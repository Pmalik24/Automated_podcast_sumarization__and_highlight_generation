far it of cruck the election maria flared florid one o the people who thanks about that a lot is heaven cheeky he is the got is job bit is to spend a hundred million dollars the billion mike boonbrig is devoted to winning for star for jobidon chili is not intimated by that task at all he spend lots of woinbrig's money in the past he ran boonbrogs three successful runs for new york mayor and is campaign for president this year and tan mi click to say a he gave me another men of begin li see the each in every time i i as you do not intend to to that a ride why flared of all the battle ground states why a hundred million dollars there craven explain that a big part of it has to do with what is gan o happen in other states he pointed to all the times tweets and in speeches that the president is said that man an ballast cannot be trusted dona trump has sought to i people get a times all bad and man and balls a fullstops and is clearly will have a plan to contest those ballast after election day as they are counted a in important swing states such as michigin and pennsylvania which join is surely leading in mini gan would take at least three days to count the ballast tensylvan is not much different trumpet said is some take everywhere never judge i have a not a question every single bout and try to truss them out and just throwing out bouts by random could really move thou states from bine to trump that is because more democrats or doing man and ballast than republicans idea this year bloomburgs people of actually run the numbers an calculated their estates with throwing out seven per cent of the ballast at random for not being filled out correctly which will abiding victory in that state to a trump victory and that is a very dangerous proposition and that is what were trying to fort by getting into florid far it dos a state the done trump pretty much has to win if he loses far at it would be enormously difficult for hm to gather in of electoral lots to have reelection and this is key far it does a state the counts man and ballast as they arrive the counting them right now already which means we very well could know the results an forte on elect night and a far to goes to bison it might settle the race that night an are om h calls to wen t state o florae that we quite frankly do not have to have that fight in state pennsylvanian how yo pick a hundred million what was that discussion li ah yen you is if i sate a it was ultimately what we determined we would need ah it was o the number that we thought we would make a difference i called i i know who is probably ti smarter a satire on the democratic side and i ask him how much which you need to stand if you one i ja to be able have an intact on a race state we racoon a presenting floral how much would you need to really put your top on this call and he said at a time million a portion ex strordinarlycments o stane it has a lot a a large expensive meeting markets under and to have any sort of in tat you really need spend twenty million dollars and if you really want to put sure om on the scale a you are in to spend seventy million dollars ah and this being homburg we round it up must of that booing money is going to deity ads and diyolads dropped into cities all across the state a vast air war conducted from thirty thousand feet cevchigi says homburgs doing daily polling o see what effect this as having exactly on a hard to figure out all kinds of things push vote or opinion around up even says the numbers and faith have move from a tie between trump and bison to a small bison weed that still within the margin of error but it is lead two to four points ut the boonburg people find encouraging that is the view from thirty thousand feet dow on the group n and all as o little different because of something basic and that is the coroner of virus and how the two campaigns a responded to the crown of iris as you may know over the summer the democratic party policy was do not go to to door do not hold events in person do not hold rallies republicans did all that stuff and far the even before the virus they were doing more an registering more voters than the democrats in sure numbers there are more register democrats in the state than republicans but since twenty sixteen the re publicans of not that lead down used to be seven per cent now it is just three and a half percent porter the voters in the state have no party of filiation the re publicans were going strong before the virus and after the virus to the state they resumed normal operations but t democrats when not going out toe campaign twas one party was out there in the streets visible and the other was just not one our producers limit sises this ben talking sofar to democrats about all that and went how the feeling not great early something one that i talk too ism a case of there is one voter i found march hope a she is in a suburb called teston which isn't one of the bluest counties in flowed for county which is just north of my army but she says at the republican present is much more noticeable that her house is somehow surrounded by trump sins and others almost nobody in since in her neighborhood wow yet the intake she sees trump supporters everywhere the the that frustrating thing that is happening is when i get tacks from my friends with pictures saying all my god a carload of trump supporters just got out in my neighborhood and they're going they nocking on doors right now but we have get not able to do that four years ago hilreclettens campaign had an office need marries house in west and and not for people would go to pick up signs to found bank i to meet up with each other by does not even have office is set up yet here o hi we have not been able to we haven't gotta a campaign material we have i leaned how hart is it to just put it up on somebody is door we can get westing done year's chicks got out in people living here we can get them done it a we et and a and that is were the frustration is is i the minute we would put a cat you know a a call out i know at i i get a cute people to cot out as were all dying doe not only is machine keeping track of what her sight is not doing she is keeping track of what the other side is doing specially signed up for her county the the pair county local republican use letter we why because a every day win when it sens out its daily male that lists all of the e that the campaign events that they have counting up for the republicans she likes to keep chuck of it and a cindaddrives her crazies just noticing all these events at their running there do merit or there do watch parties for ye on to a they had watch parties it no wat as when i used to go to breakfast an all the cam which ere not going to e for we e a a li of the hero you was mar get a all the pictures be be wanna o an to a to even e we er er they make again away and they made their presents known i also talk o march's friend jury she tracks the republican events to and well mashie some celadon sign win she talks about it lie sounds almost wistful the had pictures on on the community fasebopage and they had a watch party and i thought we one nice seeming they warn we most of em ware not wring mask i know that that something that a lot o people would be has a tint to do but it just seen it was something that involved community that they were sitting together round going hate we are true we are here and they count of support each other and kind of something that i wish would replicate and were a strong in the absence of their own official meat ups i found a bunch of frustrated democrats lake all over florid not just froward who took matters into their own hands we were they doing skate there is a woman in ovietto a which is a small red town and she is been hosting these very small rallies on street corners every money wednesday in fridge well me another example is a grandmother in talk hasty who told me that she punted out a bunch of flora vote registration forms and she was handing them out to young seeming people in the well mark parking lot never that that the bud company did finally strike going door in florid and another stage too this fall yes that append two weeks after i starer talking to march a and she went out with them but for her it was not enough why cambathy twenty three days before whatever twenty love days before a lection to believe forty day for at you dhow many how many people me hundreds of thousands of people have already noted in flora thonwut other shell anis tors o people fretting worried not what is can happened next and all that is still unknown future barreling towards them t an fin to soon enough but not quite yet the beubeeasy she to goa this me in life on er last and he's a to it that one the school of hard knocks we knocked into whether the fears a she her tenor is democrats are justified a their leaders dropping the ball did the party pull back too far with the gone of ours precautions she put together this story the think democrats have been doing instead of door knocking phone calling and on is the comradery of organizing everyone breathing in the same air in some makeshift florescent let campaign center this volunteering is done from home and here what it looks maria is a phone banking volunteer she is thirty three living in south east florid with her husband and her three year old son down she works in consulting and after work she as forty five minutes to phone bank before her could gets home maria was born in colombia looked here when she was sixteen with her parents she is a citizen now and not a fan of the president his comments again a an ma grands against women main i think almost every single position that taken in every comment that he is made i against what i believe in what i thank this country stamps for maria did dor knocking in twenty sixteen and she is doing phone banking now i wanted her to compare them for me and i listened in while she phone bank in forty five minutes she dial twenty eight shoe numbers yetis nine of those twenty eight cone calls when to voice small which the democrats mostly do not think its worth it to leave messages after the be one phone call a toddler peed ut o y is astalithe kit seems to put the phone down and walk away o some grown ups did not want to get into it either with the democratic party of florid i of course not everyone maria folk to favorite her side oh you will o i there were three calls that thanks the goal of these calls it is not to perdu need anyone it is just to get bit an voters to vote and over a third of them eleven people were biding supporters s six of them said that they would already mailed in their ballast in five of them had not a or land do not wait till the end of the monk is a lot of margin o be mailing their ballad and the postal service is going to be overwhelm with the ballast may sure you you ended a sooner you do not want a haw it delayed and not being talked use led a sign the outside of the envelope and man that quickly maria says that that one call it made a feel worth her time that day the si thing that was one more vote one vote that well be counted and would not have been otherwise if i hadn't called him i haw i it may i forty five minutes one actual vote for her team or heisted tho also four other biding voters that she nudge towards mailing in their ballast and how do these pone call us complete dor knocking maria says in twenty sixteen in terms of how many people she would made direct contact with in a shift door knocking and phone banking are about the scene but going door to door takes me more time the tween going and grabbing the lis than getting to he please and walking you and waiting you know some one's mom would open the door that we had to wait for the person that we are actually trying to reach to come over what happened yesterday took forty five minutes and then what what your taught a sturdy afternoon an twenty sixteen it sons it would take a few hours ye ye but i do think is is is get there is been actual research on this whit shows that door knocking and phone banking a pretty close in terms of their effectiveness wit is a slight edge toward door knocking though calling people is faster the question really is how many phone calls our democrats making for biding florid compared to doors knocked on in the past i called around for numbers the closest i got was from the independent organization that coordinates a lot of the get out the vote among democrats in florid they are called america votes they say when you count phoned banking and door knocking and everything else that they do to reach voters they have double the number of people they have red conversations with in florid it is two million this year verses one million or fewer and previous elections but that number does not include the democratic party's own get out the not effort which is an important part of the picture party facials would not give me outreach numbers for this year or previous elections but they did do instead it say that everything is on track all of the floored democratic officials i talk to agreed on that here is tubby wasferminshalts she is party's congress women and she used to chair the national democratic party i mean at the moment i can tell you that we lead an the proof is in the vote democrats l had republicans an vote ism now by three hundred and six thousand plus not y man balas being turned in that is just massive massive you it increases we are really lapping the field it is the what i say to door democrats is the proof is in the voting and we have to dust keep people vote it is true that more democrats democpublicans have mailed in their ballast but that is kind of what you would expect loved reactions have fallen along tarty lines and wee more democrats asked for mailman ballast than republicanstet of course things could get completely reshuffled on money that is when early in person voting stars in florid republicans a start showing up and to i fly think of there is nothing ta be waist from in shot or other party leaders could say that would reassure marry or truly or any of the nervous democrats i took to jaffgreen who also lives an power he remembers two years ago how confidently they all had it into the governor's race it was the race that was supposed to show that a democrat could wen stay wife office and fired at two years ago to day antre gilmwas at non

we thought for change of pace we would do this next story about people who are not worried enough about it this is another story from our archive it is a particular favorite it is but this couple and the future they kind of cheerfully threw themselves towards and after say everything that happens to meets a hand grenade they bring into their own home pull the pin and then wait to see what is next and one importanthing about all of this is is that when they did this the kind of couple they were was it really great couple we were always the most solid of all relationships of our friends and everything that crick brown a were met his girl friend on the third day of college and in all of the ways that we think of what makes her a good relationship i think that they were doing better than you or me or most people they had a at fun together they could talk about anything they didn't really fight happy sex life was we really just got along very well together we travelled well together we were always the kind of we were the place of friends would come when they are having hard times and thy would stay with us and we were kind of it felt very adult when even when i was twenty three felt ism kind of married even though neither of us had ever ever discussed getting married what happened well after we had both turned thirty am one day i just kind of was thinking about why we had never talked about getting married we had never ever talked about it seriously or otherwise and whenever any one would ask us we would always just kind of kind of brush often say i will work in a what will get marry when we have kids that is what would always say and i remember we were sitting in the living room and was october and i just said hey i want o talk and i a why why do you think we have not got married yet or even talked about it and she just kind of looked at me and and thought for a second then she said well i think that before we get married we should probably sleep with other people and a and that you would imagine that that mud come as a huge shock to me hit me hard but for some reason kind of it made sense to me a i kind of was gall ki very calmly and i guess the real how did that make sense have thought of lot about this and i think that there is a few reasons we both had this kind of are again notion of our relationship that it could survive literally anything that we had b in to get we we had known each other our wholesome lives we were we were each others world really we i do not think we shag that we could destroy this thing i don't to the girl friend who did not want to come on to media and she said basically she would only had two boy friends in a line our high school boy friend who was not a the boyfriend at all dirt what was great but she met kirtle said when she was seventeen she was thirty when this happened and she said that the fellow may be she missed out on something in a twenties experiences at other people had and she don hon o regret then winning i should say before we gonna further in the story we cold not acknowledge the existence of sex between a dots a nothings was they sat on the couch and they talk this throw the next part of that conversation was the logistics do we break up do i move out do we just do this while were living in the same house together and we can it came up with this idea of borrowing this this this polish concept i called rum spring o and arum spring in the polish world as when when you are sixteen you are allowed to be not polish for two years and then when you turned eighteen you decide whether or not you come back to the fold and during this two years kids get drunk they sleep around they tridrug say to lots an men depots ta stuff we are going to have i we decided to have a rumoring i from our relationship and that is the other crazy thing is that we decided that it would thirty days was enough cause probably within thirty days sleeping with other people all get that all out of our system an thirty days turns out it is holy difficult all the sudden be come single at thirty one when you have never been single for your entire life cause allow t a sudden i am in new york city and ism single and ism i mentally have the the the emotional tools of a seventeen year old boy cause the last time you dated was you were seventeen the less i i dated i was in a dorm room and also it was not that i was just it was not i was single in new york city cause being single in new york city is i think the majority of it as being just very lonely and being on your own whereas this was very different i was in a marish i was in a race i was in i was in a thirty day race to sleep with as many people as i possibly could because after thirty days i was going to go back and that get married er er the is a time caught ticking every single it was almost to the minute wrerlgisty i if i was in out somewhere trying to meet some one i was this is wasted time i am wasting my time right now and also because the fine can we are both my girl and i were both very competitive with each other that we did not speak during that thirty days but i think in both of our minds we had a competitive nature of being i need to see with more people than she does and i think she felt the same way that is true she did feel that way i asked her before they started the room spring they took u a last romantic trip together to knew organs of a new years and they had a great time and then on canary third after they both cried a bit dirt moved out for month suddenly single thirty one time caught ticking where do you start right with dirt called this woman that he knew just a little bit and had a date on the very first or second night he cannot member which it was at a dinner he told her the entire situation hat way the holding out that he seeing somebody they your taking this break to sleep around and this was rule that he made for himself that he was always going to be honest with any woman than he met during this morning whom we honest upfront that and that is the weird think that is the thing that i still kind of when i think back on this time that i do not understand like you do not understand how these women that i met during that time heard the story and were lie o ka let us continue t this day would they say i think most of that overwhelming response was how and i cannot believe your telling me this kid was staying on the futon on a friends living room for for the month in this apartmentwere there was no door between the living room in the bedroom when his friend was sleeping and he brought this woman back on the first date and they made out a little bit and then they set another date i think it was proxy for the next natter the night after something that and what happened ah what you mean what happens on the date i mi guess i mean do you sleep with her since the whole point of the story as you trying to sleep yes hands that they felt very modest about asking but ye e i eyes rented of sleeping together yet yet it was amazing it was yet totally turn my had around it really did feel having experiences i would imagine i would have had it as a teenager see was a very powerful thing and a kind of overwhelmed you they who after that i up a woman in bar something he had never done before in his life wen he goes home with her from there he is often running but remember he has the emotional tools of a seventeen year old i was emotionally getting involved with these women and that was that was against one of our rules that we had come up my girl and i had had a rule saying no relationships we do not get into relationship with people were just going to go out an sleep with people to see what it is oh i see handout you did not actually know how to jistgotten sleep with somebody without getting emotionally attack not at all i mean the first the first date i went on i immediately was life id over heels for her and i knew her first six hours and i did not know how t a date i did not not had a date casually what i really was doing was just getting in i i was acting a person who had been in a thirteen year relationship with these women that i had just met i cut us at would he immediately holding hands i remember a that i would my impulse would be to say i love you doing sex that would be my impulse because that is the only way i was used to having sex and i remember the first time that i i did and o having sex i started to say i love you and then just kind of swallowed it made it see i was corgi i and that was it and that did not happened just once certes twas just a month of incredibly intense feelings he feel this crazy elation or he would finds om walking down the street weeping the girlfriend told me that she meanwhile was having escapades of her own shed be out all night drinking and dancing going to exclusive clubs with medical high rollers doing crazy things with european torrid it was just what she wanted actually and both of them told me that the weirdest thing about that time was that the person that they wanted to talk to most about what was going on and char it with was each other but f was they were not speaking dirt says that on h most amazing things to him that is count of a revolution at during that time war something have never actual heard anybody talk about it about aby a totally related to this was how quickly he would find himself in the home of a complete stranger yet i never got in to see other people's apartment and muhthat is what i cot of was as they i for getting to see all these different people's apartments i seen how everyone lives and one that i love that part of it much you know was as look at this come seeing this all your stuff there is a stuff you keep on your bed bedbedside table a and also having really weird whoexperience ha i never had before of women picking me up a never experience that before am i was confused cause it was that it was a bar tender she was a bartender she just kept giving me drinks free drinks as why is this piss why she given me all these free drinks tut it is fastening to see if you stay at the on till in the morning than a of a sudden it'd never been aware of it before beefs on looking round me oh all these people a paring off look at how this happens thine it'd never bean it'd been at bars an before in the morning but i was always it is advisor uncovering this whole level of single life in new york city that i that i was just had not been aware of before any one in new york city i feel can have sees any night of the week if they just followed two rules which is stay at the baruntillfore in the morning and dramatically lower your standards t after a month curt missberfrn get together and talk and they agreed that a month was not enough for this it was that it was just obvious the experiment had not run dis course they both wanted more time they decided on a second month which then becomes a third month and for curt is time when on it got harder and harder to stick with the rule that they had made of not getting into any relationships he just muddling about had a figure had how to do that and his head e would think when is something actually a relationship and i think in my had all three dates three dates makes relationship that is what i defined and then i would tried and not see people more than three times am that was increasingly difficult is difficult because he was giving women two opposite messages at the same time he would tell them that he was just taking a month's break from his real relationship in this is not serious but then he did not hold back any of his feelings what i i felt kept happening what that i would act i wanted to be their boy friend and than after three dates would just abruptly end it with no explanation whatsoever and ah darling deftly people would yell it me and call me names ah and and ah and i and i feel to the spatial i feel horrible about that i cause i was just i was acting a a crazy person as like tan a person with absolutely noboundasstill was hard to stop himself what was going on and when we talked about a hurts best explanation for that was i once had it when i had a dog i was when i was a get i hat a dog and one day the cat nock a five pound backer sugar off on o the floor and my dog was about nine pounds he was a toy pool and he ate all sounds a sugar and one day and and the he was sick for three days thaterwards but i always think about that that day for hiphop a amazing that day must have been ere eating all that sugar and eating and then can going away r i er little on being i cannot stamp when it is this gat a happen and then he just started vomiting and vomit three straight days and that is how i felt o i knew this was bad about i when is this ever goes a happen aged i askers boyfriend if all this happened to her during the rumoring a too if it was hard just to have sex without a motion entering into it at all and she said a lily not not you mean dude that i me o bars of parties whatever those people she that i did not tell any one anything but my back ground or the situation and i asked her waits he would not explain when of great from a relationship she said no because it sounds crazy it older that a hurt would reveal all of that which she knew in she is a dear yo hurts way to open but wot that open is probably just made i more appealing to the lady but the end of three months curt her to fall for this woman that he met in australia and this time really actually fall for her in a real what and this made him of course feel differently about his relationship with his girl friend if we back to the states stand their old apartment and because this is the most comfortable relationship that has ever existed between two people of course they dealt with it all right away very straight forward and we woke up in the morning we went and got brunch and we brought it to the park the way we would always used to do on saturdays we just sat in thenar and i talked and we broke up and tabs a thing i i cannot i cannot point to something that was bad about our relationship except for knowing that i feel it had run its course me we organically got to the pat point where we both thought this was a good idea this the roomspeit is almost we we the the the the relations had an expiration table we did not know about it and then off we came up with this really complicated crazy plan to put the teaspoon it at the right place where it would break and it broke it is all girl friend sand something similar she said she had probably wanted out of the relationship before the room spring up sh us too scared to admitted to herself the roomspring end gave them a way to break up hurt says he would not wanted do a roomspring u again but he cam out this experience believing that it is important to force things to a decision was some one and that it is healthy for any relationship to be valuated now and then i do have a theory now i do have a theory about if i do get married in the future what i think i would want to do is have an agreement that at the end of seven years we have to get remarried in order for the marriage too continue but at the end of seven years it ends and we can agree to get remarried or not get remarried why because that i get think you get to choose that i think it makes the relationship would make the relationship stronger i do not nowt i think of that cause i think actually one of the things that is a comfort in marriage it said there is not a door at seven years and if something is must of in the short term there is a comfort of knowing we we made this commented and which son work this out and an even if to night where not getting along or there is something between us does not feel right you have the comfort of knowing we have got time or going to figure this out and that makes it much easier cause you do get through times when you hate each others guts and a young i of course he dor yet and and the no escape cause weirdly is a bigger comfort to being married than i ever would have thought before i got married really i never thought of it that way ye i i thinking about it that way yo just see many examples of when o were that of people were people do not think that way be curtain is girl friend you the roomspringe got them where they needed to go as a couple even if that place was different than they intended when they began the whole thing sometimes we o need to do next as a couple ye came and tell what it should be best you can do sold your breath maybe guess jump with these days a her browner is the host of pod cashed bananas and he virtually host belong running variety show with christian shawl hot up with cretin christen monkeys on twit that stories a few years old and i could probably say a lot about the things the curt n i talk about at the end but i will leave it that the these days cutis married and i not a for notes jacaranda glossy it i believe the children are our future and i believe that worries for our children and the future a probably the most common worries out there humanity's nimble one worry category top of the charts our survey says cannot be beat generation after generation but there is a whole other class of thoughts abut her kid's futures r less another not worry exactly they're more dislike curiosity ten years ago what eve our producers back then johnthin and hear talked about both those feelings the curiosity and the worry on is poteswill have dark wavy hair her eyes will be brown unless they are green or maybe hazel she will have full lips she will not be tall which is the nice way of saying that she might be short because of this fact pots will not going to concerts because like my wife pillory she'll only be able to see the backs of other people's heads and that spot on a persons back between their shoulder blades some day when she touches that spot in a person she loves it will feel oddly familiar and comforting because all her life while standing in line at the swings or waiting for a cashier to ring up her milk she will have looked at that spot another people because she will be our daughter ponies will chocolate ice cream and enjoy pounds she will need glasses by third grade codes i should explain is what killer and have taken to calling the little girl history will give birth to an two thousand ten calling our kit it only felt right for about a week or two we brainstorm baby code names one night in bed pillory thought the name should be something that opening scene in the west wing pilot he one where rob blow walks out of the shower an a woman in underwear in immense dress her weeds from his figure codes in a bicycle accident hilly set our cod name should pop that but we could not think of anything is coolest pots we just stop it i worked that while pods was still nothing more than cells splitting into other cells that we might be setting unachievable expectations by naming her the caravan the secret service use to refer to the president of the united states when people find out your having a baby they predict all kinds of things about the child you will have but i wanted to let pots tell us who she was i tried to cling mostly to the facts twenty weeks into hikers pregnancy we went in for an ultrared our ultrasound tactician look hate from john and cape plus ate in scrubs she had that crazy hair do and everything we asked if she could tell the gender of the baby she said it is a girl she said it with the same level of enthusiasm i use to tell history that we got a waxbill in the mail knowing that notes was a garment that now there was a shape to the mystery the ultrasound gave us the lines of he coloring book and we could not help but fill them in killer remembered all the stuff about dominant in recessive genes that i slept through in my high school biology class and we thought about our friend ma shell a biologist who spends her days working with fruit flagons i soft really understand what it is she does exactly except that it has something to do with diabetes and the summer when i was having a fruit fly in station she did not have any suggestions for how i could capture or kill them i thought maybe nickel could help us figure out what pots might look she said she would do her best but that this stuff was more complicated and humans an what i was imagining she also told me that there was a great paper published in science recently about the genetics of dog coats and that if we were breading a dog instead of a little girl she could be really helpful micelle came over to our house and in exchange for begonia an a bizarre she sat with me and drew point squares those little squares divided into four smaller squares that are supposed to help you figure out what traits went over others nickel was willing to commit to a few things the fact that pots will likely have dark hair but really she said even if she was able to study me in killer in a lab she could not tell us with any certainty would our baby will look because unlike dogs humans haven't been bread for certain trait there is really no way of knowing what green eyes may be hiding in my genes mostly she said the whole dominant recessive thing could help us figure out dopy stuff for instance now we know that notes will have unattached warlords and be able to impress her friends with her ability to roll her tongue a ta a few months ago not long after we found out that pots was a girl i was writing my bike home from work the traffic was heavy i was going pretty slow i looked to my right and noticed a girl on the sidewalk looking at me staring really she looked she was in her early twenties and she had her auburn hair tiding a thick bray that swung over her right shoulder i cannot remember if she was wearing glasses but i know she was wearing a dress and holding a petition clipboard in her right hand if skin was made of plate hers is what you would get if the forever mixed the pillory color with the jonathan one i could not tell you if it was that or the way she looked at me in gently that is to blame but i stared back the first split second i thoughtion might be pots all grown up i wanted to ask her much i was school ho live around here what you more seeing fire flies for the first time the summer who the first fat snowflakes winter really though every question was some variation on the one bag question it'll try my whole life to mage pots answer yes to are you happy it is also i realize e question

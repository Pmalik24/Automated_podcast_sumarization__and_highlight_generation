the shows sponsor back press pin the say to stand up against biotech protector dated express plans come flesh men last night's fourth republican debate will likely end up as a footnote in presidential history dona trump was leading the race by reason bounds was not on the stage the debate aired on new's nation rather than fox news of the viewership is likely to be a lot lower than the prior it debates but in some ways the debate was by far the most interesting debate of the race is interesting for a few reasons first it showed that governments actually matters the battle between rondo mantis in nick hale where the too candidates fighting for a distant second place behind trump is a battle over policy positions sure the debate expose serious differences of position on social issues for example were in hale has posed as more moderate and to mantis is more conservative but the want's main advantage against hale an advantishe dull would carry him further than it has in the pulling far is that he can point at his accomplishments and contrast them with the empty words of his opponents in the normal world the mantis would be running away with this nomination the mantis is by far the most conservative candidate who can win on the stage has a record of victory in florid the four candidates on the stage last night rondisantis nick half chrisschristy and for some od reason to a come mommy who is still in the race but the mantis is by far the most classically conservative person on the stage here for example was rondo mantis talking about calving collage how's on the ligans favorite president i grand watchman lincoln excellent a one of the guides all pagans picture from his calving collage e people don't talk about mother you presidents that got almost everything right he understood the proper roll the federal government under the constitution we need to restore the us constitution as the center piece of our national life and that requires of president who understands the original understanding of the constitution who has ta good sense of the bill of it and who knows how we have gone off track with this massive fourth branch of government a this admits state of state which is imposing its will on us and is being caponized against us silent cow knew the proper roll the federal government the country was in great hate when when he was president the united state we can learn a a learn a lustful lot from calving collage weaken that is pretty soudlicanseveiv stuff but the mean to frenchating point for to mantis firsts for example hale is over their actual government style last night the question of transgenders using particular bathrooms came up nick hale suggested that the mantis was soft on the issue and to mantis pounded er on it and i shows how hypocritical shine continues to be when he went running from governor and they aft him about that he can head thank tartan bill for our goldmines of his time you can go look that out i signed a bathroom bill and florins noting me i can the to in fay i run lungan atidand you killed it i find it i he over little girls you did not do it and there was this going on i was actually just in south caroling some of the legs slaters call me at the time there were boys going into the girl that is the who an white they say when she does that explanation that that does not hold water this is the up state of south carotid i time the bill i proven no and that obviously is a strong to ferentiating point for to mantis and again he thought that that was going to be the main part of this campaign was that even the stuff that trump has talked about doing to sand is actually done in the state of florid however this brings us to the second point second the debate showed that down trump is still the dominant force on the right that is because of all the stocked up good will he has from his tenure as twenty sixteen candidate beating hilly canton and is president when he is pretty conservative and because his one true point of electoral vulnerability trumps point of electoral vulnerability is the back that ye army lost to joobidon in twenty twenty but that has now been obscured both by the media's election malpheasanse in twenty twenty the fact that for example the hunter by the laptop story was covered up the fact that all the voting rules were changed by the democrats in lead up to the twenty twenty election the fact that we had a twenty million votes spike in the number of votes between twenty sixteen and twenty twenty and mostly by jobidon's awful pole numbers right now if the argument is that trump is unelectable then the real clerpoltic pulling average which puts trump i had of bison right now is very difficult to overcome that is why attacks from onto mantis against trump tell flat here is to mantis going after trump last night buck he he is shoe father time is undefeated the idea that were on o put some one up tor that talk must eighty an there is going to be no a facts from that we all know that that is not true ah and we have an opportunity to do a next generation of leaders and really be able to move to this core reality to present that can serve two terms ah i do not think donate from both as it have in the been bee bible o get elected the demo cats want him to be the hominy we see that they are going to turn the screws the minute if he got the not t tin ere g s it now to mantis happens to be correct democrats still believe the trump is the most bauble hominy for the republicans no matter what the poles say the problem is when the poles have trump up on bison as they do right now when dona trump is in the best pulling position of his career actually better than any time in twenty sixteen better than any time in twenty twenty the elect total argument is a hard case to make in one second well get to the third point that we take away from the debate first buttock has he covered for the holidays to the free motor five five phone nogamics no traded necessary just sin up for puretocks an limited talk unlimitedtacs and fifteen gigs of data and get all of that for just thirty five bucks you will get the motor g five phone for free but here

coverage is excellent i take all my calls on it s goodenough for ma ins good enoughfor everybody go to puretoktok come slash chip n get that free motor g five phone with qualified plan to day oke and this leaves us to the third point of the debate there is no reservoir of anger at trump among republicans the cantus was trying to go after trump on the basis that trump is too old or that he cannot win the problem is that trump is running against a person who is even older and right now he is leaving the boles but the other attack on trump which is that he would be quoting u unfit for the presidency is something republicans do not believe there is no reservoir of anger at trump over his erotic and often awful behavior itself only if that behavior threatens total viability to re publicans become queen republicans have essentially decided i think rightly given the nature of to day's politics that we are well beyond questions of civility many of us have decided the if the most plausible candidate happens to be the guy who treats due stuff and makes jokes about becoming a dictator jokes by the way there really underscore the fact that every single president since borokobama has use executive power dictatorial fashion we do not really care we may not the stuff the dona trump did between nonmember and canary of twenty twenty one but if the alternative is jobidon using his own dictatorial power to say make oho cram a van down on eighty million people or jobidon using dictatorial power to essentially keep the border open well we will pick our own giant pulsating middle finger thank very much that means that cries charity's attacks on trump which is that trump is unfit for the presidency those fell flap republicans our treating dona trump generic republican and weirdly are democrats at this point when christy attack to mantis and said why do not you answer whether trump its fitter not desansis smart enough not to play the game the cantus knows that if he says that trump is unfit all of trumps voters do not to mantis then but whale christy is attempting to do is point out i think correctly that the republican party long's that things trumpisfit is likely nominate trump that is true here is crispy why is e just the of guess the question was very direct is he tit to be present for is not he the rest of the speech is interest but completely non re sons an we r quirt room the strike the an so sin tone the anti the a t skin a smart wean ta toothy a they a my our a like the an to they wan to o after is e o in you o yo o o the i in no o i the my do the thing is the the tote do o i our one n to e the the a e i i i i i o i the an ti i e i l o an i i a o o a i i a o o o o o a ti e i to o ma coati look father time is undefeated i do not know how he would score on it on a task but i know this we haven't opportunity to nominate someone and elect someone for two terms who is going to be spitting nails on day one in for eight years the wen he ti arms all we wish not dominate somebody a long as the wo to who polemist eighty years all he's a fraud and come crispy is right that do basis will not answer he is corrected to sans too answer why hes republicans do not think the trumps outhit period and of story when crispy says things there afraid to talk about valdemor it just underscores the fact that crispy is running a revenge campaign me let t be real about this the problem is that crispy is not a bible alternative to trumps he is going to attack trump this way then he start looking at crispy well there is one problem that is i can wash here as risky doing his let us attack trumpeting look wagon ism it is often very difficult to be the only person on the stage who telling the truth and the only person who is taking on would needs to be taken on i look in my watch now were seventeen minutes since this to be and except for your little speech in the beginning we have hat these three acting as if the race is between the four of us the fifth guy who does not have the guts to show up and stand here he is the one who has you just put it his way head in the poles and yet have got these three guides who ere all seemingly to come ism with youovaultemore he shall not be names they do not want a talk about i now again crispy is right that he is the only person who is willing to really go after trump but there is a problem he college trump in twenty sixteen he ended a working for him do not youremember the deal of true saying him wrist go get on the plane and here is the other problem city's not an alternative to trump on policy here he was last night for example on sexual mutilations are try for miners how is it that you think a parent show be able to caves surgery's never mind the sterilization of a child and are not you way to out a step on this issue to be the republican omen no not because out brig's republicans believe in less government to more in lesson problem with government not more government even people's lives and your pagan i trust parents and we are out there saying that we should in power parents an education we shouldn't power parents to make more decisions about where the wins good school i agree we should it power parents to be teaching the values that they believe in in their homes without the government telling them what those values should be and yet we want to take other rental rights away ism sorry as a father of fore i believe there is no one who loves my children more than the o gay that is true no one loves your children more than you but also there ares there are things called child to be house and if you love your kin but you smack your widen ahead with a brick every day well that is a legal hiding for his genitals should be as well four the debate showed that these campaigns unfortunately have become opportunities for additional exposure for the marginal candidates and the best way to exploit that opportunity is to run directly toward twitter slash ax and as the pol show ex is not real life now listen i personally know three the for candidates on stage of never went crispy i know rondtosantus he is a straight forwardly good guy his wife is delight realianize family i know nickel who personally again a delightful human being i know her kids as well and i know awake tell gets of awake in just one second first the holiday's are hard enough make things easier

platform for be coming more famous and that is fake again i know take i supersize guy brilliants incredibly personable really charming glib is hell i say he is a salesman's salesman which is how e made his money right he was essentially the guy who is fund raising for a publicly traded farmasuitacle company that is fine that is totally cool he is also commilionic he has been throughout the race he is been trying to play trumps game save the unable except that things he saying are less unable now because trump has been in the game saying those things for a long time now the problem is as the realm of the unable decreases that means the awake has to chase the realm of the unstable he used to be unstable to say that boys a not girls and then true see it a lot n then we ell see e a lot n it's non unable any more we make full movies about it and that means the realm of the unable is shrinking into the more and more marginal viewpoints and of awake if yo wants to keep up with the unable candidate thing yes to chase the realm of the unable and that is what he has been doing last night here is one of his listings of unable ideas he does these in twitter by the way we'll just sweet out seven unable ideas six of which are can o rote inside the republican party and one of which is usually ill but odd here he was last night it is all three of them have been lie king goal true foots for years for lot and n our son the mantis of ben a great governor but you would have never been one without act to begging dona trump for that indoor an you at sati i a year go xanthin is crispy as a lobbies begging them for a cove body for his special interest in new jerry prepping him for the debates last time around these people are not monde working quarter backing some decision he mad i that the real enemy is not dona trump it is not even jobitan it is the deep state that at least dona trump a them end to take on and if you want somebody who is going to speak truth to power that vote for somebody who is going to speak the truth to you why mi the only person one the stage at least who can say that canary six now goes look it was an inside job that the government li to a tor t er a a a n non eleven that the great replacement theory is not some grand like wing conspiracy theory but a basic statement of the demo critic party's platform that the twenty twenty election was indeed stolen by big neck that the twenty sixteen o lection the one that that trump one for sure was also one that was stolen from him by the national securities basement a can at can out the trump russia collusion hokes the than he was false there is e reason why on the only person o there to get a an things that is what it is going to take not people were licking his brutes one time and now what manic quarter back i a criticizing when it is convenient i sang actable saying tanto except that along that stud is not really unstable ow when you say that the twenty sixteen election the results were thwarted by the called estate preach ever republican believes that it i literally all of us believed that the russia hooks was a hoax promulgated by people inside the federal government whore promulgating false information the twenty twenty election was stolen by biotech if by that he means the big ten put its them on the s girls for robin we all believe that that's obviously true that is not saying turntable literally everyone on stage we will say that however what he will do the ten put all of that in a sandwich with canary six was an inside job ism not sure what he means by gantry six was an inside job does he mean that somehow the trump administration which was in power at the time worked with the protestors does he mean that it was nancy policy working with the protestors who are coming into the capital building does it does he just mean that the re police officers who opened the doors which obviously is true after the rites were already in progress canary six was not that on of what inside job in the sense that no one committed criminal activity it is true the prosecution of some of e people where in the capital is clearly excessive but inside job when he says that the government whytoss for years about nine eleven what he means is that one of the people who house final of an highjackers was a member of the south intelligent service an hat was revealed in report in twenty twenty one but he is been broader claim than that when he says that the great replacement theory is real that is a term with romantic overload because it has been used by water who premises as a bus word for a placemen of wives by minorities including news and specifically news or acting this entire system in order to replace white people that is what people were chanting and for example charlosfill in the a news will not replace us don't diet about the invasion of hundreds of millions of news the are suggesting the news were presiding over the system of immigration but it is true that the democratic party has talked for twenty years about the changing demographics of the country facilitating an permanent democratic electoral majority savage wants to win points for audacity but let us be real he is really not saying anything the bunker carbon has not been saying better for longer in reality of value lek trump needs in opponents in a vacuum a lot of his view points do not make all that much sense he is been on most sides of wide ride of issues but that also gives him thewy to fire at all the candidates from every other side of every other issue last night awakes target was mainly nickel half whom he proceeds as his candidate of differentiation because she is the quinquomain stream candidate a distant is popular the basenickey daily is not nearly is popular with the base vavakue was can go after her using the same angle trump himself used in twenty sixteen against the called interventionists in the republican party now they're few problems with this the biggest problem is that the right has always been divided between hawks and isolationists going back to gorge h w bush at verses for example pay cannon and before that charges linburg feasts the rest of the republican party in the are world ware two hero the isolationists on the right generally had their way in the post world ware to hero the hawks had their way on the right in the aftermath of the arc war it is an open question who wins this battle but as the world grows more dangers isolationists tentactually loose sway the most obvious line of attack for a publicans against jordan on foreign policy for example is not that he is two interventionist it is that he is weak that he is wailing that he surrenders an afghanistan the he sends mixed signals that our enemies can see all of that and they are taking advantage well get to the foreign policy issues there being raised by van in just one second cause their kind of fascinating first as a daily war listener you are not just in form you are engaged value freedmen personal responsibility and this is why you need to check out medicare medishreis a community based approach to health care that lines up with the principles you actually believe in your value matter not medicare your health car dollars will not be used for medical procedures that do not line up with your belies meishareis the highestrated health care sharing ministry with a thirty year proven track record it is not health insurance it is a community of four hundred thousand believers committed to carrying and sharing with one another members have up to fifty per cent or more on their monthly healthcare cost member satisfaction surveys show they medicare much more than their own health insurance why we because geisha actually works for limited time tally a listeners will receive one hundred fifty dollar if card when they join medicare to find out more go to medicare dot come slash ben as medicare dot come slash ben terms and conditions do apply go check him out right now medicare dot come slash ben and again this helps you not only get great medical coverage by your health car dollars or not can to be used for medical procedures that you have moral objections to go check him out right now medicare dot come slash ben hates when it comes to foreign policy league lunch to bunch of attacks on nickel valley last night those attacks are generally from the isolationist right wit oh is very similar to the isolationist left the problem is that does not really line up with the republican perspective it large on mobile hoiden is weak is not the jobidon is too muscular in form policy is that he is too weak even in e crane the problem for bison is the he refuse to choose in actual line either you have to give you crane weapon re necessary to actually smash russia in the don bass crime or you have to to find an offramp an pursue it bison choice as always his neither that is always his choice is what if i just you know sit here and be a vegetable but when it comes to israel the attack on biding is not that he is too pro israel from the right is that he enabled the hon enlisted the who these the terristorganization foster more funding for the palistonian authority and u an our w way which means commons and now is trying to handcuff israel in it is ability to finish off a genocidal untie jewfish derris group when naval for example attacks nickel half for being too pro israel that generally does not go over that well with the crowd that is not on acts here he was last night doing just that what happened to israel was deadwrong what mamas did was medieval it was subhuman it was immoral and we have to call that out for what it is an october seven but to say that that was an attack on america fails the basic tests that may nick if ye cannot tell the difference between whore israel is not the messes on a map i can have my three year old son show you the difference now that is a silly argument obviously israel is not in america and the interest of the united states are not always the interest of israel advice verse but suggesting that hale hold some sort of duel loyalty is arsenic and the craw ne which is why that attack fell glad even if the feverswamps of acts sure on this sort of silly pestering likewise the internet chewed naval quizzing nick hale on the provinces of the donnas region in you crane the people on action a this ends nick half here was weak doing this retire i want to say one thing about the did rise experience is not the same as foreign policy wisdom i want everybody at home to know that i was the first person to say we need a reasonable pe stealing you can now a lot of the no cons are quiet thy coming along to that position with the exceptions of nip half and jobidon who still support this what i believe is pointless war in you can and i think ghost that for police experience one thing that jobidon and nikihaliav an common is that neither of them could even state for you three province says in eastern you crane that they want to send our troops to actually fight for look at thatch's is that i want people to understand these people have ism she has no idea what the hell the names of those provinces are but you wants to send our sons and daughters an our trim and our military equipment to go fight t reject this smit that they have been selling you that somebody had a copicoffi stint at the can and the makes eight million bucks after has real for pelican experience it takes an outsider to see this through look at the blank expression cede that couple of things to note about lava s point here one nickel has never called for putting troops into you crane no republican candidate has literally zero of them in fact whale's entire point is that you fund you crane is you do not have to put troops into crane or any of the surrounding countries that presumably be threatened if frusta were to take see doe's completely is stating her position to suggest the sort of isolationist notion that we are going to send america boys and girls over to dive for terry tortes far away she is not suggested that no one has suggested that but it is worth noting that hale did not fact after this name two of the three province is correctly after the question she said crime instead of harkeeve she said tonatsk anluhansk there is the reality most america don't now the answer to this particular question that lack of knowledge is not actually diapositive is to what america action should look in any particular region is a very tried and true attacking and it does not tend to score a lot of points in the real world why because geography be quizzes are a quick an easy way for isolationists to score a really cheap an easy point quick name all the provinces see china you cannot and how can you criticized china over it is cove nineteen policies or opposing invasion of ti can can you name every province in all of china but these sorts of attackstone actually for in nineteen ninety nine gorge dozy bush was asked by reporter to name the leaders of tone india backstay in chechnea he responded can you name the foreign minister of mexico push one the election america do not need you to be and encyclopedia they needed to make the right decision when you are pressed and that decision comes from baseline world view not quick search of the gouge machine that is what trump became president to think true couldn't name ten other countries off the top of his had outside of rope but being right is not the point of a makes campaign it is oppositionality that is literally whole point of the campaign that is why he went harder hale not just on policy but personally in the most conspiratorial of ways by the way he accused her of bad faith of fascism of fakery who pretty ugly here is awake comparing like hale to comma arris i don't question her far but i question her ofthentis and i think that is deeper were we were just talking about the transissue this is a symptom of a deeper cant her in america life identity politics this new religion that says your race your gender in your sexuality are your identity it is any america it is meritocratic it is any autocratic and it is dividing this country to a breaking point and have spoken about this to the left by books are all about this have cream this to the left but it is even worst when republicans tried to play the same game we talking about that transfuse an nickeyhaley's campaign lunch vino sounded a woke billing galvanic built ad talking about how she would kick in over at the first t bay she say that only a woman can get this job don that is what she said after the third debt when i criticized ronomac dance after five failedears of leadership of this party and criticized nickel for er corrupt foreign dealings as a military contractor she said that i have a woman problem nick i do not have a woman problem you have a corruption problem and i think that that is what people need know nickel is corrupt this i e i i p o ta line pares o n t a a o to asters wielding e to e i a you to i is is out this games play the posit master's foot up their poet and i reject the use of identity politics in this party it as been a cancer coming from the left and sickens out of the double standards the people of this country or to having two ex trombones does not in a i a a s a actin the an have haling win t horas fine now are not tans not earth my time fever's find a him you mean she happens to be right about that ism sorry when you hold up the jimmies paper that just as nick equals corrupt you look a child bulk an idiot it is ridiculous it is ridiculous again then the notion then nick hall's views a somehow magically change because after she left to office she worked with bowing it is it is silly that is suggesting that the varomasuamy's views have change because he once worked with big farm had made all his money off a bid farm mean it that it is a dumb tackling it is a really dummattacklin that was not his summit attack line of the right he actually then attacknickyhaly as a quoticuol famous why is nickyhaley a ashes cause she distressed them on for policy here is nick hale was keeping praise on me when i wrote that book but now i worry i was warning about the woke industrial complex in this country as a warning apparently she read it as a how too manual narrator to o o ta ta i far more dangerous than out this really cortical understand we are marching towards fathom under widen jack smith ais not peen every last re tweet that someone has issued from donate trump in the year twenty twenty the only person more famous than the biding regime now is nick hale who thinks that government should identify i ta i de that is not freedom that is racism she is wrong on the social media issue in unanimity but saying that she is a fascist more famous than jobidon he's silly was in awake is not running for president he was really never running for president he has not ben running for present in this hold tine he is colony pulling let than five per cent nationally he is not breaking ten per cent any state but he is capturing the hearts of people you need to want to podcast or perhaps a sentient primary run he is also single handily make can chis christy look at least somewhat entertaining in amusing here is christian to take last night u you ton the a are to a you go out in the stop you say something all us see it on for the o we con front you one the bate stage you say you did not say it and then you back away and i wont say was at n i no a on yet what this ego of to a the fourth debate that you would be voted in the first twenty minutes as the most of noxious below harden america a i b a a a o say something else were you twenty five minutes tit is to a and he has insulted nick halls basic intelligence not her positience her basic intelligence she doesn't no reason she would not be able to find something on a map that his three year old could fine look if you wanted disagree daisies that is fine and nickel and i disagree on submissions but it'll tell you this it'd knower for twelve years which is longer than he is even start o voting a republican fry we disagree about to mission we disagree about who should be press united states hell we do not disagree on is this is a smart a coulisse woman you should stop an suit tit to i it by the way wrist not wrong that i again what is made e my tree crispy is that lethe does have a lot of name political taken which is way he became governor of new jersey he then misused it n blew it in every single way that was not the extends of crispy long into the vague last night after the mate he also hit into the value in the post debate spin room i think the hate does have a woman probe i do think he insults woman's basic intelligence he is done over and over and over again and i guess to night i just at had enough i had enough wo listening his garbage and as i said his smart as hazard mouth cause that is what it is when he is dictated to me in the real you have committed ourselves to public service why he is been off stealing from seniors to make his fortune ten i o put up with him any more here is

calm slash subscribe oka meanwhile final mode about last night's debate it showed that the gap between winning a primary campaign and winning a general election is indeed very real for republicans by pulling data nick valley is the republican best position against jobidon to mantis leads widen by one in the real clarpolitic pulling average dona trump is up on bison by couple points in the real clarpolitics pulling average nick valley leads hoiden by five in the real car politics pulling average and someones she is up by his much as ten points but aside from form policy where valley is a hawk's talk her positions are in fact moderate across the board from abortion to gendersurgery for miners here she was last night walking back her stated position on gender surgery for the under age she said yesterday as we played on the show that should be a question for parents her she was trying to walk that back last night she said the wall should not get in balled than that and i just ask you if you are somebody that is going to be the president the united states and you cannot stand up against child abuse how are you gong to be able to hide had our branding that is the true in matters we have it on vivid i fad i fad that if you have to be eighteen to get attack to you should have to be eighteenth have anything don to changes that er gash of but that moderate position that she laid out yesterday is not a position the republican's because not a good position the republican primary electric is not in the mood for moderation you have to be either militant in policy or in affect which is again why trump who is a moderate ism any of the same policies ironically on which valley is is way out in front he might be closer to daily on policy than he is even to discants but his affect is always militants unless be frank about this the republican base is hissed off meanwhile jobidon is betting the republican anger will back fire on republicans the same way that it did in twenty twenty it is not a bad bet by the way because when you look at whats happening in congress republican militants may lose them the house majority without even another election taking place last night cave my earthy the former speaker of the house was ousted by mat gates in company for literally no reason might johns has now place mac earthy and t house is running in exactly the same way that was when my earthy was the speaker of the house nothing his change it was merely a petty judge match between my earthy and gates in which gates decided to depose mac earthy n my cars that you not have had enough of this and he is leaving he announced yesterday that at the end of his term he was going to laves as no matter the odds or personal coste tod the right thing is what he wrote n the pastry journal it is in the spirit have decided to depart the house at the end of this year to serve america in new ways i know my work is only getting started there is one problem for re publicans they just oust verge cantos who is a fraud stir that just ousted him from congress and that seat will likely go democrat come earthy seat is can be up for special election republicans currently hold two hundred twenty one seats to republicans two hundred two democrats two hundred and thirteen that means they can afford three defections on party line votes with stance with cantos out and my earthy leaving by the end of the year well that means that the buffer dwindles to two votes it's early as mid february that means that the republican majority in the house is now two votes large s they better hope nobody dies no be has a scheming accident can hear of oklahoma chare of the republican sudd committed he said an embolden some individuals at any given time with the specific issue to to hold up in stop the entire process marry tale agreeing who has emerged as in actual republican who once to get things conch as that think he makes everything harder that is everything from appropriations bills to impeachments surpassing anything on the house floor again he was ousted for no reason and my earth's have had it and ism out and your seen a lot of republicans who feel this way what is what hilarious is the democrats are looking at the upcoming election many of them areretiring many many more democrats are retiring in twenty twenty four then republicans leaving those season but democrats our leaving because they see that jordan is a weak candidate republicans are leaving h becauethey are tired of each both and there annoyed by the false purity test that they are engaging upon with each other leaves o republicans to steal defeat from the draws victory that is one thing they are good at and democrats are counting on them to do that again that is precisely at robin is counting on to yesterday he was giving a speech the president and he said ism not the only person who can be turn but i will debit him that is following up on his comments t literally the only reason he is running is cause he thinks trump his denominate all we i o i l by door closes in yes to go to the fathom something o jimasina as one of his campaign managers he says we cannot take chances on anyone else except for jobidon again democrats are justbetting that dona trump his toxic enough that he will lose the election and to betting the bins on a win it they are betting the bit that that that dona trump is going to lose it your is mine a yesterday yowls not opening the door jo bide was going o gear many an there is lots people you and i boy now to who'd love to on o that office but the truth is the improve and wit tonal trump we know that jo bison has bee him the first time he will be in the second time and we cannot take the risk of an unknown candidate the these jokes sometimes just already for primetime as we saw with her salon with can quail with a whole bunch o think you see right now with the cantus who is everyone is body who national candidate an the spot like which is too great deal trumpedmitted last time in year the you will be a dictator on gay one we just cannot take a risk for that and that is what jo byte were the first time and is boys running the second time hell he ran a basement campaign last time at not a bunch factors in his favor including a vast up taken absence he voting that is not going tor be repeated this time around and again the left is relying on republicans basically running to erectly had long its what the not horrible bet republicans jump on rakes on routine basis there basically that side who bob clip from the siphons wore he walks on every rake that is republicans but is that a smart bet by democrats again the way they thin there going to run against tonal trump is by claiming that he is a fascist an a criminal here is morning job doing the fascist routine all the rifling media has done they have gotta as sunhat that had problems with crap they have chase you avidly they could chase you they make fools of themselves time and tie again but get has work there lying about the corrupt bin fat the family they at g that clarence tombs ais wine talking about the in sing family should be on barn is outside and get out repeating this line this fashion a tap this fashion line over and over and over again you look at the souls it is work now mut half of america see jo bin his corrupt it is dona top when of course it is such to we can listen for four hours it is such a for posters argument and yet because fashion or gone at propaganda it is ashy work keep saying it overanoter sogiscp saint fascist over and over and over that is can penne the election i have serious serious doubts that that is in fact the case in the reality is that as have said man comes before everything is baked into the cake with regarded trump the only question is whether a criminal con fiction is baked in to the cake that is literally the only question left in the election cycle if dona trump is criminally con evicted which he likely will be in washington ye see not because he is guilty of the crimes ledge but because to washington de we jury if that happens does that change the pull numbers in any market or serious way or everyone already can bassoons that that is the way that it is going to go jobidon was that default candidate in twenty twenty to day because bison is really bad at this trump is that default candidate and that is a serious problem for jobidon and a t people shrieking this from the from the top of the of the empire stay building it is not going to work o cane just one second wo gets the latest from

the bid ministration having a very tough time pulling the trig on what is a very obvious deals republicans have basically said at this point are i fine you want your funding for you crane we will give your running for you crane even toughie do not it if you give us som bore security and jobidon is just fighting this thing tooth and nail he believes that he has a winning g proposition with the america people by egesting that republicans are out of touch on you crane because they want some sort of all from in you crane that if that if jobidon screams freedom over and over without any plan that is somehow on to make everything it'll better that is not going to work here is jobidin yesterday again the deal is in front of him the deals in front of him republicans in the senate have said bore security plus running for ti wan plus running for israel plus running for you crane and we will do it and jobidon is threatening to veto that he is he is basically having his democrats in the senate lock that bill and trenches going to triad and ram through he is own naked you crane funding vehicle presumably without for security anything that is a winning proposition for america for some reason i do not understand it here is hoiden trying to came republicans make no mistake to days of cony on render the is hes going to judge harshly this o turn back to creates cosh we can let to win satin in we cant let on win i soverwalmi national prison inter national it's mole french any i ruction ane in our billings you crane lo cans pus position isogon this ideas that if you do not support his latest spending package without for security then america are onto be very very angry at you ism just wondering why since we have army spent according to the sense for strategical international study's vary spent a hundred and thirteen billion dollars in you crane and he is provided no offrempagant bison's position is always shout proud slogan without any plan ism not sure how the s gin to work bidet's accusing republicans to playing chicken with national security while he is playing chicken with national security here he was yesterday strain re public's a clan chicken with o nasty secure holing can funny hospyson extreme parts border pop really they are plan chicken while why this for security and extreme policy they're democrats who backlit sent lank for o of o gloomy he says well i mean what we wants for the office wo oud likes him for security why is the difficult there is a must pass bill coming and i believe in the senate it is got running for israel running for you craning funding for border security a i hope that pass is an i hope in the house they had a rider cutting off all the funds that god of these the universities are engage in i senates where is that bill right now senator and whats senate e e i a now of a e little funny big is no money at i be a help you crane i real working at e see my can also border funding we are actually in the tent going to stop that bill from living throughbing of the governor border polo the issues having more money to the border to o sol a wo people crossing the border after we did not act change of direction on that sente r pol to clan i o top o that to day and toll say we are glad to bey all have a god on that o long's or also solving the issue at or other border mean again is a pretty obvious wind promising he gets pretty much what he wants and then he also gets to say the a militated border securities s i do normally see the ration ow other than he has an ideological commitment to some form of open borders which is why he still has alahangor orcas the secretary of homeland security which again is ridiculous once he is not guaranteeing the secured of the home landing any way shape or form suggesting the corbie is tat hour doing an amazing job on emigration let me make this perfectly clear the emigration sister is been broken for decades in our department of homeland security has been underfunded for years and years and president widen has address both issues a with strength from day one on the first day of his administration he presented congress with legislation to fix our emigration system and we have submitted to congress a supplemental funding bill that will resource our department the heroic border patrol agents a that you display just a few minutes ago a to fun them as they need to address what is an unprecedented level of migration not only at our southern border not only in the western hemisphere but throughout the world republicans are objecting to the fact that what orcas and abide want is more money on the border to facilitate faster entering not to actually close the border not to change for policy they want more agents to wave people through that is the idea here meanwhile mayorchas is expending his political capital suggesting that the governor of taxes he is doing something deeply wrong by shuttling migrant from taxis to place chico new york again it is very hilarious the democrats continue to maintain that is horrible for illegal emigrants to go to major america cities that are dominated by democrats that basically there bore policy has to only a fact red states is making with with respect to governor printer with whom a i communicate a irregular basis a we have provided him with tremendous assistance not just financially through our shelter in services program funding that the president achieved but also in providing technical advice but lets let us get to the run of what governor printers a challenge as is that we have another governor in another state that is not cooperating in coordinating with either federal or other local authorities and his unilaterally sending migrants two cities a in of what i think is an abdication of governments responsibility here talking about cragabet i am indeed is abdication of responsibility apparently to ut to send illegal emigrants north hell i mean you gets sure doing it every day but from mexico that is weird again jobidon could end all this today bi simply saying of we will dance or border policies and all then be considered stronger on the word it'll have a defense when ism attacked in a present entries but he is attached his left lank they simply cannot do it meanwhile over at the universities of the universities made a big booboo the ay before yesterday the heads of hazard am i the never si pennsylvania they went to the hill and they just exploded they they the did a horrible job they refuse to say whether it is a violation of school policy to shout genocidal chance against news and then they had to walk it back this was obvious the ridiculousthey mid twenty four forty eight hours the probe that they have they discussed yesterday on the program is that the ideology of ins fro sectionalism demands the news be subjected to chance this because chews are not part of the introsectional coalition news are cuoncuot white people because they're part of the power a hierarchy and seen people chance about getting rid of the news well if they are of the apples people who are shouting that can you really tar get them well this is led to some back tracking from some of these university presents well after the fact clouding gay who is the president of harder yo put out a statements unquote there are some who have confused o right to free expression with the idea that hazard will con done calls for violence against jewfish students let me be clear calls for violence or genocide against the jewfish community ore any religious or ethnic grub barrio they have no place at hazard those who threaten our jewishtudes will be had to account now again she is out living herself some wiggleroom there because you say from the never to the sea palatine shall be free which i to all for genocide against news in that region then apparently that is of or intifada revolution that apparently is o k only if you shout straight up i want to kill that new would clouding gay get involved new the reality is that these universe y have very strict speech coats if i say boys are not girls i might be brought up in front of the academic senate at these universities but suddenly they relying on their freetsbeech principles we point out yesterday it is absolute nonsense the the blowback to these presidents was in fact strong from most sides of the isle even some democrats were going after them representing take action close as while sathmolton both for mass chusetts they put out a statements and harverinks last out of two hundred forty eight universities for support of free speech when it comes to denouncing antisemitism suddenly the university has anxietiesabout the first moment it rings hollow well yes even the white house when after these university presidents putting out a statement suggesting that thesis ridiculous according to bison spokes person drew bates he said quotes unbelievable this needs to be said calls for genie a monstrous and antithetical to everything we represent as a country any statement that advocates for the systematic murder of news are dangerous and revolting we should all stand firmly against them only after the left signed in did these presidents at start to backdoor there was the university of pennsylvania president who was caught on vidiocano smirking as show ask this question i she looks quite contrite now because what the she she is blinking in morse code please leave me in my job that what she is blinking in morsecoed here there as the moment during yesterday congressional hearing on antisemitism when i was asked if the call for the genocide of jewfish people on our dampness would violate our policies in that moment i was focus on our university's long standing policies alined with the ask constitution which say that speech alone is not punishable i was not focused on but i should have been the irrefutable fact that i call for genuine of jewfish people is it call for some of the most terrible violence human beings can perpetrate it is evil plain and simple i want to be clear a call for genocide of jewfish people is threatening deeply why did they going tan join ntintein tilt wit them say at ridiculous here is the reality all these presidents were saying this stuff because they believe this stuff and now they are being forced to baccy off the point because their lot do not is you do not particularly it but they still believe this stuff in fact they were put in these positions because they believe this stuff this was the lipnistus in the first place and again the the stupidity if you wont to see the stupid persons version of this ridiculous argument all yes did is tun over tote view for sunny hasten and would by golfer a rushing to the university's defense claiming legal knowledge against sunny host as if she is your lawyer man you better get ready for some prison time because she is the world's worst lawyer here sunny hasten trying to claim the legally speaking these presidents are not allowed to take action against students were calling for anti jewfish genocide naturally it is would by golfer against any howston leading the charge on this one of course of course because woilpby is the same person who said the hitter was not a racist when he went after the news hos news were white people and it was white on white violence again they believe these stupid people version of what all these presidents believe here they were trying to defend the universities college is the perfect place to have these sorts of uncomfortable conversation even the wish o o o o oi my on you said that the supreme court cannot prevent space that is likely to provide a host response if you hold ta is f any other community on earth other than she us i would be manful centimes to i a i ti not ben to as throw because i it is they most annoying one of the most any things about the contusion is that as the stone it only can to an on watch in somebody put up that news and ism feel it uncomfortable then not if i a i play i a a r i titan store yet and that different and the law is the low the laws the wall would be golbrig and sunny hosted people are ridiculous the lad dos not apply the first amendment standard unfortunately is not the standard an college camps of been random colleges for saying some of things that i say this such a li buttock if student you put up a noose outside a black students dorm at a major university not only will you be counselled dial you will be expelled from the university we all mow this this is a fact will be golbrig is a liar and she stupid to boot out norther she is lying were the she trick an dumb but the fact is that between while by gulberig and sunny hosting suddenly becoming first amendment to turn hes and they are obvious cross over with the fact that they are kind of on the side of the comas next year and why she kind of i mean pretty obviously outside of the moss new year that is what is happening suddenly the same people who hate free speech the minute the minute that they are side is threatened by the standards that they themselves have set suddenly the free speech advocates to making truly incredible stuff now ashen if you are it sad a free speech standard standard at these schools that anybody can say pretty much anything that we are going to broaden the overtone window of behavior to include many more quint what extreme viewpoints that is fair but you now it is not these are the most restrictive places in america in terms of speech codes and suddenly there is only one thing that is a somehow immune to these speech codes and that is when you are calling for the extermination of news in the mdlieast when you are calling for the removal of news from that entire region arrogates the rest the shows continuing right now your not condone o is it will be joined on line by least steffannicshe is house republican conference chair she was the congress woman who is grilling

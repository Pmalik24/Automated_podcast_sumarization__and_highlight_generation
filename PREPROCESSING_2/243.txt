worried about the paper work he still has to get together for his interview his medical records and transcripts from his university and there's one piece of paper that terrifies him whet of the yous embassy requirements it is to get a police icy a something called there setifgate of good conduct what this practically is is proof from canyon late enforcement to arty is not a criminal ably does not have a records this should not be a big deal except for the place he has to go to get the official certificates the head quarters of the canyon police that is scarcely ala thousands of some milers are our being held as we speak and there waiting for a the pretend some mate or some of them are win for their rete to the camps tom thinking off camping into our was on head to he quarts stepping in the inlaying ha gas a any a police letter my hard is already badly for weeks a been been talking to me about this telling me how worried he was about having to go into the belly of the beast finally on a tuesday morning in may seventy seven days before his interview he gets up early gets together every idea he has to prove he is a legal refuge says good by to hassle and takes a buss to police head quarters he walks in waits for his name to be called and walks up to the window when he face is a canyon police officer and when he encounters is not brutal police tactics but burocrisy he was telling

some other people will grab if hi sir we there is win be a doom it is can't be a doom apt e says and i felt back too up to this point it seems if arty could just hold on long enough to get to his embassy interview he would make it to america now all bets were off now unless this changed there was no way we o horn able decides to keep going back to pops headquarters every few weeks despite the rest depend our frightening it is those if one time maybe get a different answer what happens next in a minute from chicagobob a radio when a program continues it sis america life from ire a glass to the an a program repaying the story of ably nor just three weeks after the ceremony where he finally became a you citizen boy's a small refuge we who escaped to kenya in any one what amounts to a golden ticket to move the united states become an america but only if he is able to make it to an interview with the u s embassy with all the ray paper work all done perfectly skin cash in that golden ticket the and nations has reported that the number of people around the world displaced from their homes because of conflict an persecution is at an odd time high it is over seventy million people

embarrassing and tat sometime i feel here because if who went in there a a very cut wat eyes on me in cannon because people do not trust the police mops will take justice into their own hands for example if a shop keeper yells face on the street strangers might grab the person and beat them and it is not unheard of for people to die this way a man in the back of the past chimes in why s see there he shouts kick him out i tried as might as the can cam them dow and they were ignoring me and then the driver turns his head and tells me boy step out of maker are i call the police and we were not in the the medic we were in in downtown we were in the middle and in the middle what i am in in the middle is exactly the banging police station this is the police station som marly terrorist boy

wonder the day aides lazar was issued before he heard the news i had actually called the u s embassy an my rob i said i was a reporter doing a story about and and that was curious about how long their decision would take because of my deadline the woman i spoke wo said she did not know for nine days ably had not heard anything two hours after my call he got the good news we asked the state department if my phone can influence their decision about boy's velar and they told us quote the journalist call played no role in the timing of the vest issuance any sees a process coinciding with a pressinquiry is merely a coincidence i cannot prove anything but that is at odds with what the woman on the phone told me back when i initially called the embassy she said that now that they knew i was doing a story about and they would try an expedite the process even though i told her that was not why i was calling and that i was only asking for information we spoke with eight immigration lawyers all experience with the diversity visa lottery and they all said my call probably bumped days applications to the top of the pile that day and with a lottery because they give out a finite

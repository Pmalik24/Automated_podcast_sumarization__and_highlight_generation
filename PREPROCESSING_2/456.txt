welcome to the superman latponen a science science pace ton li maydrhubermen and on a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are talking about time perception our perception of time is perhaps most important factor in how we gauge our life that is whether r not we think we are being successful whether not we are failing whether or not we live in fear whether or not we live in relation to things in away that is positive and the reason for that is that our perception of time is directly linked to the negro chemical states that control mood stress happiness excitement and of course it frames the way in which we evaluate our past whether not we think of our past as successful or unsuccessful it frames our present whether not we think we are on track or off track and it frames our sense of the future whether or not we think we have a bright future a dim future or whether not the future is very uncertain or not to day we are going to talk about the science of time perception and we are going to talk about tools and protocols that you can use that can enhance durability to dilate and contract time when we mean by dilate and contract time we con control the speed at which we experience life we can slow things down or we can speed our experience of life up and we can do that in a very direct an dynamic way s actually not that hard once you understand how time perception works that is whet were headed i think you can come away from to day's episode with a lot of new knowledge and certainly with many tools that you can try in your daily life whether r not that is work sport relational emotional and on before we begin our discussion about time perception it'd to answer some questions that i receive related to the episode on fasting and time restricted feeding if you have not seen that episode this information should still be of use to you time restricted feeding involves eating for particular period of time in each twenty for our cycle that is fairly regular this would be an eight hour most often or a ten hour blocks on people do short shorter feeding windows but regardless that feeding window is suppose to fall at more or less the same period within each twenty for our day this has a number passive effects on gene expression that regulate a number of pop effects on the different tissues of the body and for some people not all but for some people makes weight lost easier because of the way that they are not eating for large periods of each twenty for hour cycle in any event one of the major questions i got after that episode was do supplements break a fast and during that episode i talked about what breaks a fast is highly contextual it basically boils down to whether or not something you invest whether it be liquid or food increases your resting blood glucose how much it rout increases that resting blood glucose and how long that increase last you can check out the episode for more about what breaks a fast but to address this issue about supplements and whether not supplements a particular break of fast many of the questions whereabout athletic greens athletic greens is a sponsor of this podcast it is also a terrific supplement that i have been taking for more than a debate before this podcast launched and many people have been using and continued to use athletic greens does athletic greens break a fast will that will somewhat depend on whether or not your resting blood glucose tends to run high or low but for most people including me because have measured it in jesting athletic greens does not break a fast and if it happens to break a fast it would be a very transient break in fast without knowing arresting blood glucose levels on an individual basis there is noway i can say for sure that it does not break a fast but chances are it does not because it does not contain much carbohydrate or sugar and it does not tend to therefore pull you out of the molecular milk as located with low blood luck states the other question i get is whether not things fish oil break a fast and once again this will be contextual but because fish oil is a fat an essential it mainly if essential phadiacids in particular era in d a those do not tend to raise blood glucose very much in my case having measured using in continuous glucosmonitor my resting loglucos fish oil does not in any way change my resting blood glucose chances are it will not do that for most people as well does fish oil break a fast chances are it does not and of course people wanted to know about pilltype supplements canine and things that raise dopamine and their fitments in minerals in general if something does not contain sugar or much carbohydrate of any kind it is not going to raise blood glucose very much now of course proline can raise blood glucose and fat can to as we've although to a less or extent again this is all contextual but at least by the logic that i just spelled out athletic greens fish oil and most forms of supplements provided they do not have any sugar or proline content should not quotenquote break a fast before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and since related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on treason i still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might hast in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called gut microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microbic if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you i free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various

of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparation

want a try element you can go to element element do cam slash supermen let us talk about time perception and the most fundamental aspect of time perception is something called in trainmen in trainmen is the way in which your internal processes your biology in your psychology are linked to some external thing and the most basic form of en trainmen that we are all a slave to all year round for our entire life are called cercanual rhythms we have neurons nerve cells in our eye in our brain end in our body that are marking off the passage of time throughout the year literally a calendar system in your brain and body and the way this works is beautifully simple light seen by your eyes inhibits meaning it reduces the amounts of a hormone released in your brain called melatonin melatonin has too major functions one function is to make you sleepy at night and the other is to regulate some of the other hormones of the body in particular testosterone and estrogen when we view light we reduce the amount of maletoniand released in fact if you wake up in the middle the night when maletonian typically is pretty high in your brain and body and you flip on a bright light in the bathroom your melatonin levels crash down to almost as zero and stay there light is a very powerful modulator of melatonin and light inhibits melatonin throughout the year depending on where you live daylength varies and as a consequence the amount of light from the sun that is available to you varies when days are long the amount of melatonin in your rain and body that is released tends to be less there is less of it and its released for shorter amounts of time because light in habits melatonin when days are very short the amount of maletonan that is released and the duration that that mletonian exists in your brain and body tends to be butch longer melatonin correlates with daylength and if we are viewing more light we have lass maletonian review less light we have more melatonin you see different amounts of light each day but we have a process in our brain and body that average is the amount of light that your seeing both from artificial sources and from sunlight and measures that off and it exquisitely precise that for a given say eight hour day in the spring because spring in the northern hemisphere r elsewhere days are getting longer that means that the amount of melatonin is getting progressively less and less and that signals conveyed to all the systems of your brain and body and this is why most people not all but most people feel they have more energy in the spring conversely when you have an eight hour day in the winter the amount of maletonan that corresponds at eight our day is getting progressively greater and greater because why days are getting shorter melatonin is increasing from day to day to day every selling system of your body pays attention to this and as a consequence most people not all but most people feel they have a little less or sometimes a lot less energy and a slightly lower mood in the winter months there are exceptions to this of course but the melatonin signal is the way in which your internal state your mood your sense of energy even your appetite is in trained is matched to some external event in this case the event is the rotation of the earth around the son there are other forms of entrainment meaning the matching of your brain and body to things that are happening in your external en environment one particularly interesting example of this was published last year by panic at all in sell report sell pressjournal excellent journal show in that across the calender year the amount of testosterone and estrogen that human beings make varies such that in longer days they tend to make more testosterone and estrogen than in shorter days and this was correlated with things desire to seek out romantic partners or have romantic in fractions with their existing partners even aggression although a not a violent aggression but sense of can a willingness to argue into to get into a kind of combative states and over all energy and mood this is something that had been hypothesize for a long time but it never really been cleanly demonstrated and what they showed was that its actually the skin that is taking information about the amount of light and converting it into these increases in testosterone and estrogen light exposure to the skin turns out about two hours a day this was sunlight in this case to the upper body these people were not naked they were wearing clothes but their arms were exposed on their upper back and a back and face were exposed they were not wearing hats resulted in large increase of significant increases in testosterone and estrogen now you could probably export a tool from that if you a that is not really what this podcast is about but a its very clear that because the skin is acting as an intrcrane organ the organscuse me as kind of a hormone influencing organ that getting light on the skin not just to the eyes can influence our sense of well being by these hormone pathways and the threshold there again seem to be about two hours a day does not have to be very bright outside there can be cloud cover and on many people will probably ask will sun screen inhibit this effect and it does not appear that it does obviously prioritize a skin health and an avoiding skin cancer a sunscreen is kind of a controversial topic nowadays as i may be atomic for another a podcast episode at some point but none the less what the panic at all study shows and that is most relevant to today's podcast is that we are in trained we are matched to the external light dark cycle and as the daylength changes our hormones change and we can override that with exposure a to bright lights on people goes on tanning beds a i has not a practice tat particularly a myself a engaging but their number of different ways that people can override these processes but the point is very simple the point is that our perception of time is both conscious it is a waiting watching the eclectic down and their the slower what we call dilatory meaning up and down repeatedly slower dilatory events related to daylength that are influencing our hormones maletonantestosterone and estrogen and therefore our mood our outlook and even our behavior the next level of time or been of time as we say that we are all in trained or matched to is the called circadian time cycle which is twenty four hour rhythm this is perhaps the most powerful rhythm that we all contain and that none of us can es ape from we all have that this circadian clock that resides over the roof of our mouth the cells in that circadian clock fire meaning the release chemicals into our brain an body one a very regular rhythm across the twenty for hour cycle they will be very active at some periods and less active at others not surprisingly there are periods of every twenty four hour cycle when we are very active and we tend to be alert and others when we are asleep now have talked ta lot about circadian rhythms sleep on this podcast previously and i do not want to repeat too much of that information in detail but ism just going to give a summary of how circadian and trainmen works because i haven't really covered that in the contacts of time perception we have the circadian clock it oscillates it goes up and down once every twenty four hours and then repeats every cell of our body has a twenty four our oscillation in the expression of various genes how that works is actually really simple elegant and interesting dine genes make alone alone is converted into routines every cell in our body has this beautiful twenty four hour timer where a genus expressed and the importuning to understand about a given gene in this contact is that that gene is inhibited meaning its reduced by a particular proline by a little biological molecule in that cell the gene gets expressed when there is very little of that other molecules run done is then becomes alone alone is trains lated into approaching and that preaching goes waylay up and the gene shuts down but as that proline gets used up and its levels eventually drop lelelelelo to zero the gene cycle chicks in again and the gene gets express the alone gets express in the proline again this all happens on a twenty for our cycle it is a little built in timer in each in every one of our cells and i did not list off the genes but for the effycinatoes out there they go by names our for period man clock and all these differ things we call them the clock genes and those clocking regulate a number of different function every cell in our body has a twenty for our cycle of gene and routine expression and the earth rotates once every twenty for hours and the processes that are happening in every cell of our body a linked they are untrained as we say to the outside dour cycle because morning sunlight evening sunlight and the lack of light in the middle of the night make sure that the changes these oscillations that are occurring within the cells of our brain and body are matched to the outside like dark cycle no one a going to all the details of how that happens but there some very simple tools that one can use to insure that your in trainmen your circadian an trainmen is precise and i cannot emphasize enough how important it is that your circadian an trainee t be precise why because disruptions in circadian an trainmen cause huge health problems they increase cancer risk they increase obesity they increase mental health issues they in decrease wound healing they decrease physical and mental performance they disrupt hormones you want your cells to be linked to the circadian cycle that is outside you and the circadian cycle outside you mainly consists of when there's sunlight and when there is not and that is why the simple protocols to fall out of this whole discussion about circadian in trainmen are the following view ten to thirty minutes of bright light ideally sunlight within an hour of waking assuming that your waking early in the day especially you wake up early in the day get outside see sunlight do that again in the afternoon or round evening ten to thirty minutes depending on how bright it is outside artificial lights throughout the day or if you want to be awake and you wake up early and there is no sunlight outside you can of course turn on artificial lights if you want to be awake but basely want as much bright light ideally from sunlight in coming in through your eyes throughout the day and then in the evening you want as little bright light coming in through your eyes give said this over and over and over again on this podcast there is always a at in negotiations but i want to make a few things clear try not to wear sunglasses if you can do it safely find to wear eye glasses are contacts that is not going to be a problem the light viewing that you do and the avoidance of light at night set the fundamental layer of your time perception one of the best ways to disrupt your perception of time in the ways that we are going to talk about in the subsequent portions of the podcast is to disrupt your circadian clock and that is not a good thing for a number of different reasons there are other ways to called in train your circadian clock one of the best ways to do that is to engage in physical activity at fairly regular times of day you do not have to do it every day but if you're going to exercise try and exercise at a fairly consistent time of day probably better to exercise than to not exercise even if you have to move that time of day but light activity and will talk about the third and a minute food are the major ways that you in train your internal perception of time to the external events of the of the world meaning that the turning of of the earth and therefore the exposure to sunlight or not in addition the sunlight viewing in the morning and throughout the day and avoiding bright light at night of any kind not joust blue light trying to get your activity your exercise at fair fairly regular within plusher mine as two hours from each day to the next is going to have a very passive effect on called circadian in trainmen and also eating at fairly regular times however this is exciting the date a mainly point to the fact that you need to eat within more or less the same time window each day not that you always need to eat your meals at exactly the same time you do not nearly have to eat a lunch at noon and snack at for and dinner at eight in order to keep your circadian in trainmen a lined or a sharp you could for instance have a small snack at noon and then eat at two and then have dinner at six and then a small snack at eight it does not much matter when the exact meals fall much as that they fall more or less within a consistent period or phase of each twenty four hour cycle what happens when this circadian clock starts getting disrupted i mean this is after all an episode about time perceptions not an episode about circadian rhythms and in trainmen well there is a classic study by ashofftone in nineteen eighty five that is now been repeated many times where they had people go into environments where they did not have clocks and they did not have windows and they did not have watches and there were sometimes even in constant dark or constant light and they valuated how well people perceive the passage of time on shorter time scales and what they found was really interesting what they found is that people underestimate how long they were in these isolated environment after forty two days or they would ask people how long you think you have been in here and people would say twenty eight days or thirty six days they generally underestimated how long they had been in this very odd environment with no clocks or watches or exposure to sunlight or regular rhythms of artificial light in addition they found that their perception of shorter time intervals was also really disrupted if they asked them to measure off two minutes they normally people are pretty good at measuring off two minutes people within five to fifteen seconds at most a you con to sit there in just a way you have a pretty good idea when two men is dubious say two men is up well when people circadian clocks or circadian an trainmen i should say was disrupted their perception of time measurement on shorter time scales of minutes are even seconds was greatly disrupted and as well see in a couple of minutes that actually causes great problems for how you contend with work how you contend with challenges of different kinds you want your circadian n trainmen to be pretty locked in or prettier trained to the outside light dark cycle that your perception of time on shorter time intervals can be precise because the ability to perceive time accurately for they given task or given thing that your involved in turns out to be one of the most fundamental ways that predicts how well or poorly you perform that thing or task we have talked about circanual in trainmen they matching of the cells and tissues and organs of our body to the three hundred and sixty five day journey that the earth takes around the sun each year and we talked about circadian in trainmen the way that the twenty four hour genetic and proline clocks of each in every one of ourselves is matched to the rotation of the earth on its axis and the exposure o a lack of exposure to the sun because of that rotation on its axis next i to talk about called ultradean in trainmen ultradian rhythms are rhythms of about ninety minutes or and all of our existence is broken up into these ninety minute ultradean cycles when you go to sleep at night by the night you sleep six hours or four hours or eight hours or ten hours that entire period of sleep is broken up into these ninety minute ultradean cycles early in the night you tend at more slave sleep later in the right youtendon were them sleep but none the less your sleep is broken up into these ninety minute cycles however when you wake up in the morning many of the things that you do are governed by these ultradean rhythms for instance if you were to work meaning do math or try and learn a language or do physical work of any kind or work out the ninety minute time block seems to be the one in which the brain can enter a state of focus and alertness and do hard work and focus focus focus and then a about ninety minutes there is a significant drop in our ability to engage in this mental or physical work now everybody from the self help literature to the business literature to the poppsychology literature has tried to leverage these altradeian cycles by saying if you are going to do something hard and you want a focus on it limited to ninety minutes or last and i am one of those people who is also going that conversation and indeed i use ninety minute work cycle and i think ah they are extremely powerful a one should never expect that you are going to drop immediately into a state of high focus at the beginning and that its remain there for ninety minutes we all struggle to varying degrees to achieve focus and motivation an drive within those ninety minute cycles but it is true meaning there is ample literature to support the idea that after about ninety minutes we tend to going to a state of less ability to focus while this is not time perception per say it is again an example of entrainment what are we in training to right when just because we can focus for ninety minutes and then not well at a hundred minutes or a hundred twenty minutes what are we in training to will what your in training to is the release of particular norchemicles this case a seetocolling an dopamine that allow your brain to focus for particular periods of time ninety minutes or and after about ninety minutes or the amount of those chemicals that can be released tens to drop very low which is your ability to focus becomes diminished if one would to explore more about the an backbone and basis of these trading rhythms it goes by different name this was originally called the basic rest activity cycle ah this was proposed many years ago by n cranial linemen it was establish to be true within sleep states as i mention before then it was debated for a long time whether or not these ninety minute cycles also control our ability to focus and per form work in wakeful states and i turns out that they do others a lot of literature to support that i always get the question how do in the ninety minute cycle begins in other words let say you wake up at eight a m and you just finished a ninety minutes sleep cycles that mean that your next ninety minute cycle where you could do work begins right to auto one now the interesting thing about these basic rest activity cycles these trading rhythms is that you can initiate them whenever you want this is not a circateang rhythm which is a hard wired unerring signal of twenty four hours the trading rhythms that occur during sleep are hard wired unerring you do not get the option of making your sleep cycles of hundred twenty minutes or five minutes you do not get that option but if you decide that you want to apply altradiang rhythms to work in performance you can set a clock and decide can now the focus begins now the work begins and this ninety minute cycle is the period in which ism going to do work and i actually do this in a midmorning and sometimes twice to day i do a ninety minute cycle where i limit all distraction as much as possible put away my phone often turn a there an as well i take about this in an episode on opt an cold of an optimal work day at least for me i just to give an example of how this might work but i want emphasize again that these trading rhythms are ones that you set you decide ism going to work for ninety minutes what you cannot negotiate however is that at about a hundred minutes or a hundred twenty minutes no matter who you are you are going to see a diminishment in performance you are not going to focus as well and that is again because of the way that these ninety minute cycles are linked to the ability of the anurans that release a see coming and dopamine and to some ex went troupe and eft from the things that give us narrow focus motivation and drive the way that these ninety minute cycles are involved in those circuits after about ninety minutes those circuits are far less willing to engage and there for its much harder to continue to focus to a high degree some people to do multiple ninety minute cycles per day of focus in that case you need to separate them out you cannot do one ninety minute cycle than go right into another ninety minute cycle than under the ninety minute cycle you cannot cheat these a circuits related to a see of coming and opening in group an efferent unfortunately i suggest that people do no more than three an ideally it would be two or just one of these ninety minute cycles what i say ideally well they are very taxing you are in a very narrow tunnel of focus for me i can do one midmorning and can probably do another one in the afternoon this is not the kind of work that is checking meal or ten messaging or social media this is very focus hard work a working on hard problems of various kinds and this will be differ for everybody i recommend that they be spared by at least two to four hours and most people probably will not be able to handle more than two per day they're problems a mutiny out there that could do three or four but that is exceeding ugly rare i think even one a day is going to feel a significant mental investment and afterwards you are going to feel pretty taxed now we have talked about circanual circadian and ultradian rhythms but we have not really talked about time perception per say we have mainly talked about the subconscious slow oscillatory ways in which we are untrained or match to the year or to the day and these altradian cycles that we can impose on our work and that we can leverage toward more focus if we what about the actual perception of time what actually controls how fast or how slowly we perceive time going by there are basically three forms of time perception that we should all be aware of one is our perception of the passage of time in the present how quickly are slowly things seem to be happening for us this is kind of an interval time or ticking off time tictictctictictic its either fine slicing that or tic tic tic we have interval timers it'll discuss the basis of those interval timers we also engaging what is called prospective timing which is a stop watch measuring off things as they go forward that might sound a lo bit what i just described but it is actually a limit different for instance if i told you to start measuring off a two minute time interval into the future you could do that pretty well but if i told you you had to measure a five minute timer interval into the future and you could not use any clocks or watches or your phone or anything that you would have to set the tic marks you would have to decide how many times you were gin to count off during that five minute time block there is also retrospective time which is how you measure off time in the past if i say last week i a know you went to the park you did some things with friends you went out in the evening o how long was it between lunch an when you went to dinner with friends you probably think we will i remember i wen to dinner at seven and we had lunch right around two you are using memory to reconstruct certain sets of events in the past and get a sense of their relative positioning within time of we have retrospective current time interval measurements and then prospective time measurement into the future the beauty of time perception in the human nervous system is that it boils down to a couple of simple molecules that govern whether r not we are fine slicing time or whether not we are batching time in larger bins those molecules go by names that may be of heard things dopamine and nor up in efferent nuromodulators called noromodulars because they modulate they change the way the other curl circuits work also things ceretonan ceretonan is released from a different sight in the brain than dopamine nor an epineferan is and has different effect on time perception just to give you an example of how things dopamine and ceretonan can modulate our perception of time when focus on a little bit of literature that now has been done fortunately in animals and humans and which essentially shows that the more dopamine that is released into our brain the more we tend to overestimate the amount of time that is just passed the me repeat that the more dopamine that is released into our brain the more we tend to overestimate how much time has passed these experiments are very stripe straightforward souse me and their very objective which is really nice which is you can give people or in animal a drug that increases the amount of dopamine and then ask them to measure off without any measurement device a watcher a clock when one minute has passed as dopamine levels arise in the brain people tend to think that the minute is up before a minute they at the thirty eight second mark tho see think a mint is up they have overestimate e how much time has passed the higher level the dopamine the more people tend to overestimate now it is also true then more epaneferan also call noradrenalin plays a roll and its roll is very similar to that of dopamine and that is because noreponepero and dopamine a close cousins as some of you may recall that they are actually manufactured from one another case dopamine can actually make pan apron and foreman from by a chemically it is they there is a cascade in which dopamine can be made into foreman apron an pan earn which is remarkable how does having elevated levels of dopamine in norepanefran cause one to overestimate he much time has passed well it does it because of the way that it causes find slicing of your time bins find slicing of time men is increasing the frame rate on your camera right slow motion is achieved in movies and elsewhere by increasing the frame rate if you take a move at thirty frames per second and watch it it will appear to have a certain speed cause of a o snapshots thirty frames peasecod in contrasts if you took that same move at four thousand frames peasecod you are find slicing into see every little detail n as you play each one of those frames it is going to look it moved slower open whatever it the kind of jump shot an baseball that is done slowly any any slow motion is the consequence of higher frame rate dopamine and more opera ran increase frame rate and as a consequence they tend to lead us to overestimate the amount of time that is passed conversely the neromodulator ceratonan causes people to underestimate the amount of time that passed they have done these experiments they actually have done these experiments using inhuman with drugs that increase craton they have also done them with cannabis which increases ceratonan among other things including the anabantid receptor activation and when people have elevated levels of five ah t or whether not they ingested cannabis they tend to under estimate how much time has passed udo the equivalent experiment you tell people that they have to guess or tell you when five minutes for instance as passed just use five minutes example is time and generally they will miss the five minute mark they will think if they will let six minutes passages they get as five minutes when they have under estimated how much time has passed and that is because ceratonan and some of the related molecules in the brain tend to lead to slower frame rates right they take the frame rate from in the example i use before from four thousand frames percecon down to say twenty frames per second this is very interesting it is interesting in terms of how pharmacology can be used to adjust time perception but it is also interesting in the contact of that circadian rhythm there some emerging evidence that throughout the twenty four hour cycle there are robust changes in the amount of dopamine nor upon ran and serotonin that are present in the brain and blood stream an body depending on time of day within the circadian cycle now ism not talking about during sleep during sleep there are definitely variations and things doom nor pin efranan ceratoid i talked about them the episodes on sleep hereon just talking about the roll of these molecules in time perception during wakefulness much of the evidence points to the fact that in the first talk of the day approximate for half of the day dreamy in the more and ran are elevated in the brain body an blood stream much more then is ceratonan and that in the second half of the day and i particular towards evening in nighttime ceratonan levels are going up i think that is fairly well establish now what that means based on what we just discussed about the role of doom nor epinefrnan ceretonan in setting the frame rate of time perception is that our perception of the passage of time will be very different in the early part of the day and in the la latter half of the day and there starting to be some evidence to support this that early in the day people tend to overestimate how much time has passed and later in the day they ten to underestimate how much time has pass and this is independent of taking any kind of substance that would increase or decrease dopamenor ceratonan now this is important in terms of how one thinks about structuring their day because i know many people are thinking about the various tasks that they need to do throughout their day many or i should say all of the literature at least that i can find on productivity and things that sort point to the idea that we should be doing the hardest task the thing that we want to do the least or the most important task early in the day as a kind of a psychological tool forget in at done and feeling is if we accomplish something and i think that is an excellent protocol frankly but i am not sure it is an excellent protocol because of the way that we sense accomplishment or at least it is not only an excellent protocol because of the way that we sends accomplishment another reason to move something that is very hard into the early part of the day is that if indeed the dopomanergic and noratrenergic circuits are more active it at that time we are actually in a better position cognitively to parse that hard problem because of the way that we are able to find slice our perception of time and find slice all the perceptual events outside us what am really saying is that early in the day you are a much more high resolution camera to speak than you are later in the day now different types of task and different types of things require different frame rates or different ways of perceiving time and indeed this also lends itself to a tool whereby for activities that involve more kind of creative thinking that are not as constrained by particular answers or outcomes and in which we need to kind of blend different aspects of our memory different aspects of task utilization in other words for creative works for brain storming for things that are a bit more fluid to speak the more ceratonergic second half of the day and because of the way the seratonergic second half the day lends itself to are time perception may actually be more beneficial for those sorts of task and it'll put a reference to a couple the studies that point to this idea that in these higher dopamanergic states we are better at doing certain sorts of tasks and in these more sceretonergic states were better it doing other sorts of task and how the dopamine tends to be earlier in the day and the santonin later in the day to speak these are brought a painting with broad strokes here but i think these lend themselves to some really excellent tools because i think we all understand the value of doing something that is hard or challenging early in the day but we should ask ourselves harder challenging how what does that task actually really require in terms of time perception some people might appreciate some examples of how this might work basically what i am saying is if you are doing work that involves adhering to some rigid rules math or a recipe or execution of musical scales or physical skills or a counting or something that requires a lot of precision where there is a right and wrong answer and it is hard i would suggest that you do that in the early part of the day because of the way that dopamine e trapan eleven impact time perception you are literally better at slicing up time you are a higher resolution brain during those times and that is going to lend itself better to a vents and demands that require high resolution whereas in the afternoon in this more what am calling seretonrgic state that is when you are going to be better r at brain storming and creative works where there some flexibility in terms of how your bashing time in perceiving time and there is not much rigid oversight of a right or wrong answer and as an aside to support what i said but also to take us back to this critical role of the circadian rhythm there is a lot of evidence that when one's sleep is disrupted when sleep is either too short or is fragmented or is not of high enough quality for enough days one of the first things to happen is that there is a deregulation of these dopomanurgic noragener gig and ceretonurgic states throughout the day they get kind of o mishmashes up om it is not that there total mess but they aren't as cleanly defined and i think this is one of the reasons why when we have not slept well or we have not slept enough we tend to feel little off we cannot concentrate part of that lack of concentration is due to other things but part of that concentration could be due the back that our sense of the passage of time is disrupted there seems to be some value in keeping the dopomenurgic noragernergic state can e limited to the early part of the day and the certonurgic state as recalling it an a push towards the second half of the day now there is aversion of how dopamine and normal in even can impact our perception of the passage of time in ways that can be very disruptive or even maladaptive and the best example that i am aware of is tram many people who have been in car accidents or who have experienced some other form of major drama do what is called overlooking overlooking is when levels of dopamine and normal in even increase much during a particular event our level of alertness is increased much during a given event that we find slice in other words the frame rate is increase much that we perceive things as happening in ultraslow motion now that might not seem a bad thing over all but the problem with overlooking is the way in which that information gets stamped down into the memory system the memory system which involves ere is the brain the hippocampus but also the new quarter is basically a space time recorder when i mean by space time recorder well your nervous system of course is housed in the a darkness of your skull it does not have a whole lot of information about the outside world except light coming in through the eyes and whatever happens to hit our ears and on terms of soundwaves and and skinny and forth as to take all those neural signals and it has to create a record of what happened now t does not create a record of everything that happen but car accidents and drama an things of that sort oftentimes are stamped down into our record of what happened and what get stamped down what we actually mean by the phrase stamp down is that the precise firing of the sequence of neurons that reflected some event lets say ism in a car accident certain anurans are firing because of the flipping of the car or their screams ore there is blood or no thinks of that sort all of that neural activity gets repeated in the hippocampus and then the sequence of the firing of those anurans is also remembered it is not just that anuran one to three for fired in that sequence it is also than sure on one to three for fired at a particular rate would be one to three for during the actual event and then the memory is stored as firing of those anurans as one to three four right if it if during the event it was one to three for at that rate the storage of the memory is not going to be one to three four oke in other words there is both a space code as we say meaning the particular anurans that fire is important and there is a rate code how quickly those anurans fire or the relative firing the timing of the firing those anurans is also part of the memory this affords our memory system tremendous flexibility what it means is that you can take the same set of anurans in the hippocampus and stamp down many many more memories because all you have to do is use a match of the different rates of the deferent anurans that were firing in order to set that code right you do not otherwise if you needed a different set of anurans for every memory you need any enormous hyppicampagn enormous head i think i think you get the basic idea overlooking is a case in which the framoryte is high that a memory gets stamp down and people have a very hard time shaking that memory an the emotions associate with that memory and it is not the topic of to day's conversation but we will cover drama in a future episode in detail but many of the treatments for drama e m d are nowadays there is a lot of excitement also about redefine therapies a exposure therapies om cognate behavioral therapies involved not just trying to reduce the amount of emotion associate with the memory but also a a deliberate speeding up or slowing down of that memory in other words trying to allow the person who experience the drama to take control of the rate of the experience in their memory not just whether not the memory happened at all in fact know one of the first things that drama victims learn is that they are not going to forget what happen what is eventually going to happen ideally with good treatment is that the emotional write of the experience will events shall be divorced from the memory of the experience and that is done again by trying to reduce the amount of emotional activation during the recall of that experience and one of the best ways to do that is to alter the rate of the memory playback in other words taking that firing of anurans that might have been one to three four again it would be much more complicated but one to the refer for the car crash and getting the memory to play back at a rate of one to three four or even one to three four one to three for in other words allowing the person or instructing the person to take control of the rate of the playback and in that way there seems to be still yet unknown mechanism by which people can uncouple some of the emotional weight that is associate with that memory overlooking is a kind of extreme example of where the dopamanurgent an the norageneric system is ramped up high that people have this unfortunately what seems indelible mark in their brain of a particular event but again aroma treatment is design to uncouple the emotional load of that event some of you r probably saying why dopamine during drama i thought dopamine was the feel good molecule well a in reality dopamine is not necessarily a molecule rewarded a molecule of motivation pursuit and drive and because of the close relationship between dopamine and group an affray oftentimes they are to released whether not dopamine is released during carcasses or other forms of drama we do not know but what we do know is that both the dopamine system the noragenergic system when we say noragenergic we entrap an ran those systems are greatly increased any time there is a heightened state of arousal and arousal can have negative vigilance a meaning associated with an event that we really hate that we prefer not to be of molveden organ have positive valance but dopamine the drop and efronar and of the common hallmark of all things of elevated arousal and that is why we see evidence for dopamine being associated with these changes in time perception both for positive event and for negative events there is a very interesting relationship between arousal dopamine time perception and blinking and this is all supported by a really interesting paper first author terahoon as the last name t r e cut anis publishing aerobiology see prestornal excellent journal the title of the papers time dilates after spontaneous blinking heighten states of arousal or associate with heighten levels of dopamine you now know that dopamine leads to a kind of fine slicing of time and one of the ways that we fine slice time is by blinking now we think of blinking is just a thing to lubricate our eyes or to limit the amount of coming into our eyes but it is a shudder on our experiments much of the information that coming into the brain through our eyes impacts our attention i have said it before on this podcast that cognivattention follows visual attention least recited individuals well it turns out that dopamine and increases in dopamine are associated with increases in spontaneous blink rate the more roused we are the more were we are their number of effects people dilate heart rate increases et camera but also blinkrate increases and every time we blink this study cleanly shows we shift our perception of time leading to as i mention before overestimation of time it seems as though in some way blink rate is actually related to frame rate ansolicis very very interesting and the way that you could think about leveraging this would be if you wanted to actually slow down your perception of time you would blink less and if you want to speed up your perception of time you would blink more now you would have to think of a synareon which that would be useful to you a obvious of your cobbling your get a missthings as well but i think it is a very interesting perimeter of our visual attention as it relates to time perception because what it really speaks to is that these neuromodulators dopamine our seratoneand that at just frame rate they are not doing it through some magical mechanism in fact there is no single brain area that we can say controls time perception i have not said today oh it is the stratum what involves ta stream but ism not in a say for instance oh it is the cerebellum the cerebellum is definitely involved in timing of movement something for a future podcast but time perception is what we call a distributed phenomenon it is a network of areas in the brain working together but dopamine in the way that it relates to the shuddering of your eyes seems to be controlling the frame rate on your experience numerous times on this podcast have talked about cold exposure and now days there's a lot of interest in things cold showers ice baths submersion in a cold water tanks and in a lakes and oceans and things that sort there are lot of different positive effects of cold exposure provided done properly can lea to increases metabolism brown fat stores which are the good fat stores that you want this are a furnace to heat as allow you to heat yourself stay warming cold a environments a to reduce inflammation to increase resilience and forth there is a study publish in the european journal of physiology showing that cold exposure can increase are baseline levels of dopamine robustly two point five acts and it is a long lasting increase in dopamine and appears to be a healthy one meaning does not seem to be addictive ism sure there are some bailout their addict d ice basket you when you think about the range of a dopamine inducing behaviors that are addictive that seems to be more on the health promoting side what is interesting is that because cold water exposure increases dopamine it will also change your perception of time and if you have ever done one these cold water exposures you have experience this you have experience getting in and feeling well making it three minutes is a really really long time and you are fine slicing time your frame rate is going up part of that just at a kind of a a course level as you're thinking this is painful i do not this i want to get out right but part of it is also that your dopamine levels are going up very quickly and therefore your perception of that discomfort is also being fine slice and you could a levergeatool for instance where you trying in train your thinking to something other than your immediate experience right this is a a kind of a controversy if you will in the cold exposure world the question is you trying lean into the experience and really feel it or do you trying distract yourself sing a song or count off of a from one to a hundred just know that whatever tactic you use to get through the cold exposure that the dopamine level that is now increased in your system is going to cause you to fine slice or experience that at slow motions a minute is going to seem a lot longer than a minute in reality you could for instance decide to pay attention to some external cue maybe it is a a metronome that takes once every ten seconds you could decide to think about something else you could decide to sing a song in your head or sing the song out loud all of that will divorce you from the sensation that your experience somewhat but more it will divorce you from the perception of your experience as governed by that dopamine increase in frame rate if that has not clear just know this when your in the ice bath your dreamy levels are high when your dopamine levels are high your experience of the discomfort that ice bath is at higher resolution now up until now have been talking about how dopamine and to some ex sens cretonne can differentially impact your perception of how fast or how slowly things are happening in the moment but remember we have prospective time we have our experience of time in the moment and we have retrospective time and the beautiful studies that have showed that the dopaminerge ex state changes the way not just that we experience things now but that it changes the way in which we remember things in the past and the rate at which those things occurred and those are in opposite direction to make this very simple if something that you experience is fun or varied meaning has a lot of different components in it and is it in other words is associated with an increase in dopamine in your brain you will experiencing experience that as doing by very fast now this is different than the ice bath which i just said you experience is going by very slowly but here mom talkingabout something that fun and very that you really and you eel it goes by very very fast imagine an amazing day for a kid amusement part then you do a ton of things that is all new the very excited and hy'llfeel it goes by very fast but later they will remember that experience as being very long that it was a long day full of many many events and there is this paradoxical relationship between how you perceive fun exciting varied events in the present and how we remember them in the past for those of you gone on vacation you had an amazing day on vacation it will seem or an amazing vacation over all it will seem it goes by very fast the last day of vacations ore grow it went by fast as there much happening but in memory sixth eight months later you remember well that that just when that was a long lo on thing we had this than we had that than we did this than we had that intends to spool out in a longer memory than the actual experience conversely if you are bored with something or it something you really do not it is going to seem it takes a long time to go through that experience in the moment but wrettoractively looking back it'll see that moment was very short soothe other day i was waiting in the waiting room for the dentist is pretty boring i wasisna sitting there there was not much going on and it did seem you was going on an awfully long time but indeed looking back it to seems of sat in the i sat in that room not much happened in it seems a very short time been this seems to be an efficiency of how the brain stores information dopa men being associated of course with fun and varied experiences and low opening being associated with kind of empty boring or or what at the time seem long experiences and this whole thing has been stamped down into the scientific literature by those earlier experiments where they take human beings and isolate them in certain environments you now take away all the clocks and watches and cues and about what time of day it is n what time of night it is and a low people to have a life of where they can either read and work and do things or were they have very little to do when people are isolated in very boring environments and they do not have access to time cues time dilates they tend to assume that time has gone on very very long and the reason i bring this up is we are not just driven by the circadian clocks and the sircanual clocks and these all trading clocks we are driven by these timers that very depending on our level of excitement and they very on depending on our level of excitement because of these neuromodulators dooming in her atonement the way i to think about it is that you have two clocks two stop watches one is a dopamanurgic stop watch that find slices really closely is counts off silly seconds and it is grabbing a move of your experience at very high resolution and in the other hand you have a a stop watch that is gathering big time been big ticks along the the you o that the hand is moving at bigger intervals the marking off time and depending on whether not your excited or whether not your bored your using different stop watches on time and therefore your perceiving your experience differently one very interesting aspect to the way that neuromodulators dopamine and novelty interact with time perception and memory is how we perceive our relationship to places and people really interesting literature showing that the more novel experiences we have in a place the more we feel we know that place obviously but the longer we feel we have been there here is the kind of goddunkan or thought experiment that illustrates of what is in the literature let say i word to move in your city i happen to really new york city have never lived there but let say i lived there i i lived in an given apartment o for a year and i will not have a number of different a experiences and this mental experiment let say i had a hundred i different exciting in new experiences i would at the end of that year feel as if i lived there a certain period of time one year i would actually know i live there one year if however i lived in three different places in new york city and i met three times as many people and i had three times as many novel experiences i would actually feel as if i had been there much longer then had i only lived in one location this is also true for social interactions when we move to multiple or several novel environments with somebody else we tend to feel as if we know that person much better and that they know us much better now of course we get the opportunity to interact with those people in different contacts than indeed we do get the opportunity to see them for inches at the coffee shop how they order coffee you may be at the go to a sports event how they act there maybe how they interact with your family you are getting a a sense of them in different contacts that is a certainly playing a role but it seems if the more novelty you experience with somebody not only the more familiar they are to but the more time you feel you have spent with them even though the total amount of time can be exactly the same and that is a very interesting aspect of how our perception of time an these neromodulators and novelty can shape the way noxious that we perceive i give in event in our world but how we relate to a place or relate to a person we have talked a lot about the different nurchemicals and how those norchemicals can influence are perception of time we have not talked a lot about the curl circuits and the various areas of the brain that underlie this i do one o touch on that by high lighting a really wonderful study this was a study publish in neuron also a sell press journal excellent journal the title the paper is behavior physiological and curl signatures of surprise during naturalistic sports viewing this experiment his really equally they did brain imaging on individuals who are watching baseball games these were bankable games the actually took place that were recorded and subjects watching these bankable games in some cases not all had some interest in who would win or lose and in some cases not all the subjects in these studies had some prior knowledge of which team they thought was better which team was likely to win are not likely to win the basic findings of the study were that they could measure surprise bi the release of dopamine in two areas of the brain part of what are called is called excuses me the mess limbic reward pathway the two arms of the brain that r important hear the nucleus acumen and the vizier the venturaltegmentalarea these are areas that released foremen as kind of a token of reward any time something is surprising or a positive expectation is met oke if i red it that my team dribbling down court is going to score on this drive and they get the ball in the basket obit of dopamine is released these two brainareas light up in the functional imaging a called them or i fuck functional magnetic resonance imaging that they used in the study what is really interesting about this study is not just that dopamine released any time that something the subject wanted to see happen right any time they want to see their team score they scored but also during surprise if they thought for instance and they would a hit a button to predict that their team was going to score on this particular drive and they did not well then dopamine could also be released in response to that surprise this speaks again to dopamine being something that is important notorious for positive events but for unexpected events now that is all very interesting and speaks to the fact that dopamine is a kind of flexible currency in the brain it is doled out if you will or released when something that one hopes will happen happens and it is released when there is a surprise even if it is a kind of a negative surprises not something tattle subject wanted to happen but the more interesting thing is how that relates to time perception what they found was regardless of what caused the dopamine release the frequency of dopamine release predicted how the subjects parsed the time bins of the game they were watching what do i mean by that well when you watch a basketball game ere you watch anything children playing or talking your spouse or whatever your batching time how are you batching time well you could batch a meal by the i do not know the appetizer the main course in the dessert but it turns out that is not what you are doing your batching time according to the frequency of dopamine pulses the frequency of dopamine release and that is what they saw in this study if they have valuated people's perceptions of the passage of time what they found is that that match not whether not a the it was a particular timepoint in the game not whether not their team was going down courter running back record to play defense but the dopamine release served as markers which would predict the frame rate of their perception of the experience and if that sounds complicated what i mean is how often and when you released dopamine is actually setting the frame rate on the entire perception of everything not just of her plosive events or negative events what this means is as you were going through life dopamine and the release of dopamine is saying that is over and now you are in a new phase of your life even if it is very short right if i get up in the morning i really need a cup of coffee as you probably all know i wait nine mints to a hundred twenty a the under end twenty meets before i drink my coffee but then i get my coffee and surely there is a dopamine that there i promise you i actually starting to carve up my day according to dopamine hits i am with consciously or subconsciously am actually carving up my experience according to when ism getting dopamine throughout my day this governments over our perception of time that dopamine has points to a very clear very actionable and very powerful tool and that is a tool that many people of talked about before which our habits people of discussed habits in a variety of contexts but in the context of dopamine reward and time perception what this means is that placing specific habitual routines at particular intervals throughout your day is a very not just convenient but a very good way to incorporate the dopamine system that you divide your day into a series of what i would call functional units what with this look it would mean waking up and having one specific habit you always engaging that causes a release of dopamine you could say what great that will make me feel good and i will would agree doping release generally makes us feel mode if ate but it would have an additional effect of marking that time of day as the beginning of a particular time been then inserting another habit perhaps the beginning of i do not know your breakfast or something but recognizing that that is a habit and being fairly habitual you have to be obsessively precise about the timing but that the that regular sequencing of things is going to lead notes to dopamine release as it relates to reward and motivation and feeling good but it actually becomes the way in which we carve up our entire experience of our day and this is almost the circular argument you could say course i do one thing that i do the next than i do the next and that is how i perceive my day that is my day it is my list it is my to do list et camera but what i am saying is that on the basis of this study i should mention the first author as last name is antonym is antonym at all of is function twenty twenty the study on baseball viewing what it points to is that by engaging in specific habits that we know we can perform well we are actually setting the frame rate on our day and i think there will soon come a time where human beings are not just thinking of okay my morning routine and my afternoon routine think that can be useful in in fact i used were mentioned a structure of that sort earlier in their episode but rather thinking about what is actually going on at the level of our biology which is that dopamine is marking time habits are a very clear way in which we can invoke dopamine release and therefore provide time markers and what this means is that for instance during your morning you might insert habit one and habit to at say it on aught a m and ten a m and in doing that that march an epoch a little batch of time in your morning routine that is distinct from the second half your morning in other words habits serve as flankers or markers for the passage of your day now if that seems kind of hypernorotic or why would i want structure my life that i would say that many people would do well to structure their life that into utilize habits notorious for sake of what you do during the habit but because of the fact that the habits serve as a marker be cause of the way they can evoke dopamine release and in doing that you are able to segment your day into a bunch of smaller if you want them to be smaller or larger functional units if any one wants to experiment with this the superman lad podcast puts out a news letters called the neural network news letter you can sign up for it at superman labor come we put it out each month you can see the previous news letters there zero cost we have our privacy statement there we do not sharer eviler anything and there you you will find the twelve steps to improving sleep was the first one there is another of the second news letter was all about neural plasticity and using scientific literature to improve learning and teaching and in the next news letter i intend to include a example protocol of how one could use habits and the relationship between habits and dopamine opening and time perception to structureour day according to performance of particular types of taste to day we covered ta lot about time perception we certainly did not cover everything about time perception but we covered things in trainmen the roll of dopamine habits and various routines that can adjust your sense of time for sake of particular goals if you're interested in learning more about time perception i to point you to a really excellent book called your brain is a time machine the burro signs and physics of time the book

only do hard about whether it is real or not as she she just liked it er mom dropping in that you no mam always really enjoyed each other ma each other laugh hanging out our mam die relatively young sixty ween years old from a degenerative disease she struggling to speak she was not a pain is nice to think of her past all that then it happened a second time few weeks later jane was back home in w york city ever twenty five hundred miles from bags whereas lived and did how ghost would get from one part of the country to another as a question that i certainly would have if i believed in goes does it you don't just jump on a commercial jet names panties on a couch i was again scrolling on my phone am just shopping for shoes or something and again she just pops up oh and it startled me and it almost startled her that i saw her that i recognized her and she apologizes for startling me and in is oke just figure out what you not to say and she says i do not want your dad to be sad and i said why do not you tell him that you do not want him to be so she says but he does not listen you to and then i thought about how even in life i was the translator between my parent was extra as the mediator baton an she would she would give you messages to take to your dad yet yet did you get a chance to ask any other questions now i just said oke it'll carry the message no problem was did not you have questions what happens to us after we die were are you what is his experience ora she visits again it'll make sure to ask i did not even occur to me at the time really yet all of humanity what would not know the ans er i man speaking on be myself ut also when they have of all other wiving people this is the this is sure oke if she comes again i will ask her and get back to you than they did o over the message to her that do not change ye her man's rite e has not was not well sometimes the third and last time her mam shod up again change was sitting on the couch this time i was watching try and then she decided to appear while i was watching to be i had to posit and i was oke what what is it this time and she is oh just waking to show you what have been up to and have not been talking to you ism taking care of this girl she ways taking care of kids and that is what she said she is doing right now and the other realm is she is taking care of another kid and is oke you are hanging out with another daughter ism here you and hang out with me when did you say the i was not gin a say it ti just thought it was did you have the feeling if like in some way she wanted you to give her permission to do that yes she wanted to show me why she had not been around ah and that is a little bit permission but it is also ism doing this in busy ism busy yes exactly how her ma'am was often in like off busy doing her own thing and and i say is is not what change wants to hear from her dead mother and she does know what you want she wants her mother to say something about her what she meant to her man ism supercilious she was such an independent person and and she wasn't particularly expressive with emotion or affection and you ways wonder who who am i to you the are you saying you are saying you you want wont more sign from her that she really loved you yes ye and she us is not de quivering she is not delivering this is a well known psychological phenomenon that after somebody dies they appear in some form that seems very real to the people who are closest to that like l see them you'll hear the voice the further presence this is a well known thing going back to the nineteenth century frond i wrote about it and called it wishful psychoses ism n there is a study in the nineteen seventies of it was of two hundred ninety three welsh widowers and widows and found that nearly half with them said their spouse had returned yet that seems to be what has happened ism is this some sort of self soothing is this some kind of rich in my brain glitch of grief or in something that tike we want be haunted oh yes but if this is you trying to comfort yourself in some way you are doing such a bad cob i mean she is not saying the thing you wanted to say to comfort you not at all yet exit is not working all this is the problem with ghost is that the they do not do we want them to no she is not at all they ant a program the problem with ghost expect such specific things from them and they rarely deliver really do want them to be something they are not which frankly is unfair they are dead and still the sup us to put up with other people's expectations do not wallets get relief from that in the great beyond to day when a programed stories of all kinds of ghost ghost have been ignored and is understood famous ghost ghost who have ghost ted those who love them yes they got to why do you think they call them ghosts they be easy chico side america life camera glass they were the can the ghost industrial complex to people want from ghost since wanna georgia could not be care they want could scare goes tors are a thriving fire at the stories in business you will fingers e people passing by o what go wee stole water ghostevery night in stand of the historic district is packed with ghost stories guides taking people around with ridiculous ghost detecting a equipment tors and open top here says there is a lot of drinking on these tori the general is the podcast that a bunch of us here at the radio shown not changer dominica rasing a heard from a friend of his gorge when eighth generation savanna i something weird is happening on these ghost stories forge tod centered that the guides actually talk about the brutal reality of slavery henry thought rarely on these tors the on for that gentry was the cops to the podcast on civil which documented the typical ways that white southerners present the history of the south but they usually leave out i the violence of slavery when to see for himself what was happening i went down to savanna i went on o bunch of these ghost tore my friend gorge told me to be sure that i went on one called the spirits and scoundrel tore i pulled up on it about ten p m on a sturdy night was being led by an older white de rest a pirate we baggy pans an a black scarf round his head silver rings and daggers hanging from his waist kind of jingled when he walk we ladies an gentlemen welcome to the spirits and scoundrel tore i guaranty we will be walking on the did this evening and as far as i know we may well be standing on some as ism spit as we walked every once in a while he would stop on from from font of one of these large mansions and tell us about a murder and some kind of ghost sighing all of this was boldly predictable on a ghost tore and also pat a while not into ghost story but then the pirate pointed down to these bricks and said they were sunken down in the sod one because they were bodies of people buried beneath us i told you as toll have us walking on the ends evening deny a ally in funky round be get down either these bricks were walking on are the original bricks hand made by the enslaved folk since o wanna you will see these all over the his stoic does trick and when you do take a moment to look at them closely because you can alien find the indentations of the fingers of the brick maker you can see the pinky finger the index finger the what finger her the small size of these indicates the bricklayer was either of woman or a child suddenly we were not just talking about ghostly mores the pirate it snatched us into this kind of weird black history archaeologist n honestly caught me of warn keep him mind people alkane past us with beers in the hands it is not quite new organs but it steadily wen down town drinking vine the pirate knelt down and held his fingers above the indentations in the bricks when i find em always to put my fingers and i feel it gives me it conduction with the brick maker when white people acknowledge slavery ism not on to tell em do not do thetbut at this moment ism not sure on buying this connection this was a tor guide trust l like the pirate leading mostly white folks who were here to find ghosts the only other black eye on the tor was this due to was may be in his thirties and i could not help an noticing clearly we were not the target demo graphic for this store when we saw each other he gave me the nod i walked over to him i fell by fthatug just lost of black history t on he looked directly at me as scrunched up his face if you look up seriously brought in the dictionary this goes face would be there i could not help a laugh we both did his name was grab soon enough we had another weird slavery moment on the tore we stopped in front of the big mansion called the merlon willies house according to the story the former owner of the property mercer told eight of his enslave people to stand in the front of the house or and then ordered em to face to the east need down and before any body knew what was hoping is a legs to a pull his pistol from his pocket walk behind tow pa pa a pa shot all laid of him in back of the head is the pirate imitated the sound of the gun he also acted out the whole thing pointing his fingers at imaginary black heads in front of us the then is a ledge to have take an to bodies and put him on each corner of the mansion their heads coming to gather at the corner and the foundation stones land on top of them this was likely some type of too do rictal after that hairline detail he is on to the next thing i the that was just another fun little store i fell back from the grew to work next to grab ay man won which he think win din you that man he skilled on a how about o was no e now did a she stuck of the built the house tor grandwords and that story about all on the slave e they have named the where lovely shot that is wont invest again and i wanted the same thing i wanted to hear more about the blackcocks than these stories they not just their deaths and in every tore i went on this happened over and over gives would breeze through the violent stories of in slave people getting killed for pure shock vellum a laughs i when the pirate took us tho what he said was a slave burial grow the said the bodies were pretty much just thrown in the dirt ad then he kept that off with he job and after while we thank we have such lock beautiful green grass he here other graphic moments of terror a drama got other punch lines one to our guide told us about for rent away slaves who would be heading an joked at their ghost haunt the square and if you listened close you can hear them singing i are not got no body think i was expecting these tours to acknowledge slavery the way that would check a bold box or something yew somber sentences acknowledging hi slavery was bad before they got back to ghosts this was more than they were really going in a lot of his stuff was cart tarnish histeriof typical but intentionally unintentionally they would do in something to called for many times getting groups of white people to could front the violence and could bloodiness in slavery and who were southern mostly white people paying to go on these stores in their time off it is almost if you turn critical ray theory into a book of ghost stories all the white folks who hate it would love it i talked to some one who had an explanation for why this is happening time miles as a his stories at hazard and she to be do not to a tour this cold of on whim i was visiting the savanna it happened to have band a rainy said of days that i walked by a home called the viral weed house as i walked by i was called and beckoned in bi a woman who was stranded outside trying to encourage people to come locator the store is presented to ya as a historical tour not a got tour ti loves going on history tours i had never heard o this house before and i was experience i went in i took the tour and that is where i learned about molly molly is the person at the center of which probably the most popular go story down in seven her story is the spot he climax of nearly a re tours the tourguides all stopped in front of a big orange mansion with palm trees and punish moss and he way they tell me this black woman molly wholived in die in the house was own by wealthy influential business man made francs surround and his wife manila molly's caught up in a move thing francs is having and a fair with her that is the word ans only manila his wife has no idea then one night manila walks in on frantic an molly and catches them in the act the tilde distraught to learn that her husband is cheating that she walks out on the balcony and jumps to on debt some even believe she was pushed a few weeks later molly is found bed hanging from the rafters in the slave course francs is a suspect in both tenths tour is all over the city exploit this tragedy by claiming molly still haunts the house where she was murder and remember because these a got stories that et told when a whole bunch of embellishment and the slightly different versions on different tours i will say that what is interesting as manila om she was actually really close to molly molly was cone an on official fatalist for herl confidant in some tors molly manila come off as if they were lesbian an lovers here is a letter molly supposedly wrote mola loved sister pul tilde how i yearned for the the slightest with of yourwisofen and one guide when is far to end a detail about manila holding a hot boll of suit when she walked in on molly and francs to a starer o o and there is france wan moll get mill a r are a r o i a a y a r a ma o there was only one tour guide who talked about it differently not coincidentally the only non white torguide we had retina guide named para because of the power strackshare that this was some one who was pollen by francs this was not congenital for bout people this was definarat that is how ya saw it too everyone us as this sort affair to my mind the way i interpreted was she had been explained that she had been bus and she had experience true pain and suffering after that first daytime tour we tie learned about molly she came back for a night time tour which takes you to the room where molly died and the tourgude described i cans as i tell you this i feel my comic tightening the tourguide described that she had been found hanging from the rafters of the the slave quarters at this particular room and he took us to this room and he invited us to go ins ya stands frozen the threshold of the door while the other tourist push fire they just went on in as if this was only just any kind of story but there was know way i was going inside these were white get were white other for petispents for while folks everybody was but me and they did not seem to be having the same sense of the gravity of what if where we were were in the slave quarters of what occur they just when it they did not have a sort of reverence for the space anything that no one send to blink an eye and the tour give was om cares magic he was i was jo get and he was certainly making light of the story and he was narrating it as if it were some kind of horror show that people had entered into fortune no to get a hollowing scare by b choice t this point the forgot takes out of phone and placed this audioclip that he says was featured on the levy show ghost owners they filled an episode in the surreal wheel house but tie heard was a woman's voice screaming help o god help and the muffled sound of her crying hard of me was shocked an appalled at what i was heroin and that same harm that was show in appalled felts just a rush of a sense of protectiveness for molly for this young woman who really was a tea nature who is just exploited be used used and then blamed and then kills but another part of me and this is i think that the scholar inside how do series of questions running the whole time questions about how does this person know what it is that he is telling us how does he know about molly how does he know about the affair how does he know about the suicide what does the evidence behind the story outdid you decide to do about all this i decided that i had to research molly story and the sell family and this house and to find out who she was she knew it would not be easy if a double dead had happened related to a sexual scandal related to an international sexual relationship in the nineteenth century the white family would not have been happy to disclosed it right they would they would have tried to keep that quiet she started with the more accessible records and trike down francs and manila e found evidence suggesting she did killed herself though not in that house but to confirmed that they own some one name molly or anyone in that age range i started out by going to state local historical collections she conned through purchase records of people the carrells an slave do not through national a lives and send the records of a slave folks in georgia scoured local newspapers from that time found letters from neighbors she even discovered a memoir by one of the barrelled sons and at the end of a year of exhaustive research there was know molly that is that saint that motor that motor that we got u to stop this as i mean after i meou just describe to me this whole drama about molly and now you are looking in these records and you do not see any record that no no name of molly o no not a single trade on a single group nothing nothing if ti had told me that molly story was exaggerated in certain ways i do not think i would have been surprise but no molly bat's actually a fiction that somebody had created and what i realized that i felt enraged i felt enraged about the notion that some one had enrage all this up the was appalled that she decided to find out if this was happening anywhere else turns out plantations and old mansions all around the south give tors this and she went on as many as she could she discovered a whole industry built around fabricated stories he stoical sights ginned up with hate tales of murder and torture and she wrote a book it posing this part of the tourism industry called tales from the haunted south hearing this thought back to my tor with the pirate and that story he told about the shooting of eight an slave people by humurcer there is no evidence that happened and those finger prints of the enslaved in the bricks we walked on bricks that due existence wanna but probably not in that location but it is not just that much of the stuff is made up the closer tie looked at these coast tore the more she saw a disturbing pattern in the kinds of stories the work i had to they were stories were in slave folks betrayed their masters a poison their masters a seduce their masters the gore and sensationalism of stuff this actually hides the realities a slavery by turning the victimizer their masters into victims if he look at them as little moral fables the message of these stories is that everything would be fine if every one just stayed in their place to to is book the bunny molly came out in two thousand fifteen but when we took this a rail head house night tore molly story was still presented his fact and it was the focus of the tor i want did know how they could justified why they still telling this lie the manage of this a real house agreed to talk his name is clean parked and i was surprised to learn that he is black it is work at this a rale house on and off for ten years and gives tors himself but the o the historical tors that happened during the daytime and they do not mention molly these days he says molly only gets mentioned in the night time tors after we discussed i basics about the house i got right to the point when i took tho tore the stuff calla done it was but really some sensitive and intent stuff but i got to say man it seems this story about molly that was a huge part of the tor i took is not true what is what portage you take ism to to the night stories though when ism talking about i i de ideal with more the history portion of them of the business we do not mention that whole story because we do not think its that fact torus most people think if is to daughter i just ism clear you agreed that the molly story this being that i heard at the tor is a lie i do not i do not i do not know if it sir a liar not i then git is some of that is that seen sud company times at just it just stuff tit this point i realized that this conversation was going to go very differently from what i had expect tells e cause i thought calving was going to define the molly story like sight evidence and show me documents in fact i spend the night before preparing counter evidence we were going to trial clean told me he is changed rescripts of the daytime tor their facture but he insisted that even is the manager he has no control over what happens in the house yo nightie says he was promoted to run the daytime tors four years ago s and only the daytime tors the ghost tore portion of this business is always been ran in manage by of outside parties he says this year for the first time they have not had people from these outside company's running that business for now guides have continued giving the ghost stores with no one really supervising them clean says he is the factor in charge and hoping for a big overall i have to say i feel for calving is a black man he is in a tough spot as some one stuck navigating a situation created by other people's lies it still have this very real feeling that was going on here as wrong and i could not hold this back if ism been told that some one was hung in a room in a house i believe that that they should have some verification for that i grivet you but what am ask you just is humming tor you tilt in a city i i lost count maybe five an how much of thee torn be prefectural how does that help us understand molly's you in cause your ha understand tourism after understand how these forgives are training ho they how they how they work there is a lot of tore in this city that well say things that are not hundred per sent lot of the tore in the south are folk for lot of tore in out for hand don past you several times and sometimes those stories sickle people if those story sickle people i cannot help what they say i can help what i say i hear what you saying calving about you roll where your read how you approach history but i just wonder if you can understand that if feels folks have been make him money hundreds of thousands of dollars off of a lie about a black women who was that their saying is sexually assault for entertainment and now there is no account ability i i do not i do not know what you menders to that because there is a lot of stories it is a lot of torsi the some what happens in this business and all i can say is i do not do it and i can try and change to but but we talking about the surreal house do you think there should be some accountability at the surreal house for ta lie that they have been telling and make him money off to sell it to white people i do not think that is a i do not know i may not ism that is god question next year the go thing is ism one of to taken control lot fat lot of that part of the business and the lot of things wile definitely change me at the helm y you going to change that part of that are going to change are you stopping to tell the molly round now now not not in that i cannot why not i i cannot find factual things about the story it is weird that any of the ghost tore in making the stuff up to shock people because there is no shortage of real abhorrence hosanna's history it is hiding in plain sight slavery used to be the city's main business you could still see the infer structure around you the boats came in at the doc negro marts where slave people were sold or throughout the city do not picture an auction block these were just stores whose merchandise was human beings and there were brokers and bankers that funded all this people came ti sea from all over the south the since slaved people the problem of these tours is not just the tourist ongutist since of the actual lives the by real black people hundreds of years ago it is also that they do not get any picture of the economic machine the built oman the built this country made much of what we live in to day the tell us were haunted but they do not say wash really honing say dry dominica he teaches patcasting an gaudy deportation an my use journalist om school i sort pretty

ghosts the problem being of course that we expect all kinds of things from ghost and they usually do not deliver we arrived at a too a programmed a to wedding crasher since next goestoiy takes place at a wedding when uninvited guest shows up on baker explains the wedding took place on a cold night in february just one month ago it was big celebratory there was an hour of light food in drinks and then everyone walked out into the court yard for the ceremony to door opens he's double doors and the first people walking out is my god holding the groom and their holding not even holding hands directly they are holding their their elbows intertwist this is abbey it was her younger sisters wedding the last of the kits to get married it felt the end of an era this wedding would be the grand family family you have the whole family the immediate family the extend end family the grandparents it is the closest people of my life as a child are all there the baby does not say hide at any of them she cannot baby as standing behind a fence a little over fifty feet away on the sidewalk the uninvited guest it is her baby was disown by her parents seven years ago she grew up in willies burg bookman in the fistic community there it is a tightly nit world of orthodox chest in long dresses and black suits and hats it is own little cultural ego system tucked inside new york city baby was standing pretty far from the ceremony but just in case she were a face mask a big coat and a hat no one would recognize her she thought the distance would make it feel less intense but standing there made her feel she was at the wedding it totally thrower off hard you can hear to me music playing you can her here the person who is running the ceremony singing in the micephown and on everything is very familiar but at the same time i know very consciously that i can just go down there be part of it when abb first questioned and then left the city community at twenty one it seemed things would be o cay her parents stood by her which was rare at the time but also made sense her family was really cloves she would still come home on weekend but then a few years later baby came out as trains tit was a concept s o foreign she says it took over an hour for her father to grasp what she was telling him but the second he understood he stopped making i contact with her looking over her shoulder he said this means and never going to be able to talk to you ever again abbey says she asked if she could at least say good by to her mother he forbade it not talking to her mother was unfathomable before they would spoken almost every day even though abbess one of thirteen kids german took a special interest in her and when abbey broke away from nudism her mam loved hearing about her life in the outside world in the weeks and years after abbey was cut off abbey would call and call trying to reach her mother one time her mam picked up the home an i told in a said his is when a call you an hi she happy new yearn what ever and then she just ask me a you coming back he coming home which did not mean physically coming ho and spiritually and religiously and i said ta i did not call to argue lissome that she is if you to coming home a canal to you and she kept repeating that almost a taperquarter some one told her to say that abbey was later told that her father consulted a rabbi about his decision to cut her off and that this rabbi told him your child is dead now when she actually dies you do not need to sit shiva now standing outside the wedding abbey was being forced to watch all the people she would lost parade in front of her she studied her father's face his hair and beard were finally turning wite but she knew that she would seem pictures of him on line it is this moment of recognizing that i recognize my death from photos that who is alive i recognize how he looks not because i know him or that i have seen him but because have seen photos it is the moment of seeing a person who in my head has this personality of a dad o my childhood i i i cannot really grasp it this is person who's dear but is not i am here but ism not i am seeing him but ism not ism there but ism not therapy what has happeningeven though abbey knew going to the wedding would be painful she felt compelled to go because she would always imagined being there for years after they cut her off she would told herself by the time my youngest sister gets married will have worked through this it'll be back in the family throughout the ceremony abbey kept waiting for her mam to come out with the bride she knew about when it would happen she would been to many wedding but still the moment they actually walked out it caught abbey by surprise suddenly there she was her mam with her sister they tart the circle the groom an my mamas walking towards me to speak and it is that was the moment when i remember cried o she sanding to the right of my sister holding my sister's her left hand i i in the right and holding this candle and almost imagine a statue of e liberty moment if most to thinking bag in my head it wanted to be that moment where she is holding the candle to me or something that and to me debt was that that was the most that was the most intense moment can i play that vibrio by do i think them ye did the sound give the sins we hold a they play the song n tat ben in the family for agnation t moment standing there looking in to my looking on the outside you might close family listening to a song composed by my great great wet over grandfather i am suddenly feeling i am fly on the wall it a moment at the moment where you are suppose to be next to the bride and the groom the most important people at the wedding of the out their parents in their siblings it is not ism not thenar ism dear but i do not have about we have a believe a teaching based on the on the mystic teaching of the thirteen century that all the ancestors specifically if they were wholly come down to their weddings it's sols as ghosts for the of a betteterm and there all dear i am suddenly feeling i am one of those dead ancestors that is coming that we believe that we are told that is coming to the wedding i am the ghost she watch is through this changing wants it is this literal thing separating madam tut even if it were not there there would be no crossing from where she is to where they are main my life in general my parents live seven miles away from me i it feels they close but they are far away and and my at frankly whatever when i gas ya but wit my mam there is many says that wake up where i just when i ask or wight to do about my headache or what is a good dish that you think i can make for is holiday or ism having friends over and i know she would have some great ideas and all of doubt all of that comes to the forefront at that moment were i wish i was not a ghost i wish i was seen not just seeing her the way you just said when i wake up by imagine talking to her i imagine asking her whet i should cop to nay that is a thing i i felt about people i love have died i do not want to talk to people i do not not talk alter people who have literally lost apparent but to me it feels worst i thing that the part were people use those sometimes because it it explains it it calks bout something more intense than being get the fact that they are alive and i cannot talk to them the fact that they are it is that moment of being close to them that would have no doubt been easier if i did not go if i was not that close to them it much easier why i do not hae to face it to to baby be idea girl friend to watch the wedding with her it was the strange moment for them not a kind of bazaar meet the family these are the people from all the stories i tell you this was once my life wat what was the last moment of the wedding how did you leave it after the ceremonies over the riding groom hold hands and walk back into the even and this is the only tine that pathetic couples hold hands in public is ad the wedding as they walk off from the ceremony and never again baby takes one last look at her family and then she walks away with her girl friend i arrest was right away if you i think that we waited until we left the sciatica we did not one to hold hands to women in the lyrical be once we left and and we did and i remember thinking that i have some thing none of my samplings to i can hold the hands of the people i love in public an i left that they walk down into the subway to get there and get on the m train each stop taking them far there and far there away from baby's old life in closer ad the place she now calls home don baker i be stone as a memoir becoming eve by leaving the tactic community entrances hem tray salons fiction the losstory happens in a moment in history when lots of people were believing it got this is the early nineteen twenties nineteen eighteen open to make it just killed some fifty million people world wide just er sell that is way more than the number of people whole died of loved far he number people on earth which is a forth then what it is now at to that the millions of deaths in wore were one and well chance of pretty good that if you lived in america or rope your morning somebody you loved all the loss wet to this peculiar women that seems on of an fathomable now with the idea that ghosts are around us just within reach was not some far fetched or fringy kind of thing his main stream shown cold explains what spiritualism it is this religion basically the surged during this period believers thought that it is possible to talk to the dead they attended senses lots and lots of sciences sitting darkened rooms often pitch black holding hands furniture would move your voices from beyond i cannot really beeves begin to describe how pelvic of this spiritualism rage was this is avid jeer history writer wrote a book that delves deep into this whole world you had all the of these great america scientists who were trying a substantiate proof of psychic phenomenon proof of an after life the hazard psychology department were all bunch of ghost chasers ism in the head of a hazard psychology was also the head

a physiologist and while you may not have heard of charges rochet or any of the scientists who were spiritualists ran with spiritualists there these two guys you definitely have heard of both incredibly famous back then and even to day who got swept up in this movement and a way that came to really defend their lives the first is the world renowned magician and escape artist hairy whoring at the time of our story he was grieving the loss of his dearly de parted mother and this was no ordinary mother son relationship he wrote romantic letters to her used to rest his head on her bosom when he was anxious and when he was thirty five years old this by the way was before the whole world was talking about the whole edible complex thing and he would never refer to her as his mother he

with dead loved ones identified with but he had a rally hard time believing in spiritualism in the same way and for very very good reason he deny before he became a magician he actually made a living as is a fraud medium a far media yah no ken he knew all the tricks he was in a sense the world's expert on psychic frat but yet am he was also seeking that one psychic who he could believe was genially in touch with the spirit of his mother and this is one he befriend for author conman dole yes the guy who wrote all the hemlock home stories he is the other famous epic famous guy in our story conandoile lost his son his brother lots of the men in his family either in some world wore one battle or in the flue pandemic and during the war a he believed he was in contact with the spirits of his his his lost loved once a through his children ani who supposedly had psychic powers and she would hold the stance was and he became a believer and not just o believer but really the defect o lieder of the spiritualism movement he might be familiar with his part he travel all over the place giving presentations and lectures about the virtues of spiritualism which lent the movement a lot of credibility he was the guy who had invented this character who was the final of rationality in deductive reasoning of course you were going to give him the time of day and condole acknowledged the other a lot of fake mediums out there but there legitimate ones too he denies mom had already been dead for the better part of a decade when he met conendoi he presented himself to conandoil as a seeker after the truth and conandoyle thought he could help him talk to his dead mother they came to really each other in nineteen twenty who deny travel to the puca to do some shows and candle sent him around to all these mediums that he trusted but with every one of them who deny could see the puppet strings because again he had pulled the same stones himself once upon a time and he claimed to have attended a hundred since as and in inland right one a day yen humeri had a tendency to his acerate i i doubt very much if he hadtinted a hundred stances but he did i see a number of these mediums that conandoyl recommended and he struck out and and he told conandall that and conandoyle thought it was because hudenie's mental state with turbulent that he basically blocked any any kind of possibility of am psychic communication when he participating the since as and he tolludeni you cannot pursue a spirit the way terrier pursues a rat way you have got to come in quiet and receptive and he thought humeri was to blame for thus which of course his a conversation you here in a lot of spiritual houses if you cannot get in touch with a spirit whether divine ere just your cousin because he do not believe well enough that is forward a couple of years nineteen twenty two conandoyle comes to the states to give some spiritualism lectures brings his wife along and they hang out with his new best but whudeni and hudenie's one and toward the end of the conndile's time here the four of the magenta resort in aplanatic city hanging out at the lecher whatever and conandole's surprise their magician friend with a suggestion con dole's wife gentle is also a psychic medium an cur has an inspiration the week gan that whudenie's mother is going to come through and present a a manifestation of her present she just comes up with that on er found l apparently am she is hit with this psychic bolt ora an a conendoyle invites eugenic for a says and unbeknownst to the doles this week was eudenie's mother's birthday sort of in your coincidence already and who denied he is agreeable actually eager he wrote about this saying quote i was willing to believe even wanted to believe they go up to the conandoyle's hotelgrim sir rather closes the curtains and puts a writing tablet and pencils on the table this was to be lady dole's mode of mediation automatic writing am the idea she is in a trance and she is spontaneously possessed by the spirit that takes hole of her hand and she is just writing unconsciously oh it is a signboard where the spirit takes your hand a he moves ah that is that is a good way of looking at it am it is a very intimate scene conendoyle says a prayer am there holding hands it just complete silence then lady condole start's writhing around making all these jerky movements she pounds on the table which is the sign that the spirit is present lady conandoyle asked the spirit do you believe in do and then pounds the table three times which means yes she puts a cross at the top of of one of the the pads am she as are you the spirit of eudenie's mother again she pounds the table three times an then heudeni kind of lets out this gasp and says mamma are you here just thinking about whudenie sang mamma you here it is really moving it is really moving and i think i do not know i i cannot picture him saying that in any other savants i think that is expressly something that he was vulnerable enough to say at that moment lady conandoyle starts writing furiously every time she gets to the end of the page sir rather tears it off the tablet and hands it to humeri luckily who denied held on to the pages after all of this we know what is on them i asked avid to read some of what whudenie's dead mother had to say oh my darling thank god thank god at last ism through have tried oh often now i am happy why of course i want to talk to my boy my own beloved boy friends thank you with all my heart for thus you have answered how is whudenie seeming through all of this is he liken emotional during it to see according to conendoyle he was completely silence he seemed on the verge of tears am he look somebody who had finely found am what they were looking for to having just beheld the miracle is life of mine it is different over here and we see our beloved ones on earth that is such a joy and comfort to us tell him i love him more ever ears only that is conindoyle's for the story humeri is left pale and trembling a new believer hudenie's feelings about it become evident about four months later he writes an article for the new works son saying he is never seen any evidence that any one can communicate with the dead quote i do not know of any medium who is not at some time been detected in some fraud condole sees the article and writes a letter to his friend whoudenie saying am paraphrasing here dud what the hell i watched you tear up in front of me also my wife is not a fraud who denied wives in backside dud that was not my mam the fact that his mother could only read writ and speaking german whudeni cannot understand how the message from his mother in a could sound some victoria on platitude it it is not her voice victor vectoring platitude in english in english and there is also it sounds a spiritual's sermon god bless you too sir rather for what you were doing for us for us over here who need to get in touched with our beloved ones on the earth plain if only the world knew the scrap trust how different life would be for men and woman go on let nothing stop you great will be there is no great big graphical reference t anything between eugenic and his mother including no reference to the fact that it was her birthday think she would a mention that plus that cross that lady conendoyle put at the top of the page when she started channeling eugenics m were jewfish conindoile has responses to all this ad first of there is no language in the after what she says maybe a trancemedium would come through uttering the exact words of your loved ones in heir native ton but automatic writers a more translating their thoughts and feelings not taking dictation and as far as the cross goes conendoyl says his wife was that before she presents any kind of spirit writing because it is protect from lower influence says i always home it the cross on top of the page o of course i ma you soft want dark spirits and full trading your say on and i not taking hold of the medium n be terrible no that the cross peens the and conandoil maintains look you told me you were walking on air you told me you were deeply move a i i cannot reckon saw what your saying now with what i saw with my own eyes at the time how you were sponged an the things that you told me sense which indicated that you were convinced he is conadoile's passed at his friend condole is very hard the aplanatic city salons was the last straw for legend from then on he was not just a septic of spiritualism he was an all out crusader against spiritualism he would sneak in to darkens say once's in disguise china flash light on huckster mediums as they pushed furniture round that was supposed to be moving on its own he devoted a big chunk of his toringshot to just bashing spiritualists demonstrating exactly how sisters pretended to channel your dead relatives e even testified before congress in favor of a bill that would outlaw fortune telling for her did not go anywhere but the hearing devolved into total madam mediums and other spiritualists flooded the capital gearing humeri as he gave his testimony security was called in to keep them from laying into each other he screamed at them tell me the name my mother called me when i was born the way humeri saw it the called psychics they were just fleecing money from the bereaved people who were grief stricken of course they were ready to believe anything it wounded him cause he knew how they felt uncle s when the produces of ourself girder spoke about eugenics war

the wall coxes are over we now moved forward to new samphire as i said yesterday on the show it seems as though all of this is to prolonged introduction to donate trump as the actual grope nominate he won i by thirty points he is presumably the front runner in new samphire is by far the front runner in south caroling according to the latest o pulling get a burned samphire is a lit bat tight according to the america research group o pole that is connote dick polls gat a see pulsating from five to thirty but according to that pole the latest presidential pole has donate trump and nick hale tide at forty per cent with nine per cent on decided rondisancs clocking in at four per cent of vacuum swum who dropped out at four per cent presumably those four per cent from romasuomy well you move over two donate trump in fact the take last night went on stage with donate trump he of course dropped out right after the was cop's and indorse trump which of course was going to happen from pretty much the very beginning of the race again the take race was about things other than being president of the united states he accomplished many of those goals but this was sort of what was expected here was a take last night on stage with dona trump last night i was on to race thindusment of a man who is become a true leader and earn the admiration of many pay i have been a friend of is even though we were competing against each other but i was fend if iran we get along and he was say he is a great present i kept a why is running it keeps calling me great refiner but he's a fences gives is gets om tremendous ideas and his young it s gets him young ideas to an that is a good thing he has a big beautiful right future ahead evade ramisuamy o not other about friends again after trump siphon eaten gust last week he's through this guise i do love that do i do love that a side there an even no ais running since he lest me that that really was the question was it not the take ten came out and then he talked about how donate true stood for the true principles of the republican party which i am serious he said revolved round not cutting any entitlement program but cutting are to u crane which again you can make arguments about cutting eight crane not cutting eight u crane but the idea that the republican party whole sale is behind non reform an non touching of the entitlement it is one of the reasons why donate trump was more popular with the general electric than some other republicans but it is not a par circularly conservative principle also the idea that any amount of money spend on crane would have keeled the problems with social security medicare medicate is absurd the entire amount of us eight o cranes o far which is seventy five billion dollars lot of military aid and civilianade two crane not pay for about eleven days worth of social security metical and medicate put all of that aside the botomlines that the dynamics of the race azure obviously very much in donate trump's favor there will be apparently no debates next wee nickel hale suggested that she would not debate wrontosance to finished ahead of her in the will cocks the reason she is doing that i she is now plan trumps car trumps card was i am not going to debate any one bedim far ahead nickel hale is basically suggesting that going into new samphire she sol far ahead of de mantis that there is no reason to make herself vulnerable to that a b my news then duly called off the republican primary debate the announced that there would be no debate at all they sat our intent was to host debate coming out of the we coucals wet we always knew that be contingent on the candidates and the outcome of the race while while our robust election covers will continue a b s mean altar eve will not be moving forward with thursdays republican at presidential primary debate in new samphire now age do i think the new hampers quite as close to that pole is making out i do not i think the donate trump does in facts have the upper hand in new samphire even should nice hey pull out some sort of upset win in new samphire they would then hand down to south caroling where donate trump does have a fairly substantial lead in that particular race remember that new samphire as a place where cries crispy was pulling in the double digest until he dropped out presumably a lot of that support is in a flow over to nickel hale but let us be real about this all eyes are already turning to the general election and because all eyes are turning to the general election that means we have to look at the strategy that democrats are using to defeat donate trump to understand that strategy u really have to speculate on weather this is all as admiral car might say a trap whether in fact democrat's plan is to basically gat republicans to nominate donate trumps that they could run against him of course they tried this trap in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen killer canton suggested the dona trump want run she wanted donate trump to be the re publican hominy and the of course she lost to him our democrats repeating history an maccarthia national us suggests that that is the case because he says that basically by promoting all of these legal cases against donate trump this year that opened up the primary in favor of donate trump he reverse all of the momentum in the race in favor of donate trump because the republicans reacted to the in just persecution of trump bi supporting him i the race and then the entire next year is going be all about his legal cases and in fact threesome dated a support this if you look at the republican presidential primary pulling what you see is that right after the twenty twenty to election dona trump and ornis antis running basely neck and back and then they continued run necannec through canary through february and then something happened in march what happened march the announcement of prosecutions against donate trump once that happen the poles open up wide the dam burst and republicans move behind donate trump because they perceived that donate trump was being in duly persecuted and donate trumps line which twas effectively that they are coming after me because they will also come after you was an effective line that is particularly effective when the democratic party is making clear that the center of all of its policies is equity equityequity and when many america here equity would they mean is the preferred democratic voting constituencies are going to get special benefits and everybody else is going t get fact seen donate true b says they're coming after me because they are also coming after you that does have some credibility to it that said the next year obviously is going to be a very stack year for dona trump in terms of the various calendars were to more on this in just one second first as you have already seen twenty twenty four is going to be a wild ride your to seeing the impact of inflation the gas pomp

arguments in washington federal appeals sort over drums claim to absolute immunity happen that is army happen on canary tenth the trump organization civil fraud charges closing arguments were made to day there was a second trial that began in new york in which begin carol a woman who allege the donna trump rapture in a department store in york city again allegations that i think are really dick on their face but she did when a defamation suit against him and now she's found a second defamation quit against him next week canary twenty third of course have the new samphire primary on february eighth you have a supreme court case with oral arguments hearing about wether dona's from should be bard from the ballet on february twelfth when down an maralago and there is securing in fort peace flora on which classfime materials the special council can with fold from the true defense or not with hold from the trump defense three days later there is a during in manhattan on the stormy angels hush money gates that be the plan brag again specious manhattan the a case move ford just a little bit in time and you end up with the march fourth schedule opening in washington of trumps trial on the four felony charges being brought by jack smith with regard to canary sixth move ford just a little more in time march twenty fifth you've state criminal cases stormy angels again on the docket that is the schedule start of the trump trial over the hush money that was paid two stormy angels to cover up their affair in may you've the maralago classified documents trial which is schedule to start now again all of these dates may be delay august fifth you have the georgia recon case that is supposed to start he in to me all year long is going be all you are long now that obviously means that there is in me a lot of this in thehatlines and that could theoretically hurt donate trump or or it is also possible that dona trump ranting bout legal cases actually means that it get's kennaboring see the thing is with dona trump you when donate trump talks about a topic too much it basely turns into tonight's if those don't no about to night as to night as when you have ringing in your ears and it really is irritating are you wisdom e mil the night you hear the ringing your ears and what your bringing dos it a certain point is just kennitunes it out in the same way that you have now tuned out the insane over estimation of the media of donate trumps supposed fashions you've turned it out now eye to in part the background noise in the same exact way donate trump dancing on truth social about his judicial cases i think that is not part the background noise for most america i do not think most american's care particularly much about all this i thing most america a to woke you went after him on a thousand different things none of them seems to be particularly not worthy a crazy well remember canary sex o that already was baked intone can donate trumping women e let's been a thing sons the nineteen eighties donate trump raising on truth social really does not make that pic of difference and here is where as i said yesterday the fact that dona trump is on truth social is ironically actually a great help to him if dona trump runs witter ranting about things that every tweet that he sent would get hundreds of millions of views that is not an exaggeration meant that the donate trump on twitter currently has i in you not eighty seven point four million followers eighth seven point for million on truth social he is posting things and he is getting thirteen thousand likes on things cam meaning no one seeing the stuff that he is raising which is attorn quite good for him he is a means that we can just filter all of it out for example he is ranting out begin carol on truth social yesterday said after historic win and i ism going to the biding en courage which hunt and for man wanted to fight against a feign case from one i have never met seen or touch celebrity lines do not count naturally it starts right after loans bring the very important new capture primary word despite their sinister attempts i will be to night is a thing election interference cam push finance by political operatives i had no idea who this woman was pure fiction now that may very well be true i mead it a certainly true that even carrots case was fund d in fact by a democrat billion named read hodman who is attectbrow that is certainly true but the online is this democrats are gambling that trumps legal foibles are going to somehow sink his campaign i do not know that that's a particularly amazing at gambol none thewless the media are veryinswho it baggie saber man a jonathan carl they say that trumps campaign is getting at stuck in the courtroom but baggie onto things he wants to do is to drag it out is cause he is got this very complex legal and campaign status of it coming months that he likes to a peril court as it is good for fun rasing a shockingly but it is a ha what is the thinking here inside ta that's that is use this says it continual trumps in the news is it a good thing to be in the news for he is decided that he is going to try to turn this into a positive as much as possible for the reasons you said it has a strong for rising effect with his base it has a galvanizing a feu know victim hood effect with his base i also think car in have been thinking about the lot for last couple of days i think he prefers this to the act if campaigning it blocks hat a tension that his rivals can get i think that he has decided he is going to turn what are objectively undesirable circumstances into has much of a positive as he count in whispers a campaign up the risen dirt is indistinguishable from his or from his legal cases and and it is very moon but thin that the they are older involimin his his his political advisers a i as a wearer and involved in in what is happening on the legal front is anything else it is an any spends more time with his lawyers with his legal team than he does with his political team but but even when he is with the political tames marge it is out it is it is it is about the the lawyers ye well i mean all of that again may very well be true but are you that interested in the stuff i do not fort myself particularly stimulated b e dona's from legal cases again all that happen before ans now as hour the trials themselves are to be wildly fascinating are not washing a murder trial here you may watching much people testify about the handling of classified documents down in florid or people rehashing for the one millionth time what happened on canary six up in washington d c or more allegations about stormy angels in campaignpaignments from full on eight years ago is that something that is really unheard totals from which means the democrats are now having to rely on some back up strategies one of those back of strategies of course the attempts to bar donate from from the ballot yesterday jobidin campaign at coacher jeffrey cassenburg suggested he did not know if is on democratic to bandanas from from the ballot i mean i do it is on democratic you cannot just panier political opponents from the ballot i do not know how i the sprincourts can to decide that i that is not something locate e i democrat party position it's just that in very states people individuals have taken this i issue up and and we aren't hear from spring couture win of a down in the fact that the are lend incredibility to this nonsense is really nock on a benefit them and it does lend credent the dona from plains that they are out to get him which of course is the reason he hot the nomination in the first place presuming that he raps it of is is some that he will there is more on this in just one second first have been talking about my helix matters for years have had my healing matters for nearly a decade at this point it is the gift that keeps on giving because it is made just for me i took that two minutes sleep quit at mash me to bad personalized for my take you should have a bad that is made for you he looks is now introducing their newest most high and

get is not con a last long that helix sleep dot tom freshmen with relics better sleep starts right now meanwhile another take the democrats are trying to take preemptively is the same tact they took in twenty twenty and we talk about the rigging of the twenty twenty election a difference between rigging and just outright fraud is that rigging is about changing the circumstances surrounding the election in not illegal ways not ways that obviously are men to change the direction of the upcoming immoral ways for example changing the balling process might not be a legal and pensylvan anything probably was e legal but yo fulfilled certain legal cried terra but was obviously meant to skew the result in a particular way allowing people to vote early by mail three months in advance of elections leading to sixty per cent of all democracy votes in twenty twenty being cast by mail that obviously is an act of rigging the is why it was done the attempt by the f be which this again may have ben illegal to interfere in the election by effectively telling all of these big tact companies that they ought not report or allow reporting on under lions laptop the month before the election that obviously had a major impact on the election now the reason i distinguished that for of rigging from outright fraud is outright fraud is we are going to bus in tuns of fake ballast and we are going to shove them through the machines three four or five times organ pictures big vat of true votes and throve them in the river and there never seen again the sort of stuff does happen in america politic be not to the extent of tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands or millions of votes lost or or spoiled but does that mean that the twenty twenty election was not one quote rig in a sort of informal cents of course not it was rigged in the informal sense in which the media obviously were on board all the america institutions we are on board with your bi is victory or starting to see it right now in to the most perverse ways a couple of those most perverse ways are members of the intelligence community who were awful during the twenty twenty election you recall toughen the undermine laptop story came down there re dozens and dozens of intelligence officials who claim that under bison's laptop was in fact a piece of russia disinformation that was the lection rigging was the be legal for them to clam the no was at them using there credibility that the america people took seriously in order to petty much openly lie about hunter bison's laptop absolutely while now you having the same thing you are going to have intelligence officials foreign and domestic blaming the dona trump is actually a threat to the god working order of the west this presumably is why you've the former am mi six head sir richer deer lav talking about trumps at re election being in actual national security risk to the aka pa ha tiggistent bort wet give note of pole you e a the political threat who i married about which is a trumps i thought bat i reelection what i think for the u case tactless security is problematic because if trump as it were exist in damages the aplanatic plans that is a big deal for the puca we put a legs in defend this in thematic base will get at the reality is that evened dowintrump was president he was just to asking forrnato partners to increase their spending the reason i point this out is because if the intelligence community is in fact mobilized againstonal trump they can do some pretty corrupt and terrible things meanwhile members of the big tat community are also mobilizing over the beginning of the week we have had thebeginning of the world economic forum over in dagos for folks yo do not know the world the economic forum of found that originally by on i class strobe in the nineteen seventies it is essentially a meeting of big business leaders big corporate leaders big government leaders they all get together and they plan they plan for what the world should look they all coordinate with one another in fact wo have a brand new facts episode out on you top or explain everything you need to know about the w f and tacos in detail and basically there are agenda is cooperation in corporatist wussy fascistic fashion between big business big government big tack in order to sort of rig the rules of the road and already over at the you have went twenty four participants are talking about the necessity for quotinqual policing misinformation now nobody's interested in falsehood being prevaricated but lathing everybody is interested in is who gets to set the standards and to say that i do not trust the people the you have to determine what is misinformation what is not is to put it absolutely mildly here for example our hazard professor encomia ores us and censer for democracies reeve givens talking about the necessity of policing misinformation over at dagos again these are when people talk about globalists this what they really mean they do not so meat that they really do not mean people ware in favor of free trade most republicans are in favor of free trade including for more personal trump despite his rhetoric when you've actually preside is free free trading president when people say globalist what they mean is a cadre of people who wish to restructure the entire global system they are in control of the leavers of power and that is what it looks over at the w f including with regard to quonquot misinformation we get moon this in just one second first according to forces canary is the hottest

talking about the necessity for cracking down on miss in formation by which they mean information that i want you to hear and the rest of private sector is just sitting on the sat lines and there just not fan anything in their biting their tongue because well may be they present tom the reasons because he cut corporate tackles and i think the private sector has pages to stood by and allowed a lot of really damaging things to happen things thin the long on will not be good for i a liberal demo critic capitalists om and i really hope that the worldly comic form will take this into on board and think harder about the roll that the private sector complain standing out against disinformation in this big election her what kinds of safe gods and measures a you thinking that company isn't country should be trying to implement as they get ready for elections e willow pick up on a there that i think you are just getting to i just one of the most crucial intervention points is how we surface authentic trusted sources of information and your absolutely write that the media has a critical role in this some of the tack companies to if you are a serchengion are serial media platform i think it is your duty to help surfacethe trustees sources of information we again who is didn't pick tho trusted sources of in formation presume we that will be in your time the washington post all the left wing outlets at the left particular globally left absolutely lot we so about rigging the election this is what we are talking about and it is jobidentim who working handing glove with these people john carry to sort of the official convoy to the w e f every single year he obviously is is very much in favor of a globalized regime in which he gets to ferry back and forth and make friends with the chines and talk for example about the wonders o restructuring the entire global economy as to avoid climate change of course takes private just doing all this here he was at dabs talking about the need transition away from fossil fuels in into by a we were able to change that part som wit one critical para that karma is that we must transition way from consul fuels remember we could not gan a resolution between was you was down in gringo and there as no mention of this n pars but into by a hundred ninety five countries including all producing or gasperdicing countries came to consensus that we must say o the world that we must transition away from ousel fields he this guy is now moving from the join white house to the jobidon campaign and we talk about loyalest rigging of elections we are talking about people this here is john carrying up announcing the he joining the campaign i know striking theory ins the hearts of republicans everywhere giving the fact that he lost her gorge ally button two thousand for i am hatched inotherwas man o more in the having in our country because ism female an inland engage in in in the campaign that is nankanam i i want to be able to speak out a man an other acres mobile and i ana strangers and and there is many different ways to continue to be able to be engaged in this and i think the america public this is going to be one t reasons i my voicemack to be able to goon get o is this issue is a venin issue and and people want to going those because they want to continue down this road and see this new economy emerge and not here that kills them it gives them diseases and since there kids to the hospital in the summer from environment detanouce retire some minting it is the double a favors crowd that does not want dona trump that is tho the says and again there entire step is working together it's collusion tin government be business an back that is the entire stick of the u v it is that this is the jobidin campaign i natural at on a retinal of intersectionality and equity talk and that is the hoiden campaign here for examples the yum present and i work bread talking about collaboration is yon business in government the world comic farms tan anything i think it is the proof of that the week had and the years had the deliver important outcomes off celebration between business and cam even when it had explained how this requires a new world order yen i it is amazing how the you stumble headlong into saying the words but here we go that order seems to know no not be the order and the wore we are on the way to a new order we are between the orders a do you agree with that or rather ways of a what are able to keep on the positives that from the old order to bring into a new wild order and who can we avoid that that new world order a becomes a jungle growing back and we rougher have i order based on thy national land principles that have brought prosperity and the freedom a fordecets i do not think the inter'tatural order built after nineteen forty five is getting replaced whole sale with som you order a it will obviously evolve visitor as it has evolved multiple times over the debate since nineteen forty five but i do think in a in a more sharp and distinctive way were moving in to a near that is what give talked about it by remarks an that of course is the anas j sultan we talk about jobidin being in the pocket of sort of these types of people and in fact this can a word all acting out of that is correct this is what stands in the way of dona trump attaining the white house again folks last year because of you reborn network of clinics saw over fifty eight four in babies lives saved thank you to all you who made that possible let us celebrate these precious babies owns this kin of i laid a the t at the is the way you know ta me know it is not the ayin a him you no li was in is door an now that was estray to walk up i that an that the day no i guy may o a i to me you li baby you will have to going there and you was i knows there i the help es the thing in a the a mat i a base that ma i they may e ta i may have little arms e lay tan the that i may no a actually a you ma i the

her baby in the mom it changes everything about her life is it reborn dot come slash men to make such ultrasounds available that is reborn to come slash man in the the thing in favor of dona trumpets of course the fact that the bite administration and the goblets are truly incompetent ad all of this in fact the title of the its this year is restoring trust well i mean they that the trust has not been lost because people are talking about them the trust has been lost because they are garbage at this it turns out that all repeople who suggest you ought to give them control over your ligand over the system those people botched it six ways from sundae and that is donate from opening and speaking of that opening in the ochery what is going on on the border continues to be a complete disaster area in amazing story between taxes and the federal government according to bright part do come its strongly worded letter from the department homeland security to the state of texts is demanding axis the us medical border on land seems by the state and eagle passional pass of course is one of the great source of legal immigration the country right now hundreds of causes of people everymonth arriving at eagle pass d thus officials ordered the state to cease and de sit its efforts to block border patrols was in and around shall be park and remove all barriers to axes by the end of the day on canary seventeenth the d chest general council iron it and pier wrote in a letter to texts turn general ken parton texts actions are clearly on constitutional and are actively destructing the federal governments operations why what is texasdoing while they set up actual barriers to prevent people from crossing the border d his wants to dismantle those barriers s they can continue to essentially treat border patrol as a ferry service for a legal immigrants as i have mentioned is just down at the organ of a bunch of material coming out about that and it is truly amazing gabion has essentially turned our border patrol units into a bussing service for a legal emigrants they literally arrive at the border hold up their hands say their clewing asylum border patrol then picks them up posts them lets them into the country within seventy two hours the state of texts is saying no and they are building barriers and this means the bid administration is now probably going to take them to quart the ta quote the recent actions by the state of texts have impeded operations of the border patrol now as bright by points out the use of the word impeded by the d chest general council cold imply a threat of criminal action against officers an agents of the state of texts a carrying out the orders of governor abbot to secure shall be park and prevent borer patrols entry to the aria now again the reason they soft want the bore patrol in the as was the word patrols simply facilitating the entry of all the illegal emigrants all this is coming amidst a false story recorded widely by the left going media suggesting that the state of texts is responsible for migrant drownings according to a time line provided by the texts military pardon sundae the boarder patrols request to enter the park came after migrant drowning had already occurred and the bodies of the families were being pulled from the water by medical authorities but that in stop the media from running with the story which was supposedly that bunco migrant for trying to cross the border they started to drown border patrol wanted to get in to help them in tea ad stope them this report by c bus news whose false was not true it turns out that the migrant had already drowned by the time border patrols even a wear of it and arrived on the border d hes continues to pretend that this contributed to migrant drownings miners had quote on canary twelve after learning a from group all data a group of ciliated with the national institute migration mexico that a up of migrant was attempting to cross the river border patrol contact to text officials and requested axis to the border and texts reviews later a rescuing for medical as able toe rescue to individuals from the group both with signs of hypothermia three individuals drown texts is demonstrated that even the most exigent circumstance it will not allow border patrol aces to the border to conduct low enforcement and emergency respontectivities and that of course is false that is not true it turns out that these people in fortunately had drowned long before boarder patrols even a war of the situation at all but trobidan is receiving pressure from his left flag for the global regime of emigration to continue open migration three fly of people across borders including the america border there is a peace to day in the parties from a personage t andrefloris whose an emigration policy advice for both agama and widen calling on job not to compromise tithe re publicans n at border policy she says quote mister bison could lose we powers the presidents have used for decades to regulate id migration an times of crisis worse if mister trump is reelected he will have new tools at his disposal he could use to terrorized emigrants and make the case at the board even more acute she says for example quote take the reported explosion authority send a negotiators are considering that polls would alow for officials to expel migrant without asylum screenings that may be appear to be an affected the turns measure but similar asylum restrictions have proved otherwise that of course is false title forty two which is what will we were using in order just get people off the border its highly successful in preventing more people from crossing the boarder illegally instead she is claiming that we should incentivize people to seek asylum at our ports of entry and expedite asylum clams we should wide in the noel to allow more legal immigrants into the country this of course they lady who was in fact an advice two hoiden on immigration policy a jobidon bad government is going to have big indicant ramifications for his own reelect hopes in just one second we will get to exactly what that means in terms of the midleleest because there

have time to make the right choice which is stop these reckless attacks but you have not made clear what exactly the consequences will be if they do not do that and again if you are that who these all you have to do is survive this to here is john curly trying to explain what the hell were doing git hat we o idea no matter what e mi day nothing do it a a the do ending ting in the re an no matter what i day a e not going a i the i israel an no it i the day i an men o canamedian way nothing to do with it why i do not the we need to by copies that one a we do have an i i not thing cone we rely

middle's thus prolonging the possibility of this thing widening and ask late meanwhile jobidon quietly attempting to walk back his idiotic policy from twenty twenty one in which he enlisted the who these is a terror group according to jack heinrick wish reporting four fox news shut sources telex the it administration is expected to re designate to who these is a terrorist organization officials have not gets at if the groupwill be placed under the same designation but sources hellbox there a number of sanctions options that can be used in lieu of a formal ratio finding which can take a long time to complete again they are now having to walk back their dumb ask policy with regard to ran and same way they earlier in the administration and o walk back their due as policy with regard to the sorties meanwhile the aronians by the way are now attacking targets and pakistan of you think that this breshime is not attempting the stabilize anything within racket range you're totally wrong according to writers pakistan had neighboring on has now violated it is aerospace resulting in the death of two children a hours after ocean state me dyes ad missiles targeted two bases of militant

following countries and areas arch serial lebanon northern israel southern israel the gasastreb the red a and pakistan that is aulic right now ism not talking bout of the course last three years ism talking about in the last three days at shall does that seem a successful containment policy to you war might it be that the united states should say to israel do you have to do it t against comas and that the united states they have aft twenty twos and a thirty fives guys me won actually devastate the ability of the withies to do what they are doing in the red sea we might want to make clear to hesballa the west that if you guys get to a little bit two much on the northern border of israel that we will allow israel to do what it needs to do on the northern border as well again that the threat of force is what keeps people in line the miles the fact that this administration continues to try to play this middle game is stupid it is idiot otic and it is predicated and again false notions of these centrality of these rely palcinian conflict you may have noticed that in that whole disquisition that i just gape with regard to iron very bunch of countries that have literally nothing to dowiththe palcinians here is om out the reds your talking about rock an syria and your tongue out pakistan do any of those places have to do particularly with israel and palcinians the answer of course is no but for a long time in foreign policy circles there has benthic idiotic notion that central to all conflict in the iddleastes these daily palsinian issue as though if israel and the palcinians came to some sort of agreement iron would calm down and everything would be all better that of course is a lie it is not trout that is what jakesullivan is now preaching mean here he we go jakes i mean is here is haw due jaksullivan is and batted his job take mulligan literally had a piece in foreign affairs magazine it was written before october seventh and it came out the week after and in the prince addition it suggested that gas had never ben more peaceful that is how badge mulligan is at his job and this is the god who is now to dining middlelese policies you wonder why donate trump has a shot even against the rigors to be the answer is because if you are bad enough for your job it turns out the america people do not it very much veliger saying is that the fellow of o the a mama cops was to bring in i we were to bring in the rain that i with have been also a the basis we that would have to be a political solution a also were this we a would have to all netistate solution yes in fact when present began price minister kenya who spoke in the weeks of months leading up to october seventh this was a a topic of discussion how where did the paltiniins fit in to a broader vision for israel integration into the region in normalization with air obstacle the basic recipe which is piece between israel and its air of neighbors ah a to state solution with israel security guarantor these pieces are not am no in a way operating and completely separate sperm they're plankton connected they were before october seventh they remain link to day and there something the were going to have to continue again the very fact the jakesullivan is suggesting that if israel had somehow made more concessions to the palicinians that for example octobers seven never would of happen an piece would broken own middeleastis totally insane its totalling'st imine first pals totaling hand the even having a conversation the aftermath of the largest murder mass murder of news since the holiest about making concessions to the governments that support the mass murderers that is totally insane but again the entireforn policy of this ad ministration is totally insane and meanwhile again in the middle of all of this talk about concessions that the west can somehow make or how much cared the assistitake with the who the in the middle of all this we now have more and more ports there emerging from israel from the people who are held hostage by mamas and they are just as awful as you thought they would be there is a piece over at berry white's free press by a young

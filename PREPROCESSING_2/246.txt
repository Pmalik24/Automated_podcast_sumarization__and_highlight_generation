a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in today episode of the so if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our weight this america life dot o work to getting kind of old in my family and when we get together for the holidays there is never any drama any more used to be i avoided coming him for years all through my twenties in early thirties cause my parents and i were not getting long well pardon poem was me and my early twenties i was a harsh and judge and said lots of things it now i went at and never apologize for but parade h bomb with them they did not agree with most of my big life choices starting with and especially the fact that i worked in public radio during that period i was working for the empire news shows all things considered morning addition and my parents were completely against it i said this before it my parents hated when i say this but my parents are the only news in america who do not public radio the stories were too long it seems second rate to them if i wanted to be a journalist why was not i own to why ways i settling for this place that paid me little the money was a huge thing my get is an accountant does all our tax is and he knew what i made and could not quite believe it i would still are a good living somewhere i cut still be a doctor coming home for the holidays sometimes i dad would pony aside sometimes you would bring it up during dinner at a crowded table should not i quit these jobs i love and finally going to medschol it is not too late my parents pleated with me well into my thirties my mam officially cannot half joking half serious gave up the effort when i was forty one and hade been hosting this mirk en li for five years but for long my dad especially would express his love and concern for me when i came home by questioning the basics where i lived how i lived how i dressed how my heroine who i fell in love with why was not i more of his success to declare he was not mean he was not angry he was just very very concerned my sisters bandying care they got their own versions o this holidays yet things to get very tens which just to say we were a normal family but now it could not be more different my mam died over a doctor go my dad's in his cities an the last couple years he is had a lot of hearing loss it is harder in tract with him he is not the critical questioning man he once was i got home now a nothing's bothering him about me they needs to get off his chest he is been trained over the years to say i love you when we talk on the one or see each other and he actually seems to mean it he is lovely but i am not used to this milder gentle reversion of the overworked stressed out dad that i grow up with it is that guy oh dissolved away that whole side of his personality leaving another man standing there and i have to say is his bed to admit some t times i miss that other guide i go home for the holidays and it is chill and everybody gets along and i never thought i say this i swear i never thought these words would come out of my mouth i wish he would pick a fight with me i feel that is my real do that is elderly guide with the same name who likes and accepts the person that ism in love with and in fact notices if she else o glasses in the dining room that helpfully brings them to her in the kitchen just to be nice that guy he is awesome but where is my real dad and this be of going home for the holidays and not having anything to fight about at all i been are our lives over are we already dead that is it we are done no fighting are we really a family any more to day in our program we have families boisterously noisily getting into it with each other kid's coming home with important stuff ley been wearing to get off their chests parents showing up at their grown children houses with demands that absolutely need to be met id then let the games begin but the holidays it is a family get together episode of our show including a song s n good family then that either is or is not e failed critique of one family member in particular en i you be easy chico is this america life an my recast stay with us the wan how do i say this i begin to day with somebody returning to the family in the suburbs out in the far west in canada an calamari a burka and she is returning with a mission something show needed to discuss in english though the thing you wonder to discuss was a different language entirely person doing this is sat she call nine months ago after twenty eight years of being alive i finally started taking handy classes my parents are both from india and they emigrated to canada long before i was born they speak in number of languages including handy and their mother tongues many but there is no real text book or organized class or do a lingo programmed for rakish many handy proved to be the easiest one for me to learn ism not enjoying these lessons have set a lot in last several times that i hate it i hate it because it is hard harder than i expected because for some reason i thought this language would come naturally and yet for two hours every week i meet my teacher and fellow class me at a coffee shock in ma time and hasten and learn how to greet some one and tell them what i am presently eating and that the cat is sitting in the big chair sometimes the cat is sitting on the little chair learning to say that has cost me one thousand one hundred and fifty dollars thus a i pertained these lessons on a lam i knew for years that i wanted to do it but i did not give much thought us to why i assumes my parents would be happy about it not even just happy await my at has said to me more than once you are barely recognizable when he says it he means ism not recognizable to him as the person the wanted me to be the persons who would never for example have married a white man much older than she is or refused a career in medicine or smoked at least ate hundred cigarettes but i do not know if my learning him the even matters to my parents or how much i also do not know why they never made me learned in the first place i went home to find out he the something by tidy ya day here is a for of i satin feature tastes when i visit my parents we do not usually do much more than sit together in the living room an alternate between joking infighting ere algin door cats e i recently got the manual home foolishly thinking they delight in being able to boss it around they have had it for a day and have been characteristically hostile to it dog o that song ya you a bus she did not say she was buzz she said she was buggy what is than she has a bug my parents have long converted my childhood bedroom into a sorry storage facility but its still home there is nothing more comforting to me than my mam accusing in inanimate object of being against her the few it is because i keep deeding the by gan end dis's bewigged when the gugolhome fails to play the devotional song my mom reckless she curses at it and i finally recognize one of the finish many words i know for my childhood e that will not you tat pay it that as my mam said is her saying that she hopes lightening hits the gull home the insults my parents use are the part of their language i absolutely know i can help you call some only dumb loud annoying rude ugly but the one i know best is that you say when you are mad or shocked or when some one's cooking is excellent you just cannot help but want them to get hip by lightning my doubt eventually gives up on trying to teach the guggohom fishery and settles on something she knows hegira the frank a not a we a o the pleased to no she is a robot i mean it is nice butts not necessary my mean man is i should have a cigarette and aviski on n a smoking neck ten in the morning dean in ton later that night my manhole the party for my brothers fortieth birthday and she is cooked her usual dinner parting spread the male rogenjo but the each dripping in oil it happy wet wyethank you i have all these questions for my parents but first i want to talk to my brother the only other person in the world who understands what ism getting myself into i call my brother ayah meaning older brother he is twelve years older than me and was born in india cashmere is his first language and though he understands it when its spoken to him he lost the ability to speak at himself soon after he moved to canada as a toddler he does not remember any one trying to get him to speak is many instead of english but nobody said anything to me or may be they did i just said i sone which threes company thank you very much that is how my brother learned ingulash we runs of three's company consequently he has a very complex understanding of tenant protection rights my brother firms one thing i remember to be true when we were kids it was deeply uncool to speak hin the orkishmary we knew lots of india kids who spoke their parents language they were dutiful good polite o was saying yes any hands but we also knew that those kids were fuck and dorks and worthy of our ire we were never dutiful back then i envied my brother he is fair scanned with angular features an a fanatic name he could always hide in plain sight i used to wish i could do the same my brother is married he lives twenty minutes away for my parents and he has a nine year old daughter that i call raisin she is the best person in the world raisin is by tracheal her mother as white and she is light skinned with bright blue eyes she does not speak indierkish many but the exception of naming her favorite foods and even though my brother could do something about her slim language skills he has not why have not you put her in those classes she does not but she is nicsont do anything i don't she wants to wash er but but i do not want a i also do not and superlazy it is the the reality is driving to the wonder it e thirty on a sundae that is not can happen i can barely get her to corral something she is interested as for my brother he is not likely to sign up for u class himself despite having the urge just i do do i think about practicing ye all the time but i just do not i do not because our parents are merciless when ye try to learn something been on interested giving them more foster for jokes what do you mean that there merciless about men who ever tried to speak a language that they know in front of them yet ye a had yet exactly i say it is a spicy experience that does mean anything to me but don't we do you think that we turned out the way he wanted that he we know no i shindig at all if we did not turn out the way our a d wanted us to well my dad bears a lot of responsibility for that for one thing instead of forcing us to learn handy he made us learn french why instead of making me take handy class is that the temple did you decide oh i know ism hang to put them in french immerse an for some reason as a can id is a biding good country and i was hoping that the the a handy would come automatically because am at home and a the indies my at as loquacious and my and thinks he is the smartest person in the room he is also stubborn is how and am i which means were often trying to murder each other after i first got together with the man who had become my husband the way older whitey my at in talk to me for a year when i first ask him how he feels about me taking these classes he is his typicalself dismissive and led what did you think when i started taking the handy classes i was amused since you do whatever you want to do wit out made a good what of that mean i do whatever i want to do because you are at city independent mind you t piston you not a end an instruction a anything i was glad that at least you are doing something for you a betterment because i said having knowledge of another language can neverhood you do not be fooled by his detached attitude about weather i speak bendy he has other feelings as well depending on the day he used to get upset about it when i was younger sometimes he would speak to me in kish many and quickly get frustrated that i could barely understand it and could not respond he gave that up after i moved out whet ever since i started my handy classes he is trying again now when i call my mother he will barge into our calls and demand that she speak to me in india kish many i had to ask him the same question over and over again before he finally admits that yes he is absolutely thrilled at the idea of me learning handy ane wholly ye one day you will convert with the somebody in handy and you should go india it'll go with you but let you indeed that you can speak with devilries a id y curies a shop keepers and tried to haggle the them in handy i bet ate relatives my wonderful were you surprise that i started taking lesson ye i was because you were not you kids for extremely white washed maybe i i i had something do there i did not purposely do that exactly what my doubt had to do with that gas all the way back to his arrival in canada this is whom y dad was when me and my brother were kids a hundred and twenty five pounds five foot four ambitious and working hard as ha farm critical represented it was also we would eventually have all you could ever want house two cars a yard university educations we were middle class in canada all with traditional hind names it was the india dream we did not have much family near us in calvary i did not go to school with any other brown kids until i was well into high school my brother and cousin spoke to each other and me in english my father had this idea that we would pick up handy at home but that is ridiculous my p aren't so kish many in english handy was reserved for belly wood movies and when my momneeded to speak to her jeweler what form of osmosis is my dot even talking about i thought them that the language mother ton specifically would cometolaten on an the i should concentration i you being only stimulated id the the madman to her if you will but or that cullis but somehow i i i should have tested some sort of in so such her you would be you would learn and em be at least sufficient in o e languages in in tingle takes wo why did not you make me take let sons for either hin their kishmeri i do not i know why i out to have don it si do not think my dot is equipped to directly talk about how hard it was to leave india my mam can talk about her sadness easily as if all those feelings are right at the surface of her skin waiting to lead out of her and drown me the had to say good my him may dad and my mother that mas may hart any very hat my dad was the family sol bred winter and in her early days in canada my mother was alone lot with my brother just a toddler she noticed he was losing his kushmary three or four months after they arrived and an mi would talk to him and kish me and hin on sudenein than we consist he is not word to say anything back now and i would push him an sain kish me and he ho staining she would not say she then why did not you push him to keep it up wet how can you make him to o push how can you make him to speak when beta got a little older my mother and father considered signing him up for handy classes and it turns out their reason for not doing as the exact sane practical yet lazy one my big brother gives about raisin parasite to sundae in morning i i do not want to get at a get o'clock and take him to him the school that was don to we gas i the schools that is what the a s sundaes tony day and i ham a dead and i was not that confident driving that time on the dead but tin winter done that is o tell a pat my mother says that years later they actually put me in handy classes i was mad be five then she says that it'd wander out of class which was held in the basement of her mother and would trot up the stairs to find her aether remember this at all they stop trying to forest at the time ism sure i was thrilled that they left it alone i pushed against brownness in every way i could i recoiled when my white friends would call and over hear my parents speaking cashmere in the background i did not want to invite them over because they could smell sandalwood in the curtains i resented my in pronounceable first name and passively let peopled call me sash or para or scratch nor sushi or whatever examples of lentil rases and were permeating my life beau disappointed than i cannot speak kishmryin i cannot speak windy i would not sit d disappointing but she f sad that it would have me nice because sometimes we my if i want to dell you something and i have to jefe the mangy i loses its what i want delyou that him i do estates i she could understand what ism tying to deal that sometimes i could see my my struggling to find the right word to convey the right feeling as she always felt a gap between which she wanted to tell me and what i was able to grasp when i moved away for university i worried my mom would be lonely i resented that i worried about her but i wandered who my mom would talk to when i left home i never considered that maybe the language we were speaking left her feeling lonely before i even moved away t did you want me and be a to a simulate in canada yet did we assimilate too mut well even say yes at no to tat it would have been nice you for lie i stay do towards yod he i toast calces ut i guess it was suppose to happen and i think i can do about it this idea from both of my parents makes me nuts of course there is something she could have done about it i know that my parents made the best choices they had at the time now though i feel i missed out on something that i desperately want i wish i could a spoken to your ma'am when she was alive i wish that to mean did that did she say anything to you about that that she could not speak to her grandchildren i she use to cry and my and she e i i cannot speak to them and they do not understand me and er i wish i could take to bit it was it was hard twas she that and you is could not take to hat she would have been old a i those jest few woulds no is a on o does not mat i tin lots of course there is something else there is always something else what are re making for course it you want to we ho we green means a ye cooking is the only place where i do not know the english equivalency of most words evidenced by how many times i go to the grocery store and ask for am ruth or a light she and struggle to name it in english in the kitchen my pronunciation is flawless and for once i do not feel a fraud when i spoke an hin the rakish many when i was a kid i would not even let my compact me india food for lunch but no one wants to be different in a great school cafeteria it as then i moved away for university and i realized all i wanted was my mom's cooking i wanted her to braid my hair and rub my back and wax my mustache off for me all these blips of intimacy with her i once had i been learning how to make her food ever since i been always turn out word hat no they get to salt did you e waoaoful i handle after a few months of lessons is finally good n that i can have slivers of conversations with my parents recently they visited me in new york and on a walk with my husband barely two feet ahead of us my mother told me in hinny your husband has no but one day my parents will die and when not happens will all forget the insults and the sounds ad the way my minerals her ours i cannot even imagine how only ill be without our sounds me best will heart less if i learn how to make these sounds on my own for now ism still stumbling over how to say i love you to my mother an her mother tong en he ma chest si me me check visa why do let it quash push gotten me check sad butt cushcutan e checks a but on come you my mim now tells me constantly how proud she is that i am trying to learn filthy more than anything that is what keeps me going to class sick cold stories about culture for use news and she is also the author of a collection of essays one day will ell be dead and none of thistle matter be say it son seen con when everyone e son it so coming out they did not mean it they really did not mean it they really really did not mean it a made as where they say mother and daughter and the song thy chose to sing at a very significant family event that in a minute from chico bob radio when our program continues tosmaric on li from my glass e we con a person of cystitis a theme bring you different kinds of stories on that theme to day show too close to how for the holidays stories of family get together were somebody shows up with something they think the entire family has to deal with rug's discuss and they rated to forced the issue we have arrived at at two of our programmed a two you probably think this song is about you in this act two family members show up with a message the messages contained in a song which make sense as the family goods bunch of musicians the dad in this family is lawman wainwright the third song waters started putting out albums in e nineteen seventies he is father two sing er songwriters ruffs wainwright and maltha wainwright and with ha different mom lucky wainwright roach luck's mamma says my broch you got some notoriety in the band the roaches lucky and says he came into the studio to tell the story of this song we sang this one actually at tat one of my dad's weddings to be precise her dad lawman at got married for the second time and this was a party to celebrate it may be fifty people lucky went with her mam says he who never been married to and but they were together for years and a he asked us if we wanted to sing something and we said up and then he was a cable you do not pick whatever you feeling singing and surprise us and we would been learning the song that was a cover song that we just really liked and sometimes wen you are learning a new song you cant have a little crush on the songs we just when as sing it all the time and we were likely just do that that new one that we have been learning and we we we just don't really think it through yet i would say that that is an under statement do not know what we were thinking i mean at it was one of those kind of situations where you are standing in front of room full of people and they all have the champagne glasses and their looking at you smiling and you start to sing the song and an i just imagine that you're at a wedding and and yet s yours are going to sing and you got your champagne and and then and then this happens i that is gets through the song n nodes far ton y t seniyoen ain an as son lo or ha all that time ten thin ataplasan any son ow look at this point what are they thinking i feel i as soon as you sing just yes fado people think oh oh we are talking about that i bet more than anything they felt what is happening right now we is the was is a message it is he slightly hostile thing to sing at your father's wedding or your excess wedding but we were thinking we j see are seminar and basically concentrating on playing it because i did not you do not know what that well i think of going do not you lnanyota yoke a you know the clan a sways yours o si an an in anna a ta ut you on sane gan gaaawhat do you think people thought at that point i think that is the most clingy fine in the song in this contest beseems to me some fine things have been laid upon your table and you only once once that you cannot get i mean that seems rude you do not often here a wedding toast that says lake and what i love about him is lucky you he never once the things he can get that is not n tow i have not heard that a nor i think that is the low point of what we have done here that that is go into the next first oh you are not getting no younger right this is the we say this the second to worst whine of the song yes fro allay an you you tan an gonna draaaain you and the a ta u sing to your gs ans again the o so how do you think people might have hard that a what's sad that is sad it is sad now the mind you are not get no younger hold was your dead ye old yo was not getting any younger your singing this and you are looking around at the face is what dare you saying did not feeling it was the most well received we thing we would ever yet ye i mean there was a kind of a feeling of being looked at without a lot of expression which is sometimes not a great son i think they were probably thinking i thought that i think a lot when something happens that is uncomfortable and when something that has happening like just make the right kind of face waste a rye i just make sure your face is right i mean the the truth of it is that nobody has ever mentioned it again to us to the stay yet what did he say afterwards nothing do he say thank you no not really now the horrible thing about this is that people must have felt we were doing something passive aggressive or aggressive made and and the sad thing is we were completely oblivious and i know that that probably sounds maybe it is not true and unconsciously we had some sort of thing we were doing perhaps but it did not feel that at all but i think then after that couple years later when we first perform the song in a show i might have said to the audience for the first time oh actually we sang this once my dad's wedding and then the the absurdity of that really hid us right in and also the song kind of turns into a comedy instead of the beautiful song that it is but here i recording from one of those concerts yes o an s it is wear that you can get a song is places comedy i mean people get hysterical when they hear it in that context which makes it obvious that there was something strange about it now it seem som to we ta bet you e oo tin gan gee in o yo youth here is the other thing about it i do not know i should say this but i mean on the one hand it is a terrible thing to sing it a wedding and at that wedding but on the other hand it is kind of the perfect thing to sing at that wad i know an yo mean it is the perfect entertain well well because you are basically saith lyrics if you really study them a basically saying you have got to let somebody love you you saying unconsciously maybe it was the perfect pick for the wedding right ism starting to change my mind on this whole thing and say id that yes of course we meant to sing this song ism not and i see what it is actually saying what it says to me if there is a subconscious message that we were aiming at loud n or ell speak for myself me is just i see you i see what you have been true and i see your pain and and we were happy for you that you found somebody to be with says lucky rough the version desperado s on their alba mud an apples luck's most recent atomic little beast i did by the way check with laden sadesacs and luck's dad to see what he thought about desperado as their trace of sang at the party since they really had no idea at all and mot know me the deaf and only remembered it oh yes yes i remember thinking it was hilariously funny and and the ironic and i thought it was a kind of really ironic cool choice of a song to do you mothers lose y father slims smother zuuvother pass back and fort between those two unto they had enough of you anoa on the comes along b this him somethings go away a into freely it is overly therein to d she'll get ta

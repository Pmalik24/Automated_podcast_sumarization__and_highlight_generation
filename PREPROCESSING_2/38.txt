jobidons h legal immigration crisis is real and it is really really growing take a look at this graphic from the new york times website is from to day about border in counters in twenty twenty three this is absolutely stunning hour go through it in detail because it definitely shows just how open jobidon has left the border soon twenty twenty three again this according to you s customs and border protection there were three point one million attempted border crossings at the u s southern border in twenty twenty threes the question becomes one what is driving that and two how many of the people got in and it is question to then answers question one if lots of people are strung up the border and lots people oar getting in that of course is going to drive more people to the borders yet three point one in people showing up again at the southern border and here is how this breakdown six hundred thousand of those people entered undetected that is an estimate a by c b p those would be the known roadways now there's a whole category were that is not even on the chart those wo be the unknown roadways who we really have an idea of how many unknown roadways there are the way the we know the known roadways is because there is camera coverage of large swathes of the america border but we do not always have bore patrol agents where sitting on every single camera all the time the way that it works that you have these border cameras an there loaded on to essentially giant pylons and there re four of them pointed in all directions but if you have one border patrol agent whose in charge of twenty cameras the con be some people he does not see when they rush into the country goes for fathom break and suddenly that is when someday comes through that according to people i know accustoms and border protection what you are really looking at is probably another four hundred thousand people who have entered undetected minimums you going about a million people who have entered on detectives in twenty twenty three alone ka now that still leaves twopoint five million people who had in counters with you have customs in border protection out the way we ten to think of that and this is why a lot of this is weasel words when you think em in counters by u s customs and word protection what you think of is a bore patrol agents stumbles upon legal immigrant and tells the to go home wrong that never happens almost ever a now used to happen a lot more under title forty two title forty two what a provision of federal law that suggested that if you were fearful that people are entering the country with disease you could simply turn them back at the border and that was used for several years in the afterheat of cove nineteen but it did end even in twenty twenty three there are five hundred sixty five thousand people were expelled under title forty two five hundred sixty five thousand people those effectively speaking were the only people who were expelled yet about a hundred eighty thousand people ere voluntary departures and a hundred eight five thousand people were expedited removals those who be people who had criminal backgrounds for example the total number of people out three pen one million who received the deportation or or who were expelled eight hundred seventy thousand but remember till forty two has now gone away that means five hundred sixty thousand people this year in twenty twenty four if these numbers wore to remain study would now enter the united states that mean that aside from title forty two which again was only in a it was only in application temporarily under title forty two five hundred six five thousand people are turned away all those people would now enter which means a grand total of three hundred sixty five thousand people who are actually removed or departed voluntarily because for example they realized that they are going to be dinged on a coronal background tract now we get to the people who ere added to the docket and what happened to the rest of them of the people whore process under totally those one point nine million people only three hundred and sixty five thousand of those people were actually removed every other person entered the united states all of them that means that your talking about just from this chart alone two point for million people in twenty twenty three who entered the united states the vast majority of those people are here illegally they do not have asylum protected status refuge status that refuge or asylum status has to be proved in a quart of law but those people have not prove to anything in a sort of was instead they have come to the border they claim that they are in fact asleep from their home countries that they are our people who cannot go back because if they go back tho all be killed or they will be persecuted or whatever and then because we are not processing them and because me do process that our standards are two low we are allowing everybody into the country even a courting to this new york times chart you had a minimum of two point for million people who crossed the southern border in twenty twenty three now understand by way of contrast that during the intimate of the trump ad ministration the number of border in counters during the entirety of the trump ministration was one point sex million you had two point for million people enter pasture alone under jobidon that is it insane number an none the people gone away one people are brought into the united states in there given date shop later toast majority of them never gan a show up later because why would thy possibly show up they ben integrated into america society they are receiving whatever benefits they can receive there in californium actually real state benefits may be up to an including help care why exactly they show for court date where they made very well be deported if they cannot prove that they have a real asylum claim instead they just stay that is what jobiton has done and he has done that because there were executive orders in place under dona trump that prevented a lot of this not only title forty two but most prominently remain in mexico remain in medico said that if you showed up the border and you said i fear to go back to my home country the trump ad ministrations hat oke wait mexico will figure it out if the process bouneatowait in mexico which means you are not going to be releasing to the interior because there is good shot the you actually would have to show up for your quart cases and then you would be rejected and in the meantime he cantles disappear in chico or new york or tanto or denser or whatever but trident got rid of that they one that was on of the very first things that he did was get rid of remain in mexico that is the reason you are seeing this vast extraordinary increase and you legal immigration fatuous southern border it is amazing the impact of all of this is absolutely insane what is that impact well for example many illegal migrant are now arriving on the eastcoast to new york that they are being stored on football fields n the there is bad weather they have to be moved

learn from home because the school facilities had to be used to hows illegal emigrants pure somvidio inset just the legal emigrants to are in getting off a schools and they are being brought presumably directly into the school buildings and this is what school buildings are for now your public resources being used to house legal emigrants from foreign countries while kids ore told they're to stay how from school and lorn remote as though we are still in themidle of loved or as those schools should have ever been closed during covin according to the your post judges at bookman high school were kicked out of the classroom t make room for nearly two thousand migranswoere evacuated from a controversial tent shelter due to a monster storm closing in on the big apple the city made the move met concerns and massif migrant tent that flood been at field would collapse from torrential rains and gusting winds packing them instead it is the second for limit name's mats and high school five miles away a local resident who identified himself only as robs at that this is atop it is wlitmistass there using a storm a legitimate situation were the testing this out a guarantee the will be here for the entire summer there is nineteen hundred people getting thrown out into my neighborhood half a blockhmory live and o know they are they aren't vended a lot of them of criminal rack records and backgrounds we do not even know one mom went off on the migrants they pulled upsankuot how does it how you feels you does not feel good how de i feel o kicked all the kids out of school to marry to feel good hope if feel good i hope you sleep well to nigh a local dabster how d o you have feel stealing america tax pairbudy and i got toilet to certain extent don't blame the legal emigrants i blame the authorities why the hello the authorities not turning these people away if you were somebody who's coming from ta equator which is a disaster of a country and you are trying to go to a better place you algoid want to come to the united states but it is the responsibility of the america government to pataca america border rs a country without borders is obviously not a country what is in credible to me is how the left has completely forgotten about this it is totally insane in two thousand fifteen here is burn standers making the case that we should not have open borders hoping waters orbit ta wants us that is the cup of this proposal the idle corse i me that is the rite wing proposal which says the centrally there isn't can i it is let but if anybody the would make yo lo o to a for river wouldn't it din bake everybody in america porting doing away with with the console of an action time n i do not thing is any country on the work which believes in that no one believes that except for apparently large laws of the democratic party how is border patrol antipasto borer patrol has been told their first priority is that one some one claims asylum you us as a border patrol agent make direct for them beeline directly for them now recently went down to the border we can have a ton of material on this that is coming out en let me tell you the situation the border is a full scale disaster area border patrol agents are being told not to actually police the border they are essentially acting as a fairy service four legal emigrants which is why you now have the amazing spectacle of you legal migrants crossing the border and then sitting around and complaining hat the border patrol is not showing up fast enough you would complain if you share up in hotel and the bellman did not show fast enough here is siamang highlettin you legals from than a complaining about having to wait in the cold they rush towards us o i i mike not even on but that does not stop this crowd of chines migrants from vent produce r long song they are angry having to wait in the cold for border part i oo a on o as who were all sick we have been you three days now three makeshift border camps we stop at in eastern sandbag county alongside miens from satin america at each camp we doesn't from china have a question why would you possibly legally imigratua country and believe that it is the responsibility of border patrol to thousand worm you why in the answer obviously because the by administration is made clear that this is what they are going to do and by the way these illegal in runs are not wrong thebidin administration has in fact made clear to border patrol agents that their chief function now ninety per went of border patrol agents have been staff on essentially bussing and administrative duties at the border there is an actual sign in certain parts the border where you push a button for border patrol help ism not getting that is a real thing again we n have a tuna material it is coming out about this because it really is stunning what is happening at our southern border but the fact that jo bison has open theborder white is clear to literally every one now what is amazing is that democrat's continue to claim that that jobidoneis on top of this thing joining on top of anything join can barely get into a walk in shower at this point here is senator criscoons trying to pretend that it is the in unprecedented border crisis that's motivating biding to arrest the border crisis that of course untrue if join one intenser and the border crisis tomorrow he can probably do wit the couple of his decile borders he is not doing any of that there has to be aromatic action in stopping the flow of illegal em grad into this country yes and job a that view broadly is shared that weed and emigration system a that is safe that is human and that is legal and the numbers of folks who are presenting at the southern borders seeking asylum has motivated our president a both in his first state of the union a to call on congress to legislatively address this and given the powers he needs and in the supplemental package he has for months ago t as for billions of dollars to strengthen boarders security we disagreed but tween republicans and democrats about what policies we will most likely achieved that outcome but there is a broad awareness that the huge numbers of folks who are transiting central america and coming through mexico to our southern borders just not sustainable gat then why do not you stop it and the answer is what democrats want is they want more money for ad ministrative functions s just told you border patrol ninety per cent staffed on administrative functions they want more money for ad ministrative functions they want to be able to broad in the ability by legal immigrants to enter the country they do not want the border police to better and again the drug cat tells control the borders tail us should be clear about this this is not individual illegal immigrants where crossing thousands of miles by themselves through the snows through the they are paying coyotes they are paying medical drug cartels in order to get into america the industry here is enormous as here mention yesterday the medical drug car tells are making thirteen billion dollars a year just on trafficking human beings a cross america southern border the cartels or tit they speck out were on the border people should cross they know exactly where to drop people off they they learn drive up to up to the border in rocks literally they just drive up to the southern border in rocks his match covered country suborn patrol does not have the abilities simply cross the border and do anything they drive up in rocks loaded with hundreds eleglimigrants and then just drop them there that is the cartels and they are making money off tit and yet these democrats are trying to facilitate all of that gets more on this an just one second first let us say you want to be in also dad and watch the starworts move with your kids let us also say the sun is ploy your trying to wash revenge of the smith well because of all those reflections and glares on your toveescreen you have no idea who has the high ground and now you still think tar favor has all his arms and lies if you had a good set of

members the abominadministration this is crazy j johns who is the former d chasecretary under braguama he has said this is crazy seven rattier who served as councillor to the treasury secretary under the mama administration he has a piece over the near times to day talking about the situation at our southern boarder he says democrats want more money to process the backup republicans want substantially narrow the grounds how much migrant would be permitted to remain in the united states we need lots of the former and a bit of the later ah no actual we need a lot of the ladder and not nearly as much of the former he suggests that the democrats push for our funding is correct the country's immediate need is to in clog the emigration court system know that is not the immediate need the immediate need is to close the border and then figure out what the hell to do with the people here the problem is the unclog the court system that is going to facilitate more illegal entry if you unclog the system all that means is posting more people at the border now he saying that means that of get to more court cases faster at but ice is not the porting anybody people on show up for the court cases ice is not going to go into their houses and then pick them up and throw them out that is not something the yobinan has last ice with doing saying the we need more administrate of law judges where going to adjudicate whether some one has a true asylum claim or not unless they're going to do that within seventy two hours it are not on a happen an need e lay where people are released into the country is going to result and those people remaining in the country he says we must reduce the float to the border which will require making emigrating into the us by such means more difficult even rattier was as re publicans have long demanded and democrats are coming to see as necessary our obligation under international lot to provide asylum need not create chaos for starters we should require asylum secret talk play in mexico or other countries it is the remain a medical policy that trump at tempted to do and then biding basically killed also says rather we need to tighten he asylum criteria for example we should make a greater distinction in the asylum process between those who followed o established procedures and enter the country through n establish court ofventry and those who crossed along our border but tree between ports entry while no actually what you need to do is tighten up what it means to be a pursing who should receive asylum which fattener admits e says while recognizing the need for due process we should raise the legal standard for consideration for asylum from a significant possibility that asylum would be granted to something closer to the standard used for final decisions in emigration court we also we need to further limit use of humanitarian parole a prom them expanded by the bi administration that allows more migrants from placeliyke even is gala an nicaragua to temporarily enter the country and apply for relief as heartbreaking is maybe we simply cannot take every refuge from every failed state came all of that is true and where all f that stuff's that s allay atrurto that is exactly the bill l the democrats are currently rejecting all of its an nah a two democrats are currently rejecting it which means this is an ideological thing an jobidon could simply see in state the policies that dona trump had in place and the border flow would stop it would stop we did not have anything remotely this flow at the border under donaltrum it did not exist in anything remotely these numbers there is only one reason for that the only reason for that is now climb changing in is not discontent south of the border it is simply because jobidneis an open borders president in every single person knows it and is issue is going to bike join directly in the rear as it properly ought to and meanwhile more bad news for the began ministration with regard to the economy according to acids the global economy of the twenty twenties will be more bleak than the decade that proceeded it with sluggish economic activity less trade growth and crushing borrowing at close this the new warning from the world bank on tuesday morning they say the global economy far head its weakest performance in more than thirty years growth

continues we have now learned that laid listen he secretary of defend was dig notes with prostate cancer and did not tell the president for literally weeks according to politico doctors on tuesday discloses the reason the fen secretary laid stop as hospitalized on canary first was due to complications from a late remember surgery to treat postal cancer answering a major question involving the pentagon chest mysterious heltstituation but raising further issues with how the episode was handled this was announced yesterday by the pentagon press secretary major general patrol riders as the defend secretary's treated for postal cancer now we ware told his an elective surgery an elective surgery does not mean an unnecessary surgeries like an notesjob it just means the can elect the time to do it is not an emergency surgery but it seems if the secretary defend as a surgery for postal cancers rytllat somebody know here is the pentagon prosecretary announcing this this is a statement from doctor john magics aroma medical director and doctor gregory chestnut to center for prostate disease research of the mirth the center director at water read national military medical center in pathesta martian a beginning od the statement as part of secretary listens routinely recommended health screaming he has undergone regular prostate specific antigen p a surveillance changes in his laboratory evaluation and early remember twenty twenty three identified prostate cancer which required treatment on remember twenty second twenty twenty three after consultation with his medical team he was admitted to water read national military medical center and underwent a minimalyinvasive surgical procedure called t a prostate e to me to treat and cure prostate cancer an then he says that listen has taken responsibility for transparency issues while ism glad ism glad that what good good for you the go missing f a full week and nobody knows including your number too and love taken responsibility no usually responsibility comes with a resignation the department recognizes the understandable concerns expressed by the public congress in the newsmedia in terms of notification time lines and dot transparency i want a under score again the secretary listen has taken responsibility for the issues with transparency and the department is taking immediate steps improve our notification procedures i get well om why was the notification procedure not frame place this seems ice petty voice when why you need new notification procedures for ism getting prostate surgery and the number too should be aware of that shoos on vacation by the way abroad meanwhile john curly admitted yesterday the national surety spokes person he admitted yesterday the yobidon was informed yesterday about buster's prostate cancer the same as we were which is not gray the pentagon already talked about when the secretary was diagnose hi was early remember and as the statement ad in complication with his doctors elected you have the procedure don later in the month to consider with the holidays and as green rightly also says the president did not know about the diagnosis an more but is is reactions he wishes the secretary all the be er speedy recovery ow curly was asked ism do not just have a cribilig probensol let us just say that for example the at a president who seems to be in the throw of dementia why would we possibly believe anything you guides have to say about his health situation concerning the staff just when completely absent for wee all having prostate cans or surgery and told no one and no one even bother to note it inside the administration for week why people wand anything wo g and as ration colters about anything ever again i think we all recognize and i think the pension has been very very honest wit themselves about the the challenge to the credibility by what by what has transparent here by what and by ow how how hard it was ben in to be forty transparent with the merit be why get we all recognize that and and way not discommosacon now i know you get another one common here but but we all recognize that this did not unfold the way you would have on many rebels not just the notification possess up the panic command but the transparencies we all recognize that it well then why are there no consequences or assaults mean the fact that busting is still working there is pretty insane it is pretty crazy and it does raise the question is who is in charge whisper thought the adults were in charge was not the pitch the pitch was if you elect hoiden and notional trump you will not have this chaos any more the world will be a solid place we will go back to normal my normally be the new normal and instead what we get is the world on fire and economy in the midst of stagnation the greatestily liberation crisis of our lifetimes and a president whose wandering around into all's occasional was we get that is what we got that does not seem the world's most amazing pitch meanwhile things continue to heat up in the midlesom gan when the reasons things heat up in the mddleleast is because of a perception of weakness the middle's runs on perception of strength it is how the it e least runs it has always run this way this is not in a rent where good will is brought by pretty words that is not how any of this works and yet that seems to be precisely the policy that is being undertaken by the by demonstration there sending mine signals all the time on the one hand they are providing support toe israel on the other hand they are riding israel for trying to win a war on the one hand they are saying that they are gone you prevent who the attacks on shipping on the other hand there cannot letting the who these attack the shipping and then issuing strongly worded statements which is it because it turns out the reception of confusion on the other side leads to a belief by baron's proxies that they can do what they want in the region and that is raising the temperature dramatically according to the washington post duo disagreements between the united states in israel over the jewfish states treatment of palistinians emerged thing secretary of state any blincon's visit to israel on tuesday as leaders aria e posing views over when palistinians can return to northern fossa and receive tax revenue collected by israel blink told reporters these are their revenues they should have them who are they who are they by what mechanism will these tax revenues be dispersed they doubt youth big question the where is the money go it is not as though israel drops a helicopter filled with money over the gossostrip or over giving the money will have to go somewhere presumably it would go to the distributing authority an goes still comes which is still presiding over there where are the concoct palstinan taxmonygoo go to fat the military wing of the palcinian authority the placing authority is literally paying the families of people who murdered people on october seventh why should israel give money to that group than these are the mixed signals we at to more in just one second first the benshuppurosho is supported by grand canyon university and a portable private christian university with a vibrant campus in beautiful phoenix arizona ragtop twenty in the country by nice dot come g c u is omission

bachelor's masters or doctoral degree they support from your own university councillor welshing a personalized approach to helping you achieve your gold find your purpose at grand canyon university private christian affordable is e g c daddy to you to day on the one hand you have twenty blinkonsaing the correct thing that compass could have ended this october eighth simply by surrendering and giving up the hostages and they did not hear as blinking saying the right thing an then we will see blinking an many of the wrong things think it is very important to remember that everyone has voices to make and that include som ass homos could have ended this october eighth by not hiding behind civilians by putting down its weapons by surrendering by releasing the hostages none of the suffering none of the suffering would have happened is mamas haven't done did did what it did on october seventh and had it made different decisions thereafter case o that happens to be correct but then on the other hand is trying to hold israel arms behind it is back he suggested yesterday that the big promise that israel is some halitaking steps under cutting palstinins ability to govern themselves effectively om i have a question when have palistinians ever govern themselves effectively name a time any time ruler ruler this crisis is clarified you cannot have one without the other and you cant have either go without an integrated regional approach to make this possible israel must be a pardner to palistining leaders wore willing to leave their people in living side by side in piece wit israel and as neighbors and israel must be at must tot taking stats under cut paintings ability to govern themselves effectively can a settle violence carried out with impunity settlement expansion demolitions of fictions all make it harder not easier israel god cheer lasting piece insecurity hate is absolute stupidity is a stupidity hand what he is saying at the being of that queller says the goals are trainable together what are the goals one would be peace with the palstonians in the other of be piece of the surrounding arab states is going back to the old john carry line that the only way to achieve pie in the region is to make concessions to derris groups which of course is a lie and the opposite of the truth israel was able to engage in the graham l cords under the trump administration because the trumped ministration made clear that economic times with israel in no way depended on israel making concessions to say the palistonian authority when hes suggests to what is under cutting palistonian self governments is for example settlement expansion why why have a question why is building an extra bedrooment of out what is that of anything to do with the fact that there has not been in election inside palistonian governed areas for nearly two decades explain sure sell here why i want her why it is that israel allowing for example the expansion of evade dance is somehow impacting the fact that the palistonians refuse to elect governments that actually pick up the trash please explain please explain how israel completely abandoning the gossip trip re moving eight thousand news from the gossaistrip no settlement that toy nothing happening there complete self governments by compass why exactly did that not result in something beautiful was that also because o israel lice this is also stupid but again the reason that he is sending these mix signals is in the hopes that somehow that is going to buy the love of the egyptians or the saltines he is completely misreading the room the egyptians and the sorties do not believe that the palistonians are capable of moderation or self governments why they believe that you know i know they believe that they will not take any palistonian refuges none and one of the big questions here that the united states keeps rasing his now their members of the israel government was said that they want palistonians to leave gossip say forget about that for a second because sitting ow who says he is not con to do that let us talk instead about the fact that if you were living in gosh might you want to leave it might you want to not a grip place to live haven't a replace if for very long time not lot of people moving to gosh not tones of people were or have even before all of this where you nowhere it'd love to live under the auspices of comas in goa what if people want to leave well egypt will not take them south will not take them jordan will not take them no one will take them why do you think that is why do yo thing that is could it be because historically speak palistnian populations havebeen a stabilizing force in every region where they have entered and could that be because they are extremely polarized could it be because the palistonian population itself is extremely extremely radical and that is not mean that if is a terrorist does not mean peoples are to be killed what it does mean is that if you are going to access is security situation the mdaeleast with out that factor you're completely missing the deciding factor on this issue you're saying that israel can only make some sort of peace with tasty arabia for example by somehow making concessions two governments that dick to totally rule radical populations i don't understand the logic there does not me any sense at all but it's those make signals that are being red in the region and iron is reading that which is heron continues to push a on in is not rationing things down a on is ratcheting things up why is a on scan continue to poke an continue to prod until there slapped across the head by somebody t when require the united states to don't put invade iron wen require a full skill worthron and would require for example killing muncher withies along the coasting gammon to stop them from holding up global shipping which is something the united states actually does have a pretty strong direct interest in but t aby he mistress refuses to do any of that and meanwhile the question becomes on the other side of the isle cans oral true take advantage of all of this was or is he get create a grease fire here on the stove of his own well get's that in a second first you may have noticed that we at the dailyware we biology because biology says they are only two sexes were not afraid to say it but some of our loyal customers points out a flaw in our terms shop we only getter to one of the sexes o jerky's razors is all about equal opportunity to shop the woke free economy and that is why we have jerky's razors for the ladies because women deserve the same quality woke free blades as men two sexes two razors is really is that simple when god makes a new see jemmies will make a new razor plus we have a line of personal care products or a better haves including moisturizing shave cream lotion bodywash and deodorant ladies had over t jerky's razors thought tom get your razor and personal care products to day o cam meanwhile now gain you would imagine that all of this would provide folder fradonald trump run now let us be clear don try isn't get the nominate there are some poles out of for example new samphire that are showing nickel half in pretty solid position in new samphire to possibly win that state of chis christy it it is hilariusom in that cries christy continues to pretend that he is a person in this race and you on talk about somebody who has an ego problem ism not sure there is ever been a politician cries christy who literally just stays in races to alow the person he claims to be the greatest threats of the republican party to win be chis christy being in the rain new samphire is unbelievably insane i cannot even explain how do that is mean in new samphire right now the latest pulling in new samphire from see an end and university new samphire shows trump up thirty nine thirty two on hailed that is spitting distance and chis christy is pulling twelve per cent why is chis christy in this race i love that he is basically scritman ism staying in no matter what for no reason just to be a jackass the to a respect that you a it you a respect the play meanwhile in i by every available pole dona trump is way out ahead of the field according to most poles basically half into mantis are running neck and neck in swan now again i is not a direct pulling state i was a caucus state the fact that is camps has done a lot of heavy on the group lifting in i i think that means he out performs his pull numbers in i but right now obviously trump is up way ahead of the rest of the field when it comes to south caroling ism always surprise that they do not do more pulling of of south caroling is his kind of shocking to me but there has not actually been a lot of pulling of south caroling in the jeopenomination process the pulling tat there has been at this point shows trump well ahead of the field the latest pull average true five thirtyeight pass trump up at fifty two point nine per sent helve at twenty four into stances town a twelve point seven per cent way ahead of the rest of the field combined if daily would when new samphire youould expect to see a bit of an perch for but let us assume for the sake of argument be toasts were the stator the trump is the hominy well the reason trump would be the hominy and the reason that trump presumably would be a formidable challenger to jobidon is because again people look at twenty nineteen and thy look at twenty twenty three and they say twenty nineteen was better than twenty twenty three and most sane and rational people do not blame trump for bovid because how could yo possibly do that that they would be a weird thing to do came demon here he recently said that the reason the people are voting for trump is because the economy under dona trump was better i think we should stop an sulking o the side in club mama i i mention logically mane times it lot i people vote for present true not because they believe in his cham we nous but they look at son the things you did egg the name i hots right about and of the stand ort on he's right about point out about china i now he a right about that your some ablations do not clos pit about be that is while voting form i been the demo crash bel for thought full when the trunk about magic why i not in thin not don't acting eve my act ti bet of trump is not to be to not is just not try g he is right about all that it would make this lot easier as if trump it just talk about that again trump is the easiest campaign in the world his campaign involves looking donate southernland at the end of invasion of the body snatchers pointing at trobidon that is the entire campaign he is goes and that is it that is the campaign right look adage that is the campaign instead began in at the grease fire apparently trumps camp trying to claim that he has presidential immunity for everything involving canary sex that is a weird claim because again there is a difference between dona trumps our political aspirations and donate trumps public duties as president of the united states it the arguments the his lawyers are now being forced to make on behalf presidential unity are little weird according to the wallstry journal the legal reckoning for donate trump entered a critical stretch tuesday as a washington federal a public court signals it would reject the former president's claim he is immune from prosecution on chargers he plotted to overturn the twenty twenty lection out by the way this does not speak to the guilt or innocence here it does not peak o weather it is criminal to as shows a specious legal theory which is in my opinion what donate trump was doing for a couple of months there that is not criminal activity that just arguing really really due crap in a court which people do pretty frequently in this country as it turns out but putting that aside the presidential immunity they that trump is wanting four here is just bad it is not a good presidential immunity theory it is o he is suggesting apparently that he has immunity for literally everything he did while he was president of the united states in fact trump warrant of bedlam if he was denied immunity here he was explaining there a y temp join i you hae be join at i ass the a ta wan snot way got chess president as ne s there pancreas was s it is a ria thing i can wits all i elation when they are these democracy that tore re to ours ogasesoit is a threats democracy to remove him from ballast will inlay that is a threats democracy is not a threats democracy to say the president is not have immunity for literally everything he does while he is president of the united states the argument his lawyers are making is that the impeachment claws in the constitution requires that the president be impeach before he is criminally tried for any sort of offense and the judges were i really the question they asked was if the president of the united states for example ordered seal teem six to assassinate his political rivals could he then be charged on that without being impeached and trumps layers no he would bet have to be impeached a first which is a wild statement mean that that seems very very difficult the idea that that somehow the president could order the murder of his political rivals and immunity would still guard him for that murder domestic america political rivals first of all that would creates the that would cat the prospect very obviously and easily of the president of the united states let say for example here impeach and he had not yet been convicted by the senate or set i six to kill every one in the senate would vote for his conviction and now there is no one left to vote for his conviction and thus criminal conviction a again that this is this argument is not going to fly and court it is just nothing to s a trump is not going be in the problem is if we are taught every moment were talking about that sort of stuff were not talking about the fact that jobidon is an awful terrible very not good president and let us be real about this when it comes to the feeling of casts in the country it is not simply coming from trump a trumps fest argument is in facts an argument he is making which that the threats democracy is coming that the call it is coming from inside the house jobidon is the one whose claiming his opponents are insurrectionist and therefore theoretically out to be ban from ballots meanwhile we do live in a country where journalists routinely joke apparently about the assassination of donate trump caught on a hot mike yesterday dona trump was arriving and court on this particular case journalists were caught on a hot mite joking about donate trump being shot he oman e o me jam was destination how a we till o know who these journalists are by the i have a feeling that they will be exposed in probably lose their jobs over something that all of this obviously contributing to a feeling of great in ease among members of theamerican population on both sides calls have said before we have now set up a model by which violence is very likely to break out no matter who wins the election if tonal trump wins do you think democrats are to take that lying down or do you thin the they are going to claim that dictatorship is inevitable now man it is literally which lighten is arguing that the noises are in charge of gabion winds even if they down trump winds and in if for trump winds do you think that things will remain calm in the streets i think not meanwhile if jobidon winds at this point and does trump has been hit by his go jay in too separate jurisdictions in washington to s and florid do you think that that dona true supporters are going to take that lying down or is his case that he has been rigged out of the election again going to be a lot more credible this time at than it eves even was last time things in at very very nasty in the country which of courses is why the washington posed is rung pieces violent political threats surge as twenty twenty four begins haunting america democracy now the entire article is largely about the evils of dona from supporters but let us be clear the threats a violence are not coming from only one side of the isle the amount of a violence that is now being threaten against commonamerican citizens forget about public officials is really significant and is on o continue to rise because the feeling is that institutions have fail and as the feeling than institutions are failing grows in impact chaos comes in its way by the way there's not a uniquely america problem you are firing to see this literally all over the world there is a feeling that the institutions of government in many western country have failed large swaths of the population and people are beginning to take to the streets in response to big story that is been under covered by the media has been this huge farmer protest in berlin according o these some to rest farmers blocked highway access roads in parts of germany on money and snarl traffic elsewhere with their tractors launching a week of protest against the government plan to scrap tax breaks on deal used in agriculture chancellor all off shoals on popular three part position infuriated farmers last month by drawing up plans to a polish a car tax exemption for farming vehicles and deal tiebreaks those proposals were part of a package to fill a giant eighteen billion dollar whole in the twenty went for budget that home budget is really an invirimentalist whole in the budget here is what some of the pictures look a man easy it is insane me there snarling optic all of berlin there some the video wen very much he canada trucker's protest over the covenineteen shut downs in canada and your en to see the sort of stuff happening in western capitals all over the place the protests are under scrutiny after a group of farmers on thursday prevented the vice chancellor sober payback from disembarking of fairy an a small north seaport as you return from a personal trip to an offshore island that incident drew condemnation from both government and opposition figures as well as the farmers association there lot of people on the left in germany hard deeply worriedtha this is going to loose the right which of course it well mean that is exactly what happened by the wait in the netherlands all over rope therefore lots of farmers here saying lessen you have put your green dreams on our back you have said that we cannot harmony more you have put all sorts o restrictions on our use of nitrogen and the soil for example you have basically forced us to consolidate all of our farms and take out debt to do and the new prevented us from doing the farming this is what led to the giant dutch nitrogen crisis which is still rocking the country that is happening in germany it is happening in the netherlands as well no all of this is mom ours just part and parcel of a trader right righting uprising that is happening across the continent over in poland you have a true constitutional crisis that is breaking out as well poland has very weird kind of government structure you have the prime minister who has most o the power but of the president who has redo power and the ability to a prove governments and not a prove government you eldest have two separate costs the supreme court and the constitutional sort of justice in poland and the sort of covered different areas what turns out this division of power has led to the domination of one of those divisions by the right wing and one of those visions by a european integrationist party led by donate tusk well this in turn has led to a stand off between these two wings of the polish government according to politico in an dramatic ask collation of plane's battle to restore rule of law the police enter the country's presidential police on tuesday evening and took two maps into custody ho had been hiding under the protection of the president whose name is enrich dude after being sentence to prison arms for abuse of power you arrest cut to the hart of the fight between dude and the new primemanistr dona tusk who is seeking to unravel eight years of rule by the nationalist and conservative law and justice party judo is a line with pa s and sell s considerable ability to thwart tusks attempts at reform basically the re two convicted lawmakers who had ben given a pardon and tusk is now arguing that the pardon was no good and the president sang the pardon absolutely was good tutus as he pardon these two and twenty fifteen during their trial for using fix documents in an earlier attempting criminate colishan allies of law and just there re oping to destroy that smaller coalition party and then integral the members and apparently that failed the government below part in twenty seventeen pole supreme court ruled the presidential pardon was not effective because it wash granted before a final verdict in the case there are thing the camp preemptively grant pardon before somebody's been convicted in criminal court but the constitutional tribunal c of the other court which usually describes constitutionallistions they said that the pardon was in order n have a battle between the constitution a tribunal an the supremeport between the prime minister and the president in poland all of this because you basically have gridlock in poland over the future of the country the parliament of poland is by cameral but the lower house is called the same in spend ts e j m s pronounce same in in sere america and a the biggest party there is the law in justice party they still have a hundred ninety four out forhrnisixty seems in the parliament and they still dominate a lot of the proceeding you have this break down in plans yo break down in poland you have break down in germany you have break down in the netherlands you have break down in france as well one o the big probes in france right now is that manual my throne is deeply in popular the rising party is the nationalist party that is led by marine laden right now the open party is leading in the poland by a significant margin c corning two politico in rope my crone is looking to rejuvenate his troubled seconder aft for facing mass protests against pensions last year and banner descent within his own camp over an emigration bill which left his governing position badly brush my crones pick come is the president he e just pick the new prime ministers a thirty four year old guy and he passed over bunch members of his own party an or do creating real list content win than its on on coalition his pit comes the president curtly holds a thirty per cent approval rating his coalition trails the fright national valley by about ten points in european election poland france is about to turn tote rightsyof italy which is turned to the right if germany which is beginning to turn to the right and ye france which starting to tern t the right in fact this is leading to crisis calls and good inside the european parliament has he inside the european parliament there is a rise of bright wing parties this means that the head of the european parliaments liberals with the critically could crate sort of a center right coalition is outright refusing to work with any of the righting parties polls suggest the the current volition of conservative social democrats and liberals in the european parliament will cobbled together a majority but only just because right an parrot groups are surging in popularity the head of that liberal coalition who name is stepson a join he said we are risking an in governable rope it's quite real in terms of arithmetic seaborne is clothes with the manual my crone he said he will not agree to work with the far right in the next yeuropean parliament he refuse to line with the nationalist european conservatives and reforms group the car which contains the law in justice party as well as pans box party as well as presumably the national rally party in france began try to hold the enter good luck to that good luck and m again as all these institutions feel they have bid off more than they can who and they are failing and there aspirations for a green new world order are falling part

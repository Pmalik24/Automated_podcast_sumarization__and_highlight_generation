welcome to the superman latponcas s science science pace to for i mandrhubermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigrens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called gopmicrobiom and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to today's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues in organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to e element elements dotcam slash superman to day is the third episode and our series of episodes about physical and athletic skill performance and skill learning in general and today we are going to talk about the science of tools for fat loss and fat loss is something that interests a large number of people many people want to lose fat many people are athletes wo need to lose fat and in general we know that having body fat percentages that are too high is unhealthy for us and most people struggle to lose fat most people struggle to lose weight generally but most people especially struggle to lose body fat or what we call anapest tissue now this is a huge topic on the internet there is a lot of controversy today we are going to talk about some things related to fat loss and that are powerful for fat loss that ism guessing most of you have never heard about before you may have heard about a few of them but ism messing you have not heard about all of them this episode is going to be rich with science based tools that are gleaned from a variety of aspects of the literature including the use of cold including brown fat including something called age fat we are going to talk about something called neat we are going to talk about all sorts of aspects of fat loss that are governed by your nervous system and this is i think and important gap that is missing in the discussion about fat loss you can hear a lot of information out there about the role of things insulin and various diets erogenic diets are vegan diets or mediterranean diets and there some great stuff out there and there some really terrible information out there and there is a lot of controversy we did a number of episodes talking about the roll of hormones on metabolism end the role of food on mood and well being if you are interested in those topics please check them out i will touch a little bit on hormones to day things insolent and lept in just a little bit but today is episode is mainly going to be focussed on how the nervous system turns and some of the sell they collaborate with plea and macrophages how those in courage or cannon courage accelerated fat loss because it turns out they can remember your nervous system which includes your brain and your spinal cord and all the connections that they make with the organs of the body governs everything it is the on switch and the off switch for mine system it is the on switch and the off switch it turns out also for fat burning and the nervous system and the role of the brain and other neurons has been vastly overlooked in the discussion about losing fat now i would be remiss and it'd probably come under pretty considerable attack if i did not just acknowledge upfront a for truth of metabolic science and also of hero science frankly which is that c calories in verses calories out meaning how many calories you invest verses how many carries you burn is the fundamental and most important formula in this business of fat loss and weight management in general there is simply no way around the fact that if you invest far more calories than you burn your likely to gain weight and a good portion of that weight is likely to be adipose tissue fat it is also true that if you invest to your calories than you burn that you will lose weight and that a significant portion of that will come from body fat what portion depends on the number of factors but that simple formula is important on a previous episode i mention the complications with the statements of a carry is a carry and indeed there is evidence from for instance robot lusting who a pediatric antechronologist that you see san francisco is talked about how highly process foods change the way that we utilize food and can lead to higher incidences of ability and other metabolic centrums that go against the idea that a color is a carry and that is it a carry is a carry as a unit of energy and we need to accept and acknowledge this calories in meaning carries invested verses calories burned formula but the calories burned portion is strongly influenced by a number of things that you can control that can greatly accelerate or increase the amount of adipose tissue or the proportion of adipose tissue that you burn in response to exercise and food your hormones are important your thermogenic milo meaning how warm or how cold your body is how cold you make it how warm you make it but also your level of metabolism your levels of theroid hormone end something that is hardly ever discuss but is well supported by the scientific literature how much enervation meaning how much inactivity there is between your nervous system and fat to day we are going to talk about the the fact that your body fat of various kinds and there are several kinds of body fat are actually enervated by anurans anurans connect to your body fat and can change the probability that that body fat will be burned or not your nervous system is the master controller of this process and it plays a strong roll in the calories out the calories burned component as usual we are going to discuss a little bit of science i promise i will not go too deep into solipsists and all sorts of things related to fat oxidation we are going to break down that process into too important steps and if you can understand those two important steps than the rest of the tools will be very straightforward to understand and manage and i do believe that to day you will walk away with many new tools that you could incorporate into any kind of fat loss regimen that will greatly accelerate that process because it is grounded in quality were reviewed science throughout the episode ism going to talk about some behavioral tools in fact it'll mostly talk about behavioral tools i will also talk about compounds supplements many of you are into supplements some of you are not and that is fine for those of you that are into supplements an important issue in a discussion about supplements for fat loss or otherwise is going to be the quality of those supplements and the accuracy about what is in those supplement bottles and tablets et camera i usually mention this at the end of the podcast but this podcast we have partnered with thorn t h or and e because thorn we believe has the highest levels of stringency in terms of the quality of the compounds in their supplements and the amounts of those compounds if you want to see the supplements i take you can go to thorn do come slash the letter you slash supermen you can see the supplementsthat i take that will also allow you to get twenty per cent off any of those supplements or twenty per cent off any of the other supplements that thorn makes thorn has partnered with the man clinic and all the major sportsteams there is a very strong basis for their stringency again you do not need to u supplements ism certainly not encouraging any one to u supplements if that is not your thing but if you are going to u supplements make sure that your supplement source is one of very high quality with that said i want to get started and talk about the various tools for fat loss and you euro science neurons control fat loss before i do that i want to set the context correctly and extract some of the key take always from previous episodes because if your foundation of health and your foundation of hormones and your foundation of metabolism is not right it is going to be very hard to get the most out of any kind of exercise or fat loss protocol in previous episodes i talked all about the scents and the details going into particular protocols we do not have time to do that now and i want to get to the new material however there are couple bins a couple items that you should make sure your getting correctly and if you are not perfect about these do not worry about it most people are not perfect about them ism certainly not perfect about them but we should all be striving to get quality and sufficient sleep i did four full episodes on sleep and how to get better at sleeping through things light exposure temperature timing your sleep correctly for your called chronotype if you are night owl or morning person that is the first for when i think five episodes of the supermen lad podcast get your sleep right get your light exposure right avoid bright light in your eyes at times you want to be asleep and get right light in your eyes at times you want to be awake get your sleep right the other thing is essential fatiacids i talked about this in the food and mood episode but i also talked about it during the hormones episodes we need fat acids they are vital to many aspects of our health you do not have to get them from supplements you can if you want to but you need to get them from your food they are essential as a reason there is an e the essential part there of the fat acids their multiple kinds but for the anti depressing facts or the the levels of fat acids that will promote good mood and also healthy metabolism and will start to shift the needle in the right direction on blood born cardiovascular factors the key thing is to get the levels of e p a that you invest above one thousand milligrams per day that does not mean just taking a thousand milligrams are more of say fish oil or crilloil or whatever your preferred source it means getting above a thousand milligrams of e p a which may require that you invest more essential fatyacids than just a thousand milligrams per day that of course can be done through food sources things fat fish or if you are not of if you are not into eating fish you quality beats that are grab rays can do that their are other sources of essential fatyacids of course also from plant sources look those up on line it's really easy to fine but the research in the literature shows that you want to get above a thousand milligrams o e p a per day because that is when you can best support your metabolism and position yourself for good fatless as well for people who have cravings issues they they crave sweets all the time i talked about this in the gut brain episode and hormones and food they you have neurons in your gut that are craving their seeking essential fatyacids and there craving and seeking a men acids from your food now these are not supplements that they crave per say their craving those things because that is what your body needs in your brain needs but those same neurons will respond to sugars and many people who are craving sugar can satisfy that sugar craving by giving the neurons to speak what they actually want which are a men acids and essential fatiacids that includes e p a but also things glutamine and a men acid that can really reduce sugar cravings if you take a teaspoon of that or even a table spoon of that a few times to day you have to ease into that obit because some people can get a little bit of get distress from too much glutamine but glutamine has also been shown to improve symptoms of leaky gut it is a powerful a men acid and yes you can also get it from food things cottage cheese are high in glutamine et camera and then finally you cannot really position yourself to have a strong metabolism if your iodine levels are not correct in your thyroid levels are not correct you can overdo codons you do not want to do that a lot of table salt has iodine added to it but some people need to ad iodine they by investing things kelp et camera but one of the best ways to support the thyroid system and metabolism in general is to make sure your getting enough cylenniums sometimes called selenium each day simple way to do that is to invest the highest c concentration of selenium food that ism aware of which is brazil nuts one or two or three of those per day you will have more than enough selenium a to meet the thyroid needs you do not want your biennium to be too high you do not want a diet too high in anything again sleep sufficient eyes glutamine if you have issues with leek gut or sugar cravings can really help get your got microfilm right i may have a missing that but get your got microfilm right that does not necessarily meaninging to invest robotics you can if you want to but you can also just simply unjust a serving or two of fermented foods per day that can greatly assists o things safer know kimchi every culture has a different a source or sources of fermented foods those can really help the the got microbus and then make sure that your thyroid hormones supported through the ingestion of sufficient iodine not too much and sufficient selenium not too much oke sleep pie glutamine fermented foods iodine millennium that sets the basis for how things exercise cold and some of the compounds and other things that whereon to talk about to day that are ism guessing truly conto be truly new to many of you that can really increase the burn factor in the equation of calories in verses calories but burned oke on the one hand we have this reality of calories in verses calories burned however i would also be remiss if i did not mention and incredible study that was done by my colleague a lea drum at stamford she is a faculty member professor in the psychology department looking at how belief effects just thinking can impact the effects of things exercise on weight loss these are just incredible results what they did was they took subjects who were hotel service people that would clean the hotels and come in and change the the linens and forth divide them into two groups one group they were were told moving around and doing your duties for your job a meat the standards for you side lines for activity an movement et camera and a basic lecture about how movement is good for you et camera but mostly just that their daily activities met the standards for the you as the other group however was given a bunch of information about how movement and their daily routine was very good for cardiovascular health it could be good for weight loss et camera and then they tracked these subjects over a period of many weeks the take to message from the study was that simply being told that movement is good for you can lead to weight loss et camera led to significantly more body fat loss waste a hiporatio changes in the direction that most people would want essentially slimming down if you will and all sorts of other positive effects on things cardiovascular health simply by the knowledge that movement and exercise can help various health markers this is remarkable and speaks to the power of the nervous system an the power of belief in governing aspects of our body in our physiology that one would otherwise think were outside our conscious control now of course any of you that think scientifically which imagine if you watch this podcast list in t this podcast is all of you by now probably thinking well maybe they just moved around more maybe a updates a stood up in and sat down more maybe they they did something else that was different and indeed there is a strong possibility that they did things differently than the other group but the murder knowledge that exercises good for you that movement is good for you shifted their behavior and their physiology in the direction of enhanced weight loss fat loss et camera how we think about given set of activities affects how we perform those activities and how we think and hereabout and perform those activities has a real effect on our physiology somewhere between the hardened fast rule that governs fat loss and weight loss which is if you invest more calories than you burn you will either maintain or wainwright typicallyall wainwright although not always if you invest about as many calories as you burn you maintainweight typically and if you invest fewer calories than you burn typical you will lose weight that is the kind of rule of fat loss and yet we also have these belief of facts which show and this has been replicated again and again that how we think about a process whether not we think its beneficial can change our physiology in ways that can be beneficial to us somewhere in between those two extremes of hard comment metabolic science and belief of facts why a bunch of protocols that are grounded in quality were reviewed science and in physiology that you can leverage to increase the rates of fat loss and that is what we are on a talk about to day i love this topic and it is not that ism obsessed with fat loss but rather the first project i ever worked on in science was thermogenesis and fat loss i joined a laboratory as an undergraduate and the guy work for loved to explore new compounds and how they impacted thermogenesis and we looked at how things emdiama ecstasy ah how anticycotics anti depressence a various weight loss drugs that were on the market how those impacted body temperature and fat loss and metabolism and we dead much fun doing it if you detect a smile on my face that is a that is what that is about and i also learned a lot and i also came to really appreciate that this tissue of our bodies adapts tissue in fat we think of i s just the unfortunate thing this were told it is a for energy sores if we ever entered a famine and that is all true et camera come to realize that the cells in our body they are there as fuel for the furnace of our body which is our metabolism and there is a third player and that is wherein really gets interesting that the nervous system neurons has the opportunity to turn up the intensity that furnace it has the opportunity to increase the around of heat that we produce and therefore the amount of energy that we burn and i was also really intrigue by something which is that growing up i think we all no people who can eat a ton and never seem to gain any body fat or people who seem to eat very little and seem to gain body fat very easily and i was always intrigue by that and turns out there are number different factors that relate to that but the nervous system is the one that we can really control not through behaviors in what we eat but also in terms of this thing that we call thermogenesis the was one particular story i want to relate to you that does not suggest any protocol in fact ism going to discourage you from following this protocol please do not try the compound that ism about to describe one of the favorite things that we to do in that lab was to find rare compounds and tests them and at the time i was reading about thermogenesis and i learned about a compound that was actually discovered in the armory factories of we war too and it was discovered because women in particular who were work in these factories would take a a brush and dip it in a compound a a paint rather and they would than paint the numbers with a stencil on to things bombs and and a ammunition of various kinds and they were losing weight crazy and turns out that occasion they lick the brush and then they would go back just to get a a sharper point on the brush and then they would a paint on to these a various bullets and a and missiles and forth bombs and forth and they started shedding all their body fat and many of them lose excuse me lost a lot of weight a significant portion of their weight without changing anything else that they were doing what they were eating et camera turned out that that compound is something called dynnitrophenale d n p and over the years dynatrophinale d m p has gained popularity in some niche cultures mainly body builders athletes even in the an a modelling industry it is a absolutely terrible compound for any one to use because it is highly fatal if your body temperature goes too high hyperthermia will kill you and indeed many people have died using dynatrophinale as a weight lot drug or attempting to uses the weight loss drug but dona tropical really illustrates a principle which is that your your metabolism includes things devoid cordoning growth hormone et camera but your body temperature and the way you utilize energy is controlled by your nervous system and the way dynitrophenal works is by changing the neurons and the way that the neurons that connect to fat change the way fat burns up we are not going to suggest i am not suggesting that you used dynatrophenal however there are other things that you can do that can change the relationship between these neurons and the fat of your body in ways that can powerfully accelerate fat loss and i do not know why we do not here about these things more but probably because most of what you see out there on the internet focuses more on what you could eat and should eat or should not eat it concentrates on exercise regiments which we will also talk about but the burn factor your thermogenic environment is one of the if not the most important factors in this business of fat loss and since ism a negro scientists that is what wireman talk about let us talk about fat utilization let us talk about how fat is converted into energy which is sometimes also called fat burning what it'd you to know is that this is a two part process kin reality there are many big chemical steps and if you log on to the internet or you open up a ten book and you want to learn about fat utilization you are going to see a lot of chemistry and ism happy to go deep into that chemistry if you but i think most of you are probably interested in what are the leverage points where can you exert control over this process in ways that benefit you ism going to focus mainly on those k this is not to upset the offycionatos and i will put in some nomen cloture but here we go there is two parts to this process one is fat mobilization and the second is fat occupation or utilization oke the first thing that has to happen for body fat to get burned up or used and refused is that it has to get mobilized and that is a process called policies but i exactly do not care if the name policies you just have to move that fat out of the position that it is in you have to get it out of the fat cells right fat cells can be visceral around our vice our organs or the can be subcutaneous under our skin most people are thinking about subcutaneous fat when they think about fat here is the deal and if your want more detail great it'll touch on that in a bit but basically stored fat has two parts that are relevant here it is got the fattyacid part and that is the part that your to my can use and that is attached to something called glicerale and they're linked by a backbone s already probably too much chemistry for both you but what you want is you want to break the backbones if you just can remember to mobilize fat forget t break the backbone between glider all these fatyacids of that is accomplish by an denim called lipase but you can for get all that if you want remember were just try to mobilize fat the first step is to get those fatty acids moving around in the blood stream to get them out of those fat cells and then they can travel and be used for energy and that second part remember first part is mobilization the second part is oxidation is then those fatty acids those are potential fuel they are just potential fuel but you have not burn the fat yet you have just moved it out of your fat cells they are going to go into cells that can use them for energy and once they are inside those cells they are still not burned up you need a oxidize them think oxidation is to burn up part they need to be moved into the mitochondria and then they can be converted into a t p into energy just to really dugout again to make our i do not lose anybody you got a mobilize the fat than you have to oxidize the fat you have to in other word you have to mobilize it than you actually have to convert it into energy if you just mobilize it and you do not convert it into energy you do not oxidize it it can be returned to body fat and many of the things that the nervous system can do is to increase the mobilization of fat but also the oxidation of fat case you have too opportunities to burn more fat and both of those opportunities are governed by your nervous system by neurons that literally send little wires that we call axons into fat and release chemicals that provide a stimulus for more of that fat to be mobilize and then later for more of that fat to be burned up of we could go really deep on this but ism not going to go much deeper than that because this is not a by a chemistry of fatyacid metabolism lecture this is about how to burn fat using your nervous system but remember there is a mobilization step and then there is an oxidation step i think any one view all of you should be able to internalize that mobilize then oxidize of mobilize than oxide what are these neurons that connect o fat doing what are they releasing exactly how do they actually increase fatmobilization and how do they increase fat oxidation burning of fat well there are couple of things that they release that encourage that process and the main one that you need to know about is epineferan or a adrenalin the conversion of these fatty acids into a t p in the mitocondry of cells is favored by a adrenaline of and a adrenalin is released from two sources a adrenaline is released from the adrenal glance which cyton toparcidneys an our lower bat and it is also released from the called sympathetic nervous system although that name is a bit of a misnomer because it has nothing to a sympathy has to do with stimulating a alertness and promoting action of the body there is a big mistake in the literature that is finally being corrected among those who know the mistake in the literature is that the adrenal glands and the release of a adrenaline is what stimulates fat loss and autoxidation in fact it was thought for a long time that a adrenaline swimming around in your body of when you are fasted because fasting can increase a adrenaline or when you are engaging an intense exerciser when your stress is going to promote fat oxidation that is actually not the case the a adrenaline that stimulates fat oxidation the burning of fat is coming from neurons that actually connect to the fat not hormones a adrenaline that are swimming around in your system it is a local process and this is very important because it means that what you do the specific patterns of movements and the specific environment you create that can stimulate these particular neurons to act fate fat meaning to release fat to mobilize it and then to burn it is going to be a powerful lever that you can use in order to increase fat loss what have we said far we have said that you got mobilizing out o burn fat and that your nervous system is in control of that process it is not just about carry deficit of let us talk about pow to activate the nervous system in ways that it promotes more liberation movement mobilization of fat and more oxidation of fat one of the most powerful ways to stimulate epinephrin which is also called a adrenaline from these neurons that connect to fat and to thereby stimulate more fat mobilization in oxidation is through movement but ism not talking about exercise the type of movement that ism referring to is extremely subtle and some of you may be familiar with this type of movement but ism guessing your probably not familiar with what ism about to tell you which is that shiver or shivering is a strong stimulus for the release of a adrenaline epinephrin into fat and the increase in fat oxidation and mobilization but shiver is not just induced by cold and there are other subtle forms of movement that can greatly increase fat metabolism and fat loss there was a group in englut during the nineteen sixties and seventies that discovered a pathway by which subtle forms of movement can greatly increase fat loss this is the work of rothwell and stock it is very famous in the thermogenesis literature and i learned about this early on when i was an undergraduate and i asked how did they come across this and here is how the story goes they were aware that some people over eat and yet do not put on weight other people overeat even just a little bit and they seem to accumulate extra anapest tissue now this is long before all the discussions about microfilm and hormone factors in an as on before it many of the hormone factors besides insolent even been discovered what they did was they examined people who overnight and did not gain weight and what they observed was that those people engaged in lots of subtle movement throughout the day in other words they were fidget's that is what they call them ism not going do the bridges the brutish accent version of fidget's but rotten stock were brutish what they found were people that overeat but do not gain weight as a consequent and in fact many people who had low levels of body fat had a lot of resting tremor not of the parkansonian type but they would bounce their knee while they were sitting when they would talk they would engage in very angular movements they were sort of electric in fact that now in science have was chuckling about this as i was diving back into this literature because the other day i heard a a wonderful lecture on a totally different topic from a colleague of mine we all adore him he is over in rope and he is this tremendously successful scientist the we to poke fun at him a and every one of his movements is incredibly electric and staccato and he is rail thin and he eats a horse and fits very well into the discovery of rothwell and stock who discovered that fidget's people that bounce their knee people that have a head bob while they are listening people that not a lot people that stand up and sit down a lot throughout the day and people that pace burn anywhere from eight hundred to twenty five hundred calories more then the expert the control group in the experiments that they looked at and indeed there is been a modern look into all this and these numbers check out that simply moving around a lot even if those are subtle movements greatly increases the amount of energy that you burn and people who overeat the people who can have the the second or the third do not utter do not lets at all and do not seem to put on weight to the same degree they are people that move around a lot even when seated there people that will often move their limbs very quickly as well that there re even have been studies that have explored other things that correlate with fidget's fidget's stand up very quickly at the end of lecture or they strike to gather the things very quickly were as n on fidget's do not dogs my be dog costello refill not a fidget every movement is incredibly slow and deliberate sitting down as a process of scum to sit down in sort of a slow motion heascum to get up in yo can looks at use size and stands up the fidget's of the opposite that right you say dowry doing they go grass even sometimes their speech will be accelerated although not always but staccato movements fidgeting et camera and in twenty fifteen and again in twenty seventeen they're been studies that it been have explored this using some modern metabolic tracking and indeed simply moving a lot being a fidget bouncing your see standing up and pacing several times or many times throughout the day led to considerable bounce of fat loss and weight lost when people were investing the same amount of food if they overrate they were able to compensate and burn off that food and if they were trying to lose weight and they incorporated this fidgeting protocol of deliberately trying to fidget more and move around during the day pace stand up more quickly sit down more often sit down and stand up more often rather they found that they greatly increase their weight loss anywhere from twenty to thirty per cent increases in some cases there the always those few people who burned a lot more it seems to work best in people who are already slightly over weight for people that are over weight who are kind of reverse to exercise fidgeting might actually be a good entry point and eight hundred and twenty five hundred calories is a considerable mount of calories when you really think about it now why am i telling you this well there is clearly a tool to export from this which is that you can increase the amount of calories burned without having to go on additional long runs i do hope that people are exercising regularly because it is important for other aspects of brain and body health but none the less we all we are all time limited and we are not all ready to embrace exercise i have a family member who has been slowly coaxed into exercise but if i were to tell her for instance you need a fidget more should probably go for it this is a powerful way to increase the calories that are burned now that is great and you can think about the protocols but i want to nest that protocol in what i said before which is that fat is controlled by these neurons and the epinephrin they release you might say well how could these little micro movements lead to much colonic burn and that is where it really gets interesting rothwell and stock and others that they worked with subsequently found that these little fidgety movements the engagement of certain aspects of our musculature that are nothing exercise it is not these large coordinated or rhythmic a body movements but rather idle little bits of fidgety movement and here i am doing a lot of fidgety movement as an example tapping the pen this kind of thing there i was probably that kitting class most of the time i try not to do it to irritate you what i was deafly a new bouncer ism not particularly lean or or not but ais definably this is a a common activity for meat people that do that sort of thing it turns out that it is not the kind of colonic burn that we normally think of of oh your running lifting weight swimming yoga et camera those subtle movements of our core musculature not just the core but all our limbs and are in our musculature those low level movements they trigger apinaferan release from these neurons and they stimulate the mobilization of fat and then that fat is oxidized at higher rates and i find this fascinating i wish more people knew about it which is what ism telling you about it today this has nothing to do with exercise in the traditional form and yet eight hundred or twenty five hundred calories per day that is a considerable amount of fat oxidized if you are in a carry maintenance mode or a if your sub colonic that is going to add to still additional fat loss the date on this are tremendous it'll link to a few studies if you are really interested in learning about what is called neat an e a t which is non exercise activity thermogenesis neat what is the protocol fidget if you are really interested in burning calories and you already exercise you want to burn more or you do not have the opportunity exercise or your reversed exercise for whatever reason fidgeting movements staccato movement standing up walking around pacing all the sort of nervous activities that we are critical of and other people and sometimes in ourselves are actually mobilizing and oxidizing a lot of fat and a lot of energy and while this probably will not compensate for chronic over eating the colonic burn from this is considerable and very likely kin offset a a meal that had excessive calories or a kind of steady state of accumulate of eating too much and it also stars to open up all sorts of thoughts an discussion about you when you travel you tend to eat foods that are and of outside your your normal ones we tend to eat o you foods that are not great for us we also tend to be a will bit more sedentary when we travel were on the plan et camera but all of that aside just the use of something low level movement and it is almost a tremor but also these select short small fidgety movements ism intentionally doing a lot of these today you have examples that you can use that to select from if you these can have a major of felt on fat loss and it raises a second tool if these low meaning these small movements that we engage gin trigger epinephrin a adrenaline release from these neurons of the sympathetic nervosystm that enervate fat and increase fat mobilization oxidissue now it should make sense why shivering is one of the strongest stimulus stimuli that one can in corporate to stimulate fat loss now shivering is almost always associated with cold we think shivering we think cold because when we get cold we shiver and there are two ways that shivering can increase fat loss and there are several ways that you can use shivering you can leverage shivering and you can leverage cold to accelerate fat loss but you have to do it correctly and most of the people that are using cold and frankly suggesting cold as a means to increase metabolism fat loss are suggesting the exact wrong protocol in fact that one ism going to recommend is a hundred and eighty degrees in the opposite direction to the typical protocol that you would hereabout let us talk about how to use cold and haw a leverage shiver as a particularly strong stimulus to increase fat loss me through mobilization and oxidation of these fatiacids in recent years that been a growing interest in the use of cold for various things improving stress tolerance improving metabolism recovery from exercise have talked about a number of those things and the uses of cold on this podcast in fact did in episode on how to supercharge performance through palmer cooling cooling the palms in specific ways or the bottoms of the feet and if you are interested in that and how to improve performance in endurance and strength you can check out that episode but most people out there are using cold exposure typically by taking cold showers or by getting into cold water of some other kind a lay or a river or cold bath or an ice fat and they are doing that probably with mixed goals meaning they are both would to increase their metabolism and burned fat as well as improve mental resilient since to day were talking about accelerating fat loss through the use of science pase tools one emphasize a study that was published in nature just a couple years ago showing exactly how cold increases metabolism and fat loss we have several kinds of fat three kinds in fat we have white fat white anapest tissue and we have brown fat or brown anapest tissue and there is a third kind which is age anapest tissue white fat is the type that we traditionally think of as fat subcutaneous fat and it is not particularly rich in mitochondria it is there as an energy storage sight and we have to mobilize the fat out as we talked about before and burn it p elsewhere brown fat largely exists between our shoulder blades and on the back of our neck between the scapula and it is rich with mitochondria which is why it is called brown fat and brown fat has a particular bi chemical cascade whereby it can take food energy and can it can take food basically break it down and convert it into energy within those cells under some additional steps involved but unlike fatty acids from white fat which have to travel elsewhere get broken down and mite condemn and convertentaty pea et camera use by the mitochondria rather brown fat is thermogenic it can actually use energy directly it skips a step and i do not want to get diverted by going into all the the you chemistry of it base fat is sort of i between it is white fat that could be brown fat because it has some mitochondria in it but not as many as brown fat now cold exposure does several things making ourselves cold and allow us to build up mental razilients because getting into cold of any kind does not matter if it is a crib chamber does not matter fits a cold day and you forgot your sweater your parka it does not matter if it is an ice bath or you you are lying down in the snow cold causes the release of a adrenalin from your adrenals and it causes the release of epinephrin from these neurons that connect to fat now the big effects of cold on metabolism and fat burning are going to be through two routs one is that if you expose yourself to cold you have the opportunity to trigger activation of brown fat as well as to convert more bash fat into true brown fat you essentially great a stronger or hotter furnace that is the way to think about brown fats a furnace and with this principle that we started with a calories in verses calories burn what you are doing is your increasing the amount of burning you are increasing the burn of energy by increasing the intensity of the heat inside you to speak ski a talking heres kind of metaphorically now how can you do that well if you get into cold water or an ice bath or a cold day and you try and remain calm and resist shivering you actually short circuit this mechanism for increasing brown fat thormagenisis the paper publish in nature shows that it is shivering itself that causes the brown fat to increase your burning your burn rite and your metabolism and it works this when you get into cold and you shiver the shivering those that low level movement of the muscle though small movements triggers the release of a molecule cold succinate s u c c i n t e succinate and succinate acts on the brown fat to increase brown fat thermogenesis and fat burning over all it actually increases body heat through this brown fat thermogenesis pathway and it also over time can increase the amount of brown fat by converting bash fat into true brown fat now how much cold exposure and how often that is the key but be four i give that detail or set of details remember if you resist the shiver you are not going to get the increased metabolic of fact because you are not going to get the succinate release if you want to get your body heat your thermogenic level to go up you need to shiver now we have the neat that non exercise activity through agenesis of low levels of activity as i describe before which are done away from cold may you do them in cold as well as well as shiver in response to cold and the shiver itself is valuable for triggering the release of succinate in fact succinate is being evolved now by various drug manufactures as a potential treatment for obesity although it has not really hit the market in its in final form yet suite is powerful for its effects on brown fat how many times a week do you need to expose yourself to cold will depend on how much fat you are trying to lose and how much you are trying to increase your metabolism there are studies that describe positive effects on fat loss of exposing yourself to cold either through cold shower or through ice bath or other cold water does not have to acting have ice in it provided its cold enough for any time anywhere souse me between one and five times per weak but it turns out that just one exposure per weak can be valuable the question then is how long to get into that cold environment and how cold should that environment be first these talk about how long to get into that cold environment the answer here might be a obit different then you might imagine most of you might think oh well if one minute is good three minutes is better and if three minutes is better than ten minutes is best but remember the goal is to get the shiver induce release of succinate that succinate can trigger the brown fat it turns out that if you want to trigger the shiver what you want to do is to get into the cold and then get out of the cold and typically not dry off and then get back into the cold and out of the cold that will definitely stimulate more shivering than just getting into the cold itself what ism not referring to is getting into the cold environment an ice bat and waiting until you shiver and staying there shivering ski you also do not want to get hypothermic and i want to be clear r you want a you an to get approval from your doctor before you do any of this when you get in to cold water they are two factors that will dictate whether not you shiver probably three but let us just talk about the main to one is how cold it is how cold should it be and look if you get into water that is very very cold it can actually shock your heart it can actually give you a hard attack of it is truly truly ice cold and you are not adapted to that proceed with caution please ism not a physician and ism not i do not want to see anyone get hurt cold just cold enough to be uncomfortable is a good place to start for some of you that is going to be sixty degrees for some of you that is going to be fifty five degrees for some of you it is going to be high thirties right depends on how cold adapted you are and people very in terms of how well they tolerate the cold what you need to do is find a temperature that you can get in to one to five probably one to three times a week if you really want this to accelerate fat loss and you want to get in until you just start to shiver and then you want to get out and not dry off wait anywhere from one to three minutes and they get back into the cold now you will notice when you get back into the cold it will almost seem soothing it might actually not induce shive you might take away the shiver that you that you had here is a potential kind of sets reps protocol that you can play with find a temperature then duce to shiver for you that is going to very depending on your cold tolerance and how cold adapted you are one to three may be five times a week get in until you or get under the shower whatever it is until you start to shiver genuinely shiver then after about a minor get out spend one to three minutes out but do not dry off get back in for anywhere from one to three minutes but try in access the shiver point again and you might do three repetitions of that it is three times in and three times out coal that is a great starting place en what you do not want to do is build up your tolerance o to cold fast that pretty soon you are able to resist the shiver because o remember the shiver is the source of the succinate release that will trigger brown fat thorn agenesis if you would to see this protocol spelled out you can access it zero cost at a web site which is the cold plunge dot calm the cold plunge is a company they make cold plunges and they were kind enough to gift one to the superman lab podcast but i want emphasize that these protocols are free of cost the folks at the cold plunge are not just interested in a marketing their product but not of their main interests is encouraging people to engaging cold exposure for particular en points and goals fat lost resilient et camera resisting inflammation but there main focus is providing people protocols and encouraging people to use cold exposure o various kinds not just through their products but through cold rivers and ism jumps in the ocean and things that cold showers whatever is a most convenient and accessible for various people and we need it a place where we could house these protocols in a permanent way and not just for this episode but what they have agreed to do is to post the protocols there they should be very easy to find on their website this particular protocol we are referring to as the fat loss optimization protocol for lack of a better name and it is really grounded in how cold can be used to induce shiver and again it does not really matter how your accessing that cold provided you access the shiver and you are moving from the cold environment to a slightly warmer environment getting out of the cold shower getting out of the ice bath et camera or out of the cold plunge and then back in because it turns out that the cooling and rewarming process of the body is where shiver kicks in and that is distinctly different than just thing to get in to the cold and stay in the cold for as long as possible and if you dugout a little bit and think about some examples in life you will understand why that must be the case for instance people who do a lot of cold water swims you have these polar bare clubs i think they call themselves do these cold water swims i would sometimes see these people swimming back and forth alcatras andstelf that which it seems risky and they tell me is very stimulating for the mine and body great sometimes those people are very lean oftentimes there not and they are getting a lot of cold exposure and one of the things that happens as if you expose yourself to cold over and over you adapt you become cold adapted and when you do that you no longer get the epinephrin the adrenalin release from the cold and therefore you do not get the succinate release and the shivering and the brown fat thermagenic effect quite as intensely if you want to use cold for other reasons it certainly cold water swims can be fun om and there is a longs you can do him safely the their great have done gotten into cold water swimming for some period of time ah you can use cold for raziliene et camera but if you want to use cold to increase fat loss than getting this shiver process going the cooling and rewarming which accelerates the amount or increases the amount of shiver that is going to be the way to go one note about cold and some of the factors that it releases a few years back there was a lot of excitement about this hormone called price i r i s i n which was associated with cold ad there's a lot of excitement about its potential roll in increasing metabolism much that people were starting to explore this as a potential fat loss drug to my knowledge that went nowhere the science eventually shifted over to succinate as the main factor in cold induced thermogenesis through this brown fat pathway but if any one out there is aware of any abusive effects of arisen or of any science of a risen that ism over looking here or that ism speaking bout incorrectly please let me know it'd be very curious to learn now i want just talk about brown fat a little bit more and talk about a period in your life in which you were rich with brown fat you had a tons brown fat and that is when you were a baby babies cannot shiver these neurons that release epineferon into fat are not wired up and really are not present at sufficient levels or in sufficient numbers when you are a baby and therefore you cannot shiver as a baby and you cannot warm yourself up in cold environments very well to compensate for that mother nature installed in all of us an excess of brown fat early in life that exists again in the upper back an the middle of the back and the back on the neck over time if we do not expose ourselves to cold environments or do other things that make a shiver we lose a lot of that brown fat but what is interesting about brown fat is that there some evidence that brown fat just white fat can both increase in size but that you can also add new sells others a little but controversial people i say you cannot change the number of fat cells you can just shrink them or increase their size well it turns out that epineferand released from these little nerve endings in brown fat and succinate circulating in the body may and a one under score may have the effect of increasing the amount of brown fat cells probably by converting these bathe fat cells into brown fat that allows us to become much as we were early in life where we metabolized crazy and we would heat ourselves up without shivering some people have taken the cold thing to the extreme you putting ice packs on the back of their neck throughout the day a did a episode all about testosterone and estrogen and there this a let us just call it a a very niche ai haft imagine very very niche culture of people who are am wearing literally ism not joking they re these a cool pack ice pack under pants they go by a name that ism not can repeat on here but you can find them on amazon that is a those are people that are using cold facts on the body and on the growing to try and increase things testosterone ah but as well to try and increase thermogenesis and trying to increase their metabolism just remember if you become cold adapted you are not going to get the fat burning effects to the same degree cold as a powerful tool for fat loss but you do not want to adapt this is reminiscent of a rule that you hereabout in endurance exercise and strength exercise as well which is that you want to use the minimal effective stimulus to promote growth or progress o growth of the muscle or improvements in endurance if you go ten per cent further on a run or ten per cent faster you will likely see an improvement in performance provided you recovery then next time you come back and do that same round of exercise you will be able to do more work or complete the work more easily et camera you have adapted if you do twenty per cent more distance or twenty per cent more weight you will not necessarily see the same commiserate level of gain or improvement and likewise with cold if your quickly moving from thirty seconds of exposure to ten minutes of exposure you are overlooking the opportunity to get the most fat loss and increase in metabolism by stepping it up in smaller increments look and this also speaks to the rational for using cold exposure to accelerate fat loss for certain periods but then maybe not doing it year round if fat loss is your goal maybe use it for two three months at a time and then stop for two three months at time because it is such a potent stimulus provided you engage in the in the shiver next it'd to move to exercise and how particular timing and types of exercise can vastly improve fat loss before i do that i just want o mention a really important reference for those of you that are interested in learning more about how anurans connect to fat this is certainly a paper that you would want to look at if you're interested in diving deep into the literature and reading all the various studies it is a review and the title of the review is curl enervation of white adipose tissue and the control of li politics that the curl enervation of white adipose tissue and the control of lie politics it was published in frontiers in euro under chronology you can find that free on line that have the full text available the first author is a baroness b a r t n e s s it is a great review and have talked about a number of things that are mentioned in the review follow the references in that review in the reference trail as we say if your interested in learning more about also how anurans control brown fat and before i move to exercise i also just want to highlight something that comes up every few years and as largely been considered myth now but that is actually more interesting then most people might think which is this issue of spot reduction knowing that eighties and nineties there was a there were a lot of commercials like i infomercials a where they would talk about spot reduction if you do sit ups wilily you lose abdominal fat if you do praises or glue raise we you lose glue and hip fat and i think everybody now believes that and understands that fat metabolism is something that happens systemically throughout the body that some body fat is cotingquot more stubborn than others everyone varies in where they tend to store fat or lose fat last number of factors that influence that in particular hormone receptors but now at least in the scientific literature spot reduction and t possibility of real true spot reduction reductions in fat in a targeted way of body part or body area targeted way is becoming more of a reality and may be a reality soon because exercise that triggers the activation of these nerve fibers these neurons that enervate fat in theory if you can increase the amount of epinephrin release that those particular fat pats as there called their actually colon fat pats in the scientific literature in theory you could increase mobilization from those particular body fat sights case because the new view that the modern understanding is that it is not a adrenaline release systemically kind of bathing all your fat tissue but rather it is neurons releasing a adrenaline epineferan locally that in theory exercise that stimulates the release of epinefran or exercise coupled with things shiver were low grade chasing movement or these the neat the the non exercise activity thermogenesis could in theory lead to local enhancement of mobilization of fat tissue i think that spot reduction actually will soon be something that is possible using the appropriate technology what does this mean for you now what what could you possibly do for this with this information now well i think it speaks to the the fact that if one is going to engage in exercise that doing exercise that involve lots of different body parts and movements is likely to encourage the maintenance and or growth of these neurons that enervate fat throughout the body what this means is changing up the pattern of exercise engaging in novel types of movements may actually be one way that one can access these called stubborn body fat pats now there is a limit of speculation in the statement that i making but if you think about it makes sense if you become very adapted to a particular pattern of exercise whether not your subcoloric or not your a maintenance calories or not you are oxidizing some fat always and your utilizing the neurons that enervate fat in a regular way in pretty soon this enervation is going to shut off because there is no reason why this nerd enervation of fat should continue to release epinephrin unless you give it a strong stimulus cold or the fidgeting or in this case to do novel forms of exercise and there is some anecdotal evidence an there identic one to call it data but anecdotal evidence that people who have continuo stubborn body fat if they start to adopt new patterns of exercise they can start to access those stubborn fat pats and again fat pas is the correct way to referred this in the scientific literature what were focusing on to day is the fact that fact indeed will be mobilized in oxidize in response to a deficit in calories but that the waythat inner one's control those fat pads and those body fat stores afford you a lot more control than perhaps you ever previously thought let us talk about movement and the more traditional kinds of movement each exercise there is been shown to lead to increases an metabolism and fat loss to greater degrees depending on whether not for instance your fasted when you do it or not whether not you do your cardie first or your resistance training first and this is again and the literature for which there is a lot of controversy but in digging through all the studies on on this were finally trying to arrive at a condenses of when is best to do exercise and what types of exercise to do if your goal is fat loss the topic of exercise is a kind of controversial one not as controversial as nutrition an diet which we will talk about in a few minutes but it is a particularly interesting one because differentypes of exercise engage the musculature the body in the heart in the longs in different ways and can have vastly different effects on things hormones in metabolism depending on whether not it is of high intensity modern intensity or low intensity rather than think about weight training verses party of vascular exercise i think the most simple way the most fluid way to have this conversation about exercise and fat loss is in terms of three general types of training whether not s done with weights or body weight does not really matter and those are high intensity interval training something that seems to gain a lot of popularity in recent years call hit h i i t high intensity interval training sprint interval training that is can be very high intensity or es t or moderate intensity continuous training am i c t we have got hit it and picked am i c t and we can get a littibit more precise if you a ism not somebody who measures my via to man or anything while i exercise i generally know whether not ism doing something i could continue for a very long time or whether not ism doing something that a i realize this going to be of short duration high intensity but if you to map this to via to mac es t this a spring interval training was defined as all out greater than one hundred percent of into man bursts of activity that last eight to thirty seconds intersperse with less intents recovery prase this would be sprinting down field for eight to thirty seconds then maybe walking back for about a minute or two and then sprinting again and then continuing o thou's be sit hit h i it s defined as subminimal eighty to a hunt percent of via to man bursts of activity that last sixty to two hundred and forty seconds intersperse with less intense recovery periods on a fortstandard four hundred meter track just to give the kilobit of a visual am you one a comminute mile would be fantastic for most people although people run faster than that of course that is four sixty second laps but that is back to back to back am i think in my in my best shaper mantras in my dreams i do not recall which i was able to do sixty seconds around the track but of course i couldn't get that on the second or third or fourth if i did that was a certainly a in t fantasy land and not reality but sixty seconds would be about one rev revolution around the track may be may be ninety seconds depending on how fast a one is running sixteeded two hundred forty seconds m i c t this moderate intense continuous training is steady state cardie sometimes called zone two cardie these days on the internet which is performed continuously for twenty to sixty minutes at moderate intensity of forty to sixty percent of vet two man or if you prefer heart rate fifty five to seventy per cent of man heart rate we can think about high medium and low intensity exercise a the low intensity am usually means that you could carry on a conversation or may you have to gasp every every few steps or while trying to talk and run that is i think of going to be the most useful way to have this conversation that we are having now becausethere sow man different forms of exercise that people do and intensity is important let us ask the question that i think many of people are wandering about it which is is it better meaning you burn more fat if you do your exercise fasted and fasted in this respect could be that you wake up in the morning you have been fasting all night you just hydrate and you exercise or sometimes people in just caffeine there is controversy as to whether not that quitting what breaks the fast asked to do with whether night your caffeine adapted something for another episode in any case that would be fasted probably not having eaten anything for anywhere from three to twenty four hours or may be even more as you couldalso be fasted in the afternoon if you had lunch at noon and it is four r five or six p m is it will you burn more fat if you exercise without in eating anything first without investing any calories first and people have tried to really split hairs on this every which way people say well you can fat fast because fat and proline does not lead to as great increases in insolent as other things maybe you can have a few amends and then still train and indeed insolent will prevent fat oxidation i want be really cleared the burning part of fat an the sell the the movement of the fatty acid and in to mytacondria and the conversion t a t p insolent inhibits that process however it is been shown that at least for short periods of training it does not really seem to matter whether not you eat before r training or you do not if your goal is fat oxidation now i want to put an astrict near that because there some exceptions but there were several studies done that and t kind of the classic ones of these it'll it'll read out to you they what they basically did as they gave people glucose sugar bound to increase their blood sugar before training or not and they can a classic study of this is along at all nineteen seventy six o goes way back which is that glucose reduces fat burning in exercise and then some over other studies if you want to look these up their very easy to find on poet put in horrors nineteen ninety nine a flee it lee at all is another one where they have people drink milk with glucose in its o sweet sugary milk before exercise et camera and you can find a number of examples where eating before exercise reduces the amount of fat that is oxidize during the exercise and you can also find a lot of studies showing that eating during exercise will or prior to exercise will not reduce the amount of fat that oxidize however the types of exercise with an i was medium intensity or high intensity or low intense is all over the map for the study it is very hard to target and ideal protocol and then if you look really deepen the literature you starts o fine metanalysies where people have actually aggregated all the findings and some modern studies where it points to some very specific and useful protocols and here's the rule that or the protocol that i extracted from that literature at a period of about ninety minutes of moderate intensity exercise when be clear after at about or after ninety minutes of moderate intensity exercise there is a switch over point whereby if you eight before the exercise you will reduce you excuse me you will burn far less fat from the ninety minute point onward then you would if you had gone into the training fasted seem me repeat that if it is moderate intensity called zone too cardiotype exercise at the ninety minute point if you happen to have eaten before the exercise within one to three hours prior to the exercise then you reduce the amount of fat that you will burn from ninety minutes onward whereas if you had fasted prior to the exercise you had not eaten anything for three hours or more prior to the exercise at the ninety minute point you will ninety minutes of exercise you will start to burn more fat than you would had you eaten now ninety minutes of moderate intensity excises a lot that is it that is a pretty long run even if your running at a pretty slow pace a tan or twelve minute mile that is a lot of running that is a lot of swimming that is a lot o walking that is a lot e heaven however there are people who are going out hiking all day or running all day or walking all day and i you want to burn more fat permit time you want to oxidize more fat than you would do that fasted now there are also studies that point to the fact that you do not have to wait to ninety minutes in order to get this enhanced fat burning effect the studies i was able to fine and that look to me quality previewed studies with no company by us or no product by us of any kind stere studies that were largely funded by the federal government in the university contact point to the fact that if one does high intensity training or or even the very high intensity forms a trying sprints or squats or dead lifts or any kind of act this you that cannot be maintained for more than these eight or i would say up to sixty seconds a set of lifting weights repeated repeated if that is done for anywhere from twenty minutes weight training or power lifting or these kinds thing your kettle bell swings or up to sixty minutes well then the switch over point in which you can burn more fat if you go into that fasted comes earlier and this make sense because there is nothing wholly about the ninety minute point for medium intensity zone to cardie that ninety minute point is the point in which the body shifts over from mainly burning gliadin basically sugar that comes from muscles or the liver and realizes this is going on for a while ism in a shift over to a storage sight fuel that is in reserve body fat it is this is going to happen for whiles from in o start tapping into body fat stores now fat does not have a little brain there it is not evade by neurons but doesn't have thoughts and you do not actually control the switch with your mind this is something that has to do with the miles of various hormones what has to happen is insolent has to go down far enough if you eight before the exercise you would have at increase in insolent if you ait carbohydrates you would have a bigger increase in n insolent fat and prolines indeed will have lower mounts of insolent and fasting will give you the lowest amount of insolent well then that switch over point is going to come earlier in the exercise and if you think about if you were to do something high intensity for twenty thirty forty minutes may be lift weights and then get into zone to cardie if you were fasted the literature says that you are going to burn more body fact per unite time then if you had eaten before or during the exercise what is this mean this means if you want ta burn more body fat if it is in your protocols and your you'd have been approve to do this safely exercise intensely for twenty to sixty minutes the higher the intensity obviously the shorter that bout is going to be and then move over into zone to c anyone if you do that fasted or the medium intense card i should say and if you do that fasted then indeed you will burn a higher percentage of body fat if you need to eat or you to eat before you train that also can work and if you train very intensely you are likely to shift over to the fat burning pattern more quickly is well again this is not really an issue of how long you exercise it is an issue of how intensely you exercise and there for what fuel source your drawing from wholly have made that clear but basically you need to deplete licagin or through his intensity exercise and then move to a steady state exercise that will allow you to burn more fat or you need to perform a medium intensity or low intensytype exercise for a long period of time before you shift over to burning fat and indeed it seems that going into all that fasted will facilitate the burning of more fat over all but if you cannot even get sit exercise if you are somebody who just cannot do the training at all you are unwilling to ore your incapable of training unless you eat something the bodies to eating something makes the most sense and what you eat prior the exercise that is a whole other is that people argue about and and fight about whether not you should go into it with low carbohydrates are discover all of that but in general the theme there is very simple which is that you want insolent levels to be pretty low if your goal is body fat reduction if you want oxidize body fat fasting in some cases fat fasting in other cases where you just insulting fats fat and proline in some cases or for some people it will be eating carbohydrates ism not here to dictate a particular nutrition regiment that is just how the hormone balance of these things and fat oxidation works now one thing that is very interesting and cannot be overlooked is this issue of how much energy you burn during and after the activity and some of you probably already know about this but the whole business of calories inverses calories out and people counting their the number o calories they burn during their erotic session n or during their whatever session is only one haft of the equation and it really eclipses the more important issue which is how much of an increase in metabolism does at given exercise create after the exercise and we could talk for hours about this but the simple way to view this is that high intensity training anerobic training of weight training sprints a berries any kind thing i you on these days i see i hear you are not suppose to do berries that people thin berries are dangers ism not suggesting in particular movements here you have to decide what is right for you a i do berries i do not i do not seem to be injured from them but i hear that their terrible for some people anyway push up sit ups whatever it happens to be that anerobic exercise that is of higher intensity or sprints taps into glycogen stores during the movement and will burn more energy rerun at time then moderate intensity high intensity burns me the moderntensy that straightforward what is interesting is that all the studies that i was able to find on what happens after that type of exercise show that the percentage of fat that you burn after high intensity exercise is actually greater in other words you burn a lot of glycogen during the high intensity exercise and then after the exercise the post exercise oxygen consumption as it sometimes called goes up we know this after you train intensely that post exercise oxygen consumption goes up sometimes for up to twenty four hours and it is during that period of time that you oxidize more fat not glycogen now what is interesting is that the reverse is also true for people that do long bouts of low or moderate intensity exercise typically this would be things running swimming baking et camera sixty ninety minutes two hours maybe people that are training for marathons or half marathons when they stop training they burn more gelikogen more care hydrate even though they were burning more body fat per unit time during the low intensity exercise there this kind of inversion high intense burns more glikygen during the activity more body fat afterwards moderate to low intensity burns more percentagewise more body fat is oxidized than glycogen during the moveduring the actual exercise afterward it is more glycogen i do not want this to get too complicated the point is you should pick exercise that you that you are going to do regularly but it does seem that the high intensity exercise followed by moderate intensity exercise is going to be optimal for fat burning over all because when you look at the percentage of body fat burned and you look at the overall increase in bail metabolic rate moderate and high intensity training followed by low intensity training or even just followed by going back into life is going to be the best way to continue to burn body fat because the ways that it increases bail metabolic rate ow this could be distill than to a simple protocol whereby three or four times a week you do high intend training followed by either nothing or followed by low intensity training special if you are able to do that fasted and i should just mention that none of the tuff about fasted is about performance if you want a perform really well you wan it were this is for reasons of performance and you want a you its for a sport or a competition is not for body fat purposes will then all this kind of falls away and is modified by what ideal to eat for performance but were hung about to day is how to optimize body fat a body fat loss train moderately to intensely to very high intensity and then moderate to low intensity or train moderate to high intensity and then go about life and in fact i have a friend who on uses t his strategy he likes the train intensely and not that often protocol use he is a very busy persons he's train for twentieth thirty minutes intensely with weights or just bodyweight movement doing a lot he does herpes and push ups and set ups and pull ups and just and of moving in kind of circuit type training but where breathing really hard the goal he always says i want a breathe hard for thirty minutes every day and then afterwards he hydrates and drinks coffee and moves into his day and hes walking around and taking calls and carrying around his children and doing all the kinds of things that keep him really busy with kind of low intensity work think you get the principle now but you should all be asking yourselves as scientists of yourselves why would it be that certain patterns of exercise would lead to more or less fat loss it cannot just be about the energy burned we already establish that and again it has to do with the neurons it has to do with how we engage the nervous system while non exercise activity in duce thermogenesis neat the fidgeting and cold can induce thermogenesis by engaging shiver tight movement or low level movements big movements that are of very high intensity meaning they require lot of effort deploy a lot of a adrenalin epinephrin from our neurons and signal particular types and amounts of fat thermogenesis fat oxidation whereas low level intensity exercise low or moderntensity exercise in a walking running biking where you can do that easily there's not very much a adrenaline release a adrenaline an a epineferan is really the final common path by which movement of any kind whether not its low level shiver whether not its lifting a bar bell sprinting up a hill or doing along bride a adrenaline is the effector of fat loss it is the trigger end its the effector now i want to turn our attention to compounds that increase epineferon an a adrenaline as well as compounds that work outside the the adrenalin epineferan pathway to increase the rates of fat loss i almost always save compounds and supplements and and things o that sort to the end because i do believe that people should look first toward behavioral tools and an understanding of the science before they look toward a a supplement or a particular thing that they can extract from diet this is mainly to try and shift people away from the kind of magic pill phenomenon or the the idea that there is a magic pill because there really is not and frankly there never will be but there are some compounds that can greatly increase fat oxidation and mobilization and understanding which compounds increase oxidation or mobilization can be very useful if your goal is to accelerate fat loss there are things that people can ingest that will allow them to oxidize more fat and that occurs mainly by increasing the amount of epinephrin that is released from neurons that enervate fat tissue one of the more common ones is one that you may already be using which is affine it is well established that affine can enhance performance if your affine adapted i talked about this in an earlier episodes i one to make trim very clear about this if you are not used to drinking affine and you suddenly decide ism going to drink a big cup of coffee before training you will veto constrict and you will limit performance that is performance if your affine adapted however there is this con of interesting phenomenon where ingestion of affine serves more as a performance enhancer both by increasing alertness but also by way of dilating musculature of allowing more bloodflow now affine for burning more fat for oxidizing in mobilizing more fat is an interesting one it can be effective at dosages up to four hundred milligrams you have to be careful if your coffin sensitive some people of just the littlest bit of affine and their mind goes crazy and their very uncomfortable can have party of vascular effects for some people with hypotension et cameras a please check with your doctor but four hundred milligrams is a roughly a cup and a half of coffee or two cups of coffee nowadays there is a lot more affine in coffee if you go to a typical a gaffe and you are to get there a medium size that would have close to a gram of affine which is why if your a regular affine considering you do not get that gram of affine in your coff each day you will get a headache it can cause constriction and dilation of blood vessels and assets complicated but you will get a headache some people the way they feel drinking a hundred or two hundred three hundred maven four hundred milligrams of affine before training and indeed that will lead to increase fat oxidation it will do that because you will release more epinafferan and a adrenaline let us just place this in the contacts of what we said previously let say you normally do down to cardie s you going out for a moderately intense run for thirty to sixty minutes or think the current recommendation godliness in the states are that a people engage in thirty minutes of moderate intensity exercise five days a week for that is a hundred fifty minutes a if their goal is to improve or maintain health of the party vascular system eighty per cent of people in the united states fail to do that or anything close to it their went we are way below threshold for what the government has recommended in this case the government recommendations i think are pretty good that is a one could always do better of course but eighty per cent of people are uneven doing that however just using the logic in the understanding of how epinefferand a adrenalin is is affecting this fat oxidation process if you were to go out for fifteen minutes and you drank affine before you went yes you will probably oxidize more fat per unit to me can you compensate for the exercise you are not doing just by drinking affine well probably if you were just talking about fat loss if that coffin makes you fidget a lot right the amount of calories that you burn in a thirty minute run unless the run is very intend and your wearing weight vast an its up a hill it is not that great right you pall yet you and somewhere into the for hundred five hundred calories burned area but i said earlier and there allot of datanow the support that fidgeting for a day can burn anywhere from eight hundred to twenty five hundred calories to days you might they will fidgeting better than running ah but it does not trigger the activation and the a positive health facts of the party of vascular system fidgeting alone can be great but you need exercise for other reasons affine can enhance the amount of fat that you burn in any duration of exercise and it can shift the percentage a fat that you oxidize compared to glikecagen unless you take that affine and it ramps you up much that your training really really intensely the bottom line is if you affine and you can use it safely ingesting somewhere between a hundred and four hundred milligrams of coffin prior to exercise somewhere between thirty to forty menses before exercise can be beneficial if we are talking about fat oxidation burning more body fat that is affine there are number of other things that have existed over the years that are in this pathway things a a federal which is now illegal in most states i think may be in all states because people were dropping dead from taking a federal because they were heating up too much it is interesting there it was not direct effects on the heart causing heart attack it could trigger by way of adronergic receptors if you would to know increases in body temperature and heat now there those drugs turned out to be dangerous because peoplewere overheating and dying there is also the big fen fen craze there was a drug that was released a fen fluorine which actually was quite a active as an anti ability drug a treatment for obesity that had to be outlawed as well it was it was mafia approval was removed because again people were dying because a party of vascular effects i do not know if people were overheating on it as well what is the solution if affine is the kind of the the entry point for most people of using compounds to increase the rate or percentage of fat loss in exercise and even at rest what are some of the other things that are are useful and interesting well in terms of tools that are actionable and have reasonable safety margins have talked before about a something called girl p one this is something that a can be triggered by the ingestion of carbamate which is a tea i guess because a half argentine the grew up drinking matiathingos drinking mate from the time i was about three or forty years old i do not suggest that for ids i do not think kid should be in jesting canine but anyway i did it and i still in gestate mat increases g l p one g l p on is in the gluccugone pathways seditious quickly return t our bile chemistry as you recall fat as mobilized from body fat stores and then it is burned up it is oxidized in cells it actually needs to be convert into eh t p and those fatyacids a are century converting to t p in the mite conure of the cell hi insulin prevents that from happening and glucagon facilitates that process gluccugone facilitates that process through increases in g l p one the short take away is mate increases g l p one and yes increases the percentage of fat that you will burn it increases fat burning and that is especially true it turns out from the scientific literature if you ingest mate prior to exercise of any kind if you want to burn more fat drinking mate before exercise is good drinking it at rest when you are not exercising will also help shift your metabolism told enhanced burning of fat by increasing fat oxidation and there is a whole category of farmesuticles that is being developed right now that are in late stage trials or are in use for the treatment of diabetes which capitalize on this g l p one pathway there go by various names and there are people on the internet who are selling these things they are prescription drugs and i want emphasize that they are prescription drugs and you obviously would not want use any of these with without a prescription and a requirement they does seem that they are effective for the treatment of certain kinds of diabetes and lead to fairly significant weight loss and reduction in appetite this is kind of the modern version of g l p one is farmasuticls of g l p one of metabolism are drugs a such as semantical si can never pronounce us cannot seem to pronounce anythings themes a semaglutide is the the way i would pronounce it s e m a g l u t i d e ssemaglutie but that is not the way you pronounce it but sematigalide is the way that it is been described on the inner net in any case this compound increases g l p one it is actually a g l p one analogue in some cases and they go by various types of of trade names the go p one pathway is interesting most people including myself are not interested in taking a prescription drug to increase g p one i do it through the ingestion of mate i just get the mate leaves pour water over it and drink et what is kind of interesting that is not often discuss is that you can increase the amount of g l p one by you a essentially reuse the t the the first time you drink is can be very a very intend and in fact some people find that a that mate it it almost takes burnt leaves its too intents you to want the water to be too hot but i learn the strick from a friend you can reuse the leaves over and over again proxy for about a day before they go bad and in doing that you start to extract more and more of the compounds from the mate leaf that increase girl p one its calico you can on again increased effect what it'll ten it my do is make a at a about sixteen tho thirty ounce of in just spit throughout the day and i do it before i train some people who do not mate might prefer something guy us which is spell g u a y u s a g u a y u essay guys which is from equator despite the u sea ending to its from equator and its is it is a sweeter tasting t does not have any sweetener in it but the leaf of the guava plant is sweeter than the mate plant i sometimes will mix the two and then make the t with that am the there is no mate or guy us sponsor of the pod cases are just tools to increase gel p one and fat occupation and again the sea semaglutide am is the prescription version whereof the this kind of the the heavy artillery gel pe one stimulant and again should be only explored with a prescription those are the compounds that that really increase fat oxidation directly there are going to be a number of things that impact insolent and glucagon the are going to shift the body board more fat burning we talked about a lot of these during the episode on hormones we take about it we did a whole episode on hormones and metabolism and for instance berberine which comes from a plants or met foremen are compounds that are now in a and of growing use for reducing blood glucose they are very potent at reducing blood glucose which will reduce insolent because the job of the hormone insolent is to essentially manage glucose in the bloodstream there are huge gallery of compounds that will reduce insolent and thereby can increase fat occupation and that is because as i mention before fat oxidation this conversion of fat acids into a t p in the mitochondria is inhibited by insolence o if you keep insolent lo you are going to increase that process which brings us full circle back to the issue of diet and nutrition there is really solid evidence from the gardener lab at stamford and from other labs showing that when you look at different diets you look at lo fat diets high fat diets unto diets intermittent fasting provided people stick to their particular die it does not really matter which diet you follow you can still get a colonic deficit and you get weight loss adherents however is always in issue and what i always say is that you want to use the eating plan that is obviously beneficial to your health but the one that allows you to add here to whatever it is that the particular new nutrition protocol is right if you cannot stick with something than it is not very worth while but from the purely scientific standpoint there is also in advantage to keeping insolent low now that does not sisterly mean you go to zero carbohydrate have talked before my preferred way of eating is to go lower no carbohydratethroughout the day for alertness to get that a adrenalin release and the focus that goes with it at camera the ability and to think an move and do all the things i need you you during the day and then i eat carbohydrates at night cause it facilitates the transition to sleep that is what works for me but when insolent is low you do place your system in a position to oxidize more fat and that is what i think a lot of people do we benefit from lower carbohydrate or moderate carbohydrate diets because when insolent is low you are in a position to oxidize more fat both from exercise and at last and i should mention a because i often mention and it is appropriate to mention that if you're interested in looking at the effects of caffeine of mate guy us things to that sort go pe one you want to learn more about those you can go to this wonderful weight which is free examine dot cam you can put in your hamate it will describe the three studies that a show increase fat oxidation both during a exercise and at rest and it as the consequence not surprising an increase in metabolic rate one thing that is interesting about mat is it causes a slight decrease in heart rate for reasons that still escape me there is a single study showing that tartrate is slightly reduced which is kind of nice because if when i drink too much caffeine my heart rate goes ut may be that would increases my fidgeting in my fat burning but i do not the feeling of having my banal tartrate being up too high i my tartrate elevating exercise butt when ism just kind of resting your working and throughout the day and for some reason that i do not understand there is an effect of mate of increasing fat oxidation but reducing tartrate just slightly that is interesting and it probably lends itself to my hat your explains the subjective experience have had of that mate is kind of nice even mellow stimulant it is not this really supercharge stimulant caffeine from coffee or other sources although you drink too much mate you will also make you misery and there is one more compound that i think we should discuss in terms of increasing fat loss and that is carnations or asexual ell carnations they lie in the same pathway we can return to our base i knowledge now of fat mobilization and oxidation after fat is mobilized and makes it into cells and needs to be oxidize the lethally the burning of fat and conversion o it into energy that is accomplished and is facilitated by the presence of glucagon being elevated gale increases that process and insolent being low we talked about some ways to manage insolent both in this episode and previous episode ell carnations and animal el carnations in particular facilitates fat oxidation it conhelps convert fatiacids into a t p and indeed supplementing a carnations can increase fat loss that is been shown at what dosages well people invest anywhere from five hundred milligrams to to grams per day in divided dose is typically some people are really extreme are taking indictable el carnations give certainly not tried that um confess i have used it in oil form from time to time but in part because of the fat oxidation effects but also because of the other effects that it tends to have in exploring the effects that sendal carnations has it has a huge variety of of facts on cellar r metabolism it can reduce ammonia in the blood that is actually quite strong effect it can reduce things sea reactive proline which is you want sea reactive proline levels to be managed you do not want them too high can slightly reduce blood glucose it can slightly increase it steal the good form of of the blood lipid and slightly reduce over all collateral and as i mention it can slightly modify the pathway involving glucagon such that you get a considerable effect not a huge effect on fat oxidation can improve fat oxidation rates it has a number of other effects some of which i talked about during the a month on hormones and a that sort of thing it has strong effects on rates of pregnancy and sperm qualities clearly creating this doing lots of every things and lots a different cells its impacting sperm motility therein a large number of studies supporting that slight reductions in blood pressure and has these interesting effects of reducing fatigue during exercise reducing in inflammatory markers interlunar six t has a number of effects that on the whole are voting positive or at least in the direction of things that you may want and i should emphasize may you certainly do not need a seal a carnations in order to a lose fat but now that you understand the cellar process by which fat is mobilized and oxidized it should make sense that if a carnations important for converting fatiacids into energy then supplementing el carnations make sense a citadel carnations is the type of a carnations or the form of el carnations i should say that is transported and utilized most easily by theory and that is why sometimes we distinguish tween el carnations and aceedalol carnations once again we have covered an enormous amount of material we have talked about the science of fatless and in particular we have explored this topic from the perspective of the nervous system how neurons and in particular the release of things a adrenalin epineferan can facilitate fat mobilization and oxidation we talked about neat fidgeting this non exercise type movement that can greatly increase colonic burn and why that is we talked about shiver another form of non exercise movement that can really increase both colonic expenditure due to the shiver due to the movement as well as increase thermogenesis the heating up of the body through things brown fat and even the conversion of white fat to brown fat which is a good thing if you want oxidize fat we talked about cold as a particular stimulus to induce shiver and how to use getting into and out of cold as a way to stimulate shiver and avoid cold adaptation that you continue to oxidize and burn fat if that is your goal if you want to check out the protocols for that thereat the cold plunge dot calm and in weeks to come were going to be adding more protocols to that website not just for fat loss but for things raziliants reducing inflammation et camera be sure to check those out again those are totally cost free talked about exercise how rather than thinking about cartoon vascular or weight training exercise that we should perhaps look through the lends of this a adrenaline system and how it interacts with fat stores and think about low medium or high intensity exercise whether not we show up to that fated or not turns out showing up to that fasted can be useful if you start with high intensity movements and then move into lower intensity type exercise if you are going to go long duration it probably does not matter unless your exercising longer than ninety minutes whether not you eat or not we talked about caffeine as a stimulant and e stimulus for epineferan and a adrenaline release as a way to axes more fat metabolism and we talked about compounds that come from things bromate and guyucsa tee this girl pe one pathway that can trigger increased fat oxidation much that the pharmosuitical companies are now developing compound specifically to increase gel pe one for treatment of diabetes and obesity but you can leverage the people one pathway through the ingestion of things mate or guys if that is of interest to you and then we talk about a carnations and how elcarnatine itself is critical for the fat oxidation within individual cells the conversion of fatyacids to energy and why having your insolent low and things all carnations and glucagon levels high or sufficient at least to can facilitate the burning of fat fat oxidation we covered a lot of material that is a lot of protocols i realize in that did a the list i just gave right therein even begin to get into all the details and corners that we discussed i hope you have found this conversation interesting both for sake of understanding fat loss and how to lose fat more quickly and to lose more of it if that is your goal as well as simply to understand the biology of fatmotabolism from a different perspective from the perspective of the nervous system if your enjoying this podcast and your benefiting from the information that your

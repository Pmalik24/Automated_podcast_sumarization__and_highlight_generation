welcome to the superman japonicas to science science tace to s i mandruhubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor gotcha panda doctor kitchen panda is a professor and director of the regulatory biology laboratory at the sulk institute of biological studies his laboratory has made numerous important contributions that impact mental health physical health and human performance for instance his laboratory discovered the neurons in the eye end neurons within the brain that regulate our called circadian rhythm circadian rhythms are twenty four hour rhythms and everything from get expression to the overall functioning of tissues are levels of mood and alertness ore ability to sleep appetite and much much more in addition over the last decade doctor panda's laboratory has made critical discoveries in terms of how our patterns of eating over time impact our biology and our health in particular his laboratory pioneer discoveries related to called intermittent fasting also sometimes referred toe as time restricted feeding today doctor panda and i discuss how our circadian behaviors everything from when we wake up to when we view light to when we avoid viewing light to when we eat and what we eat and when we socialize and how we socialize impacts our biology and our psychology and how all of that has a strong impact on our health during to day's discussion you will learn how restricting your feeding to specific periods within each twenty for our cycle or perhaps even exploring longer patterns of fasting and eating cycles can impact everything from the health of your liver to your gut to your brain and how all of that impact things mood end your ability to perform cognitive work indeed to day's discussion goes deep into all aspects of intermittent fasting a a time restricted feeding we talk about the basic science as well as the recent clinical trials that have explored time restricted feeding in a diverse range of people including men women children people with diabetes people who are otherwise healthy and much much more ism quite aware that intermittent fasting is the topic of much debate these days we go deep into that debate and by the end of today's discussion you can be certain that you will have learned all the latest end all the details all made very clear to you thanks to the incredible experts discovery and clear communication of doctor panda as some of you may already know doctor panda has authored several important books on the topic of intermittent fasting and how it can benefit various aspects of health those books include the circadian code and a more recent book the circadian diabetes code both of which were provided link the in the shownote captions in addition if any of you are interested in learning more about doctor panda's work including seeing his publications and reading those publications were supporting his laboratory you can do that by going to his laboratory website which we have also linked in the shownote captions before you begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zerocostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar ow salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called grants in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactrolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doctor slash supermen to claim free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elements doom slash huberment and now for my discussion with doctor machine panda such in doctor panda good to see you again y i got to see we are colleagues still but we used to be read across the street for one another ah ye to those days a ism design that you are here e i think we are going to talk about a number of things mainly intermittent fasting time restricted feeding and health but also the many other thingsthat you are doing just before we started recording we were a discussing your recent paper in nature i at involve recording is from postmortem human retina maybe if there is time at the end we can get back to a your lab has shown that began essentially maintain or resurrect neurons from dead people in order to potentially and eventually provide transplants to rescue vision and the blind that is extremely exciting but of course not the main folks of to days discussions sell have to i splitter up em the first question i have is how am i lupus to define fasting and time restricted feeding in meaning when i go to sleep every night ism not eating in some sense everybody is doing time restricted feeding to some degree or another at what point can we start thinking about a pattern of eating is time restricted feeding called interment an fasting does it have to do with how regular one is about the start and stop times am how do you think about defining intermittent fasting time restricted feeding and may be just to simplify the come reservation is one term more correct than the other items of de scribing the incredible pardon of feeding well that interpreted fasting offs many times of fasting ism actually it started long time ago and it is embedded into the history of call my restriction ism almost hundred years ago people show that if you reduce calorie takin ta rat than that drat can live for a long time and in those experiments the calories were reduced every single day and that led to the idea that if we cot down our calories by twenty percent said than we can potentially live longer by doing two things one is preventing is related disease or even if we fall us a false say maybe we can axcellorat cure and keep the pair mechanasin going that we can live longer but it was very difficult to am count calories every day and reduce lenten that ism by must say that it is not that calcic restrict on is impossible or we are not doing it in fact lot of us we do am count calories in our sub conscious mine and every time you took out at you take out we take out a sora bottle or something am looking about her r in sicticulocallor particle calogilocilocallon we are doing that the point is it is it is we are doing subconscious some kind of gallery a counting but reducing gallery by twenty lady person every single day is not possible for many people then the idea cam in mouse and rat experiment whether they can eat every other day ism and in fact this every other day feeding i also led to very similar almost ecuvaland help him from and as ism continuous call restriction ism then the idea was well every other day is little it hard for months just just mas an you just get to eat an only one day an another day then the idea can well for months can dey eat less for one or two days in the week ism that we to this five two died for people can eat for five days and and two days that reduce calories that is also in tomitarnaly people are fasting ism then as water longer also can with this idea that parody fasting maybe four or five days in every month or two months three months yo can fast o reduce gallery and he also found many benefits focally restriction was there with those studies on humans many of the study started it an mice but a alternate their fasting five to and am water speedily first fasting all of them have now been done in months not for longevity of course because cannot do thus for a long time a but for whet mentonancs for reducing some signs of aging or reversing those things have been done all of them i have been done in humans mostly healthy humans and in some kisses people with a predivities or some aspectual men iblibiis that let t the idea that that all this forms are fasting in which the total caller can take on any given day is reduced for one or more days in a week a month that began that umbrella tom became intimate and fasting it yew look up the scientificultreature most intimate an fasting involves intensionally reducing calories for at least one or two days in a week or am few days in a month when we a public time restricted feeling am the indicate mouse experiments and even now most of the mouse experiments we want to test what is the impact of time restriction wars a gallery restriction in these experiments we do not reduce gallery on any day of mouse life the mice i the same number of calories as the arlivitom ford mice a but still the a health benefit that is what we call it time restricted feeding but since it involves living without for for several hours for some people which is a it can be very difficult are the indicate experiments was done a thouhware done for eight hours of feeding and sixteen hours of fasting that kind of become popular and an that that is a people use the same tom as intomitan fasting and now if few a sane tometan fasting and popular literature of polar milia than people usually refer to time restricted sitting so now coming back to how do you define time restored feeding also the way we have in time to define experimentally and also in a literature is an trying to confine all your engine take from solid and liquid for combine within a consistent window of eight to twelve hours because that is something that double of course people have done time distreetreating with four hour six hours and some people vein try to eat everything within two hours one miller day am the fond is those one not fusible to lenten for very long time for old of people one question about the six hour resist eight hour is twee our feeding window is it important that the feeding window begin an end at the same time never less ye or an if how much flexibility is there for in since ism somebody that i am not terribly hungry in the morning i to drink water usually some caffein an electrolights yin the period before my first meal am mi first me a always land some time between eleven and eleven a m and twelve noon there are exceptions occasionally have a breakfast a proper breakfasts it is call ah i gs toy improper if you're in in passing for me am but typically eleven a m or oneness when i first e my last by the food is typically round and a he thirty nine p m that is what worse for me yes that consistency affording me any benefit see an lets just leave aside sotalclerk number man or future and plan base meat et camera but is there any benefit to shortening that feeding window that we are aware of were extending that feeding window a wore being even more rigid about the start an end of that feeding window yes the start of the kidding window u that is interesting because i an the concept of time the we feeding when i described animal studies at feeding for hew months to edit a the concept a the sign subsection i them that men say a our body has an internal time table a that is present in every cell in every organ am that three programs a many my locular aspects of the sells that let tofido is an all the stuffs of that essentially a there is a are determine time table for every cell every organ to do sudden things at certain time and am the sectarian clocks as you and i know a more sensitive to light light is the most dominant a time giver i for a sample when daylight seeing time changes or when we travelled from one time on to another times on we feel kind of crappy because or daily activities a out of sink from a in ton o'clock that was non for very long time but than one you to cousin to town two am there is a ramose ferment by willy sister from sign and what he did he just fed the mice at the long time m sudden noted on o the night we dos and when he fed a mice during daytime that liver'clock instead of following it is on rooting live o'clock actually started following foot that means by changing our feeding time we can chance we can tune out liver o'clock and subsequently the same experiment has been repeated many times and can we defeated that into thither nine and wefellid out yes i shall outside this bran center call sure ciasmatike new clear or sign which is consider the master sicatian clock almost the rest of the braniven follows when we eat and that came out from petersham bonsai in rope a whether systematically looked at in am places that are were close to the assign an for those who are we know or some deal hypotolamos or barometrical a ne clues all of this within couple up or four five millimeters of the sand but they were following foot you is then am and now if we think about it for a jumble when the daylights haven time changes just one hour chance and or one our change in a linemen between our internal time and external time its to kind of feeling groggy and feeling not at a peak for hormones for one or two days the rule of tom is when the time giver changjust by one hour than or internal clock ex a twisted day to catchup that means if your flying from fella to new york a you've moving throw three times sons than on an hour is it will take three or three days to catch up with the new york time for some people it can be even slower and for some people it can be two days but the borrow mine is yes there is a an decent cronies then what does it mean for the bodies the one of the cogon of clock is to anticipate when you are going to wake up for examples the blodfressors slightly goes out or hatred goes up a breathing goes of similarly for food almost every organ that is enbordent feeding our eating digestion a all of them have clocks even from a live of production there's the fast far of our digestion to secretion of all the digestive person the a stronger and then have person of new try and than liver metabolism everything the whole villas expects wen y a sup as to eat and the getting ready for you to eat the fast meal after fasting for long time that firs breaking the fast or breakfast an and when that time changes when you change it by to or three hours from one day to another than a sometimes are on food in come maybe am well come at a long time we were at the long time and then the that the new eating times suppose ta one day you have been eating every day at eight a an a i ieteryten sos tat when you stare yea your i on when you wen does your feeling win towns shut our sixteen it for round ten hours potage am and then one day if i spitz tor ten and than what happens is a clock is thinking hell the food isn't arrive at get but it arrived at ten maybe to morrow the football arrive somewhere between eight and ten will be a there or nine son they and next day i come back and eight at eight o'clock and i may eat but my clock is not ready to digest that for that is why this idea is you hard to consistent a to take advantage of this anticipatory activity ofofclock in efferent system to get the best out of it is there evidence that those anticipatory systems in am as they relate to digestion help us better a simulate our food i would imagine even if you have the master us sister in help digest the praying fats an corroborates an the already deployed at the time when you eat i can imagine that foot will be better you is than if you do not am in other words what is the advantage of having these anticipatory signals ism in terms of a potential health benefits the anticipate is signal is really important from even even from working up m there iran why many people feel not ready completely when they work up when alarm clock because the alarm clock works you up but your body is not prepared that slipping as after working out when alarm clock is dear to our body is not prepared for that and then the best example is when the o when am the daylights having time changes particularly hand we have to was up one hour early what happens people who have under lying heart condition am when they are waking up when the body is not ready your heart is not ready and all office the hart has to start popping little retard or and there is chance of hart a tat an in fact a people have looked that hospital records and the the find that on those days and there is a start rise in hartartacts an decor accidents and caraccidents too because your bran is not cording at did you cannot a me of fined assistance that is a great example of anticipatory activity but coming back to digested wanting is am and this is something that many people might have experience the many of them in our digestive system and one of the them is our loo our intestine has the sparstaltiy function it kind of contraction expanse and that most for to food does move you to gravity sit goes back an foot and that bet static acts on actually slows down at night a few hours after our last meal and am that is why when people eat late at night for example a then that for does not get digested because there's not enough nicest in yes outing and second even if it gets digested in this tog it does not more fropaly then the next morning people get up and think i of course not peoplepon yon some uncle ho petty oft on a nude think that this is hang but those who do not a con you macaw an they've the food hang because it does not dies that is one extreme y jamplof a for i did long time can i heady port i belong time can be cot o junk ye have um experience that were if have worked later i could not eat dinner or something and then i get home i always debate weather or not to try and sleep but if ism too hungry oftentimes it is challenging and for me sometimes consuming something that it least seems easily digestible board or something in a liquid form i is better for me than if i eat a meal have made a mistake of going to the refrigerator being super hungry in eating bunch of food it ten or eleven p m and then falling o sleep and indeed the sleep if ism tired enough can be quite deep but the next morning i feel just completely physically in and cognitively weighed down i think it what you just describe makes a lot of sense is it if some one were to select o a feeling window regardless of whether not it wasn't a classic interment fasting time or stick of feeling sounds eating your first bite of food in eating your last bite of food at more or lest the same time each day has benefits i have this question you mention feeling verses eating and i think it is actually not just a a dramatic as it romantic issue and here's why we tend to think about when you take your first bite of food and then when you take your last bite of food but course foods digested different raids for fat in there is can digest make harbors just slower et camera men there all these adjustments to the li see my index and forth with foods and commination i is it better to think about not eating but you are fed state and blood sugar for instance i often get at on sociomedia does blank break a fast i and i to think about it scientifically cookie is does plain water break a fast no does air break a fast no does one grain of sugar of sucrose break a fast well probably not but does one teaspoon of sugar break a fast well you could say yes but transiently i mean when we are talking out breaking a fast are we talking about a rise in blood glue coasts or are there molecular signals downstream of of a rise in blood glue coasts that i cannot be reverse an other words if in can eat my first meal every day at noon and man eat my last a bite of food at eat p m and at nine a m for whatever reason have coffee with one teaspoon of sugar in it i suppose in the strictest sense have broken my fast but maybe by if i went for a hard run that morning maybe by nine thirty a m an back in a coda cot fasted states what is the fasted state really because when ism eating at eight p m just to give another example ism start fasting at eight or one perhaps ye but i have my blodlucosis ill of eats ism not really fasted i in fed ye is just that ism not eating the verb right a a you i again i i do only get overall detail just for sake of getting detail but i think a lot of the confusion out there about what breaks a fast ye is related specifically to this issue ye which is if i eat a whole pets after sitting round all that it is very different thin i i eat a how pets a after having run or twenty six soul marathon that y very different ye am metabolically speaking how should people think about fasted verses fed it can we be mildly fasted verse a severe fasted can we be am fed is verses very fed anyway i i as stop a asking questions now because they all relates the same thine ye now dis a am very interesting question an tan unfortunately as you can as you have you might have seen in life am the most obvious questions are often on man sad because it is hat to do this dam experiments because if you really want to address is in humans sure to bring hand o them in isolator just you said i can now imagine planning five or six different explainments each explaments word in ball eight or tan volunteers its agenda sex and then do it sits difficult and now let us go back to see how do e a less diet it an in himself san in drat calerymatri for example in dirt callrymatry is best on this principle that what oryx iran we brethren an cabin dead we a breakout if you can measure ti still than we can figure out wither body in total we we are not saying whether it is the liver a got or fat or muscle in tort of others a cosmic bucks or fat as another source the idea is when we fa when we have without food for several hours tan ideally a body will tampon to glacosan first an than to little bit of fat and than when bod is muscle running on fat than that dress a senor to to origan will come to point seven am but what is interesting we can do this experiments an mice we can go to mi an ascot is o what happens in mice an mice mice a little very different because mi a not simply little people there the metabolism is deferent they sit relatively less like cousin an he months til in toms a fa too matavlis i they overnight within twelve to fourteen hours the adding respiratory expenses yo a thisresio will go from one when the consuming mostly glucose of carbohydred as see as i sos vital slow down slowly go to point seven porn seven five sapper twelve to fourteen hours that kind of mostly running on fat now as we give them food am within ten or fifteen minutes that not actually consuming couple of grans of food an they might have consume a hundred to hundred milligram of that chat it is less than a fie push the foot then the aria will immediately begin to rise as if that small amount of food stop that fat burning prosit and can got the am carbide burning proves when you say fat burning process you mean body fat store being burned right not dietary fat crept yes er is all body fat since that that is what said an we do not know when that fat is being burn because we are us measuring how how much mice is bidding in and out am for a sample it can be from the skin subcutaneous fat or belly fat or but not dietary fan now by that time the diet fat is all the abjured and digest end and hopfullits as sitting in the liver i de position some when but it is the fat as body fat yes thank you for at you have the reason i ask is that nowadays i think more than half of the battles about nutrition that i see on line relate to this issue were i will not name names but some one will come along and say a lo carbohidry died allows you to burn more fat an end the more enhance o people out there will say well that is true but you are also talking bout dietary fat the word fag infuse people i realize you are not doing that you ere certainly to when the people guilty of doing this but indeed you eat more fat you'll burn more fat but that isn't mean you'll burn more body fat an fat i think the dad i say that under conditions of for restriction you will actually burn lass i yet do not gat pro yet i brother yet am pitch fort sir sand a through the man toward me an on that one but but i thing that is true whereas people who can some carborhydric can still burn body fat even though the majority the feel there burning is from carbohydrate a here in this case per sample for mice we know that as soon as they start eating am the aria goes up coming that to yo costa what would the ideal for us to do the explainment would be skin will go back to that and then give the mouse may be hundred telegram of food and mass on iron in the was and then well continue to measure to see how long it takes for the mouse to come back in them that is one us howlet e am let us stay on this and then it'll come back and talk about non cleric for and how whether that is considered t i to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens a letter greens now called eh g one is a it him in mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have ben taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve some deleted that their sponsoring the pod cast there is ma story taking athletic greens and the reason i still take at tic greens once or usually twice a day is that it gets o be the probiatics that i need for got health a got is very important its populated by got mycrobioda that communicate wit the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics in at lentic greens are optima and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains an number of adaptions fitments and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste cry if you to tryathletic greens you can go to at lentic green stock calm slash humored and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic teens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a yer supply of it i in de three c too again that is that lentic greenstone cam slash humored to get the five free travel packs and the year supply o it him in de the c to there is a famous experiment that was published last yer by gortacahasis slave and it cam out in sides and that lets to calorecrestriction and we kind of started to deck dead we would start a dis cuss on that the at explauments were done with caritrestrition and three such as get the duce gallery conjenson by twenty person or twenty person and get that food the rats and then subsequently mice an they all lived longer what is interesting is an and all those experiment an there is such as cam an get this bullas of food at one time what's the a liaison fared mice or rats the her asses to food all the time there eating all the time an then this tats a were given twenty person less and what happens is this mice o rats that going to take that less for which is rest a now and just it libel of fa lunch on an snack after three hours or snack often thus they would bubble of all that food within two to three hours maximum four hours foot is gone there sort of on the mad i the one meal day ye the almost in one miler day to the four hours foot is gone a even a can four hours sting of firing and twenty hours fasting an then the question became well the benefit of calratestrition as we know is it demo e ducked carry or time distracted feeling o time there is a timing conform to it that they are eating all of that within throw the four hours and then there is a long fasting and this the difficult question to ants because now sodas this poor grantor an n certacnicience to come and split that food into eight or ten or fifteen different small persons and then give them to mice in every two hours an sir gotta chassis who actually polish the fast paper in twenty seventeen showing that most calrictrestricson for in i man he used the protocol that was used by call restriction feel i actually clears e condition of time restriction he sold that an then he went back and worked with engineers to come up with the smart kids where am he could actually tell he got program how much food is given to mice at what time of the day or night completely program then he took this a for examples suppose the the adliveton fared mice it is a five grounds of she in a day and if you want to reduced galleries by a twenty person tan the we a mouse would get foregrounds of food and e divided this and to nine or ten meals and then give them in every ninety minutes and this guess thing small meals throughout the nights there is no fasting he can say that shall the smalls actually is not getting into fasting because in every few hours is i getting some food and then he measured how long the mouse is going to live am and he used am e countmints and this is a very stand pot o call people count showman mice a dying on which day and then examined them to see whether they died because the there was an accident of the actually there is a neutral cards and then the calculate at the end what is the an half a lice fifty person survival an because that is on another is that a good in dictator because if there is an outlier that t live for long time than that can skew what as interesting was the arliverton fared mice of come the live certain number of days and than this gallery restricted mice that never got into super fasting but kind of eatings snacking throughout the night that also live ten person extra then person longer that means caller restricts on extended life fan by ten person have wondered about this because recent we there is been there were bunch of news head lines about intermitting fasting and and frankly i was frustrated if you looked at one major news out wat they would say time restricted feeding of fords no additional benefit beyond door restriction for wait loss ye then a another popular press than you what is call it that same study described as time restricted feeding does not work ye right and then another on er may be some place a even more extreme year time r stricter feeding only beneficial because of colonic restriction or something lie that we essentially got are three different interpretations of the same data all of which are well two of which are true one of which is false in myth onion but what i think people take away from that as oh time restricted feeding is not valuable which is not the case it i think for many people it is a convenient way to eat because at least for people me it is simpler to designate between portions of my day when i meeting portions of they my day when ism not eating as suppose to eat a portion control you have rather people portion control can work but all of that is related to either maintenance or loss of weight none of it deals with the potential health benefits independent of wait loss ye right and i i think that a if we can segment those out a obviously in humans its hard to no if a given treatment are experiment is extending life because you not really know how long people live anyway y right whereas with mice you have some cense of and the mortality was likely to recur what can we say about time restricted feeding and longevity in terms of bookmarkers or in terms of any other indication that people who start and stop their feeding when you at a consistent time somewhere between eight and twelve hours per twenty four hour cycle are tilting the scales towards living longer a supposed to living shorter this example of this nesarical a do men is real interesting because that dullest dos a duracasis a study because i describe that if the spit calories an nitro de de the to dent the the mice live ten posnextra but if few now give mass the same caloriestricte diet and fid de living daytime wet o within twelve hours say two hours then the mice live ten post extra beyond that yes twenty person anyone's case o ley make sure i understand that i that i make sure i understand if you take a certain number calories and you distribute them throughout the twenty four hour cycle ye it is cleric restriction the mice will live ten per cent longer ye if you however restrict that to the active cycle y the for humans the but daytime then twenty per then they live twenty per cent long honey posse it is not just total color can take y a meaning it is not just important to be submaintenance and calories forsake a longevity it also is important as to when in the twenty four hour cycle you eat those calories to i have that right now that still this try is not ova because this me for forgiving daytime on the not suppose to it that is right for us o wild be the equivalent of being on the night shift and only eating at night but a subcolori ya sub maintenance carry diet i guess its a i what to say but went fed is during nighttime on the suppostoit and the same getting the same number of calories within the boys or two hours and the nicely thirty five person longer than the control thirty five per cent longer sale the human life spend w in a we do not know but but thirty five percent longer we mean that am and again no one knows but am humans now what is the average more charity in the unites say somewhere re were life ex yes i surrounded the use to bet you slow a tedious little bit because of your it but leste eighty o case of people then a living somewhere between twenty five and thirty five years longer ye hare n putting some marrobory ye e ye may as that us a really profound but now you pointed out am byamarcer another stops and now if you look at any given time within that experiment and actually down back and am had a separate cart of mice very similar and that he could take is samples and of course in the scare you have the sacrifice the mouse and he looked for a it did lot of molecleranalisis wit non macros for example hemoglobin a one see coal an to locos control cholesterol all the stuffs he could not find anything that predicted the benefit of calories region tat means in this experiment font of or we now far the predictor of longevity none of them would predict for the this am see are only mouse which it too ten night that mouse is going to live less than the night fare mouse that was going to live tarty my twenty five for om extra does that mean that they are by markers relates a on levity that we just have not discovered yer ye that is erectly that means what awe we know far about by markers a those he could not use to credit maybe there as a lot of nice maybe he wanted he had to use more number of mice to get that because in of bymarkes and not going to predict in every instance of they som er what is also very interesting is if you look at the body where ton body compassion of all this mice there is no difference in body person both composition across all these differ a us all this grots doesn't matter when they at y provided they were submit sob calloranents carry intake a was fewer calories than is required to maintain their weight in matter what pattern of eating they were the same way yes that in many ways seems to me make the human studies were thy say look it does not really matter whether not you use sort restriction in or were you start your reseeding window in the morning or star you feeding win now in the evening or you am were you portion control for sake of wait cone loss beta a taking i not sort of that and non another thing with the human study that o we reverend to her am that in that human study people are actually already eating within ten hours window habitually when they selected this people to have them and roll in the study there a already eating for ten hours and fasting for a fortis hours all participants had to reduce that callorican tie and the i ducked by almost twenty five person the see at group continued with ten hours sitting wind and the see at loss time restricted wo had toe the same number of calories within eight hours it is just a two hour difference suggested to hours difference o we that people i just one may sure people can understand is in this human study which is the one that i felt that the popular press venue all except one value am got either same wrong or badly on interns their conclusion that was my interpretation anyway was that either people came into the study eating basically in a ten hour feeding window which i goes back to my first question which is that most people are not eating in the mill the night ye or if there on shift work and they are then there sleepings sure in the day anyway there reading in a ten a twelve hour feeding winy anyway we saying they either did colonic restriction portion control within the ten hour window or another group within the study eight sub maintenance calories to comic restriction see are as we calling it the carnal see a but recut to that to an it our feeding window and they did not see any difference in terms of weight lost ye but i lot the no not all that surprising right i mean if it is just a two hour difference ye exactly we have done that experiment and my son we do not see am difference in not only wettest many of the markers and i was telling you about this am gortacasis paper where i told you that he allowed this mice to eat within two hours or twelve hours sub generic wait two or twelve two or twelve yet that is dramatic but still he did not she stands in longevity even within those two that means am when you do kelly constriction and than at least per mots and you are within twelve or window am that is that is giving be mice the best benefit the demon benefit and m two three or five or twelve are mouse does not matter at least for longevity can we conclude for humans that whether not a feeding window is for hour six hours eight hours or twelve does not matter provided the calories a or similar or same were i will not go to that extend because we do not know many of this a particularly we do not know how the sort or eating window will affect both success because and o we all listing many of this most experiments even that i tolly anon those a don only in malice but that should be changing right because the in a age i know this cause i on study section which is just a month or people who report who review grants is that every grant now has to include sexes biological variable you last to get away with a am or rather i should say the way it should we stayed which is people are required and show want to look at these phenomenon in male and female mice yes especially if there are differences in times am the many omens there is also another people am in time disco deleting that also came out the big apple going that they a comoisinnasis was accounting for loss in fat mas in time disco fed mice that is also done only in male mice am this is am we are paying artenson to it we are now doing all vapor studies in male and female and wed si big differences between male an man coming back to humans what difficulty happens is when you're trying to do four hours or six hours o time reiterating people will inadvertently reduce the caricanting it just because of got volume i tried one only one for a day and and i felt i was eating much at that one sitting y that it led to lot a gastric distress and i are tired after the male and part reason i to do time restricted feeding as i have more energy ye and certainly in the fasted state i feel more energize especially if ism investing or canine or something ye a people lie us am an o yontakan then some people are more active they can actually unconsciously the may be spending more energy in the physical activity and bissau me a widget all of this combined than homosaitin and that can have i very ad busiffect in long tom because we now that this and o e deficit an in packers am simply victim for that is call the es detective an ode deficit in sports re of energy deposit in sports oke ye s because nearly forty person of aglets am not the ana fell is but the lot of people who do trackman field am and nearly forty person of alters actually experience this reds her ten without knowing can male and female sleds both veeries are rads it is reds are e d as a he always is an soy relative energy deficit in his furors interesting is the first i have heard this acronym we have a new acronym folks is is gid that to a list of other acacias but i males and females can experience it we are w in females have heard that am reds am can lead to a emit a rear loss of of men of the menstrual cycle ye that is a common that a soprevean at in fact many women many female tales they take it for granted that yes if they are more active than the lose the menstrual cycle which is a which may be common but it is not normal or often tamper help and even if they do not want to get pregnant ye ye eye a we had an expert on female hormones come on it and say the very same thing that regular cycling is a is very well of a oblatory menstrual cycles is important to trying am maintain ye them it that is one but then what is really concerning is am it does affect bone heart and am in this state people actually o a long were of time the nosecone mas and the bone also becomes more phone to injury micro fracture and fractures am again its the risk means if some people are trying to eat within very short time in their physical active that happens and it also has impact on a mind the reason why these women are losing menstrual cycle is there am it peg axis is disrupted hypotolamas pituitary gonads axis and it starts in messtardin in off string at hypotolamas a tutors to that means that it is be a axis hypiotolamas pituitary and a drinalaxis may also get disrupted one of the symptoms of reds is also the pressor anxiety bipolar symptoms and we know that many am many alerts experience that we think that well this this may be just professor that always trying to compete and we know them unfortunately their few alters who just cannot count and the many are temptertryside or beside this is a serious issue and am there is also another new topic in the laugh to come up with ta mouse model of reds and then study it a but this is one this why we a not reduce screaming interval to two but to one meal a very short time a because it can have atborside effect that we don't known now am maybe in future will figure out when we systematically study them there are studies that are published going four hours and six hours time restritarating has benefits on witless but those arson healthy individuals and they are in the studies o the am and on the study came local a were allege monitoring the mature that there is no sudden wetcloss or witless below am some sept level a those are very different from regular people who are who maybe even normal wet a even wit a within the healthy rents if they do than they can potentially that my what we think is eight or ten hours maybe the ideal spot to begin with and am once you are physically active and you are also spending a lot of energy and physical activity of sports you can even go of to twelve hours because in mice we have done that experiment am of to twelve hours the dose get lord benefits not all but this is twelve ours of twelve as or feeding a vows or pasting am in humans am again nobody has done systematically twelve hours but there is one study in rope am from ten high collect lav and t and i and i we collaborates of they used or my civilian clock a this is ha resort ship we develop just to this is mostly used in time resulted eating studies and an he had nearly i think he started with two hundred suits a participants but teenage and he selected and to the small number of grub people where very an meticulous of what recording all their for divided them into usual feeling whatever they wanted to eat one over they wanted to eat and they were given the a advice of swim new person advice that is given to improve health and reduced old lookers almost the it's preevenson program in the hers and then the other group was given advice to eat within twelve hours an this was very early on in time we treating and we thought that the mice for getting some benefit let try with t he twelve hours has any benefit and the bottom line is and the end of a three months and six months wert an he reported is both roofs lost same amount of bodywet an and than there as not too must significant difference between roofs but both goods actually improve their health the bottom line is the swim newpresonal advise that he was giving an which is the standard of care there it a chevy the same amount of outlaws as just giving people this advise that eat within twelve hours one way to look at it look at the resolvers this and and then he went to more extent and actually look that every single meal the people conium dor close to i think close to sixty or seventy thousand mildrecors and pictures he went to and then classified them to say whether these are and good quality food o the call it the nova classificuson on to the for one is the food that e can almost eat for frogs vegetables and your good daily frolics that you can almost without any preparson and then second an never two is can of home for a home cook food that most people will prepare in few minutes and than three and then fourth one is the food that i can never prepare at home for example visit or cookies that we usually punches and few o to this and usually the never for or one the oltraposas food of which we should not be ratings or the advices to reduce nobody for and what he found was a people who got all this advice an to re improve that nutresen quality they actually improve than inpresen quality the reduce that never for for and people who were in timely stating the et we did not twelve hours they did not chance than imprison quality but what is interesting is the both got the same modest fellows that begs the question that in the meybitan hi would do this experiment to combine nuts on advise with time restriction and maybe it deals the time to ten hours and that might help am twelve hours is some ting that i say any one from five year or two hundred year old can do and am if yo are trying to lenten wet that might be a good way and combine that with exercise all great and y an people can more easily avoid reds in the way women and for non at least or recreational exerciseercises women if they distribute their calories across twelve hours or less likely to lose the menstrual cycle yes sir and this is something that we have to look carefully they have to be because we do have the micicatyan cook have that many people download and self monitor in the sal the deteforisuches and we will not provide link to that by the way it is a great is a great sun debut once in a while we do get is import from some women saying oh i started doing year timelessating and i am seeing all this woodlands son than i ask them axis what else are you doing the digitally improve the nutysan qualities o hating only solar and few and the trying to incline the fiver intake and it is really hard to eat much of uncool for because cooking helps to at her monnetent and that at the same time that running five miles every day and of course all of this combined candy to reds symptom that is y twelve i think is a good point if a combining an physical exercise and better nutty some quality because in me also we have seen that if misdating healthy food and whiting within ten to twelve hours than they also live longer than is that ting healthy for but distributing that carry of a long per of time and this is am a handy cabs am finding from an its he has systematically done the study with two different times of diet and in mice and he finds the same thing that even ms that waiting within twelve hours they do live longer than mice that it annoy even herdic i i recall a recent study i think he was either provision reports or reports n action for give me for not metering which both of course self press journals excellent journals which explored time restricted feeding in the contact of lo carbohydrates were non locorborhydra dies is lo carbohydrate verses lo carbohydrate an time restricted ye these a colonic match y rite between groups and then non locarborhydra dies sos you re standard i think he as somewhere in the neighborhood of sixty per cent of cowage from complicit corborahydrates and and as i recall the a the greatest weight loss ember sane calories across groupfolks a was achieved with lo carbohydrate pluscolor i restriction ye am and i wondered why all the popular new vans did cover that study am that that one bringing it now i thought this is really interesting and and ism somebody who is cycled low carbohydrate diet em before i find it hard to sleep after about three or four days of being on a low starch ye i just personally i saw to each some starches especially if exercising intensely your working intensely thus just a little editorial there that but look i know many people who do just feel better on a low carbohydrate die but wat what d you think of those data because it speaks to the idea that oke it is not just the total number of calories it is not just the quality of those calories it is the timing of those calories and maybe carbohydrate restriction in conjunction with time restricted feeding might be the best path for people who are looking to lose wait my i tortalyeg that when it comes to a nuts an quality quantity in timing all this three mate nearly forty present of people who lenten hadiboribet because sixty lessen or of wed be forty person a listening hadiboribet and not of those forty present out say nearly security of them a very a whereabout how mush hating and to quality a forget i see your really an optimist you looking at the forty per cent of the glass that is a or shall we say potful the that there was a pun intended but the no it is a very interesting way of looking at rather than saying in a we or six you per scent of america o beast a saying wire forty per cent dato beat they'd a very interesting way to look at it yen's in am sup consciously wot all was making dendicism inti know meantime our that you are not going on eating am tisbongon every day because am you ant to you know ye exactly i would not you good ye i enjoy it cheeseburger now and again but i am no not certainly not this stage were any stage of my life i think that am i think people i actually think the panda fatal to to do with us i think that people started to take a look at what they were doing to support were not support their health generally i know people gained a lot of waiting the pandemic other people got really into fitness have seen some college t you have always maintained am a you have always been in good shape ashes for some give senior and while you seem to of age backwards you are at a a poster a for your own am ideas and hypotheses about time roster feeding but but i am i notice that during the pandemic an number of people emerged from the pandemic in better shape other people in much worse shape it seem that as a it was a bimodal distribution the a am ye i get the sense that starting and stopping eating at more or less the same time each day even if cleric restriction is not the main focus has additional benefits am can we talk about some of those benefits as they relate to the other things that in packed health for instance if you are starting and stopping eating at more or less the same times each day are you sleeping better are you getting more predictable a sh its in otherness and sleepiness i can you project when your few good enough to exercise ye an my we coal talk about the because you of course am are well known for time restricted feeding and science around that but also other things as well am not the least of which is circadian by ology generals i was think of the main timekeepers for our system being feeding whit activity the and social connection ceramics it many temp and temperature ye ye how do these combined with one another and using timing that we begin in stop feeding is kind of an anger point we explore the lout ye and are we got into this am beginning an and anon we you ask for the gallery how much gallery will break the fast am one thing that i want m the listeners and views to bring back to this timing up when a wen you are breaking the fast because we quiet health with wit body wet and a that is when we are talking for nation quality and quantity because both of them have impact now let us think about mental health was lot of people the toggle with mental heart they have anxiety a a depression and also am sabot health because and the lot of people who also have deserve flog or had on and we know that see deploys or had on can be exams of created by coffin and takin empty stomach an those who have eserdeflox or had on their iron to them then am having black off in the morning before any food m cannot set their stomach that is my in those cases is very clearly that coffin for them becomes the trigger an that is something the fool i supposed to come and a the stomach is not seeing the foods is over reacting producing excess entered and that comes up to the so fags and that for their expense an if people have that kind of condition and may be destroy consider when they doing their fast coffee i is breaking there overall fast or kind of putting them putting the help at drink for see flags the other thing as people who have anxiety panic attack am we know that coffin can gas you a especially on an empty stomach especially hon i am to stomach but them again coffin can be a trigger that is why an i want to kind of the trencher that there is this mental health and other aspects of heart and these are too clear examples fer anxiety panic attack related to bran heart or see flag related to a got heart a in those cases when we consume that cation in the morning can affect you avoid coffin in the morning naturally an here is the interesting a history about captain and this is something i did not know and an as once invited to this a history of nighttime activity and maybe we can take a little bit of get and talk about a night time activity because that passengers me at thisicadian pilots cause of a last two hundred thousand yearsments we assumed that humans homosappience ever two hundred thousand years ego we have been as the species we have been living on this planet for two hundred thousand years and only in the last e can say couple of thousand or five thousand years when we came to control fire or maybe can even go back to hundred thousand years the some divert an than the question is well when we control fire and we lighted of the fire and we could light up when what we wanted we can artful and we can stop the fire when we do not want it that is the we ability in humans the differentiates them from all the other species no other species we can always say yes there are signs of this intelligent an thesis on making for example we know many crows can make thisison many many animals they kind of figure out started i how to get food but control live of fire e something very specific to human and when we started a controlling fire fire did not essentially extend the day because fire creeper day evening there as very different from what people i during the day and what people use to do doing day they wat the loments gathering food who has almost everything that we did and in the evening after the after the after we brought our food mostly tubers or may be lentils to cook or once in a while animal that we can we could barbecue an all of the things happened around fire and fire was expensive that it was mostly to minor fire if you go back to for example mail and all this unclear sorry an a populations that have no access to electricity and a still living and of that a historical life a fire is a coming event and the sat around the good food and then what happened they did not talk about walk the talked about an culture the tar the sang the danced they a strartagiyes an that is or politic started philosophy started signs started all of this things that a very unique human civilized started around fireside chat an an that if it think about it we re still doing fires id chat the only thing is we have the mineral with and the tip television our already as now e chapter o was so i still we are hood to that evening at activity because that is when we are completely free from the pressor of the work and we want w express ours of that hour independent kind that is why most people find it very difficult to do time sharing and story eating at six o'clock because it is in gan in our in you even be ana that we want to eat and vocalizes in the evening now unless fast for and see warmly roll of coffee in this if you look at coffee con ocean particularly caff a where people can come and have little tub coffee and sisal it also started as he evening activity and am this is an am now we can go back to istanbo because that is wane less where coffee caff is started in mid sixteen centuries we are talking out fifteen forty to fifteen seventy am and that is when a ism sorry ism for getting the new of historians who who usually invited me and a get is new hamal a kaffada and a i must be butchering the am but it'll sri we pe i the showing in the wonderful thing about for comedian somebody will saw on ut the proper pronunciation is a great opportunity if the proper pronunciation please put it in the comments on outer a lass am even checking wright now in my a an not library is not picking of thar a si won't wen o at being arioso what happened was an coffee was introduced and am people cam and a ran coffee and talked about politics at night at night at evening and it actually started with a with a sure branch of his slam because they are the once wo a consumed coffee in the evening and this is the branch of slam where they actually sing and dance and all that happened in the evening singing dancing am by the super and and here in stable people started congregating and having a a talk about politics but then are on the same time am some an o in take there was a good alible number of a muslin who have to do pie prayers to day number of prayers a set time the most prayer is very early in the morning and then the figwort out that if they wake off and immediately have coffee then they can stay awake for the first prayer and in that way they felt very good they walk up i say that i mud started as a morning drink to stay away and kind of get get on with the day but what happened was i don't although you however tried toffs coffee it is very take i a few years ago right before the pandemic twenty nineteen i travel to turkey is farewell the food is amazing the coffee is indeed very very thick a am and i have a pretty high caffein tolerance a am from drinking much coffee in yerbermate over the years and still do i really enjoy it but am ye it is it is very intense and what your saying is that am coffee an take started as away to extend into the night an ability to extend in to the night at all was because of the ability to harness fire and then coffees stimulatory properties were leverage toward morning a which is essentially the way i think about it we did not episode on caffeine and some a some one else michael gallant not i described it this way thy you serve taking alone out on your energy bank account y coffee you are suppressing the adenosine system a was he makes you sleepy but that a medicine system will kick in later your your it is a credit card of sort with an interest e right i and the interest being am an energetic lag that you are going to i experience in the afternoon but what happened was with the a strong coffee am that we hadron an side post loropepl then the state eating something withcoffee and that a de called a breakfastate in turkey a coffee actually led to the development of breakfast not the other way around and that a ya that is very hardening a no again no on intended a for the a the affine a lovers among us i i which i count myself pathos si see ai i t for biform coffee became breakfast you kind of give something to your an to stomach o is busy digesting that and than hands coffee constant it is not reacting to coffee a giving am esirepox it was not this fascinating it was not that breakfast is necessary on its own it was essentially a offer against the gastric distress caused by affine and i tan that called and send that context a we cannot said o what a dissenting hap and and all over the was be coffee is not condign but step people eat something in the morning you said you start your a first meal at all the days around eight what time do you wake up to wino run six if i said it is what time you have your first fine silly i have that is i brought of this a story because i have coffee after my breakfast fantastic ism a big proposing of delaying caffeine and take for a few hours after waking for other reasons that i might listeners of at heard me talk about endlessly i will not bother with that now but i think am allowing a the sufficed to say that allowing some of the natural waking up signals to occur yunusing light to kind of clear away and a medicine to further extent and activity at is better than using as it implant but until a few hours later this is fascinating because a never thought about the link between extension in to the night socialization for socializing rather feeding and fine sachem kind of am speaking what many the reach saran and this dis particularly this fireside chat am forgetting again the name of the scientist i thinks is from invest of wassington into am she wen to africa and kind of recorded what with lar talking of course ye could not understand what ever talking twitter and whether not tablas talk is going o of course just just getting folks and then came back and ta o fall and then we got out tat the what you talking giving has time and in the evening bat a different am si see what a they talking about at night you a exactly this is the that talking about a match making and talking out qualities and tastratagizing to fatherhood or or even singing and dancing a this is a if you think if we think about it how we manners sunset too bedtime what we do between sunset and bedtime a gets mostopohelt i on to think about that for a moment i totally agree am and by the way ism a huge believer and and ism in living in great hope for the idea that right now i do think that sciences understand a lot more about the different stages of sleep slow we sleep asleep et camera then we do active waking states this we talk about being focus or being alert but that is not those are not scientific terms as we know but i do believe and have noticed a distinct difference between the first eight hours of the day in terms of cognition and we know that the catacolomeans ore t much high levels plus sort is also down and courseall up and f ran all of that is really it much higher levels than in the later evening and that this evening time it not certainly in the contacts of mental health we know that morning in evening we are basically different creatures yew ye goleallit ye that is why i i think in the evening if you think about it am again this is a i an another set of rests from am my good friend forasio for tiglasius ye oh ye ye a big fan ragas another he is a fellow argentina occasionally we riff about things relay to that but he is a wonderful biologist are you lest collaborating ye is a his and of a i say his very humble and gits a lopropile but he does amazing mason vest monandry he does desks that a we want to know but nobody is ready to do it because fidrisas is very difficult to go to the whines a go to the places where there is no electricity and then record ism when this people i eating sleeping or in the scars activity opposite to light n that or torassia has done and i he puts this act watches is kind of i more ism activity tracker ism better little bit more fine betas it also collects a light in for mason what i found was most of this agent and to us who have no access to electricity they would consistently go to bed some between three to three and half hours after sunset this is very important because we all as thing that am our ancestors when they did not have deficit as son as the sun wen down there is a friend o sleep now the fire extended the evening they were staying awake for three to four hours kind of in om ism decompressing themselves that we say and and doing all this i activity's cooking saying meals and an they will go to sleep and if you look at the sleep onset the it it was very small they're going to bed almost within fifteen to tarty minutes stanza divers us sir no night hours verses morning people the scaly we will get none of this this the m i i get a tack by for many reason such as goes with the business i in of being public facing these days but every time i talk about viewing sunrise or low angle sunlight getting some sunlight e ring i some one says won ism a night hound they just in its some a a protest of trying to protect identity it's be come this ideological i i i identity related thing ism a night you ism a morning person i am not but you telling me that in these cultures where there is not electricity but there is fire people or going to sleep within all of them within about fifteen minutes of one another ye there is no such thing as a night hour morning person in the an er as to i shall asked him pointedly because i i and that is enough it he has not sin man say as drag hundreds of people in if we ask the many many sleepy such as a at list the public fishing sleep physicians a export they will said yow we can say one tart of people o night all one tar of morning and and on tar in bitter in but thither call my bearers wolfs and and ism not being ti surging of that i my i think people really do feel as as if they orient towards one pattern or another when i was an one great to and i never when to bed before midnight and actually midnight was my going to bedtime exactly eleven forty five it'll try to get ready to hit bed an an by twelve an in bed tan i use to get up at six six fifteen it is o o that is a pretty short sleep with an alarm of course and but then daytime is to take forty five minutes one hour nap and there is regular even if i whenever i got time of course in call aunt you do not have the whole get in in high school do not have of puts the to nap but i callas you can i might have been one of those kids with his fury on napping on the desk but they come around and the wake you up yes what did i an this gs just come back to the demand am after lunches only aster pica am then in gradschool i remember i dearly went to bed be for to e and i could have clearly said that ism a night all and actually was it not night all as very comfortable staying off at as they productive doing explain an striking all this am landscapes mostly and but then afterwards a one a look back i in stock when i had a when we head or dogger am than thinks started sending because you have to but the baby to sleep and than after the baby's slaves it is almost when you have a baby your life revels and on t phi than we have to dim down the light there is no cabin and a'lcoh drinking or any other things after the baby's slaves because we cannot do too much noisemolesso then i realize that no actually not a night all and i became kind of for normal because i could go to sleep between ten and eleven and an that is how i that was maybe this was very unique to me but what is interesting is i have another a college am good friend i ken write junior i call root at colorado and he also had graserancs and an and buttocks me who strongly believe that they were night all an just everybody else and took ken took the whole laugh for camping and when they were camping of course the is less light and lot up physical activity hiking during the day and they all went to bed an between nine and ten taxi plan of that study ye what such unjust described as a study i think the were two studies other two ye an am what is interesting as i recall is that after going camping for a week and where people a wake with the more or less with the sunrise ye and go to sleep a few hours after sunset ye there melletsonin rhythms and quarters all rhythms and sleep wake rhythms persisted on that casual for several weeks the s light returning you environments where there was a lot of artificial lighting which i find amazing that yea just a week end of consistent rising and am going to bed with the sunrise and sunset ye more or less a loud a reset that was very long lasting ye am actually even in horsy study he found that almost all the togas the was of it on a sunrise time and it is amazing when i look at the state devils an slight tight the that night out called night out i also win graduate school i would work until to i am a loved it a blast music in the lather when was at home pretty much not everyone but there were the the night crew and then it'd get in some time around get up for some time around nine thirty ten and then get in around alive and it was no problem because i was going to stay very late and then over time i notice i become more lock to a scandal casual think we were saying is that the clock and a internal clocks can shift ye but this idea that we are genetically by us towards one cache on another may need revisiting that is what that's the conclusion a i i another a couple of us bet one is a in a some people a genaticalis are program because the other lift side is an what is call technically familial a man see fecindrom these people am you can give them cabin or what about but they will fall asleep at eight o'clock they can not stay awake till nine or ten and since it is a very strong minor ti in sleep and sicidiunder them fill they're very well studied in fact a lie peace and in we for they were the first one to track one family this an an de figatout there as a mutton in one of the clogging pity a too that clogs in and that mutton am aloud the clock the run in a way that these people went to bed very oddly i guess historically given these fireside chaos that those people were probably not contributing much political discussion whatever there was decided after they went to sleep is what they woke up into never reminds me because as you're describing the difference between nighttime discussions verses morning discussions is there any theme to what is discussed in the morning verses and the ihtcember people is sipping their eating and sipping their cabin and just waking up an but is is there are there any ideas about what morning discussions really consists in discuss on a daytime discuss on a mostly about o work and like hunting gathering a farming all theirstuff and even these days that flawy do we n i go to i go to work and is smartly one mating out another and an were talking about ta minsifnd different commits an er sobbing problems are your student come with questions you have your tear o the office was all the things watreleted we are not talking man city us philosophy of unless you a in the philosophy department an you are talking out political signs an and also we are not singing and dancing that is why the evening activity even these days a very different and if i gold the evening activities a were we express ourselves we express who we are we feel we are free and an in o you and i we have this academic intellectual freedom we can talk about o o work just were talking now the lot of people who work for even in taken us try they may be working for ego and all this bigger companies they cannot talk about their work to anybody else it is all secret it is all secret just i main the staying so the spending more than half of their was of time at work thinking and doing work but they cannot talk about that work even sometimes to their own family members then what happens for them lot of people also do the same thing an the person we is going and being an restaurant or cooking or the person who is an taking trust and driving when nurses and a as cannot hart about their patience treat they cart o weary ye yean some people just do not want to talk about it is stressful they do not want to bring that stress hon that is i always say that from sunset until we go to bed during that time we try to find time for ourselves people say this is meantime the meantime is a sensibly we want to truly express who we are or we want to and to ten ourselves because on the fireside chat is not that everybody was a forformor thermals some audience we always suits are all sometime swear for forming and sometimes there serving that is what happens with meantime other an maybe dial media time should be restricted end just maybe a small portion of that evening time cause i would hope the people would also interact socially here within in the ma than a con structure way or maybe we use that for connect wit your family members an whom love or can have some productive discussion something ids ait is can interesting it i think it is extremely interesting me as the think again this the conversation about timer stricter feeding is really a conversation about section bison and sleep wake activity and human evolution real a the that is i less i go back to this an a nightout because a we we can melt comment that maybe is not thirty but a this is where it's still wrapping my head around because an o this days there some an geasteris a where there trying to look at night house to see whether they are some genetic a lions and sometimes we always think ye i should take half a million people of course you will find some lot idea that but going back to this idea that we some people more sensitive to light that it is likely that the same level of light even in the same household my make some people stay away late into the night we as other people a more resistant to light that they can go to bed ugly and since light has become driveling this days and teston us story that were talking about or people going on camping the is we have remove that light am that is some am evidence that peoples light sensitivity particularly the ipiagisi o the intrinsically port sensitive re tinalgangiansel a the simple speaks the blue light senses in our eyes am that sense to begin one logging a chess an sensitivity ayes measure my pupil constriction for some people am a small amount of artificial light at night could really shift their sir cation clock ye wake them up pas at yell and then for some and men ism very sensitive to light at night exquisitely sensitive to it oh then you are at tens yes in many ways a mi's been told thus thank you a i think a i have actually which to using a red night light but in i should clear not a fancy high cost red light for sake of any the kind of informed simulation but i red party light at light and i find that was based on reading one study that we covered in an episode on catlike an shift work which was that it seems to reduce the quarters all rallying properties of light at night to use redshift light i just use a red light ballbashe travel with one if i go to an airmen bear hotel and i switcher bey light and i find that i fall asleep and stay asleep throughout the night at much more consistently especially in when ism in new environments where it is always makes he deserruptive an to sleep am it is made an enormous difference in the depth an duration of my sleep and am because often times hotel lights you knowing the bath room you will turn them on a just here just get inn and your write some people do not seem to to be bothered by that i i really struggle with that yean in fact antics a it after puberty a thar seems to be i think that is what a the tins has become more sensitive sensitive to light and it is very it is well known that the tins boys an guys the ten to stay awake it into the night and they can stay up to twelve mid past midnight although they can stay of that let that does not mean that the sleep schetelisredus the bristle is the same among of sleep as other pink jest tats i the more likely not beware up at sixty o seven when we expect them to wake up and go to school am i have a question and i ask every circadian related by all just i can come into contact with this and no one has been able to give me an answer one way or the other but i grew up hearing that every hour of sleep before midnight was of more value r potency than the hours after midnight and indeed i find that if i go to sleep at nine thirty or ten p m i can wake up at three or four i am feeling pretty fantastic and ready to lean into the day but if i get the equivalent number of hours of sleep starting at midnight i feel complete garbage when i wake up after five or six hours an is there any to uh to the idea that going to sleep within three hours of sunset is somehow better for our circadian timing mechanisms well an the few things one you said that you're very sensitive to light i assume that you also have word bright light in the evening unless i can you as best as you could can then what is happening is with sense of that bright light your melton an levels begin to rise you are prepared for sleep am of course this is something that we cannot measure because measuring megaton in and every one hour or tiny minutes am it's very difficult and there is no conium or missing a product yet a its likely that your your body is preparing very well under this dim light to fall asleep and when you are trying to stay awake and go sleep at midnight than maybe from midnight for the fusty or four hours you are sleeping well but then after that you megaton and level might be begging to fall and it is not only megaton in your corody temperature and then the hatred and everything is changing to make you away but the sleep dead that you have a cumulated is passing you to be in bed that is this handsome between the seceding aspect and your sleep tit and am unfortunately you cannot have good night of restorative sleep for the second half of the sleep because of the tension o makes good sense yet hats i am you know you are not the only one in a there many people who who experience that and in fact lot of people thing that well this my bathe way i sleep maybe i am not am i am not design to sleep restorative until know i sleep one day just the camping trip me and then they real a a you at i feels what a you a what you are missing you're absolutely an i one make sure that we talk about the other aspect of fire which is a your paper the came out recently very interesting paper studying fire fighters enterestrate of feeding firefighters would you sure with us the the general contour may be even some the specifics of of that study cause i think it is very interesting forth for sake of shift workers but for everybody really to understand these results yes let go back to shipped workers because am this also thewless to all of us because i only said that each of us is you shipped worker or has lived the life of a shipped worker am and we have experience tow tell difficulties am and nobles start with what is the definissan of i shipped worker am ship work light light style there is knowing new her sol definition unfortunately but therefore many european countries and particularly if you go to interest on level organiison am then you will find some references different utopian countries have slightly different definition which essentially points to i f you stay awake for two or more hours during your habitual sleep time and when they the habitual slip time am the assume that we are just you said were kind of program to sleep somewhere between said ten p m and then stay in bed an cant of was up after five am the idea is if you stay if you are staying awake for two or more hours between ten p m and five am and you are guessed in some activity withers physical activity or intellectual activity are not lying in bed and wondering worrying about something but actually working that defines that is defined as shipworm and you do not how to do it every single day even if you do it once a week for fifty weeks than that itself is enough to destruct your physiology and me tell is in behavior brandfunction a shipworker the reason is as you discuss when you chance our external timing cut in this case when you travel jetlag for or travelling a crosthre days three hours of jetlag will take am three days to am repaid similarly if you've staying awake for two hours extra or if you are working up two hours before your habitual was of time than we just don get wake up and then be ingested in some activity in the dark most of us none meets unless you are wearing a infer goggles we ton on light and light resets our o'clock end that way every time we stay up for two or more hours even for one night then for the next two nights our clock is kind of find to catch up send that way for three days the day of the disruption and then two days following the destruction a a clock is trying to catch up with the outside time clock our body is not on time with our clock s that means almost for half of the week or half of the year our clock is thing to catsup that is the definition of shipworm now let us come back to on department of lever statistics and you was gone when am that have not been tracking what par centers of people are doing ship t work i accurately because they are many difficulties in tracking to but it is generally accepted that one and five working our dolls is a card carrying shipdworke card carrying shipdworkersmance they are horses am doctors fire fighters am and bakers am frog drivers am then many in the service industry that is one in five twenty foison of working a does then if we think about all the colustudents just i was doing and yew must have done am they are or i expel that lines grant gran did lines the and we are also expense in experiencing the life style of a shipped worker because were the laying slave even if you are the langsyne by two hours for most of the colustranes for five days and and the we and your trying to catch up that kind of hair secadyan destruction going on then you take one point five or one point six million new mom's am in the us every years of when the child is on and that mother is a shipped worker and actually that mother is worse than a shipped worker because an i know you do not know what time of the night the baby will wake up and how many times and there is no weekend in motherhood they are also living the life of a shipedworker am we do not count many food delivery and a overdrive lived drivers are shipped workers but they many of them we know that they live in that way we think the actual number of people who are experiencing the life of a shipped worker is an somewhere round fifty person of the torts a populuson at any given time that is why it is also another point that you might have work from people those the o i cannot do timeishating because my casual is must up i work in a different way and am that comes into play that is why we taught a focus we should try something on shipped worker another point is a the one and five people are shipped workers they carry is proposciately heavier born of dies because almost all is related degrees that we can think of for there is high blorcresser usually high blorcressor starts in fortress or fifties a high colusterall am fasten tistinal problem in division am chronic a inflation of the colon and an even a colon cancer in manycases and then of course a dive it is am all of these a this proposinately more frivoled among shipped workers but then when you think about clinical trials wether id did drop all a life style often one of the touch tan exclusion factor criteria is shipped work people who are doing shipped work we exclude them from many of this a trials a one thing is most physicians and most scientist even people who do shipped work than know that they are the body and mind is must of that often time even medications mayn't help them and lapse we do not try you medics on wat her take the risk when we know it mayn't help them and then when it comes to life sty interns son whether its a sleep extents an for example we can't do because their supposcto stay awake and do that job we cannot ask them to stay asleep at night and then physical activity and exercise some people candle but some people are tired up tor all night that the do not have the averse to do physical activity and then nu train again a most ivory son studies involved a the participants to come to the clinic and get am one on one or one or tan grupsesons and they cannot come and they cannot havebeen sometimes s come to the clinic visit am on people have to take aroma draw blood in fact there is another cadet that just if supposal healthy i perfectly normal bloodiest blodlucois cloistral everything is normal and i live the life of a ship worker just for five nights that means i sleeping let may be for five hours and even if i do not eat at night time of course many shiftworkas also feel hungry and just for am to give the won they et a just after five days my blodlocoslevel will it on most like i pedivitic w i she saw a study in a publishing proceeds in the national academy that showed that even a hundred locks dim light present in the room wile people are sleeping with eyes closed can lead to disruptions in morning a bloodglucoslavels in directions that are not good year one night the the faint clock in the corner r even a a night light that is too bright could be problematic am by the way folks these t affects a reversible i whenever i say these things i we had a lot a comments about origins what if i bending for years but kids with night lights this is an issue year but what ism hearing is that one an five people are truly shift workers in the classic senses the jobs require they work at night were en to the night and sleep into the day but for more people are shift workers by virtue of the facts that they tweeting or working or watching movies at night even though it is not work in that their not being paid for that time they are essentially operating shift workers if we add those two groups together would we say it is what a third of america i say half of ate half of merry if if you take tiny just because in o his schulsterants on collisterans because again going back to horasias a study because horas also collected activated it a from highschulsterants and collisterants and we have replicated to that with a highschulsterans and collisterans in sundayege that shall and sundiego and this study now they're many sleepy such as there an collecting thisteta and what we find is a digitally the his scholsterdans they ire going to beset on midnight and collier and turtles the you seems distedants we found may be one out of hundred who went to bed before midnight that rum reminds me that horasioglasis just publishes reallyunices paper am showing that counter to what we believe students others the universe washing in piano i should mention where it is very dark in the winter young people sees tat people in their twenties a saying up later in the winter months compared to the summer months ye which is to the honor in tut if you think we everyone stays up late in the summer and goes to bed early in the winter but because of artificial lighting at the exact opposite yes and another aments a i do not know whether horas monster id but may other suspicion am not saying whether is true in winter we are most likely to con him or coffee her choccolet in the evening and that might also i delaying a sleep consent make sense in that ti again here is another thing which can be the meted to policy a practice at as you a son institute what happened doing a covet was everybody went to the mortalorning a the assignments became digital and assignment commission became digital and the many systems on line systems that came to play and by deport the assignments some mission deadline became midnight than now what is happening is i do not know about stay for a maybe a when you are giving a assignment a when is the deadline innitmidnight then most of us master and the try to cram as much as possible try to all by the most as possible on some it at midnight and it all be really cool to go back to your sister manstertor to see is that i in mandeficcentsy lot of fiches o distress of what tine people are submitting the am assignment because we no ins when we commit o grant i yes i mean you you here about the of city crisis the crisis of metabolic disorders nachos in the abut everywhere in the word e a it is really striking i remember going to a keystone meeting scientific meeting in on the early two thousands and there was a map of the united states and showed where the of city rates we over thirty per cent in dolls in the entire country busy was lighting up crates and now it would be the entire country but there were these and of zones in the middle that word almost i wait of of of city e colorado termly dah at that time those are now also fallen under the umbrella f of ramp an of city loan ne an everyone speculating o cars it a is it seedily is it am is it this as that that is it highly process foods ism ism guessing its all of those things in coo lack of activity but one has to wonder given everything were talking about interns of metabalctis function at shifted eating all these issues with late shifted eating and staying up late with artificial living but they are not that could be one of the major factors in the called to cecity cries is likely and all we all i say freshman fifth the skin visa things a getting kitten founds in the freshmen yer in coles and an this is where i think as educator professors o he will be interesting to go back and we a what can we do because another thing that is also becoming more and more common fora jumble i i give a scatty under them class mince i just give to lectures and i remember when i started a fifteen seventeen years ago an that lecture use to be at on one thirty p m or two p m in the afternoon and it is at two and hap or lectures or is done by fit and for the last him before the pan i make i realize that the chaos the time now the lecture was starting at seven p m was finishing by nine nine twenty p m and thesis they are to going eat after nine ti my s hat e shoes lies finesse can farci chat and then to express themselves to feel free from a sign meets one ore they gong to do that after the summidaa sign man than their going to do that her w are to go back and revisit this is say o case o for adults for most of us who are working at day jo our the line is five p m in most gases i a fence at listen you knewuster tisistem the person ways submitting the grand or who is doing taking care of my i be or ice there all living at five o'clock u for me everything has to en by fight i think for most people out there i this rases a canomacroscopic question which is maybe it is not much about restricting the eating window but maybe it is about feeding mostly in and being active mostly in the early part of the day i mean i could imagine a time three four years from now when it is about when waking up early and going to bed within three hours of sunset is the protocol which harnesses all other protocols rite ya get or y exercise you gang i do it in that time you are getting emerging to do it in that time you going a social is your going t do it in that time and in doing you are also avoiding a lot of the issues related to diserruptid sea that is i all this things a you said a time is servicing is just one aspect of the cicetti an health and they are all into connector and going back to the comment four om within three hours of o sunsets and there is good but than what happens in say pronto a uncover in winter time i guess ere going to bed very very early but also waking ut very very early you know one of the things that i here all the time because ism always beating on the drum of getting morning sunlight yen a three aloud cover is people say there is no sun here this time of year and i i forgive me but there is son unless you live in a cave the son is just coming through out cover in a matter way you live in the work their son unless you live in a cave of course am i will not to make sure that i we do not ooh what was the major conclusion of the fire fighter s is a l go back the are fire fight estrade o the iran why we did the study was as they said there for of us who a living the life style of fire fighters or a shipped workers and ship workers are excluded from studies tat men wart robot we are learning about e life style or even medicisons that may the beneficial for people who actually have a normal studio am but not for people who have a disrupted will you and if you look up am clinical trial sort of there more than four hundred thousand studies listed and if you such how many studies are on ship workers it is less than a thousand and man if you ask most of them are to we what is wrong with ship workers that a we know that ship work in crises or rest for met a bullet disks can sir and even some aspects of demensyor but if you ask how many studies are done to improve the health of ship work alone that is less than fifty men i ins have to go back an check the actual number but it is less than fifty while that is why am we get sopor excited an we tart am from secede under them prospected that is something to a dress this study again this kind of study is only possible because ism a so and we are filtered with you steady and am i can work with you we as the physicians to do the studio a collateral with an doctor am to who is the directer of canna the have entering you see rusty and am has many fire fights as her plans and we both know that the number one was for death an the liability on work for fire fighters is not fighting fire but just getting hartatak and am stroke a the have a very high incidents of hated i can stroke and there also highly born to different kinds of cancer and it may be difficult to a strive can her to desrupson decade an de stepson because they are also exposed wo lord of tocsins any time fire bones that is tell of fire is a sensually male of cats yo dozens and they breathing even if they have the am hood on an spirit of the still we the idea was very simple we know that fire fighters a nearly seventpeypersont of fire fighters in the less full time fire fighters because the warrantee fire fighters an tan full time fire fighters the full time fire fight or seventy person of them work twenty four hours shipped free sample in sanding they coming at their ship is from eight em to eight and the next her and they do a crista san my ago r they do one day on one day off on off four cycles and then four days of and am but in some fire departments they actually do forty eight hours shift they come for two days to days of to days to days off and then four o five days a rut thank you fire firers ye a man am then the idea was o was o will scan fire fighters and then find fire fighters who are am metabolically unhealthy and then will see whether they can actually follow ten hours time restuterating because the font is the are fighters can follow it and everybody else with all that stress if they can and this is again where i should also at knowledge the sundae ago fire and rescue department because without their health we could not have even submitted the grant and at that time a the bitbecon who is am they health and wellness battalion chief he is the one who actually uproot us am because he's very careful he real that the job that the dew next them weaker in a long term and can kill them and long turn he was always looking for new solutions he approstus and then i she this is the idea is a well i love this idea because we are not asking them to sleep more or we are not going to cut down the over time or shave tor chance they works casual the only thing will be doing is ask them to eat within ten hours and hopeful we can do the serpinsistently between the days that the working and not working yes that means if the from eight a m to ait a m working then the next than they go home then there can eat on the same actual they did when they were at the fire fire house yer but who wat home s they are not allowing themselves to you deviate from that yes o them we we thought whether they can do it on not began they number one go or the prime he c in this clinical trial was visibility can they do it and then second was give they do it and what happens to the blood sugar and wait and all this other stuff and no we started the study and we hid the next the horde and that is am and a fire fighters a very very tight nit community and they've want to secure that you understand their culture and the best were to understand their culture is to live the life of the fire fighter a silly manurial with the fastortersy and than a we had a dinner gedoriand who is now in medscools he was a they a scoring at er at that time am theyvevoluntef the stroke will worthy biggest fibster sun in sundae ago and we will live the life of the fire fighter and they sundae a go of fire and rescue and the city a they all a a great they footed for duty a seven shady in the morning a sin day were in the station because all fire stepsons do ha have some beds for five five fighters to rest and they have a sign bed they were signed a bed an yes every time an nine one on call ken and if that five stars an in that sisters an that five begin was called and just other five fighter there run get into the gears just the shoes and an a jacket and the helmet and getting the sit and at ten the call of course there on go thy side is get out of the trot wait there then come back see that twenty four hours family got ten calls at night that see had to run but they're more than ten times the an they got the nine one every time the nine one on call ken and there is a big that goes out all five fighters were slipping the resting the get up or if they are doing something the look up to see which gun is cord interesting sos this the ones said go out it is every one gets woken out every one gets woken out that means in a night if we con night there waking up am ten fit and twenty times sometimes they are almost an an on new months are er five fighters because there do not have any idea what time the baby will cry and for what reason also the or out o similarly it is five that is what family did and then next fining when we came backs i t at got seem easy yer e then is did the study and and we are sickly a sign all the five fighters we recruited from fifty five fighters we are sign half of them to mediterin in diet because you cannot do any harm ye are to give them something goods that and other thing that is a now we want something that we now works for five fighters and there as a editor in tad study and everybody was suppose to follow mariterin diet and then half nearly seventy five of them was supposed to eat within ten hours we did not fix the ten hours because we said am you pick your own ten hours that you can stick to it has to be consistent from day the days if you her eating it in am you finish it tat et a it is seven p m f an and then try to ye other mi is air right we consistent because i say dyes we understand that there will be somethings and you can take man the half an our here and there and we will see how many times you can do it and am what is interesting has how to they are all doing twenty for our sit more or less was to begin fighting somewhere between eight en and eleven am and an that did not kip any meal they had their first mel or what we call breakfast tam but it was several hours after waking up because they are waking of but five or six and the driving to come to work at seven chatty or eight and the eating the first meal say between eight and eleven and then the finished meal an ten hours later and what we found is more or less a am most of them could stop to doing this at least five days o of sevendays i and then at the end of the study when we look at an the health parameters one thing that they said we recruited everybody who can that means the lord nearly one an three five fighters were completely heady than no sign of any am any illness no hi forces or highborn ere of high cholesterol de pressor or anything since we have one tart of the vopolicion who are already healthy and then everybody has slightly different condition some have high blorcressor but they do not have his blood hookers somebody has hihblod lookers up not high bloaters dos kind of hetrogenias we did not see big the french in witless or anywerchans between this two groove another thing is fire fighter fatally run almost eight o nine miles when they are a the job fiche the part of the ism exercise ruin but then outing that since significantly in the time restating proof was on what we call vealdeal particle size and partial number because this is something that we know this very for dancing my pocosin these are iatrogenic and if we can manage them much better than we reduce the diskfor acres choruses there is one parament of that chance in the time lesrefitting grub even when we combine all healthy on healthy everybody now if we take five fighters solar beginning with high blood pressor then we say significant redocxson in their systolic as well as diastolic blortessor and the change in bloressr of cops we do not claim that in the monoskipt but when we talk about it some fhysisan would get of and said we that looks almost there on a blotters lawyer in drop ism the extent of blorcress or losing is ecrivallen to somebody taking a antihaprotensive drop main and then those who started with his blood sugar of cops we did not have too many to too divitic but the of a few predivitic and they could better man as their blood blokes and this is interesting because once ship workers be compare divitic or divitic they have more difficulty managing their blood sugar than nonskid workers because the worskitoself we mes them of too much even if they are or many medical on the have difficult that is fascinating in ism really glad that you explain the study in such detoxes i would have thought from reading the abstract and i did look at the gator but e some one were to look at the object they see o fire fighters of the waking up n the not the night an there you throwing on their gearing going out the calls and we bet punishing correctly or fire fibers are being woken up by the signal which makes e fire fighter population a bit more similar to the more standard population is waking up i he mill the night to use the bath room getting on social media for a couple of minutes or flipping on the lights a minutes it is maybe not as severe is what firefighters are wearing am but we know there are blood sugar regulation issues related to those multiple middle of the night wakings especially if people are then staring at screen yer am scything it is really important that a people were able to hear about the the deeper contours o the study a i mean this result of regulating blood sugar bedder is really powerful i get asked all the time i gan new kid or a ism a shift worker how can i do this morning sunlight viewing am what ism hearing is that keeping a regular meal casual every day i get's five five out of seven ye ears even were as close every days solar asleep by we say trying get a really great nights sleep eighty per cent or more of the nights of your life and on the other twenty present hopefully its for fun reasons a great party or saving at there's he celebration of some sort am that seems to me a great anchor point when one cannot reliably control their sleep wage cychael it of that mean that if somebody is coming offer shift work and they are very very tired that they would be better off staying awake in eating then sleeping well it is i yes u and this is when we get in to newanse here the fire fighters a twenty for hour ship work that means and they have been working to sip for very long time they have fig out a one thing is yes fire fighters are different from horses and help car wakes wo have to work trout the night and the staying a wake toward the night for as fire fighters they get opportunity to sleep then even with their ten calls they actually have opportunity to come back and go to sleep and in fact hand family and at wanna they we and defuse us and what the jut was fire fights after they after a attending at call they are not coming back and playing cards or time to watch the deals or get disco they'd no they will just go back and anilin the bed and set of to night whenever they got any opportunity to sleep they will try to sleep send that why they sleep get and sleep are s or doing daytime is not as strong as send night ship nurse or my trodriver who is driving all night because they have testing a was trout the night when people say yes you found the sand can you extended to other ship markers my unseals now we have to go back and finger out that is why we went to the station and fight out wat to walk for them if i have to go and would do this forward horses may be can i will go o our start will go and finger out what is that wakskas o what happens do they have opportunity to eat do they have opportunity to to even take five minutes break what do they do diving brick and all of these things coming to play but here another thing is i allay said that in other times sifting paper we see chance in nuts some quality and quantity but here we also saw that somehow both goofs inadvertently they a improve that into some quality because everybody was told to it meditate and i they plus that fruits and vegetables and olivoil in tenant slightly and when they had to stop eating ugly they also did dust alcholintic and this is very significant because many ship workers just to cop with the sip tear the ten to depend on alcohol night and kafir in the morning they begin there dey with kafir an and i tall and now we can revert that many normal people were not doing ship tar we also more or less begin our day with kafir and many of us and with alcohol and then when they duce that eating to ten hours and then we si significant de human in alcoholintic in the atimelestretin grub but not in the standout of care or meditenit i certainly support that we did not episode on nalcalln i was shocked when i research that to learn that zero ti two drinks per week is essentially the threshold beyond which the you start seeing health the opposites in particular cancers and metal disruption sleep disruption an increased anxiety when people are not under the influence of also it is a be incredible how alcohol's kind of escaped as the the opposite of coffin and therefore ism not a health hazard it is in any here i ism somebody have a drink every once in a while no wee all for me i can have it or not have it but it is just striking how a call despite extensive data that it can really disrupt health even at three drinks per week the is a is just avidly consumed as if it was kind of food or affine severally incredible an i i want make sure that i circle back to something you mentioned earlier because i know they are going to be number of people at asses if i recall you said that provided that the feeding window is not shorter than eight hours that man women in children can used time restricted feeding am well when i say yes what i what i says am twelve hours but tell excuse twelve hours that inti for that i am because we did a study that is public in twenty fifteen and again am behind many of our studies that is a story we have policing all this to stories an the nod go to conferences and and of course thy am some some people would give me a look saying while we must be doing something wrong we this just pretty below tomodanan is because falcon testing the say number of pallor's and not we in wet of course by that time we fight out that a listen mouse time less refuting also changes the got mycobyum in a way that the mice may be hoping out little bit more fat and sugar than observing that wanting that happens in time lissriviting a listen mics the liver olestra metabolism to buy liked and buy lessons a exclusion an the got changes because the got mycrobiumcanges of is is a very nice study when a mirgerinpar was a in the lab now he has his own lav in you see as the and he meticulously did that and we we event bid bomcallomitry from the poop and matavolo makes from the poop and than we fight out that the exists some some calories an than that brown card activity goes up o there may be morning some of the extraccallories o the more thou to general homogeny but any a in a one nice thing a something of our talk is if they see that your science is going well than they will find was to help you and the unific ye and a this is when billrodi was our president he was the president of for a hooking for twelve yeas an than he was president and an that time he had started this in a bison grand program a which was funded by or in job moron is the founder of qualm was also a faculty at you see as say he understand the very few the led us wo achy spend some time in a cad him he understood the pa enough getting grant money when you have some interesting idea besom idea ye i do not only in age but it'll do it anyway because i sit on study section for the anlage me within i oh wants to see proposals for things that are certain to work that they are mostly done and really ground breaking work can happen and does happen within a each funding but more often than not is it is the a generosity of philanthropists liker wen jacobus and other people the alow the really pioneering am the new stuff the cool stuff ye that the ground breaking us the stuff that really now ism not ti say really marries it all matters it is all important at matters but in is high risk and an an i as men an is is not just government is not making money from tin air wen sits tapes money there is a little bit responsibility or conservative that case he soon at wastaxfors money on find the sky kind of prose too mu were we are not talking about politically conservative were talking about an and scientific we son sciatic e be careful with language now days pretty soon were boson a s it and stare at one another i for microphones to they say so that is interesting the that ways started the and tan a what we did was we a i had a o som garstudant and we got this funding from or when and also the a som any philantory matters it sully way we says yes if you give me fifty boys than that fifty boy to at signs towards buying the gloves and fond of tons for one port to for many seven days so soccer i think of our people do not realize that ninety nine per cents of lavatory sciences just they they do not make me any money a their discoveries and even if there is a patentable discovery civically the the the divide between the institution and the company that will run shy put that to market i si skin in favor of the the others involves that your scientist really do this as as rework of passion we are a labor of of we we a came of to this a a my section clock at that time and we took some an and on lessons from testy dos an particularly from an as on one click check out an because without most new to son at actually ask people to de tell the scribe to the ad go t the food library and then person size the sick o will just start got all of that we just ask people to take a picture of the food open the up one cricket a picture second click and press said tartly and on the serve the picture i tally came to our sovereign i not stay on their for and we asked a hundred fifty six people who an not ship workers t struggler worker or home makers to be part of the study no student was allowed to be part of the study because we know that there like any sicsippes and we monster for three weeks and here is some once and i want people to understand sop u a on the somebody is starting to eat at was seven an and since that it according everything we fort we got every single thing even if they id hap a cooky they had to take a picture and they actually to picture because it is not it become second nature after three or four days that evident thy are something even if a there's a glass of wat or the actually tic a picture because we ask them take picture of everything well figure out what it is what is surprise we found the million a the milden number of times people eat within it dey twenty for ours days actually seven it is part it is not that we are eating three times to day we actually sneak lit it a seven times for day seven times and that ten for sort of people the top desire was it ting twelve times to day am and it man en sand that prospect sometimes may be out falling that seven or eight f before an i did the study because thin o getting up having coffee with came and sugar is one an and i at my breakfast that is two than i came to be lave and i found that cookie that three and wen to meeting and there is some cook and es something else an that is another one and lunch and and afternoon somebody asked me to go out and have a meeting and if you think about it it is very normal that we can go of seven to eight times ten times but then if we look at what time say i start breakfast and as they said and see that in many people this start or seven o'clock and one day and seven thirty another day and eight fifteen another day or they go back to six an because there to get apollyan for for and we take all the food it er from three weeks an then ask what is the time when your body system is expecting it to eat because it is kind of our is out is into thinking of car maybe for you if you are eating breakfast at say somewhere between six and seven thirty seven forty five eight it maybe you expecting food a found seven o'clock let us forget about stript inner an outlier then similarly at the end of the day somebody is sitting finishing the last bit or the night gap whatever you call it save one that ninety and ninth it and ten eleven twelve thirty or one let sing not that one and twelve hardy but still we got some i within seven to eleven thirty for that person over three weeks time this is how we kind of finger out what is the likelihood that your body will encounter food when we do that what we found was nearly fifty for sone of our dogs in our study eight for fourteen hours forty five minutes that window when your body is expecting food sire easy to say that fifty for sone of our dogs a eating within fifteen hours or longer well and and quite frequently your it frequently too and then if we ask what faces on of our dogs were actually eating the convention all within twelve hours threemales o day or something other ten ten person the packing is gone up you man we however one is the find snaking the my good give of food in take the other day and outside this breakfast longs and dinner there all this small snake here and there and also for lot of people the dinner is delayed and we went back and looked at look as what and of fool till eating at at night anal the staff and what came out interesting with is very confer intuitive is people who prepare their own dinner that more likely to eat later at night because there coming home and then there taking some time to prepare dinner and then they are sitting down and eating of may we treating next to the come fit of whatever it is is for kind of interesting that came out and but coming back to your point that is we i say that nearly ninety for son of our dogs i eating for more than twelve hours that means a lore of people can there is scope or there is enough hat's best re dead and it within as i said all of this at interrupted son when thing your children most sleepy such ears agree that children and teen edgers should sleep somewhere between nine to ten or eleven hours because young children even five to ten year old they should sleep nine to ten hours just popping out grow thou on and a growing growing i and than the teen as are actually the an recommendisson is and they should be sleeping nine hours because if you take ten users take out all the similar the in just to them and than remove home work assign mend to everything and than led them kind of equilibrate to their homiest acts wat the likely how many hours the likely to sleep that con start to be somewhere between eight and half to nine and half hours with also means that going back to sleep nearly ninety for sent of high scholsturents in this country a ironically sleep deceive because most high schlsturents do not get nine hours of sleep on the regular yes is mall in the weekend probably because of devices yer o and also as ti said this new idea that midnight is your am assignment some missometime it'll come back to that again and again i am hearing that again against the clever is taken a it is an in it is a very interesting idea as a ways you can a anchor behavior earlier in the day y learning to in i mean public health i is complicate because people are incensivised by fear but they you get more beat with honey as they say i year are si insensivising people to wake earlier not necessarily with the sunrise but wake earlier in go to sleep earlier and eat within an eight to twelve hour window am twelve if it is yes that's my shoulder and ye it sounds to me you know all these health benefits or what i think ore going to incentivize people more than for instance this idea that w if you do not yo this you can to get the men surer some data or like mi but i carry the people fill more healthy and more productive and that's o i said that even if children a suppose to sleep for nine hours of coursethey not eating during those nine hours and we are not a fitting children and putting them down to sleep because and on the sort bar my temperature will behind they cannot fall asleep saris the have the last meal one or two hours before going to bed because typical a parents fid them and a ye give them a sour or bat an and the breathe bedtime stories its wan to two hours before began ta finishing for similarly on the other and after the wake up it is not that we are waking them off and an fitting them awfully went doing that that is at twelve hours sends to be oft the mam and it is not only am saying that if we put all the health recommendessons together from pidietrius and than it masses am fascinating i have a question about structuring meal in take or food in take am during the eating window i i have a good friend actually he say he is the nurse surgeon at nursing now but he came up through stamford and am and he has a a habit of eating of skipping one meal per day within a feeding window i mig be breakfast lunch skip dinner one day then it mig be breakfast dinner the next day i lunch in dinner the next one it is not in keeping with the same start time always but the end time is either going to be earlier or there is a gat it is never later he's never later i what you think about that as a strategy am in many ways it feels that fits with the way that a lot of people's lives run sometimes for instance if ism in spot cast i do not tend eat much string mil the day cause it makes me a own go dryly that mustering the of deep in energy it'll do breakfast well again at eleven and that is ha first that is when i break my fast feverish and then dinner maybe a snack in the middle the day but other days it is three meals of the does it matter i over all as long as am one isn't allowing the start time and the ending time to drift out is it okay if you go from twelve hours to ten to eight eight ten for twelve as long's you do not exceed that the the brackets are you oke i this is a the secret and aspect come in because if you're going am if you've moving that breakfast time a dinner time to for hours ticenstially causing may be a metabolejetlah an o in sarttam in weeks months or maybe in few years you may not see any cents i but the same time we do not know what i the long come consequences one thing is we all as think it'll come back to the spored again and again we ting that a body where to the maker of health at body compotes on is a make of heart it is not always true because i they said see deploy i filling am an a having some tang of depression or anxiety radio hialeali a the anilin i people a ear or lowboy have you a very high veal yell those are the things that am we do not collect with or habit and since the key an de the man mil timing mil structure now is a very new filed i i think good studies will come out only in a few years because it'd not with la just going back and retrospectively looking at some director one day of direct and trying to gain too much out out of it i think hopefully thinks will improve where people become it it would becomes panda that least look for one week of director mill time and what a eating all the stay because the a moustudies also going what am front lording cabohidre a front lording fat or brought in n has benefit of i think this studies a starting o i not comment for the last good of bat or within it scrag to hold off until then we have you back on to discuss an i have a question about a fasting on the longer term am and there it is in near infinite space we could explore of two days a fasting one day i know people that every ones in a while they just decide in fasting they have either been eating too much at parties or there not feeling well or whatever they just decide fasting for twenty four hours and am they still consume water in gaffer but though just fast is there any health benefit or detriment am you mention the circa in clock shifting e facts but if somebody wakes up on sundae and they they you eat too much sure they feel they too much for they do not the for they on cares an that rely feel wit than they are just gin a fasting money is there any known benefit or am health detriment to doing that kind of thing tethers a ritually richly creature on a this complete fast am an in fact in many religion a people practice complete fast as it way to lens there body and am pile ops in that the benefits to that in fact they every other they eating ain mouse model or even in humans tar also innocently some stories were done an there many health benefits and write now there even fasting clinics and germany where people checking and than the strict supervision and than they do complete fast a maybe a small bowl of sup ways has hundred two hundred kill local an that is all they get to week sometimes to three days for they five days even they have gone off to thee or four weeks for sake of way lass as ti i for many different things and a they come out pretty well he thy off command or a supervision make sure that there getting auto mix nuts e study the michronel trains by them in and am an electrolytes those studies a pretty solid people have a observe that and an in fact there are even idea that fasting this kind of fasting can have his impact on bran and people may come out of trictmen thesis tan de impression a something but and a those studies are very difficult to do there only cess of one here and there that we here once in a while but hopefully in future will see am whether the depression anxiety the mental heart aspect will benefit from fasting because now as there is more and more evidence that there is this god branaxis and what the the presents of food a the michrobium chengesin the got am if they can affect bran than may be long tom fasting very fasting a few days of locellery dit back to back a will be interesting to see how it impacts brenhealth very interesting what a you thoughts on fat fasting were people am trying limit their blood black spit only eating mainly fats mainly healthy typically they will eat a ho her fast o call o wills and not see and som animal fats perhaps but am as a way to keep blood luck low in also time restraint this it goes by to the can locarbo hydrate am thing what are your thoughts on that as as a general strategy for health i mean it combine her two general themes that are out there i think both of which a be you data still in coming that a restricting the feeding times it can be beneficial as well as keeping blood over all blood bucks lower can be beneficial y i think a there's too much a emphasis now on blot to the spiking or am we do not know am this kind of eating patron for example fence we a finally telling panties the local ye a the islets els that fro us r insolent they soda can take am taka brick on reason for for a month or two or three months am my question is it will be interesting to see what happens to those islets because a example we know that if wed this sees are on us or muscles there is muscular trophy a muscles of beck become weaker a we do not know whether long tom consequences of this very look to what to diet what your not sensually in gazing the isletselves a medically a what is its impact if there's no impact may be swim and may be because as many people racially work on kitten an idiot theserchus themselves they find it very difficult to stay in true kittosn'n idiot because the truest don't idiot is condemning less than ten person of galleries from carbide and not very many from preaching a lot people think kite sanitize allows them the massive amounts of meat and that is not surly the case just one clarification four people am a such was referring to islet cells of the pancreas which are the ones that a manufacture insolent i the questions whether not a taking in low levels of blood glucose by way of he local paddy died the those isletselvs are going to shut off their production very interesting main the livers are very plastic tissue i man it tells to am react very dramatically to to li stall change eyes that she interesting to we what happens fence we know that even muscle this seas for example people who become better tan the lust muscle us but when they come back and exercise they get it back sorb interesting to say a what happens and this people we are going through long tome kitten an idiot and of course once in a while because of a see presser or something else if the do not have accept e for or something happens the maycongum somesugar some plod lookers will spike puts not that a bespoke is bad i mean there is not why we have insolent is for good reason to offer that my to boor that spike and also and of people of e say that well if you have insolent produce or insolent grot fact of to e really badman it should avoid that and i think that little bit a extreme and me eats a the inion grot matters absolved in muss portions since the station repair yet a they even cognition y ye and it also goes back to as a emtoractivisn and all the to people get really excited about a how to reduce son toactivisn rapomisin an a that stay this is where a began from sectarian point of view an i ask people to think to very popular drop molycals for drugs that people think will incision giving a met former wits many people we not all will come to con tenses that dit active at i pi kindness a the sensor in the selves that sense that yourselves are sting met former kind of activity it that it kind of you can say although men to besinticacaly accurate and the am an o fasting in a peal grin mimics fasting and the an the thing hat on pin there with motorman is the barbering is have the four men met four minutes a the three bark extract that also dramatically lowersbod i to yer ye ait mimics kind of that am fasting and then raphomisean am also and of reduces emptor activist and a people have shown that an aphomisin and met for men can extend you life span an in improve health now that's go back to the callow restricts on study that i men in alloy restricts on people are giving food as a ransom and there are essentially doing time restriction the mi for doing time restriction if we think about it during day time hand experiment or are coming to the biveryam the my surbisliping and fasting and the so naturally have high level of empikinness if the truly fasting and the should also have low level of emptor activity because am to response toinsolin and that should go off at night my suspicion is an in many of these experiments war the mice for aloud to eat a libido even normals under cha now we are we know that as mice get older the actually conium little bit more for during day time which is the acquordin of human i humans nit metis i nit i meeting we knows an issue i did not know as there was more finish is people age but yes s we do not now what that listen mice because nor we can put the mice an can re marry look at everything a by dating how us eating i guys it was natural to see that is i such as found that there is some em tor activity during daytime when the mice for not supposed to have em tor activity be come they should be fasting and since they at little bit an there was packing during daytime an empikind es activity was not at it speak giving mat for men kind of mimic that fasting stead and reducing em tor activity by drop ago mice in a kind of mimic for aspect of the fasting step my suspicion is am since this studies were done always in mice an who wat supposed to be in the fasting state and both em or a y apomict in empykind is activity or met form in kind of a mimicking that fasting step that is why we have seen those benefits and it will be interesting to see if that experiment will be done in humans in long time because many people are very excited about and o there is em tor a long tom met forming an study an an for a pilartuly consuming good amount of apomict an off level they can get their own a that is my a curiosity ism not saying when there is good or bad or the there is signs or not that something that be interesting to control for and we an because we certainly have i saw on one o my again an close friend and college at cliffs and cut yyalamia a suited a very simple elegant study people should have done it forming fear it took mice and then meson that blood lookers at different time of the day and in fact just human blood looks doubler looks flutter li a little bit she saw that to them and then in every two hours or three hours an on different days of course we give the say dose of met from into mice and what she found was at different time of the day that forming had very dramatic chaos in blokes reducing ability an which means that even if you take mat former and give at different time of the they for the mouse or even for humans in very long tom of course in this mice an this mice for not diabetic or anything the er health mice to begin with in long tome we might see am benefits an that a very different this brings to this idea that while maybe met for men say at the end of the day evening met for in may the go that fasting state much alien an and of digestion a what s mat forming the beginning of the day manor at least from m on levity prospecting ism not talking her divide tired to diesis the see thin with emptor amid amtogin to have much better impact if taken doing evening a morning before meal these are my thoughts that go along with talk this pat am story that we talked about do you take a that forming your berberine a no i have not taken thou i no a i have flow a friend on cole am rubenchaw is now the deretrov cancosentersate extensively walks on ampicinas an its mechanism and am am it is all less fond to talk to him t hes a he is a fan you've taken barbering before and have had a two different very distinct experiences with them first of all am berberine when invested with carbohydrates in particular carbohydrates to have a lot of simple sugars definitely i know this cause i measured my blood glucose into the experiment blows you a flat now your blood glucose response in some sense if you the nowhere is this idea if you arguing to eat u particularly big meal or sugary meal when you don't want to get a mass of bloodglucosrises you take berlin or mat for him that fore minutes y prescription than i when with barber in cases as far as i know it works at as well am at least to held people ye o for help of you that is right am when i took berberine and did not in jest large amounts of simple sugars or carbohydrates along with it i experienced profound hypo glisemia i felt complete garbage for about eight hours and i had one of the worst headaches of my life because which make sense you just got a blood sugar crash if you lower blood you your bloodshed when you already have fairly low blood sugar in you nan jesting carbohydrates you can really bottom out your your am blood luck such u sits i see that as a i for to rest one as kind of a cautioned in the other one that am when ye think about the biology these compounds it makes perfect sense and i think that and i did not pay attention circa in a facts i man at e into when i can salaam am that we know on i vans the kind of the am billy don't sign metabolism and he walks on neuclehamon de septal am de a de master get metabolism and nomasels cansosels and many other and what is interesting was an depart few yes a ronde de we simple experiment am he just looked at what time of the day this nuclihomon de septa a to on agent be on level and som attorn level and he found that almost all of them i have a circadian pat on at elastin saltish a he went to that length to say even that circadian is metabolism and metabolism misicadian the son why we have ascidian i them is to have a delididem and foot sicking be via an sting and also go to appear et of time when we should be fasting an an on the other hand all the metabolicagletes also have to follow that try and almost all matablicegledos everything pelican think of conectato metabolizing macronutrian protein cabin fat there should also have a cicetian de the modal cycle to a line or messaline example path position should been opposite was with feeling an an an a in retrospect at that time revs kind of amazing to see on cud force of come sealant to forty and peri ti is going to have peen to section pi because at tat time left thinking o the supracismadic newclea she i cycle and we are not thinking too much about a marbling nasty something of our so o being at sol because we fiftipiees really cabin tossup some buildings and with open at structure you bump on to each other an tat we and with a notion giant stop bi yes it it is an amazing place i was lucky enough to have an and position there when i when my lave is at you seventy and ait is an amazing place doing incredible groungrakin work which of course includes yours this is a such in i i clear now that am we have to have you back on for another a series of discussion seriously speaking if if you be up a kind and willing to do that i want to thank you a for several things first of all for your taking the time to day to sit down and discuss these am incredibly interesting ideas indeed tell much of what we talk about on the podcast is a obviously grounded in science and and often but not always as actionable and much of what we talked about to day is actionable in the sense that many people are already doings certain dimensions of these things some are not some hearing about it in considering it you have given as dozens i listed sommout dozens of tools and considerations based on whether not people are engaging in shift work or not i think a lot of people are going t realize that they are shift workers they eventhough they didn't think they were a because of the nature of their habits now it to light into activity and forth am i absorb love the fire fighters study because of its relevant to the general population also not another nod to fighter fighters and shift workers everywhere thank you and you might i think among the colleagues have known for several decades now you really are one of a very small few who manage to do both animal studies and human studies but also animal studies with a very clear eye and appointed toward a human health and a that is such a vital and rare thing especially in this day of am extremely competitive funding i want to thank you for your t me to day for the knowledge you share the actionable aspects o that knowledge the scions that you are doing in your laboratory we will provide links for people to learn more about you and of course you go to the a yam people can am engage in some of the signs directly and of course you have several wonderful books now that we also link to both of which have read and a wonderful particular the book m the first book but also book a related bodies and am for diabetic sand people interest in metapolican and a bludshiger regulation an there y on behalf of myself and my teem here at the you men lapartcas and all the listeners a just for u say thank you much your time is valuable and am the fact toe you share with us and educate many people is really a gift ye thank you and actually likewise thee very few scientists who have taken this liver micro that you have token to a common communicate sins to the public it is not easy am because sometimes you'll have to disco lit down to simple sound by to the point where the scientist and a a all that mantis right but we always have to keep in mind that we are always living in the dark is of since because that is not why i say that this is not my court i shall this is from one of my scientific situp all sima from a acids yours says think about it ten years ago what its what you thought was right and the best has already chanced but ane thing is an the meridian o them and a lining it to our internal clock to our habit is very important and as you mention a we have a a my sicutian clock a which is results firing but we have also distil all of this down to five or six time in component and we have a new a to on time health it'll get on time health a n access that through the standard a story yes o now its the have a little and m and as to guess i a apolavstor and we want to see how because people all us think about fasting but as we discuss to day feeding casting or eating fasting and activity and sleep a kind of interline and we have to kind of balance both of this that that was the idea behind this on time health program and am thank you and because a what your doing is immensely necessary particularly these days when scions is moving at a very past is the lot of legs coming out sometimes something can be very confusing and you spending your time to company gat science is accepts oral thank you and a your your most welcome its am days to day where i get ti it down and and talk to really an colleagues you who are doing the important work that that really matters much and as you am mention a moment ago that there is a a lot of darkness and confusion out there but i thank you for being one of those who shining light thank thank you for joining me for to days discussion with doctor kitchen panda all about circadian biology and time restricted feeding if you are learning

them for things improving sleep supporting hormones improving focus and on the superman labpodcasts is proud to have partner with momentous supplements we have done that for several reasons first of all momentous supplements are of the very highest quality and are used if with various sports teams in very studies through the department defense and on and momentous supplements tend to be in single ingredient formulations single ingredient formulations are absolutely essential if you are going to develop the most cost effective and biologically effective supplement regimen for you because simply put they allow you to adjust the dosage of individual ingredients to alternate days that you take different ingredients to cycle them and forth in addition momentous supplements are available internationally which many other supplements are not if mud to see the supplements discussed on the superman lab podcast you can go to livemomentous spelled o u it live momentous dot come slash

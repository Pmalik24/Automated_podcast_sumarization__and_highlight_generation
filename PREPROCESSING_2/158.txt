from dob you be easy chico it is this america life and do middy won me in for isogloss my longer cousin chill is not really a dog person but there is one dog she adored and me was foxy because she looked exactly a fox except she was black she was the neighbors dog but she incamill seem to have a real kinship maybe because they both won't very far from the ground call was around four or five years old back then she had a little lisp foxy came out as fishy i thought was one of the cutest things id ever heard the way call remembers foxy it is almost a move her memories feel endless summer hazy and perfect a scene shot on crackly film i just remembered the being o be exit for going we foxy i have even you la head of coming to the house and i can see foxy was outside i can see foxy are the dor that leave to the garden there is a story about call and foxy that i think about fairly often i talked about it with my sister for years but never with camisole and it is this once when they were playing foxy nipped t back call nothing serious just an excited kid playing with an excited dog one minute they were playing half under the coffee table in the middle of the room and the next they wont there's no need to go to the hospital or anything but it was enough to startle call and to make her cry but it is what happened after that i think about the most the day after foxy nipped her call went right back to playing with the dog but she would not go back to the place where the nip happened if her feet unthinkingly moved her towards the coffee table she would redirect she would swerve her little body around it instead of avoiding the dog she steered clear of the place when i brought this up to camel she had no memory of doing it did anybody try did he test me head he to she in that area and eggs would not we there i me you e too you you your the done i did any one we me dow talked aby that all call when any go that corner i do not know that that suggests that we were mature enough to to try and help you solve the problem i think we shouted it funny that you avoided the area i think we were all kind of lite watch this way it is and then we trying get you to come around and the we would laugh when you would not which is very cruel in hindsight ism sorry and even more curious call still seems to have a hard time fathoming this that foxy her beloved friend could even unwittingly hurt her twenty year she was later she still will not let herself go there e five as you no a e can ferrets ye li think or tat you at she folly just ley i look she did lie e definitely niff yo but i love he you doing it gat you recasting the past you no or did she she did cause it is we i do not remember it you'll be different offer avoid once with a surprisingly common reaction to information that might knock us off killed her shying away from the things we cannot wrap our minds around it self preservation the world is full of dangerous things things that might hurt us if we look too closely at them we avoid we circumvent we choose not to go there that is it'll show to day in three acts people finding this one place in their lives they simply can access for reasons that sometimes even they do not fully understand the just a mental keep out sign on the door do not look do not pass go do not collect two hundred dollars stay with us we asked one could have grown big in japan it's go cat's is a comedian and she is incredibly closes with her grandma being she they told several times a day the together every week an and that is go makes these incredible videos of herself dancing while her grandmother plays incidental hope woman her grandma raised her but for a while now that is gothic on stage that her grandmother stole her from her dad when she was little ad brought her and her mother from trapan to live in the you es from outside she looks such a sweet on a man old aria woman u know but she is a liar she liar when i was a a she told me we were coming to the stage for a two months vacation i pack likely and then we never left you nova sure story at yah and till the stay were still dealing with the kidnapping a a ways but the truth is that's go on we has the sketchiest idea of what really happened we does not really know how she ended up in america a family does not discuss it talking about it has been a no rosin for her in her family but recently that is g decided to find out because my family does not talk about this as a kid all i new was i was living in japan and suddenly i was not i was separated from my dad and my friends i was forced to go to school in america and learn english and start a new life i went by stay for two months it was dating and confusing and i blame my dad for giving up on us and leaving us in america then a'snan adult that shifted i decided my grandma was the bad my shes stole me away for my dad and he was the victim but i never asked anybody the hard questions to find out the actual truth it was way easier to just talk about it on stage when nobody could fight you on whether it is real or not that is why i love stand up nobody talks back to you it is good for people who do not want across his feelings and then my dad had a stroke he survived it and is recovering but it was kind of e face up call and mi really done i never ask what happened with my move to the united states me it was the biggest even in my life it completely changed everything time to get answers what i kidnap what really happen a in sorting as as i oh grandma o i started with my grandfather perpetrator and confronted her face to face she and my mam lived just twenty minutes away did you kidnap me did you kidnap me that is what i tell audiences when i perform i say ya my grandma pretty much kidnap me on jail it is only we soda was romance you in that she is saying and manner an there is no such thing i did not kidnapyou you'll do in ban at ye could to a yet go long tat those out kin when people kidnap a child they demand money ransom to re turn the child but we did not asked for that it does not count as kidnaping that is on y me the it was something y o i she don't ask for ransom she is still a kidnaper she is just bad at it she took a id to raise for free can you imagine trunnion new opiate with the kidnapper and you are please how much money do you want i just want my kid back and the like oh know it is all me free in fact it'll take her to play for you i think she is going to be a star ism glad my grandma and i can joke about these things to day we sat on my couch in her living rooms we i told her i think our family has a habit of not speaking about difficult things woman the case good i think see you era she gas o did on tulip do not she as we talk my mamma interrupts us from the top of the stairs my mama is with her o a mashed is asking my grandmother to please not talk about these sad things it will effect how i see my life blew e a wan a it will not i asked her i yelled do not want she says try not to talk about anything too sad e are it is good to talk about the past my mama goes back to her room a big reason why we do not talk about things is because of my mam she has paranoid skits aphasia and talking bout sad things can trigger bad memories and the voices in her head any time we want ta talk about the past we have to tiptoe round her we whisper were just avoid it completely and that is how our family has always done things we did not even talk about how my mama has gets o paranoia as a kid my grandma would just say oh your mama just has little blood sugar she is hungry when she was clearly wilding out throwing plates at grandma it is a she needs professional help not bread n i was eager to hear my dad side of this for starters when they divorced did he have custody of me because if he did this seems o way more a real kidnapping and did he even know that my grandma was taking me to the best we talk once a month we re connected when i was fifteen i fluted japan to see him we just came from my dads house now we are a my elementary school thesis where we meme woe stool the my dad and i see each other we try to do as much as we can he is up for anything getting on a big pink dog seesaw with me at the playground to shoot a little radio we let e thine never enter very a fa a ha ha h ha i have all these memories of what it was to live with my dad it'd stay up and welcome him home from work he would make invent japan's curry out of a bag for me then he would lay on his side on the floor and watched an us before bed time i would lay beside him copping his pose i wanted to be him we walk across the street for my old elementary school to an old apartment building if i there is a period i lived here in japan with my mamma and grandma separated from my at me my mamma grandma li li the if you knew was ours in fact is crazy a a a a to o a a a a e too o o yo hungry really sometimes he we get turn in is rough of a hundred o o o a i didn't know the o because e ne me why he to yo you ta that a a a o a i mes yo all the time my lovey a s much i most o we had across the street full of sad stories but i guess i have to fee a drank or after i came to the guess there were seven years when my dad and i did not see each other he wrote me letters but after a while i could not read them any more because my japan's had gotten bad it made me too sad to know we could not really communicate any more i stopped writing him back then when i was fifteen i asked him to come visit and we been talking ever since but it is never been the same as when i used to lay next to him on the floor now i set him down to do an interview in my hotel groom in tell yo got had not interpreter helpless sore conversation my sound more formal than usual we are very japan's and a stranger will do that to us but it also helped us not cry as much which is really cool and also very japan's when you and mam separated what was the arrangement for how much you would see me what was the custody situation ism curious about that she guy man us your i have custody to and who whoa of togo no body n japan when a husband ban with steerage but math o body get custody but when we separated you mama had a mental illness i thought we mam be able to take kill o ka to girl de i the she by a the be its because i was worried alike that was i elybritly got custody you it's moue i toy us which means i was inept it is a kidnaping i told you i was but why did my grandma kit at me and why did not he stop it before i get to his answer i should probably explain a little about his relationship with my mam and how unusual it is this is the part of the story i knew before i fleet japan my mamma dad met through the speed dating event in japan that my grandma sign my mamma up for she worried my mama was getting older and decided she was going have to step in if my mama was ever on a find someone she and my mama were an ti wants they fluted token for the event at both of them my grandma has to take long to everything that way she can make sure everything's perfect that is where my parents met after just a few days they got married and it was great for a bit or my dad has told me ism fortunately for me my parents both say there connection had a lot to do with lust we just cool i think every one should experienced that in their lives and honestly talking about sexes the only time have ever see my mamrearly light up it is condo sweet actually she told me did go to porn theatres together and would make love listening to elves and when they would get into fights my mam would accuse my dad of only wanting her for her body gross i know and then they do it even more ism surprise i do not have siblings i mean i do but there for my dad's previous marriage and that is who my mam moved in with she became a set mama to a boy in a girl and i got pretty bad i mean my mama did not know anybody in japan she had no friends she did not speak the language she never even dated any one before my dad then to have to suddenly move in with a family and try to fit in it was too much my mam would get jealous whenever my dad paid a mention to my had siblings over her my dad told me she would throw things at them and get wildly abusive one time on my sister's birthday when she had her friends over my mama came home and lost it at the side of the party she threw my sisters take across the room kick all her friends out and then started pulling my sister's hair until my dad stopped hern they divorce fright after they had me i do not even

periods i was a hot potato except in this game every one wanted me i was more masked potato anyway i asked my grandma about this but there is a lot of words i do not know a madman i had not

colleagues my orgeat he has a tale about something he avoid at all costs even though it seems to follow him everywhere he goes it is been this for years here is i manual what i am about to tell you is not some funny story i tell at parties in fact i do not really talk about it at all then i do not talk about is a song i do not talk about it because for over ten years any time i listened to sing hum or even think about it it get stuck in my head and when that happens bad things happened to me often immediately i lost keys wallet mi as security card after listen to this song i lost a relationship once got dumped after it played in a coffee shop i was in i not a superstitious person but i truly believe it is the ultimate bad luck for me i right before i sat down to write this no joke i m in sure to renew my renter's assurance just in case i plants how seriously i take the song the first time i heard it i was a freshman in college you do suggested it to me during a morning study session for a midterm i had lay in that day i member listen to it and feeling happy i was having a great day and the song was my sound track i member f that feeling staying with me for hours hearing the song in my head as i took the mister it was still playing in my head a few days later when i got results back and saw that i failed and the time i did not blame the song i was dislike well that is why i get for taking a class about black holes i moved on in fact i added the song to a long playlet i had a few weeks later when i was listening to music in middle the day after some classes the song played and i fell asleep while listening let through a worksheet i had and got fired for the first only time in my life i just need more sleep i told myself it is a coincidence but then months later the next time the song came on i found myself feeling really on edge i fought about skipping it but just as quickly i also for that is ridiculous i kept the song plain later that day after a concert band rehearsal i put my back back down to help a friend moon chairs and somebody stole it presumably for the lap top inside i went the rest of the semester without personal computer i will shrieked out how in horemoovis there always that moment where the happy couple finally realized they might not have booked a great week an get away at a cabin after all and tat chevies are most definitely off that is what it felt after that even enough i knew it was not rational i tried to avoid the song but it did not work the only bike accident have ever been in happened after i heard it being played by a passing car one time it came on during a long road trip and the next time i stopped i noticed a nail in one of my tires when i was preparing to run my first marathon i was putting together a flawless and my shown played a bit of the song before i could turn it off few hours later my sister called me and told me e manual our parents are getting divorced the next morning i forgot to bring my head sons to the race and for the nearly five hours it took me to run tamaraphon all i could think about when my parents their marriage and that song which happens to be a sappy love song endlessly keeping in my head too know all of the sounds illusion on a couple of years ago i tried to convince myself once and for all that the song was just a song but it back fires spectacularly i decided to play every day for a month i wake up play the song and then walk around the rest of the day telling myself not to worry when nothing bad happened for three days i felt relieved i then on the fourth day i suffered a free rest injury which plagued me for nine months to make matters worse because it'd played it much spot if i kept pushing me the song i the months after the accident because it for i wanted to hear it that year was by far the worse your of my twenties my hair which until that point was decently your started falling out aggressively mi long time finally cat third i went for a massive break up my professional life was under i got bovid write before christian i spent my first ever christian completely alone and it push me to do something i should have done years earlier i added for group that sings the song to my do not play list on modify which is a shame because i really the song it is good with a capital j it is one of those brandy disgobaters from the seven is that is ridiculously happy positive it makes you wonder if the seventies were the most optimistic amorous have ever been or if things were actually soblaku artist had to make songs this on t a know i will not be playing with the song or naming it is poison to me a skeptical friend of mine pointed out that yes bad things happen when i hear the song but do not bad things happened to all of us all the time maybe i just noticed them when the song plays he suggested i tried to keep track of every unfortunate event i encounter without the song i could see once and for all fells nothing to this do i did it i listed every tiny thing over a course of a couple of weeks and i was surprised by how many there were even if they were small i cut myself on a metal can accidentally got bleach or one of my favorite teachers got into a never ending back and forth it my health insurance over almost twenty claims for did not want to pay i spent half of the family wedding in that yare because a guest past our of at reception i know i am supposed to look at that list and feel freed he will finally able to listen to that song whenever i worth but an do not judge me all it did was convinced me that lousy stuff happens to me a loth why would i replaying this song and making it worse i have nothing else this in my life i do not believe in astrology i do not believe in luck i do not believe that misfortune is got punishing you for your bad to you i know it is entirely possibly bat when i hear that tune i free out in a way that causes unpleasant things to happened n but this i believe i have

bistranes to talking to me immediately and you i do not even blame her i think a lot of people forget how dangerous and rotate to being gay was presented back at the time she is bullied beaten up in to escape she to stories but shes not such a surprise given where she was hanging out on line it the place shes stumbled o when she was about eleven mi at had been open was that connected with old

also got oils and i found nonfiction and i did not tat nonfiction a whole world of people equally obsessed with stories and sip to the point they were going on mine to write their own versions of the stories they love files sort of the rings they fix the things the feel the author got wrong there is time of shipping that is people deciding which characters should have ended up together and rewriting it that they do none of this is for money for the most part its just for fun tampon was just kid but she starts publishing stories there self she never would've taken to school it is the

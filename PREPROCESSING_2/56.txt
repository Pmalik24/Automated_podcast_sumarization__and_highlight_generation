those government funded government promoted censorship technologies and enterprises target conservative mediolits including t the daily wire their goal is to paint us as unreliable and therefore to push advertisers away from advertising on programs this one websites the daily wire websites the federalist that is being pushed by the state department that is an ongoing prom we are suing not for money we re suing for in injunction and if you want to help us fight these censorship that you are seeing from the federal government the kind of censorship that on a broader level has reached over

pathetic and ridiculous oh of the ax mandate we are now suing we u s state department for an injunction s they will stop their censorship regime already meanwhile i know a little but about the kind to speech that are generally welcome on campus give ben ban from quite a few camasses including it to pal university have spoken at more than a few compasses at which violence broke out over my speeches including castrate university law santualis pen state university of californium at berlin i also know that were i a student at any of these universities and if i said as a student what i recently say as a speaker i would undoubtedly we drag before the administration and hid with some sort of sanctions i be responsible for milk grow egressions for saying things western culture is superior and men are not women i be responsible for harmful language for saying that human beings ought to be judged not based on rase but on merit these are the kinds of things the are forbotan on college compasses all over the country which by are speech has never been a top of mind issue for many of the administrators on college campus instead sensitivity has but apparently at the top universities in america all of those sensitivities disappear magically for one group specifically jaws yesterday house republicans held a hearing which the heads of major universities were grilled regarding the rise antisemitism on their compasses over the past few weeks wee been talking about that sight in antisemitism for weeks from threats of violence to near riots from tearing down hostage posters to openly u hating slurs being promulgated in public some of the students from these universities explain the situation on campus here for example was student emblem inner of new york university t is it to be a new at n you being a new at n moayyu is walking to class and passing torn and defaced posters of innocent hostages with the words occupier and murderer written across their faces it is going to bath's library to study and being interrupted by unauthorized protests where students and faculty call for a globalized into those revolution and incitement to violence against news everywhere and a call for the annihilation of the jewfish state and my friends and family who lived there being a jaw at n you is being surrounded by students and faculty whose support the murder and kidnapping of news because after all as they say resistance is justified when people are occupied it is being surrounded by social justice warriors and self proclaimed feminists whose calls for justice and abruptly when the rate victims are news being a new at n bayou has went being physically assaulted in n mouse library by a fellow student while i was wearing an america is rally flag and having my attacker still roam freely throughout the campus being a new at n you is experiencing how diversity equity and inclusion is not a value that n you extends to its swish students she quarry is exactly right on awn them here is alias coat the university of pensylvani an describing similar experiences an that happy university i love pen give wanted to attend this university since before i can remember i am sure because the pen i attend to day is unrecognizable from the pen i once use to know pen once renowned for ground breaking discoveries the amir and a akene is now a shewing landscape of patron hostility i university revere for its for sure of knowledge has devolved intent a rent where just students tiptoe through their days uncertain and unsafe the situation at pan is secular into a full on crisis with students openly hurting their intentions to proceed with plants with or without university permission pent an bivalent fuels e crisis that is shattered my academic sanctuary paulisyes meant to safeguard us have become hollow promises and let us be clear if they failed just students to day to morrow they will fail the raise of us novelle less i refuse to go back to nineteen thirty nine when use at the high the religious samples and high who they are to to the intimidation and harasmonof us i used to think this is nonsense warmongering until i is made aware that pen recommended to students cot not were clothing slassiccassories related to nudism now imagine the beacons indorsing congress to describe similar experiences calls for genuine celebration of terror and rape against black america physical threes against black america does any one think these respective university present when a seat grinning at the law makers who are quizzing them on their actions that is precisely what happened yesterday again if you one aside that every one just be less sensitive whatever anything goes on campus that is one thing bat that is not what is happening on these call ice campuses or sensitivities extended to every one except for you would not here was represent of least demonic of new york questioning the presidents of university pensylvania hazard university i it about genocide language chanced on campus listen to these responses long clibween a stop and started because there is a lot here doctor cornblusf does m at m i t does calling for the genocide of news violate em items code of conduct or rules regarding bullying in harassment yes or no if targeted individuals not making public statements yes or no calling for the genocide of news does not constitute bullying and harassment i have not heard calling for the genocide r news on our campus but you have heard chance for into fade if her chance which can be antisemitic depending on the context when calling for the elimination om candy those would not be according to the m i news cot o conduct or rules that would be on investigated of as harassment if pervasive and severe miss my gill at pen does calling for the genocide of news violate pens rules or code of conduct yes or no if the speech turns into conduct it can be harassment yes i am asking specifically calling for the genocide of news does that constitute bullying a harassment if it is directed and severe pervasive it is harassment the answer is yes it is a context dependent decision conprswoman it is a context contents to sign as your testimony today calling for the genetic of news is depending upon the context that is not bullying or harassment this is the easiest question to answer yes miss my gill is your testimony that you will not answer yes if it is if the lessor not if the speech becomes conduct it can be harassment yes conduct meaning committing the act of genocide the speech is not harassment this is sonic tephomismacgall i may to give you one more opportunity for the world to see your answer does calling for the genocide of news violate ens code of conduct when it comes to bulling and harassment yes or no it can be harassment the answer is yes can be and doctor gay at hazard does lying for the genocide of news violate halyard's rules of bullying and harassment yes or no it an be depending on the context what is the contacts targeted as an individual targeted as at an individual it is targeted at jewfish students jewfish individuals do you understand your testimony is d humanizing them do you understand that d humanization is part of anthem ism i will ask you one more time us calling for the genocide of news violate hazards rules of believing and harassment yes or no antisemitic rhetoric and is not antithetic atomic antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct at amounts to collying harassment intimidation that is actionable conduct and we do take action the answer is yes that calling for the genocide of news violates hazard code of conduct correct again it depends on the contact it is not depend on the contacts the answer is yes and this is why you should resign these are unacceptable answers across the board i mean it there amazing answers because again just substitute the language now we are not talking here whether the first amendment protects activity for example the c k k marching through smoky the first amendment does protect that activity we are talking about college compasses where there are strict speech codes that exist on every one of these college camasses if you don't wan to have speech codes do not have speech codes but if you are going to it is weird that it only applies to every one except for one group can you imagine going at hazard university and leading a rally saying t death to all black people all black people should be killed can you imagine that not being punish by hazard university with expulsion can you imagine university of pensylvania some sort of rally where every one is yelling at the top of their lungs death to gay people all gay people should die and hatband that not being punishable at university pennsylvania but when you can from the river to the sea palestine should be free or intoned a revolution there is only one solution when you chant those things that is now considered perfectly acceptable at these schools putting what dependent on contact now what is amazing is that the contact very often includes conduct when they say things we are not worried about speech but when it bleeds over into conduct we have a problem that the truth is that depending on the conduct they are find with that to how many students have been suspended or expelled for actively harassing students a just for lining up outside libraries and pounding on the doors in acts of intimidation and all f this is ridiculous listen to the amount of obfuscation that they are putting forward listen to the amount of spin can you imagines during the black lives matter protest an y one saying something remotely similar as a university present about any of thus it is difficult to imagine these icons of sensitivity and diversity equity an inclusion would be nearly sanguine about sleds against any other racial or ethnic minority in america simply put they would not one can make the case for free speech on campus i can and i do but one cannot pretend tat universities protect students against horseman and then sold peel hollocloss level rhetoric these university presidents do not even free speech but there perfectly fine not only mouthing language they certainly do not believe about free speech ut then smiling while they violate these prescription s why are they sanguine there are two reasons and will get to those in just

the same old holiday fair elevate your feast with good ranchers this year good ranchers america meat delivered as we are saying there are two reasons why the left is comfortable on campus with excluding the news when it comes to all of their language about rhetoric diversity harassment a the rest first the left and university presidents are almost the platonic i real of intellectual lefts believe that news are not part of the interjectional coalition of oppression by left is logic jaws are part of the superstructure of power since all success is merely a reflection of hierarchies of power and news are disproportionately successful success equals power power equals bad antisemitism is merely the ugliest guide for the oppressor oppressed binary but it is not the only one just at the newest white america avian america on university compasses who are now white because they scored too high on their estates trust locates discriminate against them then there is the second reason the left really really hates israel the left tatisrael because america news israel is too successful in the region in which it is located israel according to the left is a colonialist outpost of the west the lest is evil because it is too successful the west is therefore exploitative and oppressive therefore israel is exploitative and oppressive as a outlet of the west in the madeleast hence the deep and passionate attempt by the left to pretend that antisemitism and artisan is more unrelated the left does not want to be perceived as openly antiseptic thy want to pretend that they are actually tolerant and evert but they understand that antisinism can provide a heartening opportunity to oppose jewfish and western flourishing hence the lefts rabbit attachment to the idea that calls for israel destruction are somehow not antiseptic but actually a reflection of a more universalistic humanitarian creed sure that free would result in the death of millions of news and the dominants of radical muslin terror all over themed least but that does not matter after all israel is the real problem because the west is the real problem and we know that is true because again the west is successful and because israel is successful and success equals power and power equals exploitation according to the left radical muscle machines that in powers and oppress their citizens are not worth one bit of attention and means they are poor which means they victimized which mean that they are the oppressed israel by contrast being tolerant diverse open and successful ought to be destroyed that is why yesterday and a subtle bit of maneuvering hazard president claim gay among the other college presidents acknowledged that israel does have right to exist but not as a jewfish state which is saying that ireland has right to exist be not as an iris country president a do you believe that israel has the right to exist as a jewishnation i agree that the state of israel has the right to exist miss my gill same question i agree chairman fox the state of israel has the right to exist doctor corbluf absolutely israel has the right to exist israel has the right to exist but that is not the question you notice that the chair woman is actually asking as a jewfish state which is the definition of israel and all three of those college president ignore that they are doing that for a reason because it israel is bad israel is a jewfish state then it does not have the right to exist by that definition what ought to be done bill accent we yo of pressing square a major done to hazard wrote that the college presidents quote must all resign in distract if a c yo of one of our companies give us similar answer h or sh would be toast within the hour why has antisemitism exploded on campus and around the world because of leaders president's gay my gill and cornbluth who believe genocide depends on the context to think that these are leaders of ivyleague institutions that are charged with the responsibility to educate our best and brightest acumen is right of course but that is not nearly sufficient the universities a cross america are corrupt through and through there indorsement of d e i diversity equity and inclusion has we a curse to reason and decency they politics are viol those politics also make t universities corrupt factories of moral depravity which means that's first every major's owner to these universities showed bill acumen think about cutting funding of course some of us run this bandwagon years ago twenty years ago i wrote a book title brainwashed have universities in doctrine america youth when i was still usual a i was nineteen years old the book came out when i was twenty in two thousand four in it i wrote the conservatives ought to quote pull money from universities i also said that tactic would not be nearly suffixion that other sources including radical illogic regimes would fill the gap which is what happens say arabia cottar they are plenty of places we are willing to pour their money into these universities because those universities very often reflect their values that means the universities ought to be hit with another tactic business people must stop falling for the credential and scam the universities represent they ought to be hiring bright kids out of high school directly and giving them internships or hiring from solid state schools that is what these universities are anyway they are just factories for deplomased and meantime idea here is that if you get a really god essay score and you go to hazard this means your smart i can tell your smart just by the essay score and utopia coming out o high school i do not need you would go two hundred thousand dollars in to debt and be in dominated in queer theory in order for me to recognize the a smart person instead businesses should just his people out of high school if they have good essay the scores and good grades for example finally parents needs seriously think about not sending their kids to the universities at all especially in the liberal arts they are in indoctrination mills for truly immoral carbon if you on a canon point as to how bad these universities are here is actually a gray canon point young liberal news a whole generation of young jewfish kids have been sent to university by their parents who believed in the upwardly mobile america dream to o yours parents there who say that their gray dream is to get their kid into a place hazard there these kids were then turned against their parents and their roots the near times has a fascinating story today about many young news meaning of course people who were born jewfish but have nothing to do with actual jewfish practice or identity as even the times recognizes and the york timeline that many of these young news are quit a abandoning israel in the name of left to ideology here is the times quote mark cornblatt prepared uneasily last month for his daughter louis to arrive for ten days with the family her home comings once brought the comfort of moving nites and boardgames but this there is different he and his wife audit had moved away from malison wisconsins live in tell of eve where they fell to real sense of belonging is news around the same time their daughter attending graduate school at the university of californium berley came to oppose the existence of israel as a jewfish state that daughter wait for a wit for a wait for it sometimes uses the pronouns they then shocker it is all the uni thing it is all one thing everyone who supports translates also supports palestine everyone who supports palestine also support supporting it is the uni left winged thing according to the times at berley she read array lord maria came ruth willow galore and other black feminist thinkers who prompted her to consider questions around power privilege and whiteness miss cornblatk came to feel that her emotional ties to jewfish statehood undermine provision for collective liberation over the last year should be he increasingly involved in pro palestine activism including through jewfish hoist for peace an antizinist actors group and the if not now movement i do not think the state of israel would ever have been establish he said it is based on this idea of jewfish supremacy and ism not on board with that actually the concept of israel is based on know jewfish existence but that is really what leftism opposes for all the reasons we have talked about universities are a disaster area full stop parent should pull their kids unless those kids are prepared for the raging hailstorm of foolishness and immorality they are about to be taught a cane just one second we are going to get the latest on the israelcommoss war and the battle inside congress over antisemitism first in a world filled with uncertainties you need to be prepared for any possibility you need my patriate supply honest to goodness it peso looking round and they are

that two hundred bucks off yer three month emergency food supplies to prepare with bend comrade now that's prepare with ben dot come they on the halls of congress people having a similarly tough him actually taking on antisemitism they're some of this actually from both sides of the i a for example republicans yesterday put for to resolution condemning antisinism as antisemitism this led represent of very antler to suggest that antisianism is not antisemitism now the way that you get the the reason he is doing this is because there a people inside his own coalition who wish that irreligious disappeared they would be destroyed the be thin oar and recreated to lead and he does not wish to condemn them he is on a pretend that antisianism and antisemitism are totally unrelated the way that he gets out of this particular box since obviously than oar and recited to leave our antisemite and hate news and israel the way he gets out of this box is he suggest hell therefore some news who antiianist is t the favorite tactic and the people he sites are sotmarchasidem which is a sect of ultra orthodox who by the way when it says their antagonist what is t be clear what they mean by antisianist what sot marcosidem this ultra orthodox which they tiny tin in percentage even the orthodox what exactly is their belief system they are belief system is that there is should in fact be a jewfish country in israel but it should be a deictic monarchy whit the reestablishment of the third temple not quite the antisianism of the palistinians who wish to see every you obliterated from the region the sotmarcosiem do not believe in a secular state of israel they believe in a jewfish theocracy o if you are talking about these people as though what they actually want is for all news to be removed from the region ah know actually what they want is for there to be a jewfish monarchic theocracy in the land complete with high priesthood and a third temple built right now instead of what they think of is an obstacle to that the secular jewfish state of israel that is what you've talking about severe playing a word game when you say the sotmarchosin want the same thing as for example achieved to leave anohinomar that they're the same kind of quonquot antisionist that is ridiculous that is ridiculous that is saying that somebody who wants a christian theocracy in the united states is is in the same camp as some one who wants to tear down the government of the united states and replace with the communistictatorship not quite the same thing in any case here's very antler and what he is really doing here obviously he is covering for prison solve no hin o mar other members of the democratic party we do not actually his real and do not is unfortunately this resolution does absolutely nothing to genuinely count to the scourge of anti feminism nor does it help bring us together with the unity of purpose that this topic merits rather it is another attempt in a long series a failed efforts by the grope to weapons jewfish lives for political gains it is another partisan hotshot gain thin amounts the cheap value signaling not serious action but if there ever was a time for real action it is now to day in the face of the largest increase in anti feminism both violent and virulent in this nation's history we have a clear choice we can abuse this moment to try to inflict into party political damage or we can rise to the occasion and do something real and powerful to actually help the jewfish community ah well what is one thing that i noticed i notice that during that learn he says we no we should wok to inflict intraparty damage on one another over antisemitism again this the same guy who also did not vote she enter riveted to leave over her comments with regard to israeliter complete antrismetic lies he says e vehemently disagrees with her but he is not called her for sample an antisemite which she clearly clearly is o it'll take my ut my tips on antisemitism from some place else meanwhile peppers the democratic representative woes frankly of flora same sort of thing she also will not condemn promo dial the spent yesterday chestily trying to walk back her comments that rape was know not that big deal and when it is against jewfish ladies in israel from milegiapall house he answer in the question on y calling dawn of as on sundae on this did that play any part in your question in a quest to traps resolution well this really has been in the work since ta psi said really with i but bidding the works for it for many ones on we start hearing the a stories from the women in e crane and then of course again this now with mamas and its atrocities and and i try not to have my actions here bee dictated by inert for comments by other members this is a much more serious issue in our fit than one member to an it has to been said by all rape and sexual fault as a tool of war as a weapon of war is not acceptable it is not hard for you to say this very eloquently and very clearly why is it for others now niter asking me to be a psychiatric psi psychologist are what they have to answer for themselves and i answer for selves but i din think i really i speak for the overwhelming majority republicans democrats here people a with good h a testa sal shul not be t a war to acceptable i haven oftomeconcimation there a has to be called ow in understand mi this very tough it really really is not and meanwhile on the rightsize of the atoms amass put out what is pretty obviously an antismaticmame yesterday it was a it was a me in which he compared america patriotism to pianism is o congress these days america patriotic that it is the mean of drake the what there basely to binary me one where he shunning in thing and when he's giving to the thus up this this congress these days shunning america patriotism congress these days giving a thus up dezianism a and obviously the ideate is that america patriotism is somehow directly opposed tuzianism now there a couple reads on this that are possible there is the more charitable reed which is that there democrats in the democratic party who for example do not america patriotism but they're ora with pianism and that is weird and they would be one with both and then there is the reed which is the more obvious red which i that america patriotism is somehow opposed tuzianism you can be both an america patriot and azianis which of course is ridiculous mean just ridiculous full stop crazy considering that that has been the mainstream position in the united states since the birth of the state of israel is being an america patriot and being avian and being pianist being in favor of the existence of a jewfish state israel are not in far are not in conflict in any way shape er form and you can read it in in either of those two ways there is the more charitable way in which the argument is that congress should not be shining america atrip ism the should be embracing america patriotism in the same way that many democrats andbrazianism that is the more charitably the other way is that represent amassed whose voted a long side to illhan oar and recite to lead with regard to any any indication of support for israel actually justly like finish and what he actually wants is for congress to dismiss pianism and he is really saying the two are directly in conflict the white house and were huge out scoring political points to the white house immediately jumps on that and the white house suggest that its time for republicans to condemn the post herb's whisked of the whorehouse hat all america including the house cop e leadership should condemn this virulent antisemitism from a sitting member of congress here is the deal who should condemn antisemitism were evert exist if what massy meant is the latter which again given his voting record would not chock that america patriotism in finish are somehow n direct conflict then at the antisemitism it should be condemn also what promote girl did the other day antisemitism should be conte this is not particular up the fact that it is tough demonstrates once again everything can be made a parts in issue even hatred of news speaking of which when is a one of the things that is been lost in this entire an this entire fight between israel and compass is the simple fact that there is a good side here in there is a bedside and commas is the bad side benjamin t to now who the prime minister of israel yesterday he gave a speech in which he he is beside himself because he is pointing out that as the tales come out from october seven of rape of women by the weight reports of rape of men is well which it s for ink in weirdly different level i mean i know stories of things tat are happening g that happen to hostages there are not public knowledge at this point and got to tell you it is way worse than anything you have heard way way worse than anything you have hard and the inter national community is still poopooingness and pretending thathe'e some fore moral equivalentere sitting out who beside himself yesterday speaking about thus the woman's rights ovinizations to the human rihtsoginizations you word of the had to is remain horrible atracotes scuta ululation we that a lain i epical soothe lis leaders governments nations to speak up against the sectroson well they are not going to when the reason there not going to his again because they have to have that moral equivalent to israel is bad andthat mean to anything that is done against it is justified in the fans phonon oppressor oppressed coalition of the wretched idea the the basic ideas that if you are memberofthe oppressed class get to do whatever the hell you want to members of the called oppressor class that is it that is an that that has been a a moral tat equation the has ben done by number of insanely antisemitic and self hating jewfish people and it is totally it is totally while but is become mainstream it become absorb mainstream by the way it is worth noting t this point that israel has actually hit a shocking number of terrors despite all of the talk by ut israel not being specific enough in it is attack the reality is that according to the usually military a leaves report from an off the brief the record brief and for foreign journalists suggests that israel believes that of the roughly fifteen thousand people the compasses reported dad five thousand of them are terrorist which is an amazing ratio by the way way better than the united states in for example epoch typically urban warfare means that for every terrace you kill you are probably going to kill three to force civilians because they embed with civilians s israel being incredibly specific and yet what is a making about this is that even if you point that even the you times is now admitting that even the your times admitting that israel hit five thousand terrors in the course of killing fifteen thousand people again they're goals to the five thousand terrace and thy killed fifteen thousand because come ass hydesmonks civilians and now they are complaining the israel has not killed enough terrors according to the washington postquote at least five thousand comose millions have been killed according to three scaly security officials leaving the majority f the groups estimated thirty thousand strong military wing intact why dingbat get is why you think israel has not killed all thirty thousand the answers because they are being considered and how they go about this war the matter the narrative is set another media are going to keep pumping it out there that israel some how the inhumane party in this conflict which is truly an astonishing reversal of the truth organ just one second we will get

coaching and access to really good resources and facilities and transtudents participating ports for this same reason as their kids because it is fun because it t creates belonging in community because it teaches much about persistence and leadersand and discipline and less they learn to lose gracefully hopefully and open they learn to wen with signal be hopefully i they learn to do the sort of work that means you have higher grades and stay connected to school i want every kid to have that chance to have the chance to play the dystopian this the distopianism of women fatwa got graves smiling oh and that is why women should learn to get their asses kicked by men and that is really what is going to make this a better more tolerant diverse and sustainable world of my god it is it that the smiling is what really does it to she had her own defense of of transit women she said well if we ban men then we can have to check genitals in lock room ought what i noticed is that there are in the woman's locker room when men are competing with women that is a thing that i noticed and that all the women also noticed nosy there with a proposed am on transactlets that originally allowed for genital examinations on miners in order to quote uncle open fact women is that correct unfortunately yes and we are being here in this use under the guise of not only trying to further marginalize clanswomen and girls we are talking of opening up all women and girls to genital examinations when they are under each that is potentially just because someone can paint to some one and say i do not think you are a girl that is t and were saying this in an environment of a postdoc america we are states are criminalizing cess to abortion and want nothing more we not jet hires on women to figure out when who is getting a menstrual cycle who does not have one and were chances to believe that this is going to make us better she sand that garner shes such a bed actress a i mouth the pencil in any case she was just point out here that actually do not have to general examinations on any one just left to present under ohiolaw which is what she is referring to in original copy of berth certificate it is the reason why for example you should not be having genderless birth certificates because these things are actually quite important because the alternative is dudes playing with the ladies in being in the lock room with the girls you nous uncomfortable for twelve girl girls having twelve yearly boys who pretend their girls in the lock room or who believe the girls in the lock room and they have a right to feel in comfortable about all that what is amazing to me is one republicans run from this culture issue this is such an obvious culture for win for republicans there is sort of a a fraught battle for second place that is going on right now inside the republican primary and have said before i ism a big van of governor rondisantis in flora if the primaries were held today i would vote for him in the primaries i macgehaley as well i said before i thought she was an excellent you an ambassador but i i really thing nick stepped on a rake right here she was doing it n interview yesterday in which she was asked about trains children or never and her answer which is well if if apparent decide to trains twelve girl than that is totally fined that is not an acceptable answer the question is what care should be on the table when i shall twelve old child in this country aside female at birth says i she feel more comfortable living as a boy what should the law allow the response to be i think the law should stay out of it and i think parents should handle at this is a job from the parents to handle and then when that child but comet fifteen if they want to make more of a permanent change they can do that but i think up until then we say with fourteen inch wins they go through a lot during purity they go through a lot of confusion they go through a lot of anxiety they go through a lot of pressures we should support them the whole way through but we do not need to go in inform something in schools we do not need school setting there hiding from the part d what nchanitor pro now threats and we do not main to have those conversations and schools that is the conversations that should be had at home oka she is right that schools should not be socially transitioning parents without the parents knowledge also parent should not be allowed to transition the twelve year old kid that is absurd first fall transition is the biggest youfromism in the entire world you cannot transition a boy into a girl selling transitioning ism struggling to you comb with an analogy what else you transition in life in this way the these folks axis i swear to god they act as though this is doctor uses the speeches the star on star off machine but to on off machine they goes not how any of this works no there should be full state bands on this sort of

excellent job over the f b i between the reports of the f b i targeting certain types of christian in the united states centers of catholic in the united states and the f b i targeting from temple pro life people and the fa is dis proportionate resource is spent on any one who is wandering around the capital on canary sixth and the f b is complete failure with regard to the hunter by the laptop in twenty twenty is been a bad stretched for the f b cries ray was on the hill and a senator john kenned of luisiana red hin the riot act over the f i failure to say that the enter by he laptop was real which the f b i full well knew during the twenty twenty election these are very week answers here from crossway why in the f b say he et tithe laptops real why don't you tell over by the lap tops real we are not baps an what is on it but is real the sit a of fiction why yes you might imagine if b i cannot especially in a time that be talking about an on going investigation second i would tell you that least my understanding is that both the b i folks involve in the conversations and the twitter folks of rolling the conversations both say that the f b i did not direct twitter to a suppress but others were in government well i cannot again i cannot speak to others in government are that part of the point that i was trying to make because the fisisten e can f b you are not part of the wide house in part of all can security you are not suppose to bi political you see ow this controversy a going on whiling the f b s an time out folks we are not getting e meddle this but the stops real again we have to be very careful about what we can say especially in the middle of an election season because that is precisely some of the problems that led i my predecessors a a negative fines from inspector did you oka but that is not right because again failure to say the true thing because your predecessor said not true things that is not the same thing again actively involving yourself in an election cycle in which you announce that your activity your activity is on going which is what names come did with regard to killer cotton few days from the election in twenty succeeding had reopening the investigation because we found the laptop hadn't had to announce that because that was about his activity but if the f bi knows for a fact that a narrative is false and that is been promulgated by one of the campaigns and the media and other parts of the government and the f b i knows that it is in fact in act ore omission that is material to the election for them not to say we know the lap up is real that is ridiculous either way you are quote quit interfering but on one side your quoting quote interfering but on behalf of a true the in tit is not the same things what names to me did in twenty sixteen meanwhile cries ray said o y to by the way even though there is still sort cases pending it suggest that we should not be coordinating with social media about what kenning cannot be selling up to the action we will still be coordinate with social media you concerned about the fifth circuit thing in fact that you cannot communicate with social media to alert them to threat we courses this this the subject of on going litigation a the a findings of the lower courts in that litigation a things that are hotly contested a through the departments filings president trump himself rightly in twenty eighteen or nineteen ai should an executive order on this very subject calling it a national emergency sissy that sent intelligence committee overwhelmingly by partisan basis identified much the same and called for more engagement more engagement with socionme companies not less the key the key is making sure that it is done in the right way and that is what wore committed to refocus on the hidden hand of the foreign actor not on the content itself post what well i wish they would do that but i do not trust you and ism sure that no one else does it either once again our administration is staffed in the city's the man government is staff by people where just not either good at their jobs or who very often argon at their jobs but in the wrong way and meanwhile congress continues to debate over you ran aid according to the your times president by in's urgent pushed for plenish you cranes work chests and send eight to israel on the brink of collapse in the senate where republicans are prepared on wednesday to block funding unless democrats agreed to add strict measures to clampdown on migration at the sports with mexico why in the worlds that even remotely controversial democrats will it what they want namely the full funding to you crane republicans will get a border that is not going to be completely open and democrats are some how blocking at this the melt down apparently took place on the revival critical testate in the senate ion one hundred and ten at billion dollar emergency spending bill and not only made at clear the measure would fail but severely dim the prospects for any by partisan agreement soon a vote to block aid would spotlight flagging you us resolve at a critical time in you cranes war against present in queen's russia we readouts to abandon you crane said senator christmarif you want what you could do is you could just allow the to be borders security you could do that very an understand why this remotely controversial were security by the way is being called for by democrats down at the border it is amazing that basically democrats in the senate are attached to the open borders nonsense and they are willing to scuttle their own support for you crane aid senegal ins grass count me in on you crane if we aren't help get you ran and pouted gets away with this you will be in a war with math i got all that tell get a robust re publican vote for you crane israel ans i want if you have real borders security but apparently there not doing anything on the border chuck stumer is now suggesting that if the build fails because the border that is on republicans well here is the thing either mobile wants the aid or it does not want the ate either you the it is important for you crane out to collapse to the ruffians and for israel t o winning goa or he does not if he does not thing its that important then not i suppose the trucksumer is right and you will try to blame the republicans for it an thing's important maybe he might try youknow shoring up the border here is structure for trying blame republicans for it is obviously a democratic failure here let us remember three things as we move forward one how important you crane is it is a turning point in western civilization this is a historic moment and this cannot be delayed any longer a kolinsky by the way could not make it to are said something happens at the last minute to our briefing at three but we will here and you will hear particularly from mar order who knows this well how desperate you crane is for the ardent that the president has proposed but it is vital vital second if this fails because a boarder that is not a by partisan failure that is a failure of the republicans and the republican leadership the only reason they added boarder was because the lot of members of their hard right said they want boarder but a lot of those same members are not gan vote you crane no matter what is there i mean first of all that is not true fears wells not true republicans our saying why not add border to the package you have by partizan support for the bill republicans support the israel aid more than democrats to democratsport you craned more than republicans to the idea is the compromise middle is going to be all those things plus border and trucktsumer's balking at that what is the high priority on leaving the border open why why exactly does he dust for the one to leave the board open this is why people are suspicions of what exactly are the motives over here oka in just one second we are going to get to mobile make extraordinary comment with regard to the twenty twenty four election we will get to that momentarily first if you are not a member become a member use coachhaparo check out for two

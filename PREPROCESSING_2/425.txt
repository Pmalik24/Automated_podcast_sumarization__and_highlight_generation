welcome to the hubermanlao sciencescience pace i drew supermen and on professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is do portal do portal is somebody who truly defies formal definition he is however credited by many to be the world expert in all things movement movement is one of the more fascinating and important aspects of our nervous system in fact it was the great hobo prize winter sherrington that said movement is the final common path and what he was referring to is the fact that much of our nervous system is dedicated to movement and in particular that the human nervous system can generate the greatest variety of forms of movement we can run we can jump we can crawl we can move at different speeds far more variation in movement and different types and speeds of movement than any other animal in the animal kingdom can perform my interest in bringing etoportal on to this podcast stemmed from a discussion about just that about sherrington and the enormous range of movements that humans can engaged do is both a practitioner and an intellectual we all know what a practitioner is at somebody who walks the walk who actually performs the thing that they are knowledgeable about and indeed do has studied capouera a number of other martial arts dance gymnastics various forms of sport he is trained top athletes conifer greggor and he has many many other credits to his name as a practitioner and teacher however he is also a true intellectual of movement i define an intellectual as somebody who can both think about and talk about a subject at multiple levels of granularity that is with exquisite detail end with its quite simplicity depending on their audience and depending on the topic at hand and as you will soon her from y discussion with do he is both a practitioner and a true intellectual of all things movement to day through our discussion you will learn how the nervous system generates movement and the different forms of moment the different speeds of movement you are also going to get an incredible insight through does mind and eyes of how movement can serve us in the various contacts of life not just in sport not just in exorcize but in every aspect of our lives from the time we get up in the morning until the time we go to sleep at night how we engage with others how we engage with ourselves indeed how movement even in forms relationships of different kinds i found our discussion to be one of the most enlightening and interesting discussions that have ever had not just about movement but about the nervous system i can assure you that by the end of this episode you will not only learn a tremendous amount about movement through the eyes an mind of the one and only do portal but your also will learn a tremendous amount of hero science about how the cells and circuits and hormones and narrow transmitters of your body assist in c eating the various forms of movement the you can generate that your trying to learn and generate and that perhaps you should think about trying to learn and generate and indeed you will learn some protocols an tools for how to do that in science we have a phrase actually its a title that is reserved for only the rarest of individuals we say that somebody is an end of one meaning a sample size of one and as you will soon learn to portal is truly and and of one before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching an research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigrens once or twice o day is that i helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens hit get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemand three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if fore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k two is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five travel packs and the year supply of vitamin three k to today episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar one talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the preparations of electron t if you would to try element you can go to drink element that element e dokcalm slash huberment and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element e calm slash hubermennt and now for my discussion with eat portal do thank you for coming here today have been looking for to sitting down with you to talk for a very long time i was first exposed to your work my post or a podcast i believe of that a group of people walking down handrails literally the hails along stairwells and as a an once a former escape order once escape order always escape order was escape order a handrails have a particular meaning but i was really struck by first of all a the incredible range of skill that people had and yet they are willingness to do this right i think of nails are walking on handrails or escape ward in harass as f potential hazard and yet some of the incredible proficiency that some of the people there including yourself had many people i was drawn to your practicing your work initially through a a wide eyed wow the other doing some incredible stuff on natural objects much escape orders or parquorer folks do but over the years we have been in communication and have come to realize that your a true intellectual of the topic of movement and i define an intellectual as somebody who can understand a topic and multiple levels of granularity detail general specific connections et camera to start off could you share with us your conception of this idea of movement you obviously movement involves translation through space but when you talk about a movement practice what are you really thinking about what what are we talking about when we talk about a movement practice i be question h i i somehow left the the the phonetician the very tied the phonetician of it out for myself because i felt it was starting constrict me and be around me and i let the practice itself freely define it m but i think impart of our sense of everything is textually a sense of movement and than the stillness into bekrondo get for me this is the entity the i refer to as movement and using that perspective course elf evolution development of course the physical side but also movement of emotions movement of thoughts am and any other movement streams and by switching these layers and examining it from different places you get a better and better sense of it i think the visuals now they and media are what defines for people in the beginning thinks and then little by little whose experience they can dive deeper which is good there is some aspects sexy aspects e or not sexy aspects and then you pulpit and you start examine and dive deeper in then you receive the gift o get finding outscore i heard you say once that we are not just a brain with a body but we are a body with a brain which i absolutely love because as a student and a researcher of the nervous system i never think about the brain as its own isolated thing i think but the nervous system in the fact that the brain and the spinal quarter connected to the body in the body is connected is ut to the brain in every direction its everything truly is connected at the physical level physiological level cut you just share fora moment how you think about this body brain relationship in terms of you mentioned movement of e motions movement of the body that you cannot really separate the two and for the tobago person who is listening this they might not immediately understand what what that means maybe it is something that has to be experience but when we think about the body an the brain and the the whole thing working as one cohesive whole what what does that mean to you it were put simply when you do a movement practise what are you focussing on are you focussing on the movement of your limbs i have to imagine that is true but are you also focussing to how that makes you feel or how your feelings make you move em o case of some thoughts am i will try not to answer any of your questions during these interest but will definitely give give some thoughts and then we can play with it m i think these the phoneticians and in general the limitation of words and up e creating some kind of it corruptive process a words corrupt us and corrupt are understanding i think the brain body these artesian the state of mind and thinking brought a lot of good but also brought a lot of problems and movement for me is the entity that ties everything together its the magic is the foulsani minds it is when the coin spend and you see both sides appear at the same time is an beautiful apology for ma a friend of mind an octorasmosom am the mind and body are one of those pairs and i call it the movement body mind system its when it is integrated eats in motion there is also stillness that appears there of course without it there can be no motion but em ma maybe that is a very good way to start to think of things there is no really pure mental processes cognitive processes there is no our physical processes everything touches everything there is a wholeness and that oneness is in motion am yet the movement practice takes the beats and examine them an here is a pragmatic thing the the scientist the cerebral thinking about movement this is important the emotional side coloring feeling the colors and the textures of motion a lot of people who are involved with a movement practice never and up feeling motions really focussing on how it makes you feel or how it feels itself and then the actual movement the action action and motion and thought and those are three streams of movement and the interlace together into this kind of a braided experience and whole experience and i try to bring all these aspects into my my practice in the way that i leave my life think most people we embark on a movement practice will first want to know which movements to do right squats planks a push ups on poets right a picture movement tit could be any moment are there any sort of just basic entry points that you believe everybody should walk through as they embrace a me in practice the first time and may even every time they you move in practice in earlier to day a the great a privilege of being guided through a long series of moving practices and yet the first practice we did involved at first any way stillness not movement if if you were could you inform us you how people should think about approaching a movement practice what is the first layer of any good movement practise you touch the word movements and it is important to for me to separate it from the world movement with a capital am movements are the containers and movement is the content and the content cannot be carried in any way without containers the first entry point is to choose containers and then the second thing to make surest to put specific content into those containers and then enjoy them i tell people that it is a cup of water and your being handed that cup of water in now they'd very often people will start to chew on the cup instead of drinking the water making it yours discard the cup and then may be later you want to have bone broth or sup use a different container a bowl a movement practice to start can start from anywhere it is arise on it is it is an open system it has no center its thescentralize and it can be approachfom anywhere and the that is its magic and that is that is the benefit of it somepeople e find the body a good entry point some people do not even enter from the body am sometimes you can enter from other perspectives and then inside the body for example where should we enter if we decided to take the body approach the spine can be a nice decision but some will choose just the pelvic any one of those points are valid and then playfulness can be an entry point and attribute or and this is open i i do not want to limit e people and limit their minds in the way that the engage with a practice but i also want to in courage the self inquiry am i doing movements practice when i doing a movement practice can you help me distinguish the to a little further i think i understand the difference between a h sort of the now verses the verbs and in some ways i here we are dealing with the challenge of that the barriers that language present to something that is physical right i mean indeed there may not be a a to assume there is no perfect verbal language for movement there are certain movements that the i language i could say somebody jumped at a particular trajectory at a particular speed and move this limb in that let but by fractionating it something is most definitely lost an if someone wanted to that's i get in better touch with their body in cuts in order to explore the infinite space that his movement how might they begin to approach that is it does it begin with an awareness with practice or both it begins with education that is probably the most stable point of entry and awareness to some something as a concept that it is a concept that there is a validity or because sometimes people look for that and to looking at this entity is open entity and that that is part of the reason why answering questions is i not something i can do or even attempt to do i believe in the power of the incomplete process making this me this a table but leaving something undone not perfecting the product why because it offers some kind of a dynamic nature of evolution that naturally unravels from it almost sometimes i do it i count reps and it'll only come to nine because intends to leave people in the count and it keeps going instead of giving them the ten everyone wants and often yet which is because of the pessimal sister's it all kinds of the things that is also important with the movement idea is to discuss to examined to look to taste to try but then also not to try to capture because if you the invisible loup of hostage if you look at it too closely is gone but if you look away it functions and exist just us very powerfully and obviously gives us the experiences that we have when people enter movement practice it is about education bringing some awareness to de felt that they are leaving in a body that they are leaving in motion that their mind is a type of movement that their life is a type of movement bringing attention to the movement of the emotions as well bringing just attention to the fact that things are in motion the ththeyou rely to say pancake all in flu nothing stops besides something that he's the background of it and and allows it to express and this is the beauty of things and this for me is the movement practice is is this examination and bringing this awerenessing to things as we sit now here ism also aware of my body m ism also aware of the way that things make me feel the way that your face is communicating to me and and ism not just in some limited m and and very verbal overly verbal state because it meet us a lot of the beautiful fluke ism going to inject some am porprojects some ideas and i perhaps you would tell me if there ridiculous ism potentially useful or useful ism as i understand what we are talking about now and were discussed earlier is that movement canal should be incorporated into one's entire life even heard you say that even before getting out of bed in the morning one can experience movement and it does not us early have to be of the intimate kind with somebody else its it can be paying attention to the rhythm of one's breath or how you get out of the bed or ism actually an anticipation of you arriving here to day i notice that as i was going up and down the stairs in this and this house ism that i was injecting a little bit of playfulness in the way that i might have many many decades ago by have not for a very long time and i asked myself whether not that is what e do is referring to when he talks about threadinghiss body awareness throughout the day as oppose to but of course not exclusive from just saying i have forty five minutes ism going to do movement practice before i shower and have some dinner right have to imagine both are helpful but in terms of moving through the day and having bodily awareness clearly there an infinite number of ways one could do that the we e share of you you mention am we wont a pay mention their breath to pay mention the posture and the notion of play is a very attractive as we say in si its its a sticky concept a concept that can give draw us one in ma if you were to to you sure it us just some ideas you get people thinking about a may been a incorporating moving practice into their day and maybeven a touch on the the potential roll of play or playfulness up am yet those those are some good directions i think one thing is this what you call worthlessness i hive been recommending to people non verbal experiences and the awareness of the body which is not really the witness of the body as not purely or not fully the awareness of motion is very i good way to start to bring a soreness to that layer and the clay will start to get clarified more and more and more the more you practise and then it will enable for most people a safe heaven away from many states and difficulties and will unlock a lot of potential attributes and strengthen freshness and a lot of beautiful things really one of the pretty perspectives about who we are comes e from person who influenced my thinking alatmonchefelden cries the late monchefelton cries and he talks about the body as the core three elements the for nervous system too is the mechanical system of muscle skeleton et camera and the third is the environment which is a unique way to look at it and it talks about how the nervous system is both get receiving information from the outside n from the inside and in the first years of life you work a lot on the frentiating though what what is me and what is not me and i think movement when you feel movement you feel the movement of the outside that is of course arriving to you and receiving this and also your own internal movement and the same can be said for stillness bringing the attention into those layers it is a treaty thing it is one of those elusive things to look at but it is definitely of huge benefit to start to train it start to practise it to feel not our thoughts not necessarily our body but to start to recognize the dynamic nature the flux the motion and it occurs in all the layers you can you can you will need to find it in morale occasions before you start to more and more m make it your own make it really yours and how for example and simple pragmatic things i used to do this i spend some time in home tongue would need to get my practicing but i am really turned off from commercial gems and there is not a lot of nature accessible there would just strap on my bag and i would walk the streets of hong long which are very crowded and i would try to avoid touching anyone and it would be two hours of of just involved fully involved fully in my body and experiencing beautiful things and enjoy and developing myself as well in all kinds of scenarios up and down and in the escalators and off this is an example of a a way to to practice and then the way that we are sitting thischairs for example our chairs are not very dynamic but there is rocking chairs right and this is something i recommend for a lot of kids and in schools i used to rock on the chair which is very common i sure iscapeord underneath my chair row back and forth an the teacher would tell me to stop and slow my a little thou try to get the mort solemnly than i could without it you then tell me they recon take it away pul try which is probably horrible horrible advice and instruction and just sit up straight and chop with your mouth closed because they remove a lot of the self education and a lot of the self development and the practicalman discoveries that are necessary and even will de age access and thinking processes in sin some ways am i out for example i would make the chairs even more by and the i would support more motion and then i would be able to bring attention the but i would also be able to bring attention away from it into other things and it keeps refreshing me i do not become stale the water does not stand this is the beauty of o movement you can focus for long periods of time and doing credible things with the mind with focus without earnest attention am and its wit skin in the game ism not talking as some meditator and is describing the act of being very access but then i put a stick on the edge of his fingers and i tell in balance it he every one can do it for ten seconds and i tell a mom i now hold a ten minutes and you see that the skill has he has no skin in the game it was not developed in varies and various but there is a delusion that start to develop am and and that is that is how movement keeps me very honest and humble in the way that i view humility and and in a way that protects me an and and keeps me yer keeps me fresh i love the example of moving through the crowded tree with e back pack because of the way in which its complexly adapted to the situation you happen to be in ten highlights the fact that one does not need a gem or any specific scenario i although we will at certainly touch on ideal learning circumstances for movement and some of a the wore tho you are doing of course the less of your own personal practice and understanding and knowledge you have done the more toys unit the more you have really worked on yourself the more high tack you are the more low neck are your tools the more hightail you are and this is the most advanced acknowledge by far on this planet is all the advancement its does not even start to scratching it from the way that we understand the eyes all the way to with all to respect to the boson robotics a five year old move motion movements a or animal motion was very under developed as still relatively to us as systems important to to remind ourselves a what can be done with the body and gravity a lore a piece of floor apiece of wall a corner of a room is the beautiful senary which you can become discover in and play in and but we are not developed we do not see those options and this is something that i try to stimulate and that is why i made at a point to avoid any of the big concern sheep and and and high take tools and i one point brought a stick into big conventions and and or i sometimes i use a shirt with holds in it an that just a useshirt as a point to make when ism addressing a crowd to keep things were were it is important and it is important we are important and our experiences important and we we have to be very careful this this e habits and this directions they come from many times good intention but they are heth devil many times they turning the devil just our acknowledge in ow days and what is happening with people with depression with meaning meaninglessness an also with the body in various perspectives or even i will also flip it into high performance sports and that their prize because for me this is not ha movement practice it erases the person in the center of it and then cane places skate boarding ere break dancing were somebody with the disability becomes the best in the world turns it into the biggest advantage but you would never be accepted into gymnastics less and i loved tat and and that the change to place change in the center it it is important just show a mention of a few sports am maybe with charges poloquin or maybe as another trainer that i i heard once say that for kids one of the worst things they can do as over specialize in a particular sport am the idea being that it leads to improvements in performance in a very narrow domain but they raised the idea that it could perhaps also constrains the development of the nervous system such that certain emotional state surgeon certain a intellectual abilities will for ever be shut off because of the intense plasticity that occurs early in life the more i learned from you the more ism thinking that that statement really should be extended to all of life and i loved to remind people a because i start off as a development on er about us that development does not start an end you do not have childhood and adulthood our life is one long development a ark from birth until death however long that might be if one is going to be anti specialist maybe even recall that a generalist what does that look one of the different domains of movement practice and as i asked this i realize i i in serious danger of fractionating movement into a list of words strength and speed and explosiveness and a suppleness a word that have heard you used before and yet i think for most people because we thinking words often am some of those categories can be useful let say i was going embark on a movement practice or a child was going to embark on a movement practice it either throughout the day or for a dedicated period of time what are the sorts of categories of movement that i might wont to think about holistic movement smooth movement maybe you could a just en rich us with some of the a some of the landscape around the first headdress the first part and that you mentioned and it have learned from you about certain changes in the way that things developed catering life versus earlier in life and you rite is o something that chospolicuin also mention than i learned from backing the day as well from him and which can seem dark a been an and kind of hopeless a but then you you should go beyond that am one thing that does seem to to to a peer for me when i look around its these the conseptof unique postures an and i think this is true for postures of thought emotional postures and movement postures truly earlier in life we are creating these unique postures and they get into these drawers or a language letters later in life the process moves more towards integration of this unique postures into all different organizations the beauty of it is that you can use very few postures to create many possibilities just a libelist a search for a language that contain one simple only verses too which he discovered am and this is something that is often seem it takes some one who moves in a certain way and you teach him all this new sports or techniques but essentially if you look deeply and your sensitive seems the same postures that he will have to work with till the end of his life the same thinking postures and this this is really problematic where we are we are not freeing the mind beyond this say how would i say a careful thing of thinking and we are actually letting go of the content we were get more and more forest on the the way the the way of thinking verses the thinking itself or or habitual ways and forms of thinking associated thinking etcetera and emotionally the same we are constructing this emotional postures and then we have to go through the rest of our lives working is that this is the dark size and but of course they re always possibilities am both i think invading this early system to some extent even if it is five per cent or seven per cent to whatever per cent and also on the freeing yourself of going beyond all postures period working with the postures you have but to words the posture less way of doing things this is something interesting and to work when when people work with movements but finally are able to go into movement and this magic starts to happen and then the technique fall apart and something appears am and and it is face change it is it is a transformation it is note it is it is a binary moment there is a jump there for sure an it is very rare to see both in thinking and a emotionally and and otherways we have many names for bitten sometalk about enlighten and some talk about all kind of processes related to it and i think most of them a shadows of the sun but it is not the sun itself re and then talking about ways of thinking about movement this is where i use an something i i call my sliced dices because of the problem o using words and the phoneticians and categories i try to create a lot of them and i write hem one on the paper and then i crumble them throw them into the been and i keep doing it all my life the writing them down and the picking on it is very important also very important to let it go i tell people what you for got is not the same for forgetting is not the same as never knowing it the crumbling and throwing always a form of forgetting but it leave some kind of a home pathic i trace behind let us take some slice and ice and to to look at it here is a physical one contraction relaxation that is a spent rum and pretty much everything falls on this spectrum also in terms of analyzing a person or yourself you can tell me if you feel closer to thisside or closer to that side and then it allows you to examine your practices how many of the practices are moving you towards balance and how many are it is your edition of just doing what your good at verses what you need and here is another example physical culture we have the dense real working with internal concepts and expressing them obstruct concepts expression second perspective the marshal consent not in the sense of just fighting but also partnering working with another person a dynamic fantasy that is communicating with you the third one is i call the elements working with the environment the next one is a somatic one is the internal practice and of course they are all grays owns and and another one is object manipulatory which you can think of it also as the environment but it is more small objects heavy objects many objects few objects and then you can look at these way of thinking and you can oh have many of my practices in this direction but not and you can draw it for yourself that is another perspective an this way i i use dozens of perspectives and with the years it gives people a sense of were they one a go how they want to do it and what they need to address verses what they to dress its it is it helpful very helpful those different bens are very helpful i really appreciate that you mention that people we often practice what their good ad as suppose to what they need in none him culture i refer to this as the that always gets they person it an big upper bodies in legs or as you will see people to have this enormous the courses and their bench pressing all day but they clearly need to pull on an object every ones in a while to create some balance but they do not do it because they for whatever reason they have an obsession with moving greater and greater poundage or something that i which in certain sports power lifting worst that is are not the the goal and it is simply to push more weight off ones just that you could imagine that there something beneficial there however i think that it is really important in intellectual endeavors and in movement endeavors i understand correctly to bring oneself to a place of real challenge on a regular basis fact earlier to day i was in a state of constant challenge cause it was all new to me and as much as i told myself beginners mine beginners mine beginners mine it it is horrid i confess do not want to do well to perform well right and and i think think that is a natural and healthy thing ow the only natural it is necessary but i want you to keep it on that side and to bring something to balance it if there is not thischallenge the process will not work it has to be descale and your talking about scales of fain pleasure and this is another scale and this discomfort again is necessary and should be recognized as i mean the right place when it becomes too high and ism unable to resolve to make any progress i went overboard but when it is not present i do not do nothing here nothing that ism truly interested in ism just gratifying myself wanker is in essence it is not about searching for the discomfort but it is a marker am and i think the question should be who ere my serving case people do not serve themselves in essence they serve part parts of it some some kind of affection of themselves and this separation of oneself from oneself and this is also a result of the practice a good practice an i think it may be the biggest gift i received from the practice is i i am i can say although it will taken may be a certain context ism not my friend at times i am but many times ism not my friend and by creating the separation i can assume a certain stability in the face of everything all the way up to our own mortality and the which is and may be beyond who knows it was i a striking moment for me earlier to day when i was really challenged with one of the a practices we were doing and you said this is exactly the what i experience this morning enter that is what you said an i could not imagine theyouere having challenges doing the what i was attempting to and of course you were what i believe what you were referring to is that you had put yourself at that edge earlier in the day in which you were making failures you were you were failing to execute the way that you were attempting to execute movement i u just at to inject some near science and neuroplasticity there i cannot help myself is what i do after all there are beautiful data in animals and human showing that in the seconds and minutes after a failed attempt at a motor execution of something the forebrain is in a heightened state of focus and when you hear it suddenly makes perfect sense of course why would the nervous system change unless it got a cue to change and the cue almost always comes in the form of frustration that the a were as we said earlier inch then an as signal is the one that traps you to extract more learning from the subsequent trials and yet for a lot of people they feel that o that failure to execute or even to approximate execution and they feel an experience that a negative signal and they lean out of the practise they start to depart either mentally or physically or both and if there is anything i thing that am perhaps i we can offer s this understanding that that edge is some people call tor that failures aren't just necessary they are part of the learning process they are the entry gate to negro plasticity yes contextualizing or recontextralizing that sensation is something i work lot with an just reminded people an u o reminded to myself and if it was not difficult and we did not need to redo it again and again we would not be again on this correct scale which is dynamic and moving just rolling down hill there is a there is definitely a necessity to succeed to orient there e certain aspects that you want to achieve but then there is also the letting go of it and an the deambitioning of it and the and within that tension the plan demon is comes movement and that that is how the and again if i stretch it to far away or if i increase one of them to my then i would have some issues but you will with practice learn to recognize the optima point of progression of course it said it takes many years and a lot of play and exposure to get a sense of it regardless of the layer in which it is applied ism sure in your field and in your pursuits you are already aware of it and applying it in your life talking about focus talking about ways of thinking creativity et camera but the n it is enough that i i pulling to another perspective and you will see that people are specialists and and then they do not have the really the the real essence of the of the concept it is not theirs it is applied specifically the one who changes all that time get's the general component because what appears when everything changes that is that new entity everything changes something stays that is what we want to get the contestant is understanding have heard the statement before we are just a meat vehicle i were just a sacacells and it is am and i i truly despise that statement because first of all it am it deprives us of all meaning n of our lives and we can go down the rout of philosophy as to whether or not there is meaning or not but more importantly it divorces us from the idea that the body and brain are intake connected and have at least equal value at any one moment that they are informing each other emotions an for movement movement in forms emotions one thing that have heard you say before e really of to hear you embellished is has his important principle that human beings are truly unique in terms of the enormous range of movements that we can perform and yet we are excellent may be superior to all other species at certain types of movement the one that comes to mine is walking strides striding am may we you just explore that that idea because obviously a she dos very fast the gibbon seems to have a lot of proficiency grabbing and swinging from branches but human beings perform an enormous were can potentially perform an enormous array of movements do you think all human beings are potentially able to explore all the different types of movement i and if how does one approach that basically what ism doing is ism tabling a concept which is not range of motion right for that for the gimerats discard with range of motion ism talking about the variety of movements at first the it is nothimportant to what i think if it is possible or not possible or if it is even possible for you or not possible for you what is important is what you truly one to what you truly are after an it is important for me because many times this way of thinking about things is already limited i the to say a man does not go to the ocean to empty with a spoon a lot of the types of dressing up of the concepts nowadays its trying to feet and elephant into the holding the needle for example the concept of practice and than our lives as if we have a life we have some kind of stream of behaviors we have ad there is a argument of free will et camera there is a multiplicity definitely a man is legion that is the the real meaning of that phrase one dame wake up this i i say antre lets me to morrow at seven an but i don't know who going awake up to morrow and then you send me a tacks message am feeling off right at six fifty five and go back to sleep examining that and seeing that i think free you up eventually and and start to orient you in in a better direction a what you want to do and what but in the rotation of also what you need to do what you sense and and what you are developing as a e for evolutionary direction for you this is the important bit is it possible for everyone to engage in certain specific physical movement for example ins candinavian countries the squat is not very approachable it is a it is very difficult they are more built for dragging have things and also in this climate i guess it it makes lessens to squat and cosegonafreis there this is an and u than you see the squatting in warm climates and it is open and accessible they're very good the deadlifters usually not good squatters and the shagged away from the ground ye the shallow heap socket and which allows one activity but then the stability wit the deep keeps of a architecture of of of the heap and the fever heads the my whenglls the shapes et camera we are all unique and their certain elements which for example my squatchellengeis for most people there is something there vat you rely people what the squat challenges er the squat was my attempt to bring a new fresh state of mind in to the word squat cannot as a strength element not but it is a fundamental resting position really actually should be one of the most abundant ones we replaced it with a sitting which is not really does not work well if you're in a natural environment it is not very comfortable actually to sit for long pierces of time rocks and different arraigns found up lying down standing and squatting a lot also when your moving low and dynamic even collecting berries the squat is much more dynamic an open and then elimination is happening there was it is such a fundamental thing and we totally eliminated it we eliminated many other things overhead movements behind the back and all kinds of beck real and what i call the back real and is totally absent in in people's awareness that was my attempt to bring it back into people and i recommend i recommended to in order to to really get that transformation going to accumulate and thirty minutes a day in the squat position unloaded just resting down not correct not erect many people make this mistake the did not read through the whole thing is just resting down there and of course you have to be mindful of dosages some people will get hurt if they try to doit too quickly they might see the build up process towards it and also ism not talking about thirty minutes straight and but accumulation throughout the day and this does a lot of good for the festive problems for lower back pain for heap pains for need and generally for aging because it is basically folding your body in the most basic way are you folding your by if you are not fold in your body you will lose the roadability of your body and this is probably the the to the easiest and the most abundant way to fall the body er but the this is an example of something that can be very useful with many many people but there will always be unique individuals which needs something else and there tether their benefits in examining things and also their benefits in getting hurt i is not often discussed especially not in this part imam one of the only ones i as teacher that says i injured many of my students in if i did not do that i would be totally useless for them is well that totally safe system is has nothing to offer practically nothing is totally safe and we can of course we do not approach it with he balmy or atheistic thing but we are aware that sometimes we have to go beyond the boundaries and hopefully those would be the small injuries that will help us avoid the big injuries but if you try to avoid the small injuries may be get those big injuries in there a examining which types and forms of movement the location of the the body and speed of execution the type of organization of the body which is a whole thing that we can discuss and all of this is a up for the grabs and i something that we have to great individual relationship with hopefully with good guidance where we can get the rights sad various a facilitator of good scenarios for our learning which is what i try to do and less of ta technical state of mind do this a b c or ye are chucking what i really dislike from for long times many people they tell me have you met this guy is an amazing t teacher because i e chunk the process into these beats a not even in the correct places of chuckles an a dozen offer fetlocks us the say the state of mind i i take about the chemistry molt of mi called it my chemistry won e way an tom an molecule and then a compound is conceptualize verses just chucking there is an actual evolution i cult it also sketch learning ism not going to try to draw you if i know anything about art and enthralling ism going to start by capturing something very rough and i need to practice that first that dineric and the the before i going the rendering and the shading et camera and the same way to learn things big picture to small details and unlike many of my teachers in the dirantan i say an was the greatest respect because i do not know who thought me more my goo teachers on my worst teachers and but some of them just teach from the small details into a big picture that never arrives given the humans can generate such a broad array of types of movement run jump duck squat leap it all these types of movements and do you think there is value in observing the movements of other animal species i know i certainly enjoy watching other animals move i think the most one of the more spectacular animal facts that i was shared with me as when i was a graduate student some one down the hall was working on the little pedals of the comedian as it which can walk up walls and it was a great mysteries whether not they reduction but turns out they can do it in a vacuum it is not suction whether not there was some sticky substance and it turned out i feel compelled to share this with the seven to do it is i have a feeling it will lead us to in to an inside of some sort that those little tiny petals are thin and close together that the the camellia actually sticks to the wall by what are called vandervall forces meaning it is a very weak molecular force but strong enough to stick to the wall because they are actually exchanging molecules with the surface thereon obviously we cannot do that and yet i spend hours because they were in late next wort watching videos of these little comedians walk and the articulation of these feet is incredible because they are literally rolling those little petals along in a way that go defies anything else have ever seen i told myself this was useful that because i thought it was interesting but be because never really thought about how i articulate my foot have thought about being a heel striker or a to driver when i run and no one can tell me which one ism spoke to be a you can loan tell me bat the point is or sup was the question is do you think there is value in observing the extremes of animal kingdom movement as a way to inform the place space an the expel ration space of our own human movement practice i think i think it is first it is inspiring its am it opens up but i will take it away from the romantic point of view and i would offer another way to examine all this movements exists in us in ways in certain ways the work of a grokovettski on the spine the spinal engine and to see how this all ways of moving even all the way up to ex skeletons and primary very ancient or even single cell things are still within us to a certain extent and then of course this gets developed and an the the the darwinian state of mind and got stuck for many years on the survival of the fittest but actually i believe i always believe the nice i saw some information about at lately that mutation is the heart of of the model not survival of the fits the a people often hear the reputation and they think mutations are bad there are mawadabdmutations and then there are thabdimutations for sure and it displaces the word change in the heart of it what it wants to do change it does not want to become better there is an inherent change in it and then of course that become better at excise at fittest is the secondary perspective that drives in relation to certain things but there is still a stronger more ancient driving force into the process for me this is cool to see these animals take it all the way to this extreme but it is also still reflecting within us i lave to do eforexemple introduce wish people's spinal waves and by bringing these waves into the body sometimes you get e weird experiences emotional releases and sometimes another times it can become an incredible tool to help an athlete which specialized and reach the top of the top and then you defray his system a little bit and offer him some freshness and and some segmental movement and first you fuck him up that is usually the case d technically his off is ordinations offset later the growth will arrive it is a form of playfulness it is a form of examining things regardless of their success or failure that more understanding the change is important and then after that we can also look at the more competitive state of mind and the more success and failure orientation and but there is no game without change this is the primary one and that is why i say what can you want a succeed in the tests we did earlier but you stain within the game to sustain the game the infinite verses finite game i prospecting to sustain the game means to continue to change continue to transform and then to win team sometimes mean game over m smile within that tension i think it is beautiful to play and to exist and to be you mention something that for mes and incredibly important concept a for a couple of reasons and mention spinal waves and i have to assume that taking that the torso for us movement more on than i all is referred to in course terms than a thins thattherasthis and sir living i will stay away from the technical anatomy and the torso and creating movement either side decide undo undulation or arching and extension of the spine the dorsal ventral outside to side rotational as was spiralling the is is have you ever had the experience that of yourself for other people engaging those types of movements and experiencing particular categories of emotions and i have a particular reason for asking this here is no righto on answer of course but ism just curious whether or not movement of the that is call it the corpse of the body things close to the sideline as suppose to far away from the midline the digest for is there any on you have any evidence that that can evoke a certain a category of emotional states evidence i have none but the have experience and i have some thoughts about it etherize this known created nothing or structural integrations said the issues are in the tissues and around the spine the spine is us as you knows can take an arm off aim but there is there there is been attempts but there is no brainy alone the cerebral thing alone that the spine and the may be more parts of and systems inside the tors or important that is why i to start from that for entity and then these little fluctuations the create er they unblocks things that they start to move things and you can avoid funny enough mobilizing those areas by doing big frame motions and competitive motions and technique all your life even somewhat most yogis for example they look extremely to if but then when you are actually going into the small what what i call the small frame i borrow dis from chines martial arts small frame big frame the big frame is the big changes of our total body in space posture and then the small frame is barely moving but mobilize in the little bits that comprise the same pretty much postures these are very beneficial and it has totally disappeared from our physical culture when you introduce it back am the small frame offers the big frame but the big frame does not offer the small frame because of course the small detail come together into the big picture if i one a place my body in specific position and i have all this bits moving well i can constructed in whatever way i want but if i just work on the big one more most chances are i just mobilize certain areas while other areas are totally held or blocked and then i specialized one more time take me out of this realm and it'll have difficulties what will sit there in stagnation and motion material founts trismus that is why people get discharges am the body memory is not what we think it is that is how i believe it is tired in a lot everywhere am and have had those experiences allot of people have the opposite when a certain a motion is evoked they start to undulate the spine this can be worked from this direction from this direction and i believe by a plying such a practice it is while it you you basically turn over the land and you are allowing things to to shift and to move in to adept i highly recommend and we teach it in a very elaborate and gradual way and and and this is needed really because people when they just going some general recommendation they usually just get stuck into a new water a that is spinal way oke that is it have been using again the slighsand ice teaching dozens of systems of moving the torso and till a person is freed to really move the torso the language is created the the the small enough units are created in your understanding from all these systems and then you improvise you reach the highest level of the practice of the answer i emit i tell you a bit of why i asked m there is a principle and in now in your science but especially in narrow evolution they called evil ego sometimes evolution and development how to long if you look it we have modernerons as but for the audience that o live in our spinal sort that cause transmission and contraction of the muscles last over lies and then we have modernerons up here called up er modern's the control the modern lower ones one something as reflects for learned we were not thinking about it as we we mainly use the lower modern's we know that because you can do an experiment it is a rather barbaric experiment but it is been done many times a creating at the cerebral cat you have would remove the new quarters and these cats will walk on a treadmill called fictive motion no problem at all there are human beings who do not have a no quarter or much of their neocartics is missing they generate perfectly fine moving stern has been dolled that is right and it is truly down loaded into the into the spine and the connection between the spider muscles now the motornerons that control the spinal waves as you call them are of a particular category they have a molecular signature of physiological signature they were identified by he is dead now but a and it a biologistict colombia universe seeming tom gest and many of the scientific offspring here is what is interesting in fish or in animals that really only have the opportunity to undulate and flap their little a fins thou motorcar on that control undulation in those animals are identical molecular to the motorcar on the control the spinal undulation in humans what is been added in human evolution are extra rows literally categories of molecular distinct our on that as you move from the center of the body outward unlike a fish which can move its fins but cannot actually art does not have digits we have special motornerons to move these little bits these bits these bits and i cannot do a spinal wave but but i can do that mama's thing the the belly thing that comes from moving the move e t when i was a kid and out my stomach and realizing that i could wave it but only in one direction occarently not up anyway i that the bogies out there can chuckle at that but i the orgies eat d with the side oh do that yet know if i can do that anyway my spinal wave is weak but i it'll work on it but what i find interesting about these layers of i do not wan ta say sophistication but these with evolution came the addition of morn pools of opportunity these motorcar on pools as they are called heir opportunity to engage in new more elaborate types of movement but with each new pool became the opportunity to create combinations of new movement and the reason i asked you why spinal waves create one category of movement is that if you touch a fish on one side of its body it moves to the opposite side it never moves toward it but early are we were doing a practice somewhat similar of testing this similar reflex and sometimes i or some will move toward a touch we do not deviate to the opposite side i have this am untested at least formally tested hypothesis that movements of small digits and portions of or distal as they are called far from the middlemen body parts evoke different sensations may been far more subtle sensations than movements of the core of our body and and the the stuff closer to the spine again it is just a a theory but in grateful for your answer because at lands at least in the general vector direction of of my of my idea here the central orientation is mostly gone from our culture we do not even walk basically these days if you look at traditional culture the amount of walking you do on a estray its saurian we started to crate technologies to bring everything into the periphery controlling it with the finger keeps et camera we have incredible neurological development relating to this but our central patterns swimming running jumping throwing throwing is not pushing away that is an example right some people when you give them ball through the you can tell if they have never thrown away the taro roles that is often as sat here in the best and stats of course unfairbudy to it it relates to experience right that is less in let may be promoted or offered for females you get this this ben peripheral pattern instead of a central generated pattern the progress is towards the extremities am one thing i wanted to to ascus i know an an area that is not often mentioned is that some of these ancient patterns and systems our primary in many ways hence those newer developments inside of us or constraint by using the connections running through these ancient systems hence we are much more limited by the gipon we are each hikers on a piece of deny to say and and that gimp is is driving something primary that even when you are in kind of the driver seat in your eyes your equally not or your beingtotally constraint by that am and i want to hear about this ya the recently we had a guess on the precast i iercharvis is a professor a rock feller who is am offered a position to dance with the alvanaily dance company an accomplish dancer and and comes from me musical family chose to become a nor scientists instead and study speech of language but he said something incredible several incredible things that really looking for to getting your reflections on first of all he said that when you look at the species in the kingdom of animals including us that have e elaborate language and true song they all also have the capacity to dance all the i turns out humming birds i shall have a dance and a song capacity that perhaps this is the going idea now in your science and evolution of the brain that singing actually came before finally articulated speech and language that voice involved first to sing to communicate i mean to enunciate h i m but then song may it may have come first where you have song you have dance in the capacity to dance which of course is movement of the body and where you have song end dance you always find that those species can generate elaborate language now the simple version of this is case sophisticated brains tend to create clusters of sophisticated capabilities but the other possibility and it is the one that parvis proposes and i think it is in line with what your perhaps raising here is the idea that movement of the body and range an sophistication of movement of the body through all these different systems may have actually promoted or even driven the evolution of the things that we think of as speech and language in the ability to have multiple a words for the same concept or to have elaborate articulation of speech i find this incredibly attractive as an idea because certainly from as a hierchey of needs we needed to move first to survive into made and to flee into attack it makes perfect sense to me that the layers would be built up fundamentally from the body to the mind and not the other way around that is one piece and then the other piece which it'll jut share of for any reflections you might have that i just bloom away was parvis told me that when we read if and this has been done experimentally if one records the e m g the low level muscular activity in the laringsonfarings we are actually repeating the words that we read but subtly that we do not actually speak them out unless there some sort of neurologic deficit which some people have some will mumble why they read but what that tells me is it that language is movement and movement is language again we have this convergence but at a very basic love id love your reflections on those are all his ideas i want say am just repeating what what he said and not nearly as precisely as he did but how do you think of movement as either the foundation of language or as its own language that perhaps even defies words ow those are beautiful prospective and definitely feel feel the same there is a lot to say about singing and then being as well as also as a form of fair ancient programmed of translation sometimes my that there is design some ancient practices them did e contras and they people do not realize that they are tantric practices they contain a form of vibrating and breathing all tight together into very elaborate way to promote a certain effect and how would you do something this in ancient times this is ingenious i even until to day we need a full book to describe something a l it wouldest work as well it is a very ancient form of transition the more accurate we became with the language the more tad it became because it is it is less of a movement entity t is less of a dynamicantity from its nature that is why you cure meshing us as its corrupt it corrupts us am definitely definitely the the the conducing for s or that the primary force for me is movement that is experienced every time we we talk about movement basically even now we are spilling it into a container to call it what it is but it is beyond that than it is applied into dancing into singing into language there is no other language that i see as a primary mode and this is an nature of space time things moving i think i think everything moves into the direction of understanding that more and more and the maybe it is not popular to call it movement people have some connotations and it is o a can throw away this word and put another word and we probably need to do that also regularly i have start to see the end of this word for me and things get corrupted again overuse the bused and then we need there need anew anew word and and that is even that word is only needed for communication and for specific processes of education exchange it is important to stay within the experiences it is important to continue to promotes and areas in which the experience is primary more open experience lets say and not try to hold down and and the fine and overlyaccurately or if it is done throwing it away and starting again there is no winning concept you got to the winning concept you got nothing you you were able to gradin you were able to this very science right we got it we got it and than it turns out to be nothing and la more more time passes i feel science is becoming more humble and things are being disgusting and in in this way and the because really what the science do reported the son came up certain amount of obedience of times and then to morrow it will come up gas study sticks that is good prediction ye but we we can go beyond the something in site of us that can go beyond hard to communicate i cannot alter it right now here but i have the e experience and thankfully i have a practice and a was to sens til feel and to re examine it and then we can talk about it and have something from that and at toward willow the great social biologist yet ye founded the field of sociobiology to nelson that call him toward willow ism had this beautiful word and indeed named a book i see the word was better than the book sorry willow but the book was a little bit meandering for my taste but then again he is the hazard professor not me i the stamford's pretty pretietarm good the a this word is concilients this idea of a leaping together of divergent forms of knowledge to create a truly valuable concept which i love i love it because of course ism formerly trains is a scientist i look at things mainly through the lends of not science but experience is real and observation is real and even in the field of medicine you have you a double blindplessy book controlled clinical trials and then you have caste studies and of what right not often discussed right having h m the most famous example in narrow science of a patient that had no hippocampus informed us more about the process of memory and indeed the function of the hippocampus then thousands of independent experiments that followed you cannot have one you need all these different forms of exploration which is i think i i think we share the belief if i may that convergent forms of knowledge eventually this process of concelients can eject a new concept and yet the challenge again is that if we do not have a language for it it becomes hard to transmit one of the things that i findincredibly it'll use this word again sticky is this notion of movement culture i do not know who coin that phrase or i seen it in the circles and accounts around your a inter gram account in others i do not know if i that is a a phrase that you coin but this idea of engaging in movement practice with others whether not it is dance or other movement practices ism because it is dynamic is the unpredictability of it ism even to to day two practitioners at vastly different levels of knowledge and experience in movement practice there is there is information i to think to be gained from both sides si a one thing that have heard you say before which really resonate with me as this idea that people ha maybe prettiline you as have this concept of i have my yoga friends or my o the vibe i dance with our distinct from my family friends are distinct from but as you pointed out gathering around movement iran gold tradition and that perhaps we better off nonthinking about people we exercise with their train with but that friendship and connection made through movement is perhaps the most valuable form or connection i think it is a product of those practices that are may be not aware a not movement oriented in the open sense and then you get this sensation with people but alone we do nothing much that were never alone also n the inside and we will manufacture and and produce entities the inside ere were constantly in a dynamic exchange cultural exchange and practically i learn this lesson in capauela it is a cultural manifestation things happen within this context we rub against reality we rub against each other and a were movement occurs and their insight is to be gained and and development happen an and then comes other thoughts collective knowledge for self knowledge we are transmitting knowledge if if we go on top of some mountain twenty people twenty normal individuals and we spend twenty years just fighting for hours in the morning four hours in the afternoon we do it for twenty years but were isolated from any other source of knowledge we would still not reach anything that a very young fighter these days has we will be unable to develop those the units those insights that is where collective knowledge comes in and transmission jumps us forward but what is the problem with that thing with in just those technical constraints and never making it yours that is the the part of self knowledge the digestion of this collective information until it becomes digested and becomes part of yourselves and then you are it verses you are doing it and this is a clear separation that you can seen sports on a very high level and only not highlevel even though i would be honest if i say that some people reach very far just wits collective knowledge and very technical approach and others rich extremely far within very little of it and there is always outliers they're always the outliers in that case and other thought i had when you mentioned evil devil evolution development is also the green concepts of noesis and and peas and and and a pisses the growing of these into the tree and the other process of the manufacturing of the chair from the tree two processes of development evolution very different one from everything to something the other for nothing to something one is the cumulation based one is subtraction base both of this processes relate to collective knowledge self knowledge but er not exactly just that and what is what should we do this is a question that my friend the us muse he asks in in is the thesis and thoughts what is the ultimate for us should we manufacture our chair for should we grow into the tree civilized the mind leave savage the body is it in this way or should the mind also be left wild er wild and wise is a nice combination of words a i to place together wild wise this is something that i try to bring into the way that i leave my life and my practise and an i try to bring at the information and the wisdom and the and the collective knowledge but i also try to let go more and more until an essence is glean until something is appearing and because everything was already there for example if in sitting here all the movements our already occurring all the possibilities or it is just about i need to ope i open this window the air would come from here if i open this window there would come i don need to drive my motion i need to discover what is stopping it from a happening something is constantly holding and when we remove this immediately movement appears this is real deep movement verses the driven movement is a very wasteful at times walking you see people pushing through the walk instead of the controlled falling that it should be fighting punching to manufacture the strength and then to have some one who knows how to facilitate the conditions in which you are nock out it does not knock you out it heats verses i eat bruskly he said this is a beautiful thing to examine in to work within that as see am i state board am i using this perspective or am i trying to to control because of risk and danger am trying to overly control something that actually can never be controlled the way to controlled is to let go off the control and then bogey but what about all this collection of information knowledge that i can bringing where do i want to play i can play down here or i can play up here the collective knowledge is maybe take you further in and then you still go need to do your individual work lot of people to momentous size on that and it is you do not need teachers we do not need nothing we don't need information it is not fully ones the e you do not need but depends on were you want a function and how you want function they should not be demonized but they should not be overly glorified as when you mention about the opportunity for movement perhaps even all forms of moment coming from deep within i cut raises to mind in the no science of motor systems we talk about motor means as i describe t ones that actually thevokue contraction of muscles and then there is this category of means that is not often discuss but certainly exist i an't often discussing can a popular nomenclature of persons which is the promoter system most of our movements are the reflection of certain patterns of transmission breaking through from the promoter to the actual motor in other words we are always in a butanticipatory mode of movement and as and i think you the way you describe it you clearly intuitively understand as you feel it and and you recognize it i think of it as a it is a layer of errands as constantly humming ready to go and it is the release of these gates that allows movement to occur in a particular way could be very smooth an very holistic which is the ana the same turning often but ere all the information already there right and then the possibilities are just allowed i am allowed i do not do free will already but i am allowed to do i am there are possibilities and i am then in within that dance but i am not the only denser that is that is my sensation at least is most am states of being let us a maybe there is other states it could be reached stability that will arrive from the waters from the movement of the waters the humming the potential possibilities to be in that state to vibrate this is very powerful for our lives to wake up in the morning and feel that lot leaving thing is the feeling of movement and for mess a result of the practice and then it is easy not to stagnate and then the mind can stay focus for hours we have done to day and i can listen and tune in and i will not lose you which is very difficult i have not had the good conversation here in the yours it is very difficult and i eve had your attention and your listening but it is rare it is ware that somebody can do that and an an it is a struggle always a struggle but it is definitely my trick my dirty trick in the you said you are aloud and again when taking some of the language in and what you report about your experience and and turn await to some concepts that relate o neural circuits in in the principles of nurse science we talk about destructiveness verses permissiveness there instructive us for since dance the the ability to pick up this pan writ there is an instruction clearly there is a motor command but that is just one way of looking at it the way it actually work sos that there is a promoter system that is already generating that movement and what we have done as we have flung open the gate and allowed that movement to occur precisely serving it right serving that current or the current or another current or opening the window exactly and if you look at the formal study of of movement and improvement of movement at the most basic example i gan give is a a tenners serve am then e if you just they have done this many times over you map the trajectories and in a novice the the lines are all over the place it ends up looking more a e a tangle of rubber ban ball r whereas in the fetter or the expert you almost wonder if it is just one line being drawn but it is it the trajectories are incredibly stereotype that is the reflection of one little narrow gat opening again and again and again lacolette let me let me inject something here from an old naurologiseyou can say bursting and the the soviet and he talked about the green of freedom and that they did in order to increase productivity in so it union i do not know if you we have heard this story the was brought in to examine the movement habits of the workers and he collected some some information he placed he was one of the first kinetic i do not know how it is called in english the kinetic capturing of motion is moving pictures in that time and he placed these thoughts and they took the say foots which became kind of moving and what you discover was something very interesting the anurous y of the heat of the sledge hammer increased while the variance in the serious point became more notes it was not ha fixed pattern it was a metapater and these pattern is adjusted in this way to achieve the perfect execution those wo ere very early findings ism nature how does that sit with everything but i am sure there is some truth trust for my experience basically the self adjusting dynamic nature of the system allows you to reach a very constant and stable and result by being open and letting go off your control am the example you give fits very well with the one that i described before because in am recalling the experiment at puvona look this up at a paper will put it in the shown of caption he also happens to be harbor am am bensolevsky hungarynam clearly pronouncing his name wrong but i know tens a and i remember the slide in my mind's eye and the trajectory that was mapped with the movement of the tense racket not of the limbs themselves in the federal case that i think a lines well with what you're describing the others that exploration of degrees of freedom is where the opportunity for am i real advancement and expansion of skill shows up as a i think the way it is been described to me is that we go from unskilled the skilled and then there is mastery and then there is this top there which is this beautiful thin layer that few people occupy which is virtuosity in which the practitioner invites variability and chance back in as an opportunity to to truly new things n i i am it it made me think many years ago this this kind of we thinking about what is that entity because obviously ts not technique and it would not even be honest to say it is a movement pattern there is too much diversity there i started to talk about e i call tit movement sleeves or metatecnique but it the for technique already misleading am there is some kind of a dynamic sleeve in which you can move as long as you're not out of this sleeve you're still within the boundaries of achieving the result that you are after and then there there is all this adaptation of all these elements inside to keep you in the sleeve the sleeve is not constricted as we once thought oh beautiful technique the many ways to skin act am an and that experience and that variety that diversity goes into virtuosity it is too true freedom because your focus is on the righting you do not point at the moon look at your finger and an that is really in essence being a virtuoso for for me mystery that say if there is such a thing all this i do believe there is such a thing and it'll flatter in attempt to embarrass you by saying i think that ism not alone in viewing you as a virtue torso movement i think but that is i think that is what comes to mind because there is this notion that not everything is preplanned that even you might not know what you are going to do next until the moment of execution but that here ism projecting my own my own assumptions ah it'd to talk about mind sets in approaching practice e a bit more but i want to weight into that territory by talking about vision in the eyes something that we both ashore it deep interest in i from the background official nor science but also from the realization that we have this incredible ability to adjust the aperture of our visual window we can focus very narrowly we can focus very broadly o something i encountered i think first is a child realizing that i could spend all day watching ants play in a very find domain an and look up and inside andrelizes a whole world and realizing while it'll never be able to consume the full range of experiences at any one moment their aunts probably in the corner of this room doing their thing and too are our approach to movement can be as you mention very big and dynamic in terms of the broad movements of our limbs or fine articulation when you begin a practice or i and as you move through a practice do you apply a regimented a way of focussing your vision are you in panoramic vision are you in in a very narrow field of you or does it entirely depend and for the person who is a true beginner true novice myself how should i show up to the practice with my eyes the eyes are we good starting point as you helpmate a lot of people to understand and that when you encounter difficulties with other layers it is a very powerful to start with the eyes and other thing important to in understand and to experience you you cannot believe me or you got o examine it for yourself we do not move the eyes as well as we think we do cause as long as you can see move the eyes people never think about it that it can be trained that it can be improve at camera and the effector it are far reaching the eyes lead to the manor eye you can think of it in a beautiful and metaphorical way and its a representation of the way that we use various cogent even mind processes and also of course affect the body the eyes lead in many ways and the head is also a very because all of this inputs are coming in here it is very easy to lead the body in a if you look at a centered what from the head it is a very powerful and easy thing for example you when when you teach boxers how to bob usually eats not done in the way that i i believe it it should be done you teach it with the parifery they teach it from the feet because they have the idea which is correct that you need do it in spacial conditions in movement in space but in reality the head will organize the feet for you instead you are now putting two elements together and then with the years of practice you hope of tying them together well i prefer to do something else because you fell pul your head now to the side you will immediately start to organize your feet under it i give you just one element to manipulate ta system from that is how i would teach some one something this many animals hunt with the head you can see that the body running forward while the head is turning to these the whole thing fallows afterwards it is a very powerful way to address movement not only one and there many modes thankfully and were very adaptable in that but definitely a primary one and then the use of the eyes is of course may be the most important element with that usually were what else can i say about the eyes as that for how do you come in well it the person the practice you need to start to have some kind of a checklist of what your looking to do and then by this you can start to tailor the way that you use your eyes the same thing i do for posture the same thing i do for stands the same sing eventually i do for state and there is different flavors there is no correct way to use the i sometimes is very peripheral soft open a wetness orientation sometimes its very focus notice them pulling these to opposite a wetness and focus which is often put together and confused but am and then the eyes are the immediate and the easiest entry point into that another thing is the placement of the head and the eyes for example when we lower our chin we seem to see better when we raise the eyebrows there is too much exposure of top light forces and people would usually when looking into the distance will til the their chin in and in many scenarios tilting of the the chin to the side or placing just listening with the ear placing a certain i or dominant eye depending on serious and various and this is all information that i can come in cerebrally and think about and jump might practice forward instead of just letting the experience teach me that ism using some kind of a thinking process to improve and this is not cheating this is great repeat work we got to try is it is a process those are some thoughts and start to play was ye i love that you mention chin down because we all have a natural reflects when chin goes down ice goes up and the opposite is true en head goes up a eyes go down and there are two separate clusters of anurans in the that's cranial nerve newly i that was we call them when eyes are up it increases our level of alertness over all this is it not this is not wo science this is this is the the function of these cranial nerve lucky i when our eyes re down we go into states of more calm and quiescence and this makes perfect sense then the lads usually go down and then people fall asleep eyes up does not mean head ups as you said there is a very dynamic control over the amount of luminous depending in the environment that and then as you mention this difference between focus in awareness i think it is a really important one when we are in this more panoramic south gays as am and broad awareness big big swaths of visual field as we say the neurons that control that come through a pathway call mango cellar pathway in any event those neurons are much thicker thicker cables they transmit much faster just thick a pipes can carry more water ore quickly and you reaction time is for at least four times what it is in this awareness smoke then it is when you are narrowly focus on something and this is counter intuitive i think to lot of people but the person who is running to catch the ball is not tracking the the ball in a smooth movement tho most of their vision is in perifrovision when we drive were in this perfrovision and our reaction times are much much faster i do not know if ism reluctant to a encourage people to shift toward a prertygular type of practice toward o pricilirt ape of vision i think what you and i i i hope agree on check me from wrong is that exploring these different extremes and everything in between is were the real value is panoramic focus eyes head up eyes down had down eyes up playing with it and exploring it and in as opposed to for the first ten minutes of practice been panoramic vision another sort of ate earlier to day we were joking about and kind of lamenting the fact that this word bivouacking exist or that the optimal performance it is that there unfortunate terms because they suggest that if you just plug it in its can be two plus to equals for and you are going to get it right every time m and other pragmatic bet ere if i can offers am am since our culture has been more geared than pushing us towards focus they the focus use of the ice and primary can language reading and and other things we have less opportunities to work is the more open ponoromi cone o it would be smart to start to balance tings out to be t more when you're in nature you do not look at each leaf everything is moving and you are kind of umerseing that and then something attracts your attention always a bird yo focus and you go back into the general state the basic state which is open awareness here we switch things around in our modern culture we are mostly focussed and then we sonthize they dream which is may be some kind of it some kind of a balancing act that comes from deep within i do not know may be you can you can share some information about that but i see that many time people need to the focus is overly done by far in a in our life i could not agree more and i think a lot of it'll even venture far as to say that the a lot of the visual deposits that we now see and young people biopic literally near sightedness occurs because if we look at things that are too close to us as children oral adults the eyeball actually gets longer the lends focusses the visual image in front of nearer to the lands near sighted than a in front of the where it should land and basically it is a lack of panoramic vision that is or open awareness that is driving these changes and nowadays we are essentially most people or ninety per cent of the time in this narrow focus mode you right before recording we took a break and went up to look at a vista and to look off to the distance incredibly useful easy practice at some level but i think most people are not doing this sort of thing and the way that it shapes the mind and the perception of time of course is a whole other a kingdom of ideas but one thing it'd to a relate this element of vision to and open awareness's earlier you mentioned the cone of auditory attention the other sense that we can play with in as in our practice an end throughout the day do you see any value to both paying attention to things in a very narrow cone of auditory attention but also just walking and listening to all the sounds at once i can imagine that could be useful and in terms of of physical movement practises i was on say wary your ears years are always more less in the same place but where is your hearing when you approach your practice another set of parameters to think about and to play with to be aware of am also i i have experience that some people are better at using system or tat system and and you would be amazed how differently the same result seemingly outside results are non by different practitioners and indifferent can arias thingies into this mutation and change idea what really jumps us forward eventually some kind of mutation as all of our culture and practices and success puts at closer and closer to each other we have the same opinions everywhere around the world becoming more and more the same less and less different but the real hope comes from the different and were we have a difficult difficulty in promoting that an an this is another thing that can be promoted with the right practices the right for example i i i work with corporate or even worked with governments before to bring in some of that freshness we simple habits in the work that or in the education of children or in in in companies increasing productivity i do not really give a fuck but i am there to give what i view is important and what is important may be increases productivity an but it is more important to me that it improves people's lives who are involved and improves er yet being and becoming being in becoming a stool this identities ism not there i am on my way i am a process thinking about here the way that people use their ears the way that people use listening again we can talk about placement of the head and posture and sometimes angling as well sharper and touching down some people ten to use the the shape of the ear people is different ears closer or further out this is it is if you're very sensitive and your looking round you would see and the a is affecting people's motion even the shape of our face the development of the vocal courts in speaking will totally change how we are how we look but how we listen also and will do the same i do not have any proof of it but am it is something i believe in but people will even make their ears bigger we we try and become those public foxes or something but a wen i lap you do not like that act why we did this is the capture for sound ways right imine a leaning is that the localization of sound is based on a simple brainstorm calculation of inter or or time differences the time in which something the the brain intuitively it just knows cause it is pretty hard wired circuit that if a sound arrives first to this ear than tat ear that is likely coming from over here whereas if it is that center arise at the two the same time that me it is almost ridiculously simple when when hears it no pone intended but it is it is a incredibly valuable way of thinking about how the architecture of the body changes are experience i will not along those lines earlier you mention something in it an it a flag that an important question for me am when i see people walking i sometimes sometimes i think while they really move in a strange way occasionally see somebody they walk really it is impressive for whatever reason n he just think while they sort of glide along people come in different shapes and sizes short tours this long arms et camera am do you think that if people have a a body type that facilitate certain kinds of movement and not others that they should intentionally try and move in the way that is right at the edge of the kind of friction and challenge in order to am shape new possibilities or you think that they should lean into the smooth execution of what comes most naturally to them i think i a good practice is to have many walks and because they required and of course there is very efficient and endurance summon our rented thing that if you have the experience it will naturally develops and unravel and if not you can get some collective knowledge and proof and then there is a lot of it emotion emotional things related to walk how walking into a business meeting and or how ism walking out of a bad situation and that there is a lot of beautiful things to to research there practically is yourself trying to approach some one with the chin slightly down very lean a very efficient in the straight at line or trying to approach some one a little bitt more rounded from the side and you and tilting your head and you will see totally different result totally different communication that happens over people's heads but if you are sensitive you realize that who this open the door instead many people you start on the mines at my sister my sister tales y always as i started on the mines why do not i start on the zero with them but it is it is part of the approach you can effect that and you can start even on the plus if you are the slime and as the practitioner needs to me this is am something to play with and to work with and then you have of course body proportions and ways and and we have all the technical invasions mathematics and try gone on nature and architecture thy invaded our bodies they invaded our nervous system and ow our walk and our physical practices they look leaning r and mention the pass between two points is ha straight lines not is is big mechanics's of mechanics nothing the is a even this no gossip the walk is sometimes have to go around or sway from side to side in thee is coiling and coiling and their moving beats and what about teethe coordination of my breathing is my walk because if i wok too linearly there is less pumping of the air naturally in and out now i have to forcefully bring it in and out i ism wasteful and then that is why you see in lest years this incredible runners especially long distance doing things we never thought we are possible in the most in the worst possible way that we use to think pronation and an all kinds of thing our technical thoughts were hotly is guided and wrong and an somebody comes in and does it in in somethinsome way that is totally wrong anyhegets results we could never get that that is the beauty of playfulness experimentation change been different the am as your destriveins from smiling because one of my favor it your scientists hes not in the unease chico i was in a meeting him there was an argument about evolution of the nervous system and he said at the end an people were arguing about whether not this gene in one animal was homologous to this gene and humans et camera can get very dick and he said very very appropriately that one of the major jobs of evolution is to take existing retypes and circuits and give them new functions but that can only be done through the playful exploration of new possibilities which i think maps very well to what you are saying that at the extreme thresholds of technical execution mastery mastery mastery you your obviously performances very high but the opportunity for evolution of the sport or the music or the dance were the intellectual endeavor is is limited because you are not introducing variability in the attempt to get proper execution id you are limiting oneself o hence i i want to offer something that is relating to you an we should be were of defining the mechanisms and putting certain meaning with certain processes and ways because just history in experience shows it does not work well for us inmost times a orbit becomes this much more elaborate thing even if we were somewhat in the right direction because even thinking this way can offer a lot for example it your adviseabout heat open in light offers a lot o benefit but also can create problems and the it can inclose something a with the the improvisor will find the mariners right take a pinch some paper clinic and you make it into something great and this is really our are the suggesting proviso's around that is that is what made us we are thinking or this is incredible what what we can do with it the the russia america space exploration story with the spaceman famous story about a development of the spaceman i now it is a space pen yo i do not know i do not i i think i think it is an urban mi i know if it is true but i its o i use it the the was this of course a space competition and the ruffians put the first animal in space and the first we o my can monsters ye the e and than then liken and they put the first sees sputnik the safelight and men on in space but america took the men on the to and on the way lot of thecknowledgies got developed in the america because of lack of gravity out there developed the spaceman with a huge investment the ruffians use the pencil i do not know if it is i don'now if itstrou i do not think it is but it it represents something in the state of mind you look at for example the military equipment in soviet equipment it is all can do multiple things and it means that it is heavier it is less sufficient it is not as light an but even the navy seals will still carry a an act with certain conditions why because you can pour a whole bucket of send into the mechanism and i will keep running while chemist advanced german eclelend cool and accurate and light weapons for every grain can get stuck and overly specialized and there is something about this openness that we humans needs to keep and also may be something for our leaders to be more of less specialist and more in this opens less capable in this or that way but more capable of doing the whole thing e ell of the story wether not its legend or not at it is legendary because it is ait is fantastic as you say no laboratory whenever some one takes on a project in my lab i was said you do not you have to ask yourself how much technical detail and challenge you want to take on because with more tacknowlegy advance acknowledge festers the opportunity for more discovery but more down time your pic yo will literally take longer if you candy use a microscope that is out of commission thirty per cent of the time an ye just have to understand that there is a dynamic interplay there by thewy i think that scientist get it right it is where you transmit the knowledge out o the scientific field because science have debate and everything you are not connected of course these can happen as well but then when it goes out and to this simple person was all the experience takes it more as a gospel as a fixed thing and then t was just the report i was just reporting some functions here and play with it see what it does for you because with old the greatest information that i can give the person will examine it can it might be not useful at all for me this is the proctition a make it your own go practice try heat cold light movement a weakness to be harness my this and the is up to you to make it yours but we do not to have this responsibility now people prefer to have the this will work the first time every time and i will serve you best compared everything also and and while there are more reliable tools than others in my mind the more reliable tools ten to be ones that are grounded in our innate physiology i as oppose to some i do not the word hack in fact i loathe the word byohack as i were toking about again earlier a because it the a hack in my mind as it is something that is designed for one purpose that is use for another it is it is not the most efficient use of that tool nor is it naturally the best solution whereas biology has some very good solutions but they do not always work not every time i earlier to day we did a practice in which ism which involved a invasion shall we say of very personal space we were not standing superclass for any a pretty reason but there was overbid god forbid but we a but there was am we are close enough together we could touch one's torsos and we were doing that as part of this practice and you encourage me to pay attention to how does it feel to have some one in your prairie personal space and then this notion of reactivity i find this an immensely interesting and potentially powerful practice because i think a lot of people i know a lot of people suffer from anxiety just being in a face to face conversation some people have a lot of anxiety about being physically close to people whether not they know them or not and many people are reactive they are in that anticipatory state of something it is going to happen and sometimes this relates to drama and negative experience but sometimes no sometimes they are just not use to being in dynamo dynamo excuse me it exchange with other beings and one thing i love about the movement practice and how dynamic is that one can explore that space maybe could ism talk about that a little bit more ye m touch proximity all the things a also taking very it it takes a very ear i think limited place in our lives people are not touched and they do not touch enough there is certain bubbles of very personal space according to culture according to environment what is right what is wrong and then came all the of course politically correctness and harespence and all kinds and this is a problem it is a problem to navigate all this et scenario and i think we are that there is definitely decide which is suffering people go to be g jackasses to touch not to learn b j j that most of it they're not even aware of it before they would go to a prostitute may be it would not be honest to say that am yet this is not required of a necessary more in our lives a children who are not touched there is a lot of information about that and the problems but at also are not touched there is not a lot of information and i think it is no less of a problem because something that has to be constantly present and then proximity being able to as you said remove certain reactivity and to learn to control that am that volume volume control over how reactive i am and in other serials how do i remove this activity altogether is very important for performance and also for our lives for clear thinking et camera because everything is moving through us and is being monk told by us everything has the potential to detract us from a certain direction of exploration or and if you reactive your slave it it becomes worse and worse tan worse or as for example a fighter or a football player et camera has to no what to take what not to take the fact that you can sense more does mean you should react it that an the practise helps that by bringing people into this snares but oftentimes disarming them when we were working closely to day and because you have a certain background with boxing our fighting i can tell you you are missing some kind of a way to been that space that is not martial you carry certain tone although you are very kind person but often times you help me without realizing your holding to with a lot of strength for example and and there it just it was clear to me you are not fully aware of what is unfolding and is just of course a question of experience to be able to be in disanariable do something else which is not hear towards being losing competition or just being able to play with another person foexemple contacting provision to that and played with that and the work of stiff atone for the ones who are not familiar this this is w where i i call it the the high breeds become very useful we we do not when when you are practicing in disobey way you are not bound by specific rule set or ways of doing things it can be a fight but it can be a dance a moment after another thing that i learn from cancel the situations very treaty there because have seen kids doing card wills in broil and and clears fall from their pocket why why would you go to with the cesar in your pocket obviously there is certain intentions and then at other time you see back sleeps and beautiful things but people die in cancel every year the breaks touch something kicks to the face from very violence it is i explored other marshal arts and boxing always invite with and i may and be gene but i tell you the most violent are in is that vipecause it is unknown one moment it smiles another moment its something else and its uncontrolled the is no category is no ways and its street phenomenon you have musical instruments sometimes they break it on your head people do not see that but you can look on line on you you end see some of that side of cancel which is actually the day to day in profile an the reality and how things unfolded it is very important to explore many ways of being within different distances and spaces from other people and touched in different ways and not contextualizing it always in the same way i can touch your chest and in one way i can touch it with the exact same pressure and speed but will feel very different the parameters am not sure certain intentions certain combination of postures or ways and this is beautiful exploration and again i would encourage you and others to explore the discomfort for example certain discomfort e to be with a man in certain scenario or with a woman and trying to see what is that because if were truly strong we are not afraid of anything if we truly know who we are and we are in that exploration we do not know the and result but we are in a research and then we are not afraid of being in that or i or and we do not er come out of boundaries and this will improve our culture tremendously of course there must be agreement you never force yourself that you meets some one who is also interested in that exploration and then you do it an and the there many canaries to do that with traditional practices learning to grapple or or am going to contacting provision and and studying there or going to dance to to eating dens less or and there is of course my favorite is to create and come up wits your own highbrow of that and generous communicating with your loved one through movement not seeing around food and talking moving together in all kinds of ways sometimes it is walking together sometimes it is e all kinds of it can be gain playful it can be romantic i and the many shades sex don't start here an and here right it is continurment we do not even need to define it in that way with tine i think it unlocks a lot of things people become much stronger in a good sense intense of becoming being and there we abuse less and the we can approached yet other aspects to us of of the idea that through the exploration of a range of a physical contacts provided one knows they can always return to their center to speak then there is a lot of opportunity that opens up i i wish there was more of that encouraged in a children play but also as you mention in in adult a environments because yet nowadays for all sorts of reasons that you touched on am the tidy of keeping at least enormous only distances become critical they lot of environments as she were hugging is not allowed i do not know what it is in israel but in in the states many institutions here you not allowed to touch any one ease's body is lushly a wonderful study that comes to my roman is rally laboratory i get i no noble is over there am who as shown that a by recording people's first interactions that when people meet if they shake hands they almost always i thing it is greater than eighty five percent of the time they will then wipe the chemicals from the other person on to their own eyes typically their eyes ore their face a this changed a little it during the shall pandemic thing but this is thought to be a a carry over from what other animals do in terms of exchanging mycrobyon elements exchanging chemicals that were constantly feeding a subconscious with the a chemical knowledge of the chemical constituents of other people right it is it goes way beyond how people smell how they look et camera more touch seems to me just a as you said provider's consensual seems a just a really good thing over all and si unbelt i think may ball important for discharging discharging certain experience is remoulderling refrain sos touches very powerful in that if if you are touched and you are touching a lot er you are unpacking and you experience that touch that may be has been tomato and you are refrain it you have the opportunity am which is something interesting i have have heard some story about some traditional culture in which when you were burnet by mistake they would immediately burn you again and it made me think and then there would not be any burn marks and the would not be the same side effects that is the claim it made me thinks what is the source of this and i i realize that maybe it a louse certain completion to happen that in the dramatic moment is not there the preexposure while your still open the port are still open allows you to refrain the experience and then the unfolding of the rest of the event is very different this is if your touching in your practice in the day to day and your working with people and your being touched and people come closer further away it happens naturally m ye and if you pass a certain limit and it it becomes too much there is always of course communication that has to be present certain cultures make this communication free her certain cultures post is really for example post here free a n israel they'll say that did not feel good to mere that thou goober that was fine ye it would be more comment am here in the air port the guys that ism going to slide my hands up towards your crutch until i meet the hard stop and and then he does this in a way that is supposed to show me i have no enjoyment in that and for me it just feels aggressive but his his his intention is good showing me but if it was a loving though you would be nicer for me actually personally that is it would be gentle but he goes up there and he shows me i have no enjoyment in this a ah that is my tactical right there us fit is it is different choice as i do not think it is worse or but this description can be a bit dissociated and what does it make me think is it truly what he feels or not cause it feels robotic it is not sometimes i rather not say and hen ism going to touch your chest ism just place my hand on the chest and the of course we cannot avoid ta problem ism not suggesting that there is but there is an examination and because i moved around around the world have seen many things and have see benefit is here benefit is there am and and in the practice i think it is important to disgusts to examine this i do not have a solution but it is something to talk about it is something to talk about and ism glad you raise it because i think that its clear to me that much of the value of a movement practice involves that i am acanteraction with somebody else who as you point out it can be p informed on one's own and practice throughout one's they but the unpredictability is a key element to all it and and in bringing out all the the potential that you have described reference to the this notion of drama and and burn and return ad my collar gets tempered avid pig he is i works on drama and he is a has actually on this precast he voice that he is against things trigger warnings because of the way that it puts the nervous system into the state of readiness and reactivity that can exacerbate i problems whereas i it is very clear from the literature on tram and drama relief that the way to deal with that is through a controlled but clearly a controlled preexposure to the drama in order to diminish the emotional response over a time cumin at it is very clear if we avoid the thing i we see we don't wot a reinsure ourselves a retramatize but if one avoids the thing that makes them upset over and over all it does is serve to create a heightened state of readiness it primes more drama i think it makes good sense i think i impressions are very useful here also when stepping into an area in which tramachennical and then by going through the impression that it already occurred you crate some kind of a thormalayer of protection am have already been hit when ism entering that space beneficial or have already been touched in away that i did not if i go to a conducting provision place and just running the snarling in your head protect well glad you mention running scenarios in your head i with been curious all day as to whether or not you do visualization or mental rehearsal of physical movement this is a it seems to be a popular idea in in the states people always asking me can you just imagine o a movement and learn it better than i were you to actually perform in my hunch based on and my understand a scent of literature that visualization can be useful to some extent for people that are very good at visualization but for many people it does not help and that there is nothing real physical practice to improve physical practice at the word visualizations not good obviously i has to be experience salivation i in a very complete way not just visually of course am and unless you already developed certain experience tangible experience that has been bet that has benefited from fidabec from outside feedback it is not the very useful thing to and e tends up being fabrications but if you're very experience and you already gain the benefit of being burnt here or over extended year the an you have a certain experience and then you can strengthen certain aspects of it but you got to be careful because you do not have feed beck and because of the missing feed beck you might develop delusions it might be that you develop stronger potheen but ultimately these would lead you away from the aliveness of the movement itself the reading for example very useful to learn a general inform structure of the movement sleeve or the technique but then to dress it up you need feed beck you needed to be life you need to receive something corrective of it for many people the approach movement in the form of way training or yoga running you is a bit more by dynamic but i fairly linear types of exercise and movement a platoon rowing s kinds of things i think most people will probably not depart from those practices entirely because they them ism speaking about myself i some of those very much i enjoy them but in terms of thinking about adding a movement practice to ones already existing exercise resume i can imagine threading it throughout the day i can imagine having a dedicated movement practice one thing that i i have started doing on the basis of some of your teachings em and i justcorcreade this ideas rather than statically standing there in lifting waits i shall walking from as i alternate repetitions it occurred to me that i never done a carrel the biceps curl with one foot in front of the other and then it'd never actually switch that up and it is a kind of an odd stance to be standing in parallel and curling one's arms have a ridiculous movement when one thinks about it s i started i covering some of that you get some strange looks in the him but i just give them strange looks back what are your thoughts about these very linear forms of exercise and and do you encourage people to expand the place back as it were for these kinds of exercise were do you think that movement practice is just best a explored through three dimensionality gravity and maybe a sticker a ball definitely a problem and it is a it is approach able people want to due people want a heck people want the the the icing there is no cake there is no cake and just industries of icing icing icing on what what are you putting it on for me that that is why i am ism going towards the side is i have my life now tell me what movement practices i should pursue you are movement in essence you are not thinking of yourself in in any serious way in through my eyes there is a dynamic entity to you the body is a huge pot is a huge part of it communicating you have geneticlares there is a personalities that cut developed and build around variousinfluences but then there is also some kind of an essence something that wreaks from within the selves and if you grew up in my family in i grew up in your family in it would still be the same and that something that always try to think about what is that inside of me an i think this practices the very good but there not designed for the gold we think they were does i do it it orients towards something else for example theory there is a good book called the yoga body and which will destroy lot of peoples the yoga practice and and it goes into how did we get to this yoga the influence of swish domestics and mongolia contortionists and the western the west affecting it and then the ancient practice which was verily son related posture position actually you said the yoga is less near you get very near very in your the days these lines look at all the traditional dances they look nothing yoga look at dance look at chines dances martial arts round at all cutlets the out nature what you see nature and the movement of the animals where does it come from these or things to understand because it designs you now it shapes you you placing yourself in this forces of change and the streams of change and you have a good intention and you just want this or that but the joke is on us and this is the movement practice for me is first education start to think about this i have nothing that i can just sprinkle now some magic powder that will help resolve this because it is a start of the deep investigation and then o some of the things program let stock pragmatically because what you described is not about you placing the foot in front when your curling it is about the examination this is whit it it is a very good direction and then you will need another one another one do not get stuck on that for in front of at and try to do with the eye closed or with a different had posture and you will see things arrive unrelated things because the associative mind the thinking this relates this does not get to the heart of it never just in fusing this elements in a cup will create endless combinations possibilities and a lot of discovery and this for is humility of the practitioner i do not know i try to day with you i tried serious combinations and tough i discover something a this this is a playful approach and this is a researcher approach an i do not try to fit my truth into something i there to examine i do not have a motive yet why because ism fine i do not depend on that to defend myself i am a human being but if i do not have that sense of worth i ism already gear towards i need to do this i need to prove this i have this gender and this is how we get all the lies in the world and all the the problems and difficulties this practices they are related to it to prove this that this way and why we need muscles for excise that and a lot of the i reported outcomes are often from my places funny i hear about something i i heard you say about gratitude practice that e actually experience from outside s if somebody else or you are receiving grad to this actually more powerful it is true but i see whites you i ism not sure everybody sis if somebody tries to feel gratitude just sit with the eyes close or watch a move and sense the grad to there it would be clear to you one is very difficult to do and the others very easy hence if gratitude his achieved easier this way that is why it works that although all the traditional practices are about you and by challenging yourself to sense that gratitude yourself the achieve much more power thing but this is not the research people eye the people in the research we do not have a lot of those people a lot of the things that a can arrive to us way training the benefits for the way that the the hormonal effects and the effect over cognition and et camera i when you open a bit and you go far out you see certain things not the truth but may be less delusion you there is not nothing definite but there is there is something may be more wholesome that appears am ye i think this is the this is a state state of exploration i do not want to have the same thought if i already had it my would i want to have the same thought i already had it i do not want to have the same practice i do want it i curled already in this way i want to experience something else i want to there is a benefit to gain no but that was better the better is better is is not more is not faster is a better is better and better is i we do not know what better is frights is lie it is open oh this is better i do not know it is just more weight it is one morello but maybe if i remove one kilo i discover something for example power development that has been shown to pain certain benefits when you lighten the load and you accelerate it more in certain conditions but who discovered it a practitioner and met person not her koshenski is to siorski they reported something but it was already within the grasp of the practitioners i think am an laser as a researcher this is very powerful to remind yourself this and to work with that and as a practitioner as a leaving human being for everyone i think something very useful and than those play that your doing it e people give you this the weird looks and ye i tell people you do not want to be normal if you do not get the word looks you are not moving in the hi direct your moving i and in a very fixed and you already know the result of that direction let say at least that continue to play wash that t continue to play look elsewhere look at places you did not look yet because this is still within the same layer one foot in front of one foot behind what happens when you do it with a smile the same work out and when you do it is a frown or what happens breast holding or bloderestrict as all this is great play and i think a very beneficial to do to go though the i think hat wonderful message what i keep hearing from yo over and over again is to that people should explore explore explore and dam the s and i i want to thank you for your time to day first of all am for the incredible teachings here at the table but also the introduction to a movement practice though now ism tempted to say that have been moving my whole life have just that is know i was that it was such a vast landscape am that also thou are willingness to tread out in this i journey that is truly unique that the greatest compliment that one can give in science is the one hat eminent tell you now because it is entirely appropriate which is we say you are an end of one right that that and you truly are i do not think there is any one that has been as willing to embrace existing practices evolve the create new practices and and i and to share broadly to really be willing to given

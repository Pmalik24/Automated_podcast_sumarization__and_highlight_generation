biding special prosecutor jack smith launches another four charges that tonal trump over mishandling of classified information as two more cases against trump loom the collapsing hunter bit an plead ears spells vulnerability for job and house re publicans reveal how the bison whorehouse push censorship on face book ism been share let is the venthparo show the benchmark shosponterback spressvepian i do not let them every single show why haven't got love pianist get express we plan right not if press panda calm flashes well another day another set of charges against the former precedent to of the united states that r bunch of charges looming in separate cases from the classified documents case we have the fanny wills case in georgia that presumably will be about canary sixth and electoral pressure there is the jack smith case looming about canary sixth and electoral pressure but there are new charges that were filed yesterday by blacksmith these new charges are in the classified document's case and they really carry two major revelations that the first major revolution nation that is carried by by the actual filing is that the prosecutors know full well that the famous tape now of dona trump waving around a document and sang to people here is a classified document at could of deed classified this document bat is had did not end he classified the document it is very classified e trump had clawed that his classified document was in fact maps of a golf course or something andapparently going the prosecutors they know full well it was not maps of golf horse it was actually a tack plans with regard to iron and we now know that what the prosecutors know and presumably that will be the sensorpiece of their case when he have the person on tape admitting to the chiming usually is a very bad indicator for them legally speaking that is number one piece of information is that the tape where trump his chalking he made various excuses about it it appears that the prosecution is ready to blow up those excuses the second piece of revelatory information here is that dona trump apparently told one of his aids decamp a a maintenance worker at trumps south florid resort and carols de old sierra apparently he told this fellow two while the security tape according tote walzterjournal trump an his ages shuts have surevailance footed from his marlin club to leaded t could not be turned over to a grand jury according to blacksmith in these new charges the newinvictment charges carols to one sierra he mare notnance worker as well making him the third defended in the cases wire member the second offended in the case was waltmouta who is another trump are who's apparently task of moving boxes around and then told the prosecution had not move boxes around the additional charges brought the indictment brought by a flora gran jury in tune a legging the form president held on to sensitive military secrets knew he should never train access too sherd the with others and directed his staff to help him made authorities efforts to get them back they commas trumpbraces for separate federal target of safer sun do his twenty twenty election lost now as have said all long therefore two separate issues here one is is trump guilty of the crimes for which he is charged and the second is should the charges be brought even if trump is guilty of the charges facially speaking with regard to the first question whether trump his actually guilty of some of these charges and get the evidence seems pretty clear the trump violated the law here in well get to the sang was ion i just a second which is going to obviate the first question but the first question which is wether true violated the low if blacksmith has actual testimony that the document that trump was waving around on that tape or he is talking about how he couldnave de classified the document but he did not the classified the documents but still technically classified but here it is and he showing its people who do not have any sort of classification status if that is what happen and if jacksmelt can prove that if he has the evidence to prove it beyond the actual tape then presumably that will be in element of gilt when it comes to evidence that this maintenance worker was actively wiping security footage in order to pretends donate trump true being indited on precisely the sorts of charges wipe the evidence of for example donate trump moving the documents around now here is the thing about the whole case all this was easily avoidable the reason be angry at trump here is not really his behavior much as it is the insanity of knowing tat he's got the world's biggest tarragon's back he is likely to run for reelection again and do and he besides that he is going to do all of this under the assumption that known is going to come after him the the assumption of impunity here is just foolish again as as a person who prominent politics over pay my taxes because the last thing that i want is be put under the scrutiny of jo bisons o horas will donate trump is way more of a target than i am personally why in the world would he be careless and and clumsy as to do all of these things then do them on tape also that that is why h should be upset at trump that the crimes themselves the messing with the classified documents not turning them back in he was not during them over to russia as i said from the very beginning the entire case is donate trump likes things and then he keeps them donate trumps here is a thing it is really nice thing it is a good it is bod thing i won it it is bine n they can thingies a thing that that is donate trumps he he does this all the time he literally just had to hive a bunch of antiquities back to the is really consulate because he would kept the antiquities and thy e was lives lay a munch of two thousand your old artifact and trump had been handed them at the white house and then he so said he was gin keep em why was was he going to handles over to the ruffians as epicenter a lo he likes things he keeps them he is can of a order the notion that he was actively certain sort spy for chino or russia that the is classified document who is keeping them on hands who could do something ne serious and terrible them that is not true and sell what you went up with is he miss handle classified documents because donate trump is clumsy and does not care about the ramifications legally but also is not somebody who seeking to disseminate the newcomer codes to the ruffians or the chines or something an with all that in mind this brings us to the second question which is whether donate trump shouldhav ben charged on the stuff at all because this is the most perilous political prosecution in america history you have the current precedents of the united states his demean mane a mistake is still his done his done prosecuting the guy he just ran against and his probable future opponent in the twenty twenty four race that is kind of astonishing stuff and again put aside for just one moment the actual elements of the crime because when he actually read the charges here when you read what trump did i think that it is fairly t clear that trump did many of the things that he is accused of but that is not really the question the question is why he is being charged with it at all again ism looking at the at the actual charges here and do and the charges openly discuss what exactly he was doing with the documents how he was sort of messing around with the documents toll costing two this actual document is the indictment document quit on tune third twenty twenty two when of agents where at farrago to collect documents with classification markings true trumpet turn one and trump plenty three the agent observed the re several surveillance cameras located near the storage room on tune twenty second twenty twenty two the do j small in a turned for trumps business organization a draft gran very open

three indicating trump anted s loud a couple of hours later he changed his travelskedrel and began to make arrangements to go to palm beach florid instead now to then provided inconsistent explanations to colleges for is sudden travel to florid he tested one person he would not be traveling with trump the next day and then he used shushing emotes and nine forty eight that nighty

forts with small room known as an audio closet and then they had an exchange in which duller asked how many days the serve retain footage deliver then trump told trump em ploy for the boss wanted the server to lead it and then duller tested not are you working today and they are gone back an forth and finally apparently the footage ends up essentially being race there is an attempt to race the footage we that is what the actual indictment sejant now second question should trump be indicted for this stuff at all well let us look at t time line literally yesterday the hunterbide and pleedio collapses and a collapse is because the hunter biding fleet deal is garbage and the began knows it is garbage and the deejays lying to the judge about a being garbage and the judge discovers that and then she blows up to deal and one day later the special council blacksmith the dumps a bunch of additional charges on donate trump does that seem suspicious to you it should seem particularly suspicious given once again that killer canton is the standard by which all this must be judge killer clinic to the exact same thing as doll trump in this case she was not prosecuted aims mommy went outofhis way not to prosecutor coin despite the fact that she too violated the obvious letter of the law and the spirit of law by the way and choose let off to hook will get to that momentarily first we love our dog happy his a delightful doggy yesterday he was playing with the was rolling round carpet an i thought i want happy to live a long healthy life this why we give him rough greens every

they three my dog thirty three'get we get to the second question now s the first question did trump fulfill the elements the crime did he do the chiming on tape am mean it appears that naming bithevalble evidence if blacksmith's got the good of got t e goods but that is a separate question from weather the prosecution of dona trump should move forward because i remind you him's come let killer canton off the hook for the same exact stuff the same exact stuff flash back so thousand sixteen nonmember six pal sherry reports for then you post that killer canton directed her made to print out class i materials to the idea here is the donate trump exposed t classified materials that he sure la ossified to people who were not within classification states wright he is over at bedpan strings waning round document saying these are classified a tidied should tat escape but here is from hilly canton routinely as secretary of state well serving in the government with out the power of

congress with sepia her and the equipment that she use canton apparently expected this philippic immigrant to hands state secrets further opening the democratic presidential moline to criticism is she played fast and loose with national security there crested that cantos prints out trass for speech confidential memos and callsheets those be background in formation and talking points prepared for the secretary of state in advance to a one call with the foreign hat of state please ask marina to print for me in a m client meal locate whom bit an regarding any redacted two thousand levin message

canton apparently the up i noted that clinging periodically receive the presidential daily brief via the secure facts the is a topsecret dolmen that is created by the c i a and other us intelligence agencies hero killer canton was having her philipino maid pick up the stuff and due and handed to her and printed out for her is that misshandal in classy according jam's combat is not criminal miss handling classified information we what about dona true telling employes to wipe the server win think where this is going then you knower this is going yu'lry call that all the way back in twothousan sixteen submember of two thousand sixteen the fix released documents from its investigation into weather former secretary of state still client i properly sort or transmitted classified meal is going o the denser post included were notes from interviews with employees of plant river networks that is the denser firm the canton family hired to host of personal meals for four months after she left office a corning to the up documents indecember twenty fourteen former chief of staff shirt mills till last river employe client no longer needed access to meals older than sixty days also instructed the person modified the meal retention piles on canton server to reflect this change in unknown client staff member said sh did not want the p it file after the port and wanted it remove from the server the last river employed to not to we defiles for make their attention polls change in till four months later after a march second two thousand fifteen n york time story about killer's secret server mills into males to plant river net work referencing the preservation request from the committee on bengozy then some time between t march twenty fifth and much thirty first twenty fifteen the play river employ had an od bleat moments that the files wasn't it the leaded he ten told the f bi he released the canton a give male box from the pierce server and used bleach bit to defeat the exported at p sty files he had created on the service sister containing cantons females according that f pat report bleach bit scrubs to file out of existence to prevent recovery the employ told the f bi in a made third twenty sixteen interview he was aware of the existence of the preservation re quest the fact that it meant he should not to stub canton male data on the piercing server canton told the f fresh never released nor did he instruct any one to defeat males it was unaware of play rivers delusions from march twenty fifteen to in other words canton's defend to all this as we told them on to go they should to lead it and then the gestdidn' do it on him but the play river employ you knew about it what you think that he actually was we ouzo now that i haven't f b request for the in formation and i made a bobble probe should violate the lawn to lead all the males your call tat killer canton was then asked about this and she famously joked about wiping in male server without with a cloth here we go now all i can tell you is in ranthrospect if i use it government account and i had said you know let us release everything let us let everybody in amebic to see what i did for four years we would have the same arguments that that is all i can say i ism ism not know i do not i have no idea that is why we turned it over weatwwell li with a clothes in do not know how it werestitily at all i you not a an with a cloth you remember this and the entire me dourliga ha ha hall with a cloth with clock no let with bleach bit ere you wipe the servers she was not prosecuted if she does the same stuff itsonl tromp and she does not get prosecuted and it is explicitly let off the hook could she is running for president and don't frump is being prosecutor for all that that does look the double standard of justice that doll trump is complaining about and does not stop there finest a second one can get to more in fitments looming over president trump which ironically help him in the primaries and hurt him in the general first it is time far mead of it questions ponced by good ranchers where we get to the meat of a hart headband weekly question good ranchers asked with all the recent hearings you think aliens are disguising themselves among us well if they are they are not in congress because there is no intelligent life in congress well alienstirme to guiding thmsells on

trummicle ben at good ranchers do tom good ranchers do come wanigan america neat delivered focus this is not the only criminal charge facing trump down apparently yesterday according to the nearly news barriers ritually erected outside a futon county quart house in anticipation of possible indictments involving interference in the twenty twenty presidential election futon county district to turn fanning wills once to make an me for herself plans to charge twice ins i did former presidents oral trump with crimes including witness tampering according to the uchegardian wills asked a gorge's superior sort chief forge in may to keep the courthouse free at the start of august leading a speculation trump and his surrygets might be charged in connection with attempts to overturn the electoral lose he still refuses to accept trumpet's recorded in canary twenty twenty one preserving gorge o secretary of state brad raffin'sburgo to find enough votes to keep him in the white house following his defeat if that is all they have that is not going to be sufficient because you have to show in ten to actually j fraudulently create votes or throw out votes trump saying i know that there is enough votes for me to in and aye to do its find me the lots that i know gest that goes to intent as have said a thousand times the gar tod trump intent is a real problem in proving crimes against oral trump because he is uniquely capable of convincing himself of things a he he does this all the time and what dona trump thinks in the moment is precisely with tonne trump things in the moment the the thing people love about him it is all thing people hate about him trump is fully authentic the thing he thinks right now is exactly the thing he things five seconds later it may change but in the moment he may actually believe the he won the election and it is impossible to say he's he knew he lost the election and therefore who is thing to fraudulently fine votes he cannot do that because he may very well have thought he won the election the votes existed and who just encouraging people i know it is there i know my career are somewhere in the house just find the career and that is not the same things i know the career are not anywhere in the house and know ism making you search for the career fraudulently until he steal the neighbor's carries not quite the same thing the gran jury was sworn in on rely eleventh to pure evidenceagainsts trump and his allies they move also included other communications with state officials and the selection of fix electors drummer turning re jubilant confessed in a quart filing this week he lied about gorge election workers he would accuse of trying to savage trumps at re elect efforts but the question is did julienne lie bout that to trump also if julienne admits now i knew the election was lost i was lying when i accused ex win z of doing these things if junior he said that if he lied to trump also then true would have been under the misimpression that stuff was true son trump repeated that then presumably trump would not have the intent requisite toectully charge him with a crime we still have that case looming over trump and then we also have a second case looming over trump that looming case is the canary sit incitements the jack smith is likely to bring this would make for on going federal cases and one stake it while three on going federal cases in one staircase against dona trump the state case would be the ridiculous mandarin d plan brag bringing the case against trump for campaign finance violations in new york which is absolute garbage seriously trumped up the second is the classified documents case where trump may very well have committed the crime but it's very clear that heroin canton was not charge for the exacting cru i the third case would be the fanny wills cabin gorge where again it scan be very dipole to prove the intent necessary to can vice trump of a crime unless they can actually show some sort of obstruction of justice threats to witnesses or something that and fourth would be the canary sixth case the blacksmith presumably is about to bring against on a

lawyers for trump mat thirsty with members of jacsmith's steam i had of a potential indictment over the former presenetszefforts to overturn the results of the twenty twenty election true himself confirmed the meeting in a post on his truth social network righting quote my attorneys had a productive meting with the delay this morning explaining in detail i did nothing long was advised by many lawyers and that an indictment of me wold only further to stray our country he added no indication of notice was given during the meeting s there is a lot of talk this week that here would be an indictment of trump on canary sixth charges coming down it may well be the lot of that in formation was about the new charges they were actually brought by jack smith an the class fit document's case that the canary sixth indictment is actually not right around the corner here it was not immediately clear what was discuss of the meeting though similar sit down with lovers occurred in the as before trump was indicted last month on the classfiget at document's case thirsday's meeting included trump attorning john lava said the person familiar with the case wo spoke to the a p on the condition of anonymity to describe a private gathering lour said in a fox telvishen inter view this week dis cline had done at nothing wrong the status of that secretive grander proceeding what remained in clear as by building speculation the criminal case could be near so is in clear when that is going to come down it is also in clear what exactly the charges are going to be they ben talking bat using a fraud charge which seems really really weak to me i do not see ow legally they charge him with defrauding the government usually when that is done it is it is because you faked boats or because you stool votes or something not because you made a bad legal request for the overturning of state certified boats that that's presume fall under free speech as much is is untrue theoretical they could go of for him for obstruction wit that actually have tor show the pressure witnesses which gan is pretty hear and then they've been using civil war ere a civil rights violations i do not see how any of these applies can be a very very big scratch if that is all blacksmith has to charge on two sum of of the to r cases only one of them appears to have serious legal merit at this point again we soft knockabout the georgia case because the indictment has come down gets we cannot actually adjudicate what they have got or what they are charging him with but just from the speculates we have two that not yet ben file that we have two that been file of the to that en file the manhantantiese case is absolute crap the case that has been filed an jor in florid with regard to classified documents it appears that they they have trump maybe did to wrists evidentiary speaking but politically speaking which may make a difference with the jury killer did the exact same thing mean much the donate trump in that case apparently told his lawyers he loved what galleries lawyers did and he love to do it also again if the ideates the donate dis not char tiller but they definitely charged trump that double standard of justice maybe a jury nullification play particularly in the state of floor where trump remains very very popular there is that which his led to speculation that blacksmith will file very similar charges in new jersey for trumping get a much less favorable very but ollitake is one her jest actually say no to easily scuttle the case that is the one with merit but the one with merit becomes non meritorious once you had misery coin to the next then you have the georgia case that gorge case can be very hard to prove we haven't seen the charges and fannuwills appears to be a very political motive to prosecutor and finally you have the canary six case the jack smith is thinking of charging apparently we do not know what the charges are there but those appear to be a stretch as well how doesthis great down political while obviously it benefits trump in the republican primaries because right now the argument against trump would be that these indictments hurt him against jobidon but jobidon is running super super weak right now ironically the greatest enemy of rondissancis campaign is jobidonsweet polling numbers the are the fact is that the chief appeal of rondisantis that he runs better against bison in the swing states then trump does by every available pole but if bison is running at forty percent well that in matter to much mean right now the spread on the biding trump race it has them both in the low forties mean right now mean looking at the latest arsed pee pulling average has biding up point nine percentage points on trump and last four poles are trump plus five biding plus to trump plus four biding plus for everything is within margin of error meanwhile the real clear politics pulling average on biding verse to dances has widen up one point nine points in other words he is not running all that much ahead of trump in the general elect efforts right now because biding is running low what that means s that a lot re publicans are likely to think that trump can beat mobile does not actually hurting him with republican voters these indictments also it is had in fuel to the firer because the fact is that pretty much all re publicans included think that donate trump is being targeted unfairly over a lot of these cases that put aside his bad behaviors very obvious there is a double standard of justice here that is obviously being applied and because of that it is likely to boost i in the primaries which is the reason he has incredibly durable numbers everbeady wright now is focusing in on rondissantisand to sand is under per romance in the republican primaries thus far in the re publican primary pulling but the reality is that the story is not the sand is under per for mind the story is trumps absolute our ability in this pulling trump has not dropped in any significant way below a ten point lead for months and months and months and right now his current lead on the rest of the field because remember to sandsainet the only competitor this lead on the rest the field is thirty four points he is locked and loaded i mean tat duties just cruising to the nomination right now unless something changes and that thing is not going to be the indictments ironically the indictments help trump in the primaries now well e yet convicted i mean it is pretty obvious he could be mean sure he is got a man rattan very in the alien brag case the flora case as i say before is pretty legally eiritite but there is double standard now in's up in the air we do not no its can happen is trump actually gin to be even ins i did not gorge if he is does that does that trial take place in futon county georgia an aslant is i be very bad for him obviously is here ma another case on new jersey that we do not know what the actual out come of all of this is going to be wit that said is it likely to hurt true politically inside their publican party really the answer is now because a lot of re publicans right now would rather basically used trump as they're instrument of revenge and trump knows this again trump has in an errant skill in this is his true instinctive skill trump has not an errant skill of knowing has i get a really emotionally literal connection to his base here knows that his people want him to be the revenge in in twenty sixteen he is a pulsating middle finger wall right now he he says i am your revenge i am your vengeance a now there may be bunch people in the country cur i don't want be anybody's vengeance i got or not i do not it want vengeance but i really wanted his good governments and you now may be some good policies but a increasingly in the united state i that that is a minority of people or at least it is a it is a silent majority and the silence makes a rather large difference in meanwhile again the double stander of justice is being very obviously applied because at the same it is that time that all of this pressure is been brought to bear own trump hunter bison the deck went out of its way mean truly went out of its way to try to cut a sweetheart tell with hunter there is just no question about this a mean much that as we discussed yesterdown the program hunter's plea bargain was lenient that the judging the case was are you get you willing to publicly say the plea bargain this way are oven in the rogers not that is really what happen what apparently ha happened as i said yesterday is that prosecutors tried to hide they are blanket immunity class in a crazy and on unprecedented tactic but they were exposed by the judge i did the biding done tried to let hunter off the hook but they tried to do quietly in the actual publicly available plea bargain it said nothing about immunizing bison hunter from all of these charges for an agent's registration a violations or investigations into foreign for cashing of checks an allay f that kind of stuff was not included the plea bargain it was included in the agreement for diversion on the gun charge the idea was it said in the diversion agreement that that's part of the diversion agreement he is immunized from the gun charges and anything else that was in estimated in this plea bargain over here on the tax charges n a en the was strargeges it did not say anything about that it just said he is a man from the tax charges sat the judges all i i cannot i cannot do thallic you recur to you do not even haven't agreement publicly on what it is that he is immunized from and dodoes while this is kind of embarrassing we cannot be publicly exposed to be handing hunter widen goodies while his father is president of the united states ridgscan blow up the pleabargan and at that point hunter bisons attorneys basically pulled out that that is the actual story here but be case this plea bargain was blown up by the judge now this on to reopen a bunch of cans of worms for the bison administration the be white house a corn star before investigate report for the washington examiner for example hunter bison worked closely with multiple people who disclosed their lobbying for foreign companies under the former agents registration act raising questions about whether he broke the law by not registering himself for doing the same work he lobbied yours officials along had many others who did not register under far for that for work tat clearly involved advocacy that would trigger far requirements the focus on hunter dons the foreign lobbying grew more intents this week when a judge delftware press prosecutors about whether they were still investigating the present and sun for a legend faraviolations a ayin sort that is supposed to mark the and of hunter lions legal troubles may have been the start of even more because the judge rejected that plea and now the federal prospers at we may look into far some of the individuals were actually working with but with hunter an advocating for seriema where a hunters being paid eighty three grand month to do nothing except have t e last n and bid in call his daddy on the phone some times they registered their work under far after prodding from the justice department many the people working directly with hunter and lobbying on behalf a seriema were forced to register under the far act one of the foreign agents registration act and om the doge force them too that hunter to not an that that is kind of amazing an that's pretty obviously a faravilation by hunter bison bluest strategies apparently was a a torment shots associated with berrizma twas underinvestigation by the doge why they were permitted to file foreign

with hunter a means how day hunter is not a private citizen he is at the white house he is squired along on every trip by hoiden and again he has tabs to his own daughter talking about paying is dad he is bills come on come on how stupid do they think you are again the answer is really really stupid here is green jump here si this purported is the personal matter this iran hunter ban as you knows a private citizen and and this was done in an independent wave ti investigation is an being let crompapointed prosecutor u well i mean that that is that the clearly here is nothing to see here the whitehuse was asked about pardoning hunter an that i no no no you never do that no here is a thing whenever the white house ionize are going to do a thing her's a seventy five percent shot tat venture f the lone of doing it the no was chance en yesteman a personal matter to from president r prospector is there any possibility tat president would and a a man i them her i are not just then now i give an the o case so just answered there is it the no possibility oman is a little possibility is there not they thing a pedal is gan in at worked is is what this really means and meanwhile the media doing their best to make sure that no serious questions are so a s news end s news they they are very worried about the grope folks on hunter again much re publican pouncing that is always the story the story is not the possible deepen abiding years long corrupt ion between hunter and job willows vise president out the story here is much re publican pouncing they are purring in their pouncing the color kittens over here it is a moment that is the culmination of a years long federal investigation a painful reminder of a dark chapter in the biding family and the latest scene in a loin national scandal the republicans promise is pal president band is continuing to therapy by his sin he has repeatedly said that he his proud of an eventing that e has tan nothing wrong republicans are making a clear they are not satisfied they are calling on the judge to block bat plateau insisting they will continue on with their investigations into claims that the prison end has he us his political career to personally benefit and rich and protect his family republicans not ready to move on they are still aggressively pursuing and not investigation into the younger bodies business practices there not rat why cannot they just move on why cannot they move on well maybe because he is getting sweetheart deals from his daddies do jay after presumably funding millions of dollars to the benefit of his at may maybe it is that maybes that and beseem andramichal to the same thing shefshy apologized to jobidons campaign cop chair criscoons for a mentioning hunter and tonal trumping same sentence no we could never do that let us just be clear a what is about the connect of a former president going office and the o the a is about a private citizen the sot of the current president there is he star difference wen you as they correct and echo at balatas there ta things together in in my haste there is no question thither very very different proportions they'd no comparison there is no comparison none there's no comparison between dona trump post presidency misusing classified documents and him just the killer clintonted by the way will she secretary of state and tom t n none n no similarity between that and hunter bison years long corruption scheme with his daddy no similarity according to media just let it go y meanwhile again the republicans are trying to figure out who they need to run against obit n right out dona trump is fareinaway the front runner but i have to say the the some of the attacks on discants at this point are truly skulls most scurrilous attack that were seeing right now is the absurd and ridiculous attack on the flora educational standards hair's notion promulgate by comely arris on the rest of lies in the media that the florid educational standards talk about the wonders and greatness of slavery which they lie it is not true you will recall that the original criticism is that the florid state curriculum include standards that teach quote how slaves developed skills which in some instances could be applied for the personal benefit which meant as is true that slaves being incredibly resilient and being very often people had to undergo severe harshly always severe hardship that the use that opportunity to developed skills that could benefit them personally that is not a in upholding of the virtue of slavers the opposite a but comely hairs then went out and lied about to my touch there there talking bout the magical benefits of slavery there's only one problem here is what the a p african america studies official course framework says this year quote in addition to agricultural work in slaves people learn specialized trades and worked as painters carpenters tailors musicians and healers in the north and sold once for you african amaricans used these skills to provided for themselves and others that is the exact same thing the associate presses the exact same thing as the guide lines for the state of florid and yet rondistanscan ripped up and down over all this heres tenants response to a reporter who try to come after him on this particular issue were there beneficial affects the slavery s not with the crriculents that what are you going with the correct now it the now it is not in the crrilem its very clear you have i dirt find to hundred a e is of all kinds is no that you cannot read that a you rat it what you are an you read it what is you can't i vain euros in which you have it read its ism just just making that clear that makes it very clear about the in just this sis tho slay re in this did detail any one that actually read that an then lis is the calla will now its hes line and that particular natation about the skills that is ans pit slay be not be has that the ad p course this mad that say poi other course is that mad that the point nobody said any this ism about that and decor own has people will say but this is what is use host too when hes to re doing stop that was very very clear and i would just say you no people in can read it of course this basis exactly red that is not stopping the lies from being promulgated this is why the congressional black hawk is is now pushing the whorehouse according to the a if pushing white house the justice payment and the d o e to adopt an aggressive legal strategy to scrutinize recent changes to floors black history curriculum it is an absurdity at the very least you would expect that the same republicans were defensive of donate trump and his em and his class documents is handling the it be defensive of discants when me a lie about them the very least republicans should defend each other when they are being lied about by the media this gym very disappointment him shot today him scout was to ask about this and he promptly sided with comely arris and he sided with the the congressional black hawk as here is him shot as i tot yer don ha en e in a i we e in a es e to of linen we e en i ieeeiin to e e e see e a e one on e i very o e in o e i a of i wins i i elfin e o in too en e in o are we e we e rest a lav ratings see we e en e e assign ane where by the lust was you dikulis hm in that scoping disingenuous because he fully won those what the it the story is with with florins education greculam understand its presidentialrice but done it would it would be hoof republicans to actually at some point defend people were not actually doing the wrong thing mean it is particularly true the republicans should not by back in attacks another republicans on the basis of false racial nonsense especially because again democrats are doing that nog sorry bush yesterday decide to shout at house majority whip stove scales suggesting openly yelling on the floor the stevescoleses bills are race is that it is such a joke i mean that the democrats playing the race find o literally every element is pathetic it is really bad if both sides will not we still will do that wore and are wit you old one more time to the metalline be in order ti mean ridiculous stuff there from sorry bush but that is who she is meanwhile ohanomar an other member of the execrable squad specially when on a algebra to explain that america should be afraid of white men the sh she shes a member of the tolerant diver squad is is this terrible human being i would say our contractions be more feel o of whiten across our country because they are excel t clothing to of the that within this country man she should be paying royalties to to vocal gained erythin in any case illhanomar doing this routine that we should be very fearful of whitened imagine of the races reverse you would not have to exactly who'd happen statistically speaking of course if she is talking about violent crime what she saying is not true but it is matter whether it is true or not she is very diverse person ash speaking on algzeer which of course is a place filled with diversity and and wonder and meanwhile we know have breaking news over from the face book files tho him jordan has now revealed a bunch of documents that that's been discovered by congress about the whorehouse's activities so v casebook according to the pastry journal casebook removed contents related to koa nineteen in response to pressure from the bide administration including post claiming the virus was man made according to internal come company communications deed by the waste journal the males show casebook executive discussed how they manage users posts about the origins of pandemic the administration was seeking to control nice flag company's president of global affairs wrote quote can some one quickly remind me why we were removing rather than to moving or labeling claims the code's man made and a he says we are under pressure from the administration and others to do more the a casebook v p in charge of content policy we should not have done it that is in jury twenty twenty one flag saying we shouldn't have removed this content and another v p going at we should not hove but the bine whorehouse wanted us to that male and number of other such internal company communications were obtained by the judiciary committee which has been investigating what go people's maker say is the bide administrations and proper efforts to censor america speech on social media about cove another topics whorehouse says its discussions were aimed at promoting the adoption valines and other public help goals whorehouse presser's are comrechon sierra than had we believe that social media companies have a critical responsibility to take accounts of the effects of their platform ye i know the censorship i proxy that is exactly what this was the males viewed by the pastry journal which had not ben previously reported that's of the spring an summer of twenty twenty one when thewhitehouse was putting explicit pressure on america not only thetvaccinated but not to disseminate in formationthe whorehouse disagreed with apparently after jobidon said that casebook was killing people because of the quotincled false information they saw on face book the tongue fashion cause casebook to reevaluate its policies about covenineteen contents discussions then solved high level company officials including nice flag and then so osherrel saber following the president's killing people comment the casebook v p circulated memo assessing the difference between facebook's content policies and the bid administrations demands the face book v piece e quit there is a likely gap between what the white house would us remove in what we are comfortable removing as one example the executive listed the white houses desire the company take action against humorous or satirical content that suggested the valines are save the vice present wrote quote the white house has previously indicated it thinks humor should be removed if it is premised on the valine having side effects so expect it would similarly wants e humor about facing hesitance removed flag then wrote i cancel marking a million years being comfortable with removing that i would not re commend it that is amazing the white house was literally writing to face but can be stop the jokes about to actin no jokes joking will be forbidden there be no joking about the regime amazing amazing amazing stupid again this is in fact a first men in violation when the government uses private companies as proxies to perform censorship that is not that is a violation of the first moment pretty damned clearly of time for a quick thing i and then some things that i hate sop things that i to day there is a good series on applet it is called highjack stars indies alba hots excellent levetrssall been preach everything and a the entire series is about the high jacking of a passenger air craft a from the middle east to onion and undersold a place sort of a negotiator he sorter is the need passenger on board whose attempting to to figure out what exactly is going on it is little more complex than it seems because and o spoil anything but do the some the high jackets have all turgor motives which are not clear from the beginning it is well filmed it is very tents it it is pretty clever definitely an enjoyable series that that is worth watching if you have the time his jack on apple t v worth the watch of one more thing that i sop i hate it for the employee but i it for the fact that there has to be bushbuck and bushbuck has consequences apparently an his a bushes announce he'd be laying off three hundred fifty corporate i poles on thirst after months suppose sales fueled by conservators boy cutting sunlight the firm said the lays told effect less the two per cent to eighteen thousand i please would not effect blue collar workers warehouse staff and drivers in a statement is media reporting we yo been and whitworth ex plain the companies leadership would never take these decisions lightly they are also resolve to insure our organization continues to be set for future long terms success all this has been driven by the fact that they decided over sunlight that a great way of marketing to a bunch of blue collar white men was to market a man pretending to be a woman during the entry double tournament sales have fallen thirty per cent twenty twenty three compared to the year before well done you right you the consumer good for you for demonstrating the handsome muscle and the you will not be insulted this way really god stuff in fact if you are dulia malvasia this plain you probably star threatening other companies that you might just spontaneously indorse the product freeway to shake down companies sin a secret check to dulia maladies the dulimlvany does not in dorser product because if dolomulvanian horses your product you may get your products clock by thirty per cents of its entire grow sales solid stuff there and again good job for concert you got pick examples got polorasa make examples of them this is sallinsky tact tic the lefts his musing literally for decades and if they refuse to stop using it than we also have to use at i mean the really is no other choice look a time for a couple of quick things that i hate things that i hate to day just in amazing amazing sequins of events when be ninety year old senator dial finestein started launching into an unprompted speech who is called upon to boat it was a voice vote and do she did not know what was going on to shejust started giving a speech because she is no longer with us never knows that the dial fine sin is no longer with us which means that she is just one

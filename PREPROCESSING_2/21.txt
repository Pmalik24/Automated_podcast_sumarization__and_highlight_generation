last night two disappointing things happened one of course was the release the sent compromise border security build an go through all the details of that momentarily the other was the grannies and honk starved the grannies mainly because frankly tomacdonali if we had performed fact at the grannies who had ben at least ten times better because that was a the o can it just point out at this point that trevernoa is truly an awful host trevernoa is legitimately most boring host in the history of the grannies because he is basically decided that his job at the grannies is to simply flatter the celebrities around him as suppose to doing the packager bays for you going and you insult all of the cslebries which way more entertaining for everybody else trevernoa goes in and tells much of jokes o how tailor swift helps the local economy a and everyone is beautiful aha and and billy jolts successful eh it was terrible also seedy wonder can no longer saying i say this as a longtime stay wonder van but the only is not a point all this out is because culture is upstream of politics and as much as were on to talk about the senate borderbill in just a moment the reality is that there are maybe seven to ten million people in the united states we v get to have any idea that a border bill is even om the table or being contemplated whereas there will be hundreds of millions o people who'll listen to all the garbage music that emerges from the grannies in the messaging put out from the grannies does not mean that everybody listens to what all these dolts in holly would have to say about politics it does mean that they do have some impact we begin with a brief review of the grannies will start with this the fashion at the grannies these people are not you they are not connected to lives that you lead they do not follow your moral structures they are not interested in promoting the morality that you wish to teach your children and yet if you leave them with access to your kids we you tube or a i tunes or anything else it will in fact have an impact on your kids this is a human this human is called dona cat which i do not understand because she is not a cat apparently i have been informed by reliable sources that she literally named herself after pot and a cat not getting you because he did not come out of her coming er mom's behold i shall name her dona cat a she obviously is not only a a class at in every way she also is just wearing a sheer body suits that does not even attempt to cover her nipples because this is where we are right now i sum she can afford the entire dress if not then we should you know tiffecan start o fund to actually by the extra two inches of cloth that it would take to cover her anti nipple but apparently not because free the nipple because liberation because this is what holly would wants and it was not of course just dona cat the idiocy any cravats showed up i do not understand why people bother to hear clothes that are not clothes again that this looks is though he got into some sort of mad mass world strange bordello l fight it'd i do not ye this i this full hunger games count i always enjoy it when people penny cravats where giant crosses surely jess would approve of this outfit he probably figured out how address this in church at for those who cannot see he is wearing what appears to be leather pants and the a leather shirt but most of the short es missing he is got felon sleeves but it is not covering anything below maybe his breastbone and due i not i feel we should read distribute in the name of social justice his sleeve material to his chest just for the safety of all involved a deny cravats again these of the people who make the culture the your children imbibe and then of course we have billy wish who apparently is dress the of pot smoking girl from hogwartzs i know what exactly has happening here her her hair used to be green now her hair now that she is declared herself queer her hair is red i know what the corelation is right there i wearing some most deliberately ugly clothes you will ever a case o these are the people who have decided to beautify america with their art the it is more on this in one second first we are experiencing a lot of goblin stability as we plunge into primary season how are you protecting your family in the midst of all this chaos the fact is there is one asset that is withstood famine war political an economic up heavy kidding all the way back to biblical times that would be gold it is not too late to diversified old array or for one say

it is version o morality and it is version of morality is all he's were make it a better p except that there is no actual healing of the world it is mostly just absolute cowardice and foolishness any leno she was a supposed to pay tribute to people who had passed away during the last years and tum they they did a bit in favor of a cease fire in gaze finding to your any leno on a sense fire in gaze well by the way a hundred and forty hostages who are still being held by mamas this wining to here from our or cultural betters here e fire a she is is artist for sees fire peace and raises her fest a mean first of all this is the inmemorium segment lady a is a denies by this who yours must we paying tribes all the people who died and him she is calling for a cease fire in got annylenics he outgo rognaless in to any tennis now and then of course you'd the same sort of idiocy coming out of the recording academy c yo garvey mason junior a he did in entire stick where he proclaimed that the nova music festival massacre in which compass slaughtered hundreds of people at music festival in southern israel they did it cause they were news but instead because the music industry is all that watering morality towns the point where it makes no sent effectively he makes the case the people were slaughtered because they were at a music festival as supposed to because they were news which is heard since this did not happen in the middle of say montane it happened in the jewfish state in ancismentic fashion that is what it was about for all of the a for all of the white to premises all right conspiracies who think that holy would is cuticle run by the news of just point out her that holy would cannot even say that attacks on news are attacks on news they instead have to make it about attacks on music lovers very one of us the matter where were fro is united by the sceriexperienc of must at brings us together nothing else can and that is why music must always be our same pace when that is violated that strikes of the very sort of who we are we felt that a the both con concern all and peris we felt that at the mantaary ana in inland we felt that t the rout navy one harvest music fest lost things and on a toter we felt that it gat when we heard the tragic news from the supernova music festival for love that over three hundred and sixty music fans lost their lives and another forty were kuldnots that they and all the trait they the o follow have been awful for the worlds o bear as we mourn the loss of all innocent lives we live in a world to lie the morals loveless i could discuss that o he stop stop this fool stop him an they can the lack of moral clarity is just insane right here first fie should point out that three of the attacks that he talks about three of the four attacks our comic errata's in the manchester concert explosion was in his comic terror suiciboming in may of twenty seventeen the botoclonterratack was in tack in is on atterratack an of course what just happening southern israel is a is a terror attack and would happen another israel is a specifically antisemitic terror attack an yet this ideas there is the whole world and then linking that with what happened in loss vagus where we still do not have a motive by the way an the weirdest mas shooting in the history of the united states is superstate and everyday we mourn life of an or you could you notice a moral stand against the people who murder red music goners who happened to be jewfish because they were jewfish in thenesroblet we cannot even do that again no moral clarity whatsoever from the recording artists shocker o a then you hade the obnoxious one of the most obnoxious things about the artists at the e at the grams is the absolute self gentleness we begin with miles gyrus miles gyrus has an awful song called flowers shed two songs last year that we are both big heats one was called flowers and this was all about how independent ladies do not need no man and then the other song that miles cars had last year was it one called use to be young which is actually a more interesting song because it to all about how basically she blue her youth of course the one the makes or more famous in the one they given war to his flowers which is a really really garlic song my favorite part of this is where she assumes everyone in the concert hall noses fer lyrics because she is just famous ever everyone knows the words these people there tiresome also i do not know she high jacked her hair from a nineteen eighty's man can last night very heard look for miles gyrus heroin to why are you acting you and the song cause no one because we do not know you are song and then there was tom j s who decided to do a full cone and show up on stage who is gain some sort of lifetime achievement word impost and em an you decided to talk about how the academy was was not paying enough attention to been say yes you are right beans has not gotten enough attention in her life clearly the lack of attention on beanie is destroying her career what can we do to help beyond say here we go in no one embarrass this young lady wit ye on mad in every owning every one out wen a year even by yo on metric pet of in were think about the out grams never one out went year eve every were no ye that that is it ye it is true m we we have to yes it beans the great

and is ramp dot come slashed chipper cards issued by button bank and cultic bank members f t i see terms in conditions apply meanwhile speaking of people who are absolute self obsessinself hunter tailor swift i know that we are all supposed to in i take sides in the tailor swift war and a few things can be true a oms one is i do not believe her in anything that she does i find her entirely in authentic literally everything she does feels it has been scripted downs to the minutest to detail including last night second i do not care whether she is dating traviscelcy and i hope that for the sake of the country to get married now babies that all these thirty one year old feminist with seven cats can decide that marriage is actually good for them and we can have the tailor swift baby boom that would be good for america i also do not believe that she is some sort of deep state sit of if she is a deep state sailing to pic some od who can act because tailors in the most awkward moment last night she wins album of the year and she gets up and then promotes her next to album and she is sold she is clearly does not care about being there she is clearly does not even want to be there whenever they cuts her and she is dancing the audience she is dancing wood dance in the audience which is to say awkwardly and with a sense of rage about having to be in this place at this time she gets upon stage and she basically as i got cab hare pick out another trophy i have twelve of these already or thirteen of these whatever man an is put this one in the crash with all the rest f them also i have a new album it'll be releasing the cover later by i count to they think you o the fan by telling you a secret that have been kinin from ye for the last to years which is that is am s a value mortar poets department a cover right now that tat thank you i she does not love you shoes not care about you she does not know you i'lleve ever in met my favorite cut away actually here was miles gyrus the cut away least i is in the elects really really funny the the cut away miles by miles was mi cost cannot believe this lady and honestly point for miles gyrus for that then she released the actual cover and a the cover is of course a lady half clad in bad because this is hollywood and its called the tortured poets department all's fair in love and poetry new album the tortured poets department out aril nineteen eleven point eight million likes almost immediately on the insults oh oh orcas these are some of her brilliant lyrics some of her brilliant lyrics quote and i ends her into evidence my tarnish coat of arms my us is acquired bruises my talismans and charms the tick tick tick of love boys my veins of pitch black in all's fair in love and poetry sincerely the chairman of the tortured poets department oh she's the tenthgray girl and shes start for and again i hope she gets married to traviscelsy and has babies and grows the fop because i cannot stand any more of reading the lyrics of her albums that read a seventeen year old girl made another album about how tortured she is in how sad she is but really inside she is deeply happy but she is really sad do not care it is stupid at that is your music industry that is hoer game's up take now on to more serious matters the bide administration is none the mind that therein is that america at do not trust them on emigration the reason america do not trust them an emigration is because they have basically declared that they are in favor of open boarders robin is currently pulling at i i get you not thirty seven per cent has the thirty seven percent approval rating that is not a reelectrating not remotely on immigration he is deeply underrothirson enbysee pull by the way that same obese pull has him losing to donate trump by five points forty seven to forty two an it has republicans ahead on the generic ballet by four points right now the are very bad numbers for jobidon not only that again on immigration the america people do not trust jobidon and they thing that he has the unilateral ability to actually stop the mass of wave of legal immigration that we have ben seeing because in fact he does and what they believe correctly is that the bide administration has made in overt decision that they wished the border to remain open and son he protests and he says they does not actually have the ability to shut the boarder no one believes him especially when you have allahandromaoricus the head of the department of home can security who is currently theoretically can be i peach by the house suggesting that we actually need more migrants in the united states he actually said this at duringthe interview with the car times what would not it be more orderly wouldn't it be responsible governments to be able to deliver a lawful pathway to fill what we have which is a labor see and cut the exploitative smugglers out and give the individuals pat to arrive at lawfully safely in in orderly way to perform labor that we need they can sentiments his home they can return home in their work is done is not that an element of a workable immigration system and ut when asked what what ism hearing you say is you would to expand legal pathways in order to relieve some of the pressure on the southern borderer people common legally and he said yes and to fulfil one of the golds for emigration system yet they be yes to more migration according to alehandro maracas and the dunt early care other its legal or illegal ad ends of being basically the same thing this is why presumably jobidon continues to keep the border open now the game that democrats ere playing is their trying to get republicans to take ownership of the open boarder the way they are publicans to take ownership of the open border is to craft e quitting by partisan emigration bill that when things continue to sock they can then say republicans helped craft the bill it is their fall now all the political dynamics are moving against democrats democratic representative but rob agendas of new jersey he says that support for nasty hortation has now doubled which of course is true because this is what happens when you decide you let in literally six to seven million legal immigrants over the course of the last three and a half years minimum then you stand on pol at this lying thirty one percent of america support poor rising mask potations of all people living in this country a likely that is to from fifteen percent in twenty nineteen the language of tucker to pressed an baton all the way on down is that n wore about polling and politics or you believe its actually language about policy i think it is a lot of o polite except goon t e last several years people see the situation at the border and the responding to the republican narrative around whats happening at the border is not there is a global migration challenge between global a climate change between file governments and our hemisphere there is a chalone at meet you redress at the rectus an also how its appearing at our border but when you look at what republicans whet re pekans talk about when you talk bout a massing vision you here texts republicans talking about when you talk about things o policemen theory thenar things that have that's gain t hold in our electric is thatuat republicans are talking about because they think its if they an if they can come oilcans ferity they that dangerous in of that i pelicans will trust them when you see the rise an support for pastry potations it is in repairs to a dangerous republican narrative oh is the dangerous publican narrative that is the problem okay not the gigantic way of of illegal migration by the way every one knows would is the facilitating you legal immigration lit is hm on this in just one moment first nobody likes to talk about life interns but it is incredibly important you need to include it in your financial planning this year start shopping now with policy genius find the right policy to protect your family to day give yourself the peace of mind that comes it knowing that if something word to happens you your family can cover

dot comslash apparel or quick that linin the description that your free life insures souls we how much you could save that is policy genius dot come slash paper and we have life interns that you should have life insure issue but a policy genius dot come slash aero see how much you should save perhaps the funny is media moments of the last seventy two hours was seamen was talking to experts on immigration and they are talking about the fact that some of the legal immigrants who beat up cops last week actually would go and commit crimes in new york and then theywoud go spend the money in florid and then they would come back to w w york and the question was asked we in an anchors why they coming back to new york whin that to stay on in flora and a the illegal migration expert john miller whose the chief lawn horsemen an intelligence annalist for sent he says ism the reason thy comeback to ne york is cause they will not be deported if the in new york and the sin an anchors are oh oh that is awkward its individuals i went over there rashes yesterday multiple charges grandlarsony robbery attempt at robbery grandlarsny grandlarsny a this particular cooperated on mopeds and shooters they were doing organized retail raft they were doing snatches on the street i finds i pads clothing on and forth i one of them that they are still seeking as ten charges on one day because he is part of a patin that is been going on and ism looking at the dates that there rest started which is probably close to when they got here the only been there couple of months wat the detectives are telling me is they have cruise here that operate in new york do all their stealing then go to flirted to spend the money and then come back on won they to stay and stealing flirting that it is the you go to jail oh oo then the sin hangs a oh you mean being loosen immigration means that margins take advantage of that now that is softly crazy oh ow that is that super awkward well a him jeoffreys of course at tempting to get republicans take ownership of this the house minority leader he wants the r publicans stake this up in the house because you realized i get jolly half a republicans an all democrats to not in favor of this and jeffreys was asked marngjus this aggregate what is in this bills this giant border bill is not actually border bill it contains but sixty billion dollars an are you crane contains fourteen billy dollars and aide who israel it contains as we will see three billion dollars and aid to goa which presume we will go directly into derris pockets because that is out works we send aid two places there governed by terrorist and it give some money four the border twenty billion dollars for various word priorities including by the way a bunch of money to quaint quit non profit groups to facilitate ill legal emigration services and were down at the border and help just tall you these non profit groups are literally facilitating i legal migration out of the border the that they have signs at the borders in goes way to avoid border patrol come over to of it they basically are creating sanctuary pathways into the united states in any case heres a keep jeoffreys trying to are clam that we to pass all this is a package the reason he wants that of course is because the boll here is to get republicans to sign off on bad border bills that they cannot run on it in the twenty twenty four election here he was and we need a comprehends to bill you saw the speaker yesterday say that hes can bring a stand alone israel bill to the floor of the house you response what well value hate that legislation over the next the days i then on tuesday morning house them crossbill meet as ta conchas you might be open to it oh to these the way forward as a relates to america national security priorities clearly we have got to support israel ability to defend itself against homos and to feet homos we also need to make sora that we are doing everything possible to bring the hostage is home including america citizens and to be able to sera humanitarian assistance the pakistan ins civilians who are in harms way in cast the no fault of their own beyond that we also have to address the also security priorities of the america people in other parts of the world first than foremost certainly to support in brains effort to pus back against resent aggression also to support or allies in the in the pacific ti on japan south care the legislation being put forth by house republicans does none of that the responsible approach it is a comprehensive one to address america name security print of course the opposite the actual responsible approach would to to approach each one of these bills is a separate giant billies are big bills and in fact that is something that republicans are currently pressing sir republicans very early ominous process tried to pass a fourteen billion dollar aid to israel bill they did by having press tacks offsets and the goal was to put in one place in order you spend in another an how's responsible bill but democrats rejected it and they did on the basis that they did not the offsetting stuff now the republicans are lo say will call your bluff we will put forward a bill in the house that just pass of the are israel reject tat at your own panel which seems to me smart politics because again of democrats r in a clam the the actually support israel the face of genecitle terrorism then presumably thy would be able to do that without any preconditions just pass the clean bill just do it if democrats will not that suggest that perhaps they have another set of priorities o case what exactly is in this border bill your being told a pack of lies about this border bill ay your being told for example that it ends catch in release have read the bill three hundred seventy pages long there is may be forty or fifty relevant pages lot of i is tat you crane aide a lot of it is about crack downs on on drug cartels that re that are traffic in retinal and all the rest but the see border provisions do not in fact end catch and release there is nothing in there that for example requires attention of everybody until they can be fully a dedicated in a cart and there is no building of giant facilities that would allow for the mass attention of people play it also leaves in place the call floor settlement which suggest that children cannot actively be detained with parents which means the children get released into the country and then in order to reconnect the parents you actually in up releasing the parton o the country to as well organ goes through some of the provisions in this bill the bill is not good the bill may be slightly better than the way that jobidon is currently practicing but it certainly does not mandate anything from jobidon that he is not already able to do under current law it is go through it right now because again most of the people who can be commenting the bill of not act read the bill spent this morning reading the all it is more this not just once second first if your most america it cant struggling to make ends meat everything is a lot more expensive than it used to be by the time you pay the bills fill up your cargo grocery shopping there might not be them much left you are laying out your creticard more than you and last i check your average critical intrastate for america it is now twenty four per cent which is in sane some get behind on that creticardett get a problem of the on home i want you to call my friends in america financing right now interest rates have finally dropped into the fives that is the lowest they have ben for a long tune call america financing and talk about their refinance options they save their customers and average of eight hundred fifty four but to month by tapping into their home equity and wiping out high interestocratic hardest think about it a her fifty four bucks that is a ten thousand dollar raise every year what a relief that could be for you and your family do not wait to take control hour finances the rates might not last long act today call america financing and eight six six seven to one three three zero zero and if you call to day you might not have to make next months mortgage payment that is eight six six seven to one thirty three hundred ornis america financing dot net animals wont two three three four allies conto me visit or eight p a for rates in five started six point four zero six per cent for well call i barbers c eight six six seven to one thirty three hundred for details about credit costs and terms here is where it begins one it first has two point three billion dollars for refuge and entrance assistant activities a theater the are currently legal that would be a two point three billion dollar give way to many of the non profit organizations that i was talking about and by the way down to bore some of the non profit organizations are actively facilitating you the immigration not just people across the border and then they want o disappearing the interior until these non profits literally just bring them food bring them water shuttle them into the interior of the country and there ben pretty serious allegations that some these non profits are outright in gage ne legal activities helping to break down the border wall when border patrol is not actually present there is about three billion dollars for u s a id and goes as i sat is notches aide for israel it is also aid for goa the is a provision in there that requires u say id give report to congress about how much of that age is being redirected in stolen by commons or other terra scraps there is nothing there that man dates to cut off in fun if a certain percentage of those fun and up being handled by terrorists it has three point for billion dollars and hiring an associated cost for you a citizenship and emigration services including a hundred twelve million dollars for non personal operations including transcription services peresemn we for all the judicial hearings and five hundred million dollars for facilities and forty nine million dollars for training related expenses what exactly with those trenuralated expenses be whole for border patrol they would have to be trained to include escalation strategies and methods i dentifrice screening and responding to vulnerable populations the i pact to for security operations on natural resources thing they got som environmentalists lectures the border patrol and they have to be lectured on quote relevant cultural social racial and religious training we have diversity training for the border patrol officers very very interesting stuff now the core of the borer provisions of this bill do not an caching release and they create a sort of mandatory quod quit shut down they aren't actually shut down the shuttling into the country they just shuttle everybody over to ports entry here is what it sasin a lot of this is the direct text to the bill section two thirty five b under the bill quit non custodial proceedings this the part read it new at isn't understand ism hearing from various centers including curse anima that this ends catching release i do not understand how under section to thirty five be quote the secretary based upon operational circumstances they refer in alien applicant for admission for proceedings described in the section if the alien indicates an intention to apply for protection determination or expresses a credible fear of persecution or torture cay not get these be non custodial proceedings as you make understand the language of english custodial proceedings would be were you get held non custodial proceedings a re you get released into the interior of the united states in fact it says that clearly aliens referred for proceedings under the section shall be released from physical custinot may be released shall be released from physical custody and process in accordance withe procedures described in the section an adult alien including ahead of household wo has been referred for proceeding under the section shall be supervised under the alternatives to detention program of you less it migration in customs enforcement immediately upon release for physical custody and continuing for the duration of such proceeding what would that amount to it could be house or attic could be tat we put an ankle bracelet on it could be that we just releasing into the interior relit come back at a certain date the secretary shall shirts o the greatest extent practicable that the refer of a family unit for proceeding under the section includes all members of such family to our traveling together you should try to if one person claims asylum you can treat them all is if they have been claimed asylum and they're going to release them into the interior again none of the supplies to unaccompanied miners if an alien receives a posit if protection determination there immediately issued employment authorization if they are dedicated that they have refuge you status immediate before they leave the before they leave the building they get a card that effectively says they can work in the united states an of course been over ti floras which says that their campy any family separations that remains in place as well now section thirty two o two of the bill actually loosens the definition of what it means to claim asylum there is been some talk about the strengthening the definition of what it means to claim asylum will talk about that provision one second but the baseline clam of asylum actually gets loosen here by definition section thirty to o two said you have the declare a credible fear right the original definition that gets change i used to say that there had to be a significant possibility that the alien could establish eligibility for asylum cay that was changed to a reasonable possibilities now in order clemisilemu just have to show a reasonable possibility that you could establish eligibility for asylum this bill actually loosens the definition of a credible fear t she makes it easier to claim asylum not harder now the alien does have to show to receive actual asylum that there are no reasonable grounds for concluding the alien could relocate to another location in the alien's country of nationality or in the case of an alien having no nationality another location in the aliens country of last initial residence what is that mean that means that if you travel up from honors to the united state you have to show number one if you want actual legal asylum you have to show that you couldn't have just relocated in side hundorus and two they you could not have relocated in mexico as you were passing through mexico right that that that would be the definitions but that does not solve the problem because of course the vast majority people who are claiming asylum are not doing legally even the definition of asylum is somewhat irrelevant if people are simply coming claiming that they have a reasonable possibility of establishing asylum then released into the interior and all of this of course depends on the actual implementation because if you have a bunch o border patrol officials who've been instructed by the ad ministration to be really loose about how they apply these rules it does not matter what the losses they will just allow people through and then those people never show up again people here saying this is a strict borderbill are focussing in on the redefinition of reasonable grounds right to that that if you actually claim asylum and then you show up for your secondary date or you show up and you say i have a credible fear of returning o my home country that you have to make a reasonable showing not at not at again a significant possibility a reasonable possibility you cannot relocate you country of origin or the cannot stand mexico yen all you'd have to say presumably is i cannot stain my country of origin because i have a credible fear that in my country of origin anywhere i go those track me down and kill me how exactly are you going to indicate get is the asylum offcergan ta say i do not believe you how dos that work and if you say orca what you could theoretically stay in vehicle ins t none snout the drugcar tells can a follow me to mexico is that enough are we just shifting around definitions s that people can continue to escape into the interior bottom line is this if you wants shut the border you need to do one of two things are both one remain a mexico no one cross is the border until they have been effectively eradicated as a true refuge you stay in mexico until get your court at that is what don trumphaddon place and your by navigated it two if you shop on the border anywhere it going to remain a mexico we have vast detention facilities and you and the detention facilities and you are admitted or ejected but long as we are not doing either of those first two the definition of asylum becomes almost o relevant and heroin lies the rob organ to get to the con what emergency provisions of the build that people are hanging their hats on to claim this is strong on the border in one second first valentines day is coming up fast germ's has the perfect gifts to surprise your better half whether you are hoping for him or for her germ's has a bundle

border security bill that a supposed to make conservatives feel more comfortable is burn is is what is called border emergency authority here is how the system works and hearing a lot about this particular system in the media to day some actual read you the sections from the big that a relevant tactless going on first the secretary there is of homeland security may activate the border emergency authority if during a period of seven connect cutie days there is an average of four thousand or more aliens are encountered each day a gas just to get that strut you are talking about a seventy period in which you average four thousand border en counter a day that by the way is actually in under camp because it swill discuss in one second the way they actually do the border account does not apply to children from non contiguous countries i e mexico or canters that border count does not include kid to a arriving from honors or all salvador for example it does not apply to aliens not from mexico or canada and it does not count roadways for people who simply rush across the border and we do not actually arrest them at the border the word patrol does not actually encounter them that does not count if you have a thousand people two thousand people whore entering between ports of entry and they are just escaping into the interior and we know there there because we have cameras all along the borderhave been down of the southern border as you can seel for a daily whiter we at a whole documentary on this those people do not count toward the count there is a wild under count but you are at four thousand a day right which again is going to amount to over the ports of a year one point for six million people entering the country if you great four thousand a date then these secretary is allowed to activate yes this border of word emergency authority the secretary must activate the border emergency authority if during a period of seven consecutive calender calender days there's an average of five thousand or more aliens are encountered every day that would be one point it two five million people per year that is the cut off point where the secretary must activate emergency authority what is that mean that that emergency authority all right now if you arrive at say the san magelgate which is where i was in that video down in arizona that is not a port of entry if you arrive at the port of entry border patrol will still pick you up and there is the cud detentions there a mile away your process within seventy two hours ruin the country the border emergency authority would allow the secretary of hogan security if therefore four thousand and mandate that the secretary of homansicurity if there are five thousand tell everybody you cannot be process were you have to be process at a local point of entry are you've to go to a port of entry in order to be process now it is in clear whether a you show up at the border bore patrol simply drives you there maybe maybe the now you are on america soil are you pushed back across the bondage drop you back across thither side of the gate or do they now put you into boy and instead of them bussing you a mile away they simply buss you to the local port of entry when it comes to the port of entry during any activation of the border emergency authority the secretary shall maintain the capacity to process and continue processing a minimum of one thousand four hundred inadmissible alienceach calender day he cannot shall down to both ports entry hest actually continue at a minimum to alow fourteen hundred people a day into the country via these ports of entry an now dos that solve the problem somehow ism failing to see how it does if and then is it turns out they pop a bunch of holes in the supposed emergency authority for example the secretary shall not activate the border e emergency authority during the first calender year from ore than two hundred seventy calender r days during the second calender your for more than two hundred and twenty five calender days during the third calender year fro more than a hundred eighty calender days even if you're getting fifteen thousand people o day in your two you can only activated for tweundred twenty fie days during your three for a hundred an eighty calender days half the year it simply the usandth apply there is no way to actually maintain this you cannot it is not lick open ended border authority to shut it down fave five thousand a day even to day that only applies for two hundred seventy calender days why precisely it let let say the ear the drunkard he's why not facility the people will not be process red there not process because they are literally stopped from processing if the border security if it is shot and portsventry cant process everybody let us say you the drunkard hells why not now bring it ten thousand people a day do it for two under seventy days and they can do this just do it every day five thousand six thousand people a day they get rejected for two hundred seventy days now's exhausted the border authority now i cannot use emergency authority any more see still its to process everybody who shows up or keep it at five thousand and one and if you give it a five thousand and one for tenter seventy strait days then on day two seventy one of the year you fled the border with twenty thousand people the drugcar tells are capable of doing this they run the border have been down at the board they have literal drug cart help drones that are flying over the america side of the border and monitoring every specific border patrol agent according to this bill the secretary shall suspend activation of the border emergency authority not later than fourteen calender days after the date on which there is during a period of seven consecutive calender days in average of less than seventy five per cent of the en counter level use for activation in other words the border the border emergency authority has to be then remote within fourteen days of the numbering down to one thousand two hundred and fifty border en counters per day batty that is by law what is more there is another hole that is poke in this which is if the president fines it is in the national interest to temporarily suspend the border emergency authority the president may direct the secretary to suspend the use of the border emergency authority on an emergency bays us the pet jobidin let say that that mayor's is man dated they are five thousand a day for seven days he is man dated to kick in the emergency authority biding can suspend it bad can say not do not want you to do it now the secretary shall suspend the border emergency authority for not more than forty five calender days within a calender year notwithstanding on any limitations on the use of authority that means that the secretary can than overrule the presidents after forty five days when you talk about two and on seventy days what you really mean is if the president used as authority you are a ready down to two hundred and twenty five days in your two you are already down two one hundred eighty days and in your three you're already down to a hundred and thirty five days that border emergency authority could even be used even if they wanted to all by the way all border cases all cases under this bill and now no longer be resolved by the fifth circuit fort of appeals which is a much more contra t give circuit court instead it kicks all of them over to the desex circuit court of appeals why why is the deny circuit sort of appeals they left when court ante they will do exactly what democrats want them to do does this thing shut the border in any serious way there lot of people claiming this the very harsh border put for control method it does not man date nearly anything the thing that it mandates is not in end to catching rules the thing that it mandates is not in fact a lower sandman basically makes the new supposed cap one point eight million and it really is not one point ait million it is well an excessive to million it does not count any the roadways easily the new normal is one point right million people are saying well but that is a shall that is that is where the the secretary come security my must do the thing but he can do it under yes but there you no win secretormaorchost to kick the thing in that forty nine hundred ninety nine ism not is see no evidence that he will more than that he can potholes in this every which way the gull here for democrats is very clear get republicans to sin on to the bills that can then claim that anything that happens after this is somehow also republican's fault that is the grown does it create any long standing serious changes to the system the only longstanding series change to the system that would be a positive plywood would be the changes to the actual standard for asylum i doubt would actually be a a good change to the system but is that worth buying into jobidon simply applying the law as he sees fit here anyway again political ownership of the issue verses a change to law jobidon is bucking the law is at currently stands his he an a formative obligation is president of the united states then forceporta law he is not doing it passing more law is not going to change that fact that simply conto make republicans politically complicit in whatever jobidon does with the border ay the reason that cordon is doing all this is because he feels the threat from his left he feels threats he is trying to basically have the baby with this border bill that is going nowhere by the way speaker of the house my johns says the thing as he men coming ut for a votes stevscollys now when i in bring is up for a vote it to bad bill were not doing it the reason that jordan is pushing far to the left on things a migration is because he truly believes the only way's on win is to got out he left wing was this a wrong calculation by him the way that is gone win if he does whin is by winning a few rule white lots an wining over suburban women that is the actual way that he winds the problem for jordan is that he is a bad landed it jobidon yesterday he suggest is is the weirdest race that he has ever been and while i know join the clubbed color ism feeling good about where we are i really am the folk sir or starting focus in an be i we reneagainst sir hes the is not foreignythin he is against everything o mess thorn the weirdest cannot any evnisseen worse tho e terms es behave then the last time it twin e went ism ism this is this the weariest race hes ever been in i mean it'll give him that is the superweard race but tom trump is by the way upright now i mean the poles are what the poles are and again downs from sortie weird intractable nature is one of the reasons that i think people this plater look i the distracted guy rat than the got whose later focus on doing dumb crap in donate trump spent the weekend actively telling people that he looks elves press ism not getting he actively did that he went on his truth social page and he put out in actual image of himself in which he is mashed up with elves and he says that some people have been telling ma look elves and most america to find id rather have that then what you have currently gemma send be chives at a very in comfortable interview the black voter where the black loderwas a the economy is founder trump and i the economy right now to no you are hearing that is there believe your permit who were he's go without o er consider for shore lot o my paper poorly by so we over we owe of e what is well for i for press and chop a cot allée all an the i chose by the y well we we all w by e we ware we shall at that is hair that only thing that ut her fallen ale a are a in e that o cool we had one by the way many of the issues that have been raised against on true including classic document stuff the problem is the jobidon is done the same sort of stuff according to axis president biding steam is now concerned that special council robot hurds investigation inubidin's handle and classic documents will hurt his reelect campaign bi needs don aspect criminal charges but they believe that hers report will include em embarrassing details possibly with photos on how biding store documents because again class i documents were in his garage and also any private offs that he used if the entire rip on donate trump is that he is very careless of class documents because he put boxes on the stage an farrago well i mean dad's awkward for jobidon according to axis anchovy coly of former senior at biker to magic garland caught the biding steam attention recently when he wrote the biding in those in his orbit had known to blame but themselves for garland to phoning a special council coley said began seem was not initially transparent about the documents and put garland into know wind situation this could certainly hurts go bison's real campanulas again one of the points he is using against trump he she is irresponsible the adultery back in theroomand the i turns out he is done a lot the same stuff the donate trump has done and this is why he keeps doubling down on the on the wild left wing policy he is now pandering to the worst parts of his was ape that receives enormous blowback over the weekend but happens t be trues by

and therefor lose the election and all he needs is cover from the media which he is getting the entire ne york times now dedicated to the proposition that the crisis in the least was not cause aromas actively attacking and murdering some twelve hundred news and kidnapping to hundred forty others that the cries in the middle east is israel fighting back against mamas and literally every day there just plastering on the front pages the suffering of the poor people of gaze all of which by the way could be ended right now allcomas has to do is walk out of the tunnels with their hands up with the hostages in to release the hostages go into exile and all of the violence stops tomorrow that is the end of the islands and then when rebuilding face but the near time's not calling for that they want israel to agree to a cease fire leaving mamas in place leaving them alive which is insane which is we than you times is putting out piece is about suffering in gaze with all sort to the pictures in the hospitals and all the rest of the sorstuff again the people responsible for the sarcomas all this is terrible i was aren't happening else whishes it were not happening the is rally population these ray government i know that cause they were not doing this from two thousand five to two thousand and twenty three none of these pictures were available in two thousand five to two thousand twenty three we because i was not a masbombarbment a military arias of gaze because gaze despite the fact that they were in fact comas firing rocks in israel had not slaughtered twelve hundred news meanwhile niches kissoff doing his usual ration what can we possibly say to the children of outhit is literally title of spies from the execrable neck kristov over the your times what can be possibly say to the children of goa i mean the thing that you can say to the children of goa is make your parents should not have supported a terror group and maybe you parents right now should expel that terror group from their leadership maybe that would be the solution nick kristov says my government is on the side engaged from y present widen has referred to is indiscriminaboming this not the same is deliberately targeting civilians but this time as a tax arum helping to paid for those bombs not youvebeen paying for bombs of indiscriminate bombing for a while because youveben spend sending aid was an america taxpayer i have too we have been sending aid try the goa strip the camps and all that aid wen to building terra tunnels and rockets e been paying actually for indie truly in discrimna bumming for quite a wile but this of course is the is the the idea here is that israel is supposed to essentially are emotively stop its war against comose which of course is ridiculous o the democratic party is caught between a rock and a hard places on the one hand there still some democrats who realize that hey comose should be defeated on the other hand they are wetted to this peculiar idea that unless israel is forced into concessions to terrorists then middle eastern conflicts becomes more broad and inevitable which of course is a lie it is a lie you don't createsminleation conflict weakness as always perceptions of weakness our death in the middle east an it is the united states attempting to make israel weaker by restricting their activities against goa that is the entire thing you cannot hold these you thoughts at once you cannot say the you wish terrorism to lose and also that you wish israel to negotiate with terra you cannot do those wo things the that is exactly the by administration is doing it is on the one hand you hakim jeoffreys correctly saying that the united state should not put conditions on allies defending themselves that is correct about on the ideisreal several members progressive members of your cocks have said that they handsome conditions now a mad is really cleangyour fellow new york condom notindia a cousin courts when you say to that other has ta right to to defendiself and also of course the responsibility to conduct it is war in the man or consistent with the ins anise the rules of conflict we should not put conditions on the ability of any of our allies to defend themselves puttictly against the brutal terrorist resume famous he is right about that but at the same time y of jakesullivan the national security adviser saying we needed two states solution and they keep saying this over and over as tough you can just wishes states in to existence which is totally crazy with whom with whom there is no government that ought to be a government of any self respecting state there is no de radicalized population the you radicalize population in place the gazastrip and less bangs twenty percent of the population maximum maximum but that busy talking about you see any prospect at all these seems to have bee ruling it out prep premonition and who of some kind of a long term dead that leads to a palistanian state the you es position on this is very straightforward the only long t am answer to piece in the region to israel security in the region is it costate solution with israel security guaranteed a palistonian state that also has a security guarantees for israel that is what we are on to keep working for we were doing that before october seventh i think since october seventh the need to work on that i has only increase and we would to deliver an out that is over railing the lesson cremsary that is crazy we stop in there that is not when he says that since october seventh we need to give more concessions to the people who actively did the terror attack that is preemptive surrender that is crazenat's all kids attacks the united states on in eleven and he us government immediately says what can we do for youasama what areyour demands you not our basis out of the out nasality of it maybe we can do that we ans it accelerate that we n make that happen for you wat is it what in the actual xenia and the answers beaus n ornathiona of plan t bialies they do not their plan in the the least is to puts around nonsensically because they do not understand the middlemost in any real way shape perform and wat that amounts to is randomly lashing out at empty buildings and occasionally hitting a camel in the ass yelling at the rallies that they probably should kill fur commons members or that urban war is really bad and war is bad ya every one knows and then making weird concession signals to iron this is their actual plan train abash called jakesaldan on this she's you keep saying that you do not want entering original conflict is this already original conflict or one's terror arms extend to syria a rock lebanon yeomen the the is it litter all over the place just yesterday the youesan you ka i responded to what the rebels and yamen there engaging in retain attacks on shipping in the had we there are near daily strikes between israel and halala and matodetitruded and the war between israel and mammoth my college peter burg and scarlet pen ad to o this conflict involve ten country is at least for major terriscroupt if he it is already original conflict well tan of what i would say is that these are distinct but related challenges for example what is happening in the red sea is obviously to a certain extend a trigger by what is happening in gaze but it is not the same thing the hotel's archeshitting ships a related israel they are hitting a lot of different ships from a lot of different countries and we are trying to deal with the challenge to freedom of navigation in the red sea that is a distinct challenge it is always fun when they pretend that it is distinct challenge when the same exact group i sponsoring all with is namely the government o born again refusal to acknowledge reality and in more conflict and dentin more war and it ends in more death of in just a second we are going to get to tockercrarlson he is

welcome to the superman science sciencepaceto i man drew supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor say arris doctor say arris did his undergraduate training in philosophy at stamford university and then went on to do his doctrine in negro science at the universe of californium lost angels he is well known as an author who has written about everything from meditation to consciousness free will and he holds many strong political views that he is voiced on social media end in the content of various books as they relate to philosophy and negro science during to day's episode i mainly talk to doctor arris about his views and practices related to meditation consciousness and free will in fact he made several important point about what a proper meditation practice can accomplish prior to this episode i thought that meditation was about deliberately changing one's conscious experience in order to achieve things such as deeper relaxation a heightened sense of focus or ability to focus generally elevated memory and on what say taught me in what you will soon learn as well is that while meditation does indeed hold all of those valuable benefits the main value of a meditation practice were perhaps the greater value of a meditation practice is that it does in just allow one to change their conscious experience but it actually can allow a human being to view consciousness itself that is to understand what the process of consciousness is and in doing to profoundly shift the way that one engages with the world and with one's self in all practices all environments and at all times both in sleep and in waking states and in that way making meditation perhaps most potent and important portal by which one can access novel ways of thinking and being and viewing one's life experience we also discuss the called mind body problem and issues of duality and free will concepts from philosophy in narrow science that fortunately thanks to valuable experiments and deep thinking on the part of people doctor say arris and others is now leading people to understand really what free will is and is not were the locus of free will likely sits in the brain if it indeed resides in the brain at all and what it means to be a conscious being and how we can modify our conscious states in ways that allow us to be more functional we also discuss perception both visual perception auditory perception and especially interesting to mean i think as well hopefully to you time perception which we know is very elastic in the brain the literal frame rate by which we process our conscious experience can expand and contract dramatically depending on our state of mind and how conscious we are about our state of mind we went deep into that topic as well to day's discussion was indeed an intellectual l deep dive into all the topics that i mention few moments ago but it also included many practical tools in fact i pushed say to share with us what his specific practices are and how we can all arrive at a clear and better understanding of a meditation practice that we can each in all apply that we can derive these i credible benefits not just the once related to stress and focus and enhanced memory but the ones that relate to our consciousness that is to our deeper sense of self and to others several times during today's episode i mention the waking up a the waking up a was developed by say arris but i want t emphasize that my mention of the a is in no way a paid promotional rather the waking up a is one that have used for some period of time now and fine very very useful i family members that also use it other staff members here the hubermnlabpodcast use it because we find it to be such a powerful tool say has generously offered superman labor casts listeners a thirty day completely free trial of the waking up a if any of you want to try it you can simply go to waking up doc come slash supermen to get that thirty day free trial during to day's discussion we did not just talk about meditation consciousness and free will we also talked about psychedelics both their therapeutic applications for the treatment of things depression and it it but also the use of psychedelics and we discuss say's experiences with psychedelics as they relate to expanding one's consciousness i also ask say about his views and practices related to social media prompted in no small part by his recent voluntary decision to close down his twitter account s we talked about his rational for doing that how he feels about doing that and i think you will find that to be very interesting as well before you begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the sells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performances element contains a science back to electrolyte ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kinofphysical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element h doc come slash superman to claim a free element sample pay with your purchase again that is drink element elements doctor slash superman and now for my discussion but doctor say arris doctor say arris i just talking to his for you are indeed a doctor i cannot save your life but i i might i might that i might say of your not existent if we talk long enoughwell neither of us are citations but we are both a brain explorers from the different perspectives some overlapping ye and ism really sad to have this conversation have been listening to your voice for many years learning from you for many years and i be remiss if i did not say that my father who's also a scientist is an enormous fan of your waking up a i and has spend a lot of time over the last few years a he is in his late seventy sees almost eighty the theoretical physicist walking to the park near his apartment and spending time meditating with the a or sometimes separate from the at but using the same sorts of meditations in his head ye cantoggles back and forth and even a i should say even but yes even in his late seventies his reported that it is significantly shifted his awareness of self and his conscious experience of things happening in and around him and he was somebody who i think already saw i self as pretty aware person thinking bout e tanto mechanics and and and the rest thank you from him indirectly i thank you from me a now directly and i really one he is at as a way to frame up what i think is one of the more interesting questions and a not just science of philosophy and psychology but all of life which is what is this thing that we call self in as far as i know we have not localizes the region in the brain that can entirely account for perception f self there air is of course it regulate proprioception you knee wherein us of where our limbs are in space maybe even are were in us of where we are in physical space there are such circuits as we both know but when we talk about sense of self i have to remember this kind of a negro science one or one om thing that we always say when you teach memory you say you knew wake up every morning and you remember who you are who you are most people do even if they lack memory systems in the brain for whatever reason pretty much everyone seems to know who they are what are your thoughts on what that whole thing is about him do we come into the world feeling that way i would appreciate answers from the perspective of any feel year science of i will big question i the problems we we use the term self in so may different ways right and there is what there is one sense of that term which i is the target of meditation as the target of deconstruction by the practise and by understand surrounding philosophy ye you will hear and you hear t for me that this self is an illusion right and and that there this a psychological freedom that can be experience on the other side of discovering it to be an illusion i and some people don't that framing of people would would insist that is not much n an illusion but is a a construct and is not at what it seems right i but it is not that every use of the herself is illegitimate and there is certain types of selves that are not illusory m you non not saying that people are illusions i must saying that you cannot i i talk about your self as distinct yourself as as that whole person and and it with as yo psychological continuity with your past experience is being distinct from the person and psychological continuity of some other person riding of obviously we have to be able to conserve those data it is not fundamentally mysterious that you arguing to wake up to morrow morning still being psychologically continuous with your past and not my past right an and you know if we swapped lives that would itdouno demand some explanation a the illusoriness of the self does not cut against any of those obvious fact that the sense of self that is illusory a and again we might one t talk of a self and other modes because there is just a lot of interest they psychologically and you n ultimately i scientifically i the the thing that does not exist certainly does not exist as it seems and i would i would wont argue that it actually is just a proper illusion i is this the sense that there is a subject interior to experience in addition to experience o most people feel there having an experience of the world and there having there inexperience of their bodies in the world and in addition to that they feel that they are a subject internal to the body you are very likely in the head most people feel their behind their face as a kind of locus of awareness and thought and intention and and that ever is it is almost like the your passenger inside your body you do not most people do not feel identical to their bodies and they can imagine this this is the origin the psychological origin and you the the folk psychological origin of of a sense of that there that there might be a soul that to our survive the death of the body man most people are are what my friend pal bloom calls common sense dualists right you you you are used to the de default expectation seems to be that whatever the relationship between the mind and the body there is this there is some promise of separability they are right that the and whenever you it really push hard on the science sides they will known that the mind is really just what the brain is doing that begins to feel more and more counter intuitive to people and there still seems some some residual mi story that at death maybe something has going to lift off the brain and go elsewhere right the is the sense of dualism that met many people have and obviously that that is supported by many religious beliefs a but this feeling its it's a very peculiar starting point people feel that in in thy do not feel like tactical to their experience right is a matter of experience they feel there on the edge of experience somehow appropriating it from the side you kind upon the edge of the world and the world is out there your body is i is in some sense an object in the world a which you you it is different from the world that the boundary of your skin still meaning full you can sort of you loosely control your body am you cannot control you can con control your gross found and subtle in a voluntary motor movements but a you cannot you are not controlling everything your body's doing you are to controlling your heart beat and your your am hormonal secretions and all that an there is the lot that is going on that is in the dark for you and then you you give some one in instruction to meditate say and you say kea less less examine all this from the first person sciolist look for this thawing you are calling i and again eye is not identical to the body people feel their hands are out there and they are when they they on to meditate that on to close their eyes very likely an nothing to pay attention to something and vantage of the breath or a sound and it is from the point of view of being a locus of attention that is now aiming attention strategically at an object the breath a that there is this dualism that is set up and ultimately the ultimate promise of meditation and therereally too levels at which you could be interested in meditation am one is very straightforward and remedial and non paradoxical and very well subscribed and it is it is the usual set of claims about all the benefits you begin to get for meditation recall yo can a lower your stress and you in to increase your focus and you are going t stave off cortical thinning and others all kinds of good things that science as saying meditation will will give you amend none of that entails really drilling down on this paradoxical claim that the self is an illusion or or anything else of that sort but from my point of view the real purpose of meditation and it is real promise is not in this long list of of benefits in on not discounting any of those though in the science for many them is quite provisional am it is in this deeper claim that if you look for this thing you are calling eye if you look for the sense there is a thinker in addition to the the the mere rising of the next thought say you will not find that thing and and you can what is more you can not find it in a w ay that is conclusive and that matters right an an has a there is a host of benefits that follow from that discovery i which are i quite a a deeper and more interesting than engaging meditation on the side of its benefiting distressing increasing focus and all the rest have a number of questions related heard what you just said and a first of all i i agree that the evidence that meditation can improve focus re distress et camera it is there it is am not an enormous pile of evident but it is growing and i think of it especially for some of the shorter meditations which i these days view more as perceptional exercises a talked bout the sun the dicast before but for those that have not heard o before about o perception you can have extrreception extending things beyond the confinezier skin interception which is also includes the surfaces of the skin but everything inward am and meditation through eyes close typically am involving some sort of a attentional spot lighting something will get into a to more interceptive for s as extraaceptive events et camera including thoughts an i think of at it at a basic level meditation as a somewhat of a perceptional exercise am you can tell me where you disagree there night i would expect and hope that you could am but i would to just touch on this idea that you brought up consician interesting one of this idea that our bodies are containers and that we am somehow of you ourselves as passengers within those containers that certainly been my experience am and the image that i have is of i as you say that is of myself or of people out there that sit a few centimeters below the surface or that sit entirely in their head and of course the brain an body are connected through the nervous system i think sometimes a brain a is used to replace nervous system and that can get us into trouble just of coming up with real real directions in definitions but the point is at there is something special about the real estate in the head i think for as much as my laboratory and many other scientists are are really interested in brain body connections through the nervous system an other organ systems of that the nervous system binds that if you conduct off all my limbs ism going to be different but ism fundamentally still drew whereas i we were to lesion a a couple square millimeters out of my palatal quarters am it is an open question as to whether or not i would still seem as much drew o to other people into myself heaven and there is something fundamentally different about the real estate in the cranial vault ai we aren't remove both of my eyes it'd still be drew in those or two pieces of my central nervous system that are fundamental to my daily life but it'd still be me you areas am and this does not i think just apply to memory systems i mean i think their reasons of the frontal quarters that when destroyed have been shown to modify personality and self peace option in in dramatic ways it is a sort of obvious point once it is made but i do think it is worth a high lighting cause there does seem to be something special about being in the head the other thing is that a sitting a few centimeters below the surface or riding in this container make sense to me except i i wonder if you have ever am experience shift as i have when something very extreme happens that us the the negative example of all a see you are in a fierce state all of a sudden it feels as if your entire body is is you work me and is and and now i need to get this thing the whole container an me to some place of safety in what whatever form a this is also there i think in ecstatic states we can feel really when people say embodied i wonder whether not we normally oscillate below the surface of our body when i say oscillate i mean in nerd terms o me may be our sensory experience is not truly at the bodily surface but sits below the bodily surface more at the level of organ systems em within our head and then certain things that jolt us our autonomic nervous system into heighten states bring us into states of am you do not bring us closer to the surface and therefore include all of us again i do not want to take us down a a mechanistic description of of something that does not exist but is any of that resonate a in terms of how your thinking about her describing the self ye year there is a lot there e first on the point of the brain being e o the locus of of what we are as mine i yet i remember there people who will insist that through the whole nervous system has to be thought of is able you talking about our emotional life an yell the the i the the insole's connection to the got and jushethe sense of of self extends beyond the brain but i totally take your point that a brain transplanted is a coherent idea and you would expect to go with the brain rather than with tether viscera and i in that sense we really are the the old philosophical thought it is garment of been a brain and o tat may we sensibly are already knowthe vat as our skull and we are unnivertually in that situation i the horrible move ism sir i can ho pan enter up when i was a a senator my sister n i us sure the movies everyone in while we would trade off who could pick the move and am she took me to see once the move boxing college the avid lynch fill never however he amputates the limbs of a woman who he is obsess by and keeps sir its a really horrible him and about twenty minutes into it my sister returned to me and said sorry and the question then was whether not too sibling should actually persist in a move that we decided to persist in the movies that we coal laugh about it later a but it was rather disturbing i do not recommend the move nor do i recommending it with a sibling but in that move that the woman he he takes her as a container an and restricts er movement rig it sadistic and our able thing really am avid lynch am interesting mind perhaps but the the idea was that a was to question how much of the person persist in the absence of there ability to move et camera could there be love could there be these the other affections a may rather extreme example but a one that i that still haunts me in a somethinking about still a whats just to follow that point there is a there is a lot about us that we do not have access to unless we enact it physically likening if i asked you do you still know how to write a bike it there is no place in your memory where you can you can inspect by youngest sitting in your chair that you you have retained the knowledge of how to wite a bite it as the preceedual memories different from semantic or apostolic memory of i asked you d do your address yes you can recall your address just sitting there but if you if you had had a micro stroke that neatly dissected out your ability to write a bike you known and left everything else in tact you might think you could write a bite but suddenly you stand up next to one and you have no idea what to do with it and that would be a discovery that would only happen if you were yo meteorically engaged with that object i and ism sure there is you know we could probably come up with a hundred things about us that really seem cord to us and wand an unnotseparable for our from our know personhood which seem to only cut you would only get in voted when we are you out their moving in the world and you know we have limbs et camera i and but yet no it is the the seat of a consciousness an me tit i the right frame work to talk about all this from my point of views consciousness an its contents right we have consciousness the fact that there is something thetas to be us ate the fact that that the world and our internal experience is is illuminated that it has a qualitative character i and then there is the question of what is that quality of character what is it know what kinds of information to we have access to what is at feel to be us how do how to different states of arousal change that you talked about fear amen fear can change a lot of things but i i and very serological deficits or you k u can add drugs to the maxes you had psychedelic that you the radically current transform the contents of consciousness from my point of view consciousness itself is simply the the cognessence the awareness this that that is the the flood lights by which any of that stuff appears writes i consciousness does not change but its contents change and to come back to meditation for a second many people think meditation is about changing the contents of consciousness you wither some con some constant you ant to go rid of anxiety other contents you want to to in courage calm and o unconditional love or you some other your classically pleasant prosodical emotion a and that is all fine that is all possible a the real the wisdom of the two thousand year old wisdom of meditation that really is the en of the the chewy center of the the tustypop is a recognition of what consciousness itself is always already regardless of the contents and the changes in contents and this is why a we might talk about this but this wide the mutually compatible a psychedelics and meditation from mere somewhat or tonal because psychedelics is all about making wholesale changes to the contents of consciousness and and there is a being of some wonderful consequences of doing that there can be some harrowing and terrifying consequences of doing that but a generally speaking i think used used wisely they can be incredibly valuable and and the therapeutic potential there is enormous but the crucial disjunction here is that there really is something to recognize about ordinary waking consciousness that the consciousness that is compatible with my driving a car to get here on time right you you do not have to you do not have to have the pirate technics of be beyond alas de to see the the the to transcend the central illusion that ism ism saying is is that the thing to be transcendent which is the sense that there is a duality between subject and object in every moment of experience a and to take it back to to something you said about just all of our different modes in ordinary life the interesting thing is i think people are constantly losing their sense of self and they are not aware of it and that ether there is a probably an analogy to the visual system here which is a to a visual seconds which a perhaps you have spoken about as simpoine on your podcast not enough please ye a what happens with our you know every time we move our eyes is called a a sacadeand we do that about you three times a second or i just normally a there is a the the reason of motor quartets that that effects that movement sends was called and an efferent copy of that motor movement a which i which as used as information the propagates back to visual quartets as suppresses a the data of vision while the eyes are moving because otherwise if you ware not doing that every time you moved your eyes it would seem the visual seen itself was lurching around and people can experience this for themselves if they just touch one of their eyeballs on the side not all that heart and con jiggle it nay thin you can roll it around you can jigger from side to side you can see that a a a a movement of the eyeball that is not governed by your ocular motor system delivers a jiggling of the world because it is not your brain is not anticipating in the same way in is not you are not producing at the the same a in a predictive a copy of of the movement it is a low bit am i the some action sports fullers on our staff here the the gamble that holds it ani only you see the kids to it on you sir words you scape words your selling there you hold a phone while moving around or the people who the bloggers say when you been still use that a moving around and to it is it is image stabilization actually a that keeps the the camera steady and these are more than cameras of course the this lessen a point at my eyes but hey far more than just what a came would do but yet this internal system of of image stabilization i can see a perhaps where you are going with this am that that it allows us to remain in a self reference and scheme as oppose to a the sort paying attention to just how confusing it is to detract the visual world at some level what up i actually where ism going is it with people are having this suppression of vision three times a second on average and they are not experiencing it die slip you are you are t literally you your effectively going blind and you are not noticing it and a is very fast yes ex's very fast now there there is an analogous a suppression i would say of the sense if self that occurs every find attention gets absorbed significantly in his object rice slide all we you we even have this concept of you losing yourself in your for or you you losing your the classic flow experiences have this this quality where there is the in this the tense to be whythey'r rewarding a where there is just if often in some in athletic activity or an aesthetic one a or youcould be having sex or y whatever it is some pique experience its uniqueness usually instals there being some brief period where there was no distance between you and the experience right the for that moment you were no longer looking over your own shoulder or anticipating the next moment or trying to get somewhere were were you warrant or you a mike managing errs or you the young this not there is just the flow of unity with whatever the that i o whatever the experiences you of a surfer on it on the way right a and we love those experiences a and then we are continually abstracted away from them by a thinking about them what well o think lament o the but it was good or how do i get back to that or and you are looking at a sunset is the most beautiful sense tat you ever seen and then you are continually interrupting the experience of merely seen it with a commentary about how amazing less is and i i wonder ye what a real estate prices a here i make it is a possible act we cut w could move here and you u your mind is just continually narrating a hi conversation you are having with yourself how re paradoxically and you are telling yourself thing your self things that you already know a as though there were two of you rather often right you are just you ism looking for which which is the water and s o there it is re but i am the one seen it who am i saying o that out there it is to as hough there some one else who needs to be informed about the thing i already saw right it is it is a there is something about our internal dialogue that is paradoxical ai is there any a neurologic condition i a call select to me or or anything that where somehow people feel more unified with the self on it continual basis a the observer and the act or with young whether state wore more i is as a complete sentence is there any known near logical kinda they senelike a bad thing but could be good thing whereby people feel that the actor and the observer within them are unified continual there is not a pathological one it some of them the work on the default mode n at work suggest at that at least part of the story i the default mode net work i the which has ben talked to about a lot of late because its it has come up both in the in the meditation literature and in the psychedelic literature a but it is original a discovery was that young and the reason i was called the default mode was s that in virtually every your imaging experiment ever run they found that between tasks when the brain was just in its default state teethes these midline structures would would to increase their activity and then they would then they would reliably diminish whenever the person in the scan or was i was on task and usually that men some kind of outward looking i you no visual discrimination task i mi but it could be could it could be visual cold be semantic it could be but the pretends to be their eyes are open and their pan attention to something that is being broadcast of them through you a monitor goggles i bring another look in i a mirror that showing them a computer monitor i but the o the general insight was there these midline structures in the brain that seem to be i increasing their activity when the brain is just kind of idling between task waiting for something to happen and then further experiments found tasks that actually unregulated i activity the beyond base line and those tasks seem to be self referential that when you ask people then you give i a list of words and you say would do these any unites apply to you right and people a r or you asked people t think about i i you've acting what one experiment i did when you when you are challenging people's beliefs i when you are challenging beliefs that it have more of a personal significance a political or religious beliefs you get an up regulation in these regents is supposed a just generic beliefs about you are in lost angel as this is a table another is something to which being a people are not i holding fast as a matter of identity i anyway both meditation and psychedelics seem to suppress activity in these in these regions which we know are associated with both self talk mind wandering and and explicit acts of self representation right could we say that they are somewhat autobiographical because they access memory systems and in the way you are describing them and in the way that a a colleague of mine who is been a guest on this pockets at don if you have interact with before but i think you would very much enjoy whatever interaction you would have is am avid eagle he is our associate sure o sichietries a he an is father actually his father than he founded hypnosis as a valid clinical practice in latitreted hypnosis which is i see a heightened sense of attention with deep relaxation is known to a dramatically suppress the the default mode network he talks about the salad i i always wonder as we take down activity within the default mode network what surface is it in its place and is what surface is n its place does that somehow reflect that the two are normally in a pushpin hes dos not necessarily the case when i fall asleep i can hallucinate but that does not mean that during the day my a the fact that ism looking at objects is is what is preventing me from hallucinating i close my eyes i can get imagery but the others this kind of a a different illusion the illusion of antagonistic circuitry sometimes u i soft not take us off course but the default mode network seems to want to be there up its it seems to be fighting for for our attention i unless we give ourselves a visual targeted on auditory target or some sailing experience of some kind it sounds and then if ism surprised to hear that meditation reduces activity in the default mode network at some level because meditation to me oftentimes involves paying attention to some sort of perceptional target maybe could u eventually explain as to how it might do that or why t my dear and and no i do not think it is the whole story because obviously outward going attention is not i even if you are having the kind of logic a cod that ism talking about where you are you are actually not clearly aware of of yourself our not clearly defining yourself as separate from experience i for the moment of pain attention you are sir losing yourself in your work that is not the same thing as having the clear meditative insight of selflessness that ism that ism claiming as the goal of meditation i but there is a youth wine back to the original point i was making an the reason why i drug the rev the analyst to visual seconds i do think there is a continuous interruption in our sense if self that goes unrecognized and i but but the conscious i acquisition o the understanding that the self is an illusion is a different experience and its because your your then you are then focussing on this absence actual there is another analogy to to visual system that applies here which is to the the optic blind spot and is i which is a good analogy for me because it cuts through a bunch of false assumption as to w con o ware that you would look for this or how this relates to ordinary experience as man people know that we have using both eyes we have was called the blind spot which is a consequence of the optic nerve transiting through the retain ism not unlike a sephlipods i think think sephlipods i have their optic nerve you know as a an omission being would have engineered it it connecting the retina from the back and therefore there is no blinds the area a blindness associated with its transit back through the retina bartotorecepters on the outside exactly e humans whatever reason a put photos we i will say i was not consult the design face some thing i put a photoreceptor am combination of things but photoreceptor in the back and you you i show have to send the highway of arabia through through the picnic center of the of the eye yesephlopods and obgresophla on earthly a a invertebrates r a the design is more at its face logical canals very illogical design at least as far o judgments but it gives gives me good analogy it'll take it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there is my sorry taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets me the robotics that i need for got health our god is very important its populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those robotics athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains an number of adaptions fitments and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste grape if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash hubormen and they will give you five for we travel packs that make it really easy to mix up out lentic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of it him in the three c too again that is that let it green stock calm slash humoral to get the fivefree travel packs and the year supply a it him into the k to i many was we have this blind spot which you can i think most people learn this in school although my daughters had not been taught the since cold to show them this for the first time i a month ago which and they were briefly fascinated than then when i returned to their screen time a but a anyway you can take a piece of paper and you make in a two marks on it and then you cover one eye and you fixate on on one mark a make you can look this up on line if you need i details of have to do this and you bile staring at one fixation point you move the paper back and forth and you can get it to a place where the other mark disappears and that and if and you can run this experiment long enough to satisfy yourself that there is in fact to blind spot in your visual field which you with one eye closed you do not normally notice a the reason we y have to cover it you cover one eyes because each eye compensates for the the blind spot of the other a but what chichis to say that if you close one eye and and survey the visual seen something really is missing whatever you are looking at if your looking at a crowd of people somebody is missing ahead and you are not noticing it and it is not is not easy to notice because a the the brain does not tend to vividly represent the absence of information i may just thighs just part of the game that not being rendered is not is not showing up as a a break in your in the visual field is just not there and your i man the people of argued that there's a a kind of filling in phenomenon that happens but i think that can be misunderstood or or exaggerated but the eye movements themselves you describe before it the as si should say that the ye ti said analogy of bout am transiently and repeated we erasing thyself arks perfectly here because indeed micro seconds the smaller sockets ay cur all the time also prevent our eyes from fixating one location is long enough to deserve our blindspot even if whole eyes close i is if we ad the the experiments done with paralytics to session lock eyes an one location baby things just start disappear ye it just they long o tad returning ut should we start going blind and those experiments have been done and inhuman sit i hear they are quite terrifying eye ye bagmen you can do that for yourself do it just be it begins to just oi melt away and idle in a warm glow a no psychedelics required but the the interesting point there is that when you ask yourself focus of this because of as a consequence of the eyes an atomy there is this this thing you can see ether that is absent from your experience but the question is where is that in relationship to the rest it of you to your mind t leads that deep within or is that some sensoria on the surface of experience and there is this expectation that people have again i think conflating meditation with with a search for changes in the contents of consciousness ha looking for a much more subtle things to to to notice about the mind or much you now vaster things to notice i psychedelic sets up this this expectation that you do a mass of dose of mushrooms or plenty and everything changes and me just get this full beatific vision i and n you get you not only visual changes but emotional changes and and you get syne thesis where y your just you have much more mind in in in many ways i they begin having these experiences or reading the mystical literature you begin to think look able than freedom is it is really elsewhere or is it is really it is deep within is it is not it is not coincident with the ordinary awareness that can that coffee this coffee cup clearly and that can transition attention to reading animal i u will it wit with a a full sobriety of just you n ordinary waking consciousness i but the truth is this insight into selflessness is insight into the nonduality of subject and object is as close to ordinary consciousness as this inside into the of to blind spot what where do you have to go to have this insight into the blinds but now you just have to if you go anywhere you stove to set up that the the experiment correctly such that you you can see the data but the date is right on the surface it is its it is it is almost too close to you to notice and i it is at all hard to notice it is because it is because it close rather than it is be know deep within or far away i and there are other analogies i i do not remember those minds i pieces of art work that with as the random dot stereo gramityayou have an image at pops out i have always find it very difficult to see those let now very dominant i but i people cannot see those these of these images that you seem et the kind touristy shops of but you will my oh there it is the wale i m think i do not an yet i you non kids that swim all when they are younger and the i tend to breathe just to one side i write if this was you this known tend to well keep one eye close you set up a pretty strong ocular dominants at basing your vision to one or the other eye early in life wether n or learning how to be a saw hunter or you are learning how to throw darts or shoot billiards or anything inhales am selectively viewing the world through one eye for even a couple of hours can set up a permanent i i symmetry in the waiting of a visual flow i if a flow o visual information from the eye of the brain a it is reversible but only through the reverse gymnastics of covering up the other i and s i should be id to be reverse patched for while was i a seen double because i lost by ocular vision i do not stand a chance in hell of seeing an image pop out of wander toaster s cave ironic as i did my ice own by ocular circuitry by on and none the less yet if people can see these were if they cannot with think they provide a really terrific example of what you are talking bout it as a larger theme which is that exceptionally you see bunch dots and then all of a sudden r what you thought was not there suddenly there but can disdisappear again or there are certain visualillusions if we were to include others that once you see them you cannot unseen them so there is the faces faces figure ground type stuff the very my us aby all percepts an not by stable percepts and then there sort of ocular competition you show two different images to the eyes that each of the two eyes it is near impossible for people to perceive them both simultaneously sit is a little bit of what you are describing am and you seem to be fundamental features about the way the moral circuits are organized that they do not want to stably wether don want a stay fixated on any one thing fore very long to do either takes training intense interest intense fear intense excitement mi say intense i guess i come back to this idea that the autonomic nervous system is somehow governing our ability to spotlight at any one location for very long is that is that a useful framework or as icing to take us down an different what is it sort of a different path for this me the only point i was making as that this seemingly paradox will claim that something can be right on the surface and yet hard to see right thine that that there things that are because it is and again this this this seems to justify the expectation held by i would thinking of the vast majority of people who get interested in these spiritual things for lack or better word i that the truth must somehow be deep within right likely thy lifting there is really there is some distance between where your but between the one who is looking and the thing that has to be found right and the you have to go through this this long evolution of changes and that the many metaphors is at this uppish here at the base of a mountain and you have to climb to the top and s we have to find the path however secure secured us to get you there i but there really is a distance between where you between your starting point and the goal and what ism arguing on this is a kind of a fondue in to use a term of jargon i is a non duel approach to meditation i supposed to a dualistic one that there really is a a the path and the goal are are are coincident right that there is a the that you have to unravel the logic by which you would seek something that is outside of u of the the p the present moments experience ism i not available really not available to you now ism because many things worth having many many skills worth acquiring really are not available do you now s us you know you want to be a a pianist if you want to speak chines or yo it it the southern is something you do not know and thenyou want learn that thing and there is a whole process right and you might not be capable of doing it it you ma and and real mastery is far away right if you if you have never hid a golf ball and you want to hid a golf ball three hundred yards straight right you now i can pretty much guarantee you are not going to do that initially and you're not going to do it on day to and i you are not in do it reliably for the longest time and there's real training you in front of you to to be able to do that reliably an insight you to and really the core insight you mean that the insight that is you the cores of you are the buddies teaching to take one one a historical example of this i really is available now and it is not i may suave granted it can be very hard one for people and i i had probably spend a year on silent retreat in in u one week to three month increments before i i got the point ism making now right i it is it is quite a s i may literally in this is the laser is a retreats wreespend you have twelve to eighteen hours a day just meditating trying to to you unpack the kinds of claims ism ism n making now ism there is pot its it is possible to rigorously overlook this it is possible to stand in front of the minds i image and stare in a way that is guaranteed not to give you pop out right and to be to be adept at being o staring in that way ism it is possible to be misled and what ism what ism trying to argue here is if there is ism trestle fair man of leverage you can get with with better information which can concur the time course of your searching for this thing and and and concancel your false expectations about just were this is in relation to your ordinary waking consciousness ism and it is possible to get bad in formation and to have a bunch of experiences you know you go t you go and do an i work trip and you have it is incredibly valuable and it is valuable for all the ways in which it change the contents of your consciousness in in n a startling ways and you had insights into your past and into your relationships and into we re not as loving as you might be and is lots to think about and you get that is all great it is all something that you can talk about but there is it is truly is worth tonal an if it makes a point of contact to what ism talking about it is rely just at one point in it is at the point where this sense of a subject object i vision in consciousness is s illusory and vulnerable to investigation and if you investigate it as tote the right plane of focus you pick the analogy you want from whether it is setting up the the i the optic blind spot experiment in just the right way the you can see that it is actually not in the date's not there or i mad the by stable percepts is great because when you see one of these images the the vase face i diagram or the dalmatian that that looks a just mess of dots and then you see the the image of a dalmatian dog pop out once you see it you really cannot unseen it an me like once you have the the requisite conceptional you of anger to it then every time you look you can find it again and and eventually becomes effortless and that is what ultimately meditation is a this kind of meditation you you ultimately learn to recognize that the is no separation from you between you and your experience it there is not the experience on the one hand and the self on the other there is just experience right there is just seen hearing smelling taste in touching thinking feeling you appropriaception ad ad whatever channels in formation you want to that i but there is just the there is just the totality of the energy of consciousness and its contents and there is no it is not that you are on the river bank and this is this is how it can seem in the beginning even when you are practising meditation fairly diligently can seem you are on the river bank watching the contents of consciousness flow by and and and meditation is the act of doing that more and more dispassionately you are no longer grabbing at at the pleasant or pushing the unpleasant away your just kind of relaxing and an and in the most non judgemental frame of mind just witnessing the flow right but if you are doing that dualistically you feel the meditator you feel the subject aiming attention and now you are on the river bank watching everything go go past but the truth is you are the river right experience itself is that there is just experience itself you are not you are not on the edge of experience and everything you can notice is part of the of the flow right and there is and there is no point from which to abstract yourself away from the flow to stand outside it and to say okay this is this is my life this is my experience this is my body yes you can do that am in those are all just thoughts but the more of the flow right and there is a there is a process by which you would avenge eventually recognize that there is no distance between you and your experience and again you can you can wait for those moments in life where experience gets good or terrifying it is just salient right you are eidola is do having hard an is e you're inn a war and you cannot think about anything because there you now the enemy's shooting at you and this is the most thrilling video game you have ever play in your life and your life is on the line or your you are you car at the peak of of som athematic event where there is just you soft know how you are doing the things you are doing but it is all happening automatically right but those a those a you do not one one hundredth of one per cent of one's life and what ism calling meditation is a way of simply understanding the mechanics of attention whereby you are denying yourself that unity of experience much of the time and recognizing that that is it is it is based on a a misperception of the way consciousness always already is if there was not an incentive to learn how to meditate properly that was one and have been meditating a fair amount since i was in my teens i but more along the lines of jumping attention to breath an you recognize thought sort of observer open observer tight meditation and or focus attention i wouldsuppose more of the focus attention type will get into these elicit layer but have a number of questions relate to what you just said our i love the idea that this thing that we would all do well to understand to observe consciousness it self as supposed to try to alter the contents of consciousness may sit much closer to us then one might think that it u and that because it sit close to us that hat might be one o the reasons why we mist it i go right to visual system a example of if you do not you wearing a corrective lenses in there is aspect on your lens simple your looking out through the lens and everyone t observe that speck any number of different analogies could work here the the fact that there are states however few positive and negative ecstasy y extreme ecstasy an extreme fear i being that the two i think most obvious ones that seems we agree on that allow us to capture the sense of completeness of self were the the unity of the observer an the and the actor the fact that those are are seldom for the non trained for the non meditator suggests to me two things i think one perhaps worth exploring more than the other but one is that what is really being revealed in the states where we can feel the unity of the observer in the actor is understanding something fundamental about the algorithm not the on line algrthem but the algrthem that is our nervous system just as a you mention sephloposame mentor shrimp see an enormous array of color hues that we do not right there map there maps and representations the world are fundamentally different pit viper see in the informed wee restricted to see what of a limited management in the cover spectrum but still more vast than that of dogs or cats o k understanding that for seen what a pithier can see for moments would be informative perhaps i sensing heatomissions was a human might be invasive a maybe that is why we do not do it the question is to just make it straight for it is why would the system be design this way again neither of us were consulted the design phase but that brings me to perhaps the more tractable question was which is m about development i i may great believer that the nerd circuits that i encouraged a healthy parent child relations or unhealthy parent child relations as the case may be e child's them from the initial demands of internal versus external states which is exactly that we are talking about which is that a a young child feels anxious because it needs its diner change is does not really know it needs its diner change or it is cold when it is uncomfortable or it is hungry for it is overly full and it vocalizes and then some external source comes to us and relieves that hopefully i and the fundamental rule that we first learn is not that we have a sell for that things fall down not up but is that i when uncomfortable externalize that discomfort and it will be relieved by an outside player and then of course there is a purposing of that circuitry for adult romantic attachments i do not think any one doubts that and the can explain a lot indeed about attachment and forth something about our developmental wiring and the algorithms that these neral circuits run tend to buys most people the non practise mediators to live at somewhat functional life at least without this awareness of actor an observer and what you aerially talking about is at it deliberate intervention to understand and resolve that gap an the algorithm is that do i have tat right i ma more less restating we said in a way that ism i hoping will serve as a jumping off point is why questions are always very dangerous in biology were any no a and relation what is that or in relation ore in relation right exactly although i think it all does really horn back to this early developmental wiring which of course is modifiable that is the that is a beauty of of the the nervous system is its the one organ that seems to be able to change itself at least to some degree what are your thoughts about the organization of the circuitry to essentially under normal conditions to not reveal it is what seems to be one of its more important and profound and for you dare i say enlightening features i almost as if we are potentially mantis shrimp we can see many more colors than we actually see and yet we do not we we serve of most people ought not to and i would argue that one of the great strengths of the waking up a for inches that it it sickly walks you through the process of being able to arrive at these scenes without having to go to one year or three year u long solenliation retreats you just elaborate for a women before we move gone about what your thoughts about how the circuitry is arranged by default verses that the an an what that means for there to be t an n intervention that we have to intervene in the self in order to reveal the self wall that to big questions there one about evolution one about development i with respect to evolution ami it is important to recognize that evolution does not see are deepest concerns about human flourishing and human well being all about the all it is just in now you we are set up to spawn and to survive long enough to to help our progeny spawn if we can do that and that and that that is it right and anything that was good for that including tribalism and xenophobia and i all kinds of hard working saw wereflaws that are that a reveal themselves to bells in the present time when we are trying to build a viable global civilization but they they redounded to the advantage of our ancestors somehow were they just there their things about us that were simply not selected for that just coming came along for the ride the what stepped jacal called a spandrel m a we are not set up by evolution to be as happy as we possibly can be ism and certainly an and to do almost anything that interests us well and we we are not set up by evolution to be mathematicians or musicians or to to create democracies that are healthy i minion evolution can see none of this and we are doing these things based on cognitive an emotional hardware a that we are leveraging in new directions right n that we have we are primates and we are were communicating with in a small mouth noseband we were language using primates an all of that is clearly evolved i and we are doing these amazing things including science however improbably were you were actually able to to almost entirely with language i understand reality that at a scale that exceeds us in both directions man that the very the very vast and the very small and and you also temporally the very old we have visions of the far future we can figure out where an you an asteroid is going to in a cross earth's or bit a thousand years from now i if we just do the math and it is ma easing that we can do all those things but evolution is blind to a of that right and we have you terms of what we care about and certainly in terms of what we what is going to insure our survival of a species we have flown the perch that was created for us by evolution and me we are just not it is not just the primate things and it is with learning how to regulate our emotions and and punch through to a self concept ere beyond a self concept that is more normative psychologically that allows us to not be terrorized by our apish genes a as fully as we seem to be even in the presence of more and more destructive technology that lily were we are still practically chimpanzee armed with newcomer weapons right and and that is you know increasingly dysfunctional and a very soon were can be in the presence of minds or apparent minds that we have built that are as intelligent as we are or and very quickly probably fifteen minutes after that far more intelligent than we are and what we do with all of that is again something that we have to figure out based on the minds we have the minds we can build the minds we can change we can we can meddle with our own genomes now and and that will produce its own consequences a i in in ourselves and i in future generations if we meddle with the germ line and again all of that is just evolution is just for the womb we came out of but it is not it did not anticipate any of that right that mother nature has has simply not had our best interests at heart right and is i we might die off and and from the point of view of mother nature that is that is fine because ninety nine percent of it of every species dies off a there is that what but when you are talking t when you are talking about the the individual develop mentally yo now we all come into this world again as a as say a fairly hairilous primate a that needs a tremendous amount of care by others and a the logic of that is that a the reason why we are not a it gazelle that can run forty five minutes later d than basically do all the gazelle things a perfectly a soon thereafter a the reason why we have we have this this time of of immaturity a and that becomes has become functional for us is it it its just we were were far d more flexible and we can learn based on the needs of of an environments to do is much more than a gazelle can and language is part of that and a in the last ten thousand years or culture increasingly has been more and more part of that and there is a probably a l air at which we can plausibly talk about cultural evolution a an culture evolution interacting with biological evolution to to change us am when you talk about the development of an individual each of us comes into this world i think am not recognizing ourselves in any in any sense that it would make sense to to really am it is not that there is nothing there in could be some kind of photo self differentiation but i think it is it takes o it takes a long while and there is pot very likely a coincidence between really recognize recognizing others we recognize others first and we were in certainly in relationship immediately and we worry into human faces and and we i you even detect a other humans as good and bad moral actors very early a certainly long before we recognize ourselves an in a mirror a a we am the experiments run against as pal bloom and and colleagues experiments run on count of the moral hardware o and a aware of of a developing toddlers but i think this point they push it down all the it six months of of age where you will get these infants staring at out of a puppet show and deal the will show a an am a greater interest in in a in a classically good actors overseas bad actors your cooperators verses defectors in various in o puppashow games am there is it is not that we have no mind and no a photo awareness of others and and of self but what eventually happens certainly as we become at all fascia with with language use is that we become aware that that not only are we in relationship to others but we are an object in the world for them right that we have enough people pointing at us in our cribs right and impinging upon our experience wright neath you you are you are being physically moved and prodded and touched and consoled or not consoled and just imagine what all of these r on the receiving end of ten thousand interventions right and you are completely helpless for the longest time a at all of that attention you have all these people coming up to the crib and and making faces at you cheering yet and ad it is all pointed at you writes others day is classic magical nnarcicism that that gets constructed there if you if you take the psychological literature in at least a certain strand of it seriously am and i think it is its largely apt to to think of of a child of that age as a kind a kind of am a there is a kind of narcissistic structure there where it is it is it is all kind of going inward and at a certain point you realize of ism ism the center all of this right it is not just it is not just a a move that you are that you are you are where you are t you are completely absorbed in and you have lost your sense of self and this is o talk oftthe yet another example of a of what is as a grown up to lose our sense of self and one of things o thing we find fascinating by about television and and film is that when we get totally absorbed in it we are in this very unusual circumstance where we are our brain is basically reading it as weariness in the classic social circumstance were presented with with the the facial displays of other people in fact wite a weaned that some of that sometimes these people are ten feet tall right or there faces are ten feet all a close up in a move theatre son's the superstimulus yet interns of to evolution and they could make they con be making direct eye contact with the camera rightly you have the gigantic face staring at you and yet you are totally implicated socially you cannot be seen and you and something about you cannot be seen and you are completely you completely lose self consciousness and yet you are you are able to examine with completely free attention again cause you are totally implicated a the the e facial minutia and the metic facial play of people a from if at a very close range and your seeing people closet me you'd have to be physically just you've about to kiss your your your spouse that is what a close up is in a film right that you never get that close to people right and yet her your in situation where you are unobserved and that and this that one attention but the it is it is the other side of what is happening developmentally for a kid a when you've in a moving theatre watching a move you are truly invisible and yet you are right there seeing you of the however harrowing the human drama is you are been to play out n you are seen at youyou are seen it up close and it is a it is principally social encounter that your genes are ready for but they are not ready for you to be invisible right and that is what is a magical about it but what happens developmentally for a kid is that you are not invisible you are an object that is constantly being being am overrun the boundaries of your u youyou are sensory engagement with the world are constantly being impinged upon by others and at a certain point your recognize of ism at the center of this and the and the way this gets in shrine as a self a i think it is probably coincident with are learning the language game we we learned to play with others were we we are talking to others people are talking to us and at a certain point we are talking to our elves even when they other people leave the room right saying you can hear i if you ever have been with a toddler when they are when there when they are externalizing their self talk you hear them talking to themselves are playing and their and their there have not a conversation that they were talking to you the parent but then you left the room and and there still talking you come back gain than there still there still talking right and what happens to us strangely i and this comes back to the logic of evolution i we never stop because ought evolution never thought to build us an offswitch for this right amidlanguage is useful and hit gets tuned up strongly for us and the was never reason to shut it off right there is never reason to give you this ability is ice would not be nice of four hours of quiet now no self talk a and for most of us and mi this there are people who for whatever neurological reason or it isnencratic reason undoubtedly there is be a neological reason for it do not have any self talk but for the for most of us i we are covertly talking basically all the time and and ire's an imagistic component of this for many people your your visualizing things as well but there just a lot o ton of white noise in the mind that feels a certain way and what i what you discover in meditation ultimately is that the self is what it feels to be thinking without knowing that you are thinking right a thought arises inspected and seems to just become you rat a you and our talking now and you sat your people are listening to us they are there struggling to follow the train of this conversation because it is competing with teethe conversation as happening in their heads right that all be saying something and a person listening will say well what dos that mean or obey how he just contradicted himself or the you are and there is a voice in your head that is also vying for your attention much of the time and i it is you the first discovery people making meditations that it is just hard to pay attention to anything the breath or mantra or t whatever it is because you are thinking every you are thinking about the thing you need to do in an hour and all it is good that i o downloaded the sap unto this is really good is to be good for me butane you are but your that chatter is not showing up you are not far back enough i yin the in the n of the theater of consciousness as to see it emerge is it is just sneaking up behind you and it feels me again or it feels when some one is thinking the thought what the hell does that mean right there not seeing it as an emerging object and consciousness it just feels me it just feel that that that is it is it them the you subjectively it is the mind contracts around this appearance and consciousness and it really is just it is just i it is just a sound with the voice of the mind if you actually can inspect it it is it is deeply inscrutable that we ever feel identified with our thoughts me how is it that we could be a thought the thoughts that thought just arises and passes away and when you inspect the when you go to inspect it it is it it unravels it is it is it is it is it is the least substantial possible thing and and it could but yet it could be a thought of self hatred you know could be a thought that tit unrecognized totally defines your your mood you not me just again this all con seem kind of abstract but we will know tat but i think it its extremely concrete from the perspective of the narrow circuits that will return to in a maybe in a few minutes if you could elaborate a bit on this notion of internal chatter and external stimulus and the bridge between them costs i think that for some people that might be into give i think for others it is not obvious that language it is on going it my backdrop at is sometimes i think some people are more tuned into that language for some people it's its louder volume for some people it is more structured i have a colleague at hat stamford has been on this podcast called dicer auto is a little an the presa by when you s else psychiatrist and he has a mat he does not call to meditative practice as a practicer each evening after is five kids a down asleep m they are older now but a and in the quiet of that the late hours of the night early morning he sits and forces himself to think in complete sentences with punctuation for an hour is is the way that he as taught himself to structure his thinking because of the very fact that you are describing which is hat ordinarily there is an underlying structure to what is internal but it is destructed by external events and its and these are it atypically it is not coherent enough to really make meaning from it is almost somebody sing down to write in complete sentences but forcing himself to do it in his head but for many people in clean myself that is at that is a foreign experience and we only experience structure through our interactions with the world and other people that if i were i taken the time to try an explore ideas with eyes closed and you are no been able to do that there certain phormicalogic states tat we could talk about that facilitate that and know those are not meet a means those do exactly the opposite my the but i think people exist in varying degrees of structured and ex and unstructured internal dialogue and in in varying depths of recognition of that internal dialogue and ho or the question i suppose is is just the recognition that there is an a dialogue on going internally is that itself valuable ye and that that also can take some time severe it here is ha claim i would make that some people might find surprising but i think this is an objectively true claim about the subjectivity of most people which is that unless you you have a fair mount of train let us here just happen to be some kind of savant in this area which ben almost people by definition are not for you have a remarkable amount of training in what is called in concentration practice and in meditation ism i think i believe this is a a true claim that you know if we just yo put a a stop watch on this table and and you a people could just watch it you of the thirty seconds elapse and ism i set set all of our listeners or your viewers the task i for the next thirty seconds just pay attention to anything your breath or the f the sight of your hand or the side of the clock or i any object without getting lost in thought without getting momentarily distracted by this conversation your having with yourself ism this couple things would happen one is no one would be able to do it right and and and not just this is not just a a superficial instill frame if your life depended on it you would not be able to do it and if if the fate of civilization depended on it none of none of our listeners would be able to do this ism and yet some percentage of them a are distracted by thought that they would think tat they will actually try this experiment and think they succeeded right and for these people what at what happens as you put them on a meditation retreat and you have them spend twelve hours o day in silence doing nothing but this rights of the practice is just pay attention to the breath when they're sitting and then eventually at you incorporate everything sounds and other sensations and then you interleave that with walking meditation with their pain attention just to the sensations of lifting and moving and placing their feet and then once the practice is going you incorporate sounds and sights in everything but you in pay attention everything but the goal is for every moment i you are going to you were going to cultivate that what this the faculty of mind which you increasingly is known as mindfulness rights and mindfulness is nothing other than this very careful attention to the contents of consciousness but the crucial peace is it is not a moment of being lost in thought right you are not you you are not blocking thoughts thoughts themselves can arise but in those moments of being truly mindful your noticing thoughts as thoughts whether there whether it is language in the mind or images you are noticing those two as to cutaneous appearances in consciousness i if if more people certainly any one who thinks they can pay attention to to can do the experiment successfully that i just a suggested pay attention to something for thirty seconds without being lost in thought you put those people on in meditation retreat what they are going to experience is and on the first day they arguing to feel all yet i was i was with the breath or i was walk as with the sensations of walking and i be therefor five minutes solid and then i would get lost in thought i come back i five more men use to be lost in thought an get backbit as the days progress even ten days in to a silent meditation retreat they are going to experience more and more distraction they gong its in a seem i cay await a minute now i cannot pay attention to anything for more than five seconds right that is progress right because what they are discovering is just how intractable they are right and i sometime for some people that will be immediately obvious for some people it illectually take a a lot of practice to realize just how distracted there what you just said which was that at some point am we can start noticing our thoughts i can notice my thoughts but what you are talking about is as a goal state is not am is not being distracted by thoughts but shall seen the relationship between thoughts self and other types of perceptions and here i think recognizing and seen thoughts is a form of perception is just an entirely director perception this raises a a topic that am am also obsessed by which i think neral science can somewhat explain but still incomplete am incompletely that i the circuits of mechanics at camera are not am yet known which is about time perception and a simple analogy would be that there are lot of a small objects flying around in the space that we happen to be having this discussion but there moving fast that i cannot perceive them where there entirely stationary i cannot perceive them because of the reasons we talked about before in the visual system my eyes are moving in perfect concert with these with these small object movements and therefore they are they i am blind to them a slight shift in time perception am think of this a perhaps as som a changing the frame rate mi camera frame rates at faster frame ate you can capture slow motion slower frame rate you gan to get more of a strobe type effect if the frame rate is low enough r right could it be that our time perception is not one thing but we have one rate of perceiving time for external objects hat a given distance which we know is true another frame rate for objects that are up close we know this to be true even if those objects are moving at these act same speed victim in this would be thus sitting on a train the rungs on the fence seem to be going by very very fast but the ones in the distance seem to be moving slowly rest is the way thought the visual system an time perception interconnect at some level your on a sky scraper the little ants of cars an people down below they are moving much faster than you perceive them to move debut it is the it is a distance of an you see it you see a plain as could be going three hundred miles know are exact and it is not because of the lack of resolution the lack of resolution is incidental we know this because in animals such as hawks that have twice the degree of vacuity as far as we know they have the same a distance associated shifts in time perception could it be that we are running multiple streams of time percept multiple cones of attention that include cones of attention to our thoughts and that somehow through meditation we start to a line the frame rate for these different streams of attention that they all fall into a they all fall into the same move if you will although it is noxious u movyou with visual content what ism doing here is a clearly ism becoming a lumper rather than of smirker it's sure this violates certain rules of time perception nerd circuitry but ism not sure that it is entirely untrue either and does it survive a at all as a possible model for what you are describing and if the answers know ism perfectly comfortable n that well it say ism it is dependent on what you mean by meditation that this is what y sort the particularities of of what one is doing with one's attention under the the frame of meditation really matter bees it their ways to practice were is practise mindfulness in particular were the frame rate really does seem to go waylay up again that it has actually been some research done on this we take people in before and after a three month silent meditation retreat and you give them some kind of visual dis discrimination t ask where they have to detect tam i think they use i to o to to to to cystoscope is that the to for there someone me they present a am very quick pulses of light and in any case you can you can discriminate am just in any in any sensory channel i would imagine you can make finer grain discrimination if your practicing mindfulness in a very specific way which is to be making these fine grin discrimination more and more and do do nothing else for three months which is which is a way of practicing a your the classic n a mindfulness practice in in was called the veposson a meditation is to pay scrupulous attention to seeing hearing smelling tasting touching in a way that breaks everything down into this kind o microscopic sensory a moments in a your rather than feel your your hands pressing together what you are trying to feel with your attention and your feeling more and more is all of the mikerow sensations of pressure and temperature and movement a such that the feeling of hands completely disappears you realize that the hand as a concept and all you have is this cloud of of punctate and and a very brief sensations and that its anything you think you you you have as a date of experience as you as you bore into it with your attention it it resolves into a a this kind of idiot that diamines cloud of changing sensation and that can be even even something is as a captivating as that you know serious pain in your body m you have a yuuyou couldhave injured your neck and you have some excruciating pain in your neck if you just are willing to pay attention to it and just pay a hundred percent attention to it a you're a couple things happen one is your resistance to feeling it goes away by definition cause your now your got as is just pay attention to it and and you recognize that much of the suffering associated with the pain was born of a of the resistance to feeling it your con outracing against it and all of your thinking about it you think will will on why i i do this to myself or when you should i see a north of resistor why how long is it one a last and and you're maybe i herniated a disk all of that self talk is producing anxiety and unless saying there never anything to think about there but either you can do something about it in the moment or you cannot and much of our suffering in in the presence of pain is the result of resisting it worrying about it think is just all of the everything we are doing with our minds but just if just feeling right when you just feel it again tit it breaks apart into this this ever chain ever shifting collection of of different sensations and it is not one thing and it never stays the same and it is and that two things happen the one is there can be tremendous tremendous tat of relief that happens there war you you you you can achieve a level of equanimity even in the presence of really unpleasant living a physical sensation a and this is true of mental sensation as well as is true of emotions the classically negative emotions anger or depression or fear the moment you become willing to just feel them in all of their in a punctate a a unchangeable qualities they cease to be what they they were a moment ago they are just their and they n when you've talking about emotional states they cease to map back on to you and your self concept as meaningful in the same way that suddenly the anxiety you feel lies say before going out on stage to give a talk a moment ago if it was it had psychological meaning i felt look it ism anxious how to i get rid of this why am i the sort of person what you nor should i have taken a bateablocker this is t e conversationyore you are having with yourself the moment you just become willing to feel it as the pure energy of ouphe physiology of of of course is all release it ceases to have any meaning it just ceases to be a problem in that moment because it is no more it no more maps on to the kind of person you are than a feeling of indigestion or a pain in your in your knee maps on to the kind of person you ares just it it its just sensation anyway back to the main point here which is that if you train your attention in this way to notice the particularities of of sensory experience and emotional experience you are looking for the atoms of experience i you get better and better at that and certain things happen but one thing thatyou one thing that really do do think happens is there is a kind of frame rate change in in the the data stream where you really are just your s noticing much much more i all of that is n i very interesting way of training it is not what i tend to recommend now is is it is a great preliminary practice for what i do recommend because it gives you it re really teaches you the difference between being lost on thought and not it really teaches you what mindfulness is but it tends to be done by youninety nine point nine per cent of of people in a dualistic way which you again you your your set up to think looking ism over here is the locust of attention and and i am continually getting distracted by thought and the project is to not do that any more and actually pay attention to the breath and sounds and sensations and and every time i get lost in thought i ma to go back here but this whole dance of have lost in thought now ism now ism strategically directing my attention again all of this seems to ramify this sense of self the sense of of there there is one to be doing this there is here's somebody holding the spotlight of attention and getting better at coming back to the object of meditation i again it is inevitable that ninety nine point nine per cento people are gin a start there and stay there for some considerable period of time but the thing i to do when i talk about all of this is under cut the false assumptions that are anchoring all of that as early as possible because were it were nowhere i think you want to be is recognizing that there is no place from which to aim attention there this whole dualistic set up of subject and object is the thing that is already not there and it is not that you its not that it is there and you meditated out of existence successfully it is really not there and if you if you learn how to look for it you can see that it is not there and feel that it is not there and it no longer seems to be there right as its it is not and it becomes again a by stable percept were it you looked at it long enough an you though looking now i see the says and the face and ism i cannot unseen it and every time i look it is it is there again right and ism yet that is at to come back to the the example you gave with your am your college at standard ism whose book i know i have i have not read it as this is the he wrote a book projections right guess art ya ism i it is it is all my stack to read but ism it is the opposite what ism recommending essentially the opposite end of the continuum of the sort of internal exercise he was he he was doing rather than you he is doing something very deliberate and controlled and he is he is deliberately thinking in complete sentences and kind of common peering the the the give the machinery of thought and attention i in a way that i would imagine an not be interest to talked him about it but i would imagine it he really feels he is doing that right and there is e yon a engineer ex inside as you describe it in this way it it remind me he he is he is a physician but he is also an engineer such up about taking the the draw materials of thought and engineering something structured from it right i r i have not been in a quail's mind i you have t got a talking on that you up insure we get yes what it is you'll do that conversation at some point the but yo exact opposite if w exact opposite would be to recognize that the sense of control is a total illusion i there e could because you do not know what you are going to think next right and even he in the most laborious way at me he could he could just get is muscular as he wants with it he still does not know what he is going to think next i thought because thought simply arise right it you now to be you can run this experiment for yourself an this connects up to the topic of a free will which a we might want a touch but i may just think of any category of thing you of i asked you to think of the names of cities or o friends you have or famous people you you can you remember exist or i think of sounds or anything ism and just watch what comes percolating into consciousness right now there is there things you cannot think of father things you do not know the name of their languages you do not speak there is their famous people you have never seen or never heard of rights like you have no control over that part those those names and and faces are not going to suddenly comes trying in into consciousness but of of the the the totality of facts and figures and faces and names that you do know right only some will come vying for inclusion right and they are not and there is there is a sort of you no um we could i may guess that we know something about the neurology of this but we no depending on what can all you are you are i you are waiting for thoughts in i mes can be different if its visual or romantic or er i episode i memory n at all these things are different but i wherever you con a point your inner gaze of attention and wait for the next face or name i certain things are going to come and certain certain things are not going to come and how you land on one it they will be this process if your pain attention to you might think we'll shay we will say we go with names of cities right you just you say you will you will this of parts you will think of onion you will think of come you will think of of soon you'll thinly that these these names ill come and if i ask you to just say one right such as maniaplis is what came to mine for me as very strait for it is maniaplis the famous person was joestrummer and that just i can writ you reasons why i think they those came to mine return conversations o whatever we know we know a fair about a ma vair bit about much of this one we know that your reasons visit could be right or wrong there very likely to be wrong because we have the sort of confabulatory story telling mechanism even in an intact brain where we just we we always seem to never lack for the reasons why something came to mind and we know we can know we can manipulate people in ways that prove that people are just reliably wrong and confident confidently about the reasons why they thought of things are did things but weaving out aside even if you are completely accurate right i there are there are people's names who excites names that that inexplicably just did not come to mind and if we ran this experiment again and again again t they would not come to in if your brain was in precisely the state it was in a moment ago if we if we could return your brain to the state it was in a moment ago correcting for all the determinist i changes and all the random changes that would have to be corrected for tit just get all the synapses and the synaptic waits and everything in in the the state it was in to produce joey strummed and maniapolists right you are going to we remind that move that that part of the move of your life you are going to say job's strummed and maniapolists a trillion times in a row right this is why you my view the notion of free will makes absorb no sense i and you can at as much random toss that process as you wand it still does not get you the freedom people think they have i there is another conversation to have about you why one of that matters and why things only get better once you admit to yourself that free will's an illusion a and yes you can get in shape and you can diet andyou can do all things you want to do and you do not have to think about free will i b ut the from it from a contemplative meditative point of view the thing to notice is that everything is just springing in to view right you are this no place from which you are offering you're next thought because you would have to think it before you think it right it there is just there is just this fundamental mystery at our backs that is disgorging everything that we experience and what if ism speaking if ism talking about something and i have some command of that i information i can often sense what ism into say next an on myself saying it fully that is ye sand on something else i certainly said things i did not intend to say or never thought i would say in life but i when engaged in speech or action it it least gives us the illusion i think that we somehow have more command over our thoughts you well you have a script and me s that their things a lot about and you have talked of you have talked about them a lot and you you have the things you want to say about those things and the things you you you do not want to say or you you would not want to say ism and you can it still is a bit of a high wire act because you can misspeak or you can fail to get to the end of a sentence ruin a dramatically correct way and and it is again all the subjectively this whole process is mysterious to you right you you do not know how you have follow the rules of english grammar right likely my i just you s a it your tongue is doing it somehow and i and when it fails it fails and you are just as surprise as the next my that it failed and you mispronounce a word and of i i do not know what happened there but it is if it keeps happening ism the a whereby i had a stroke and it stops ism ism ism not in a work about it i it is still mysterious even when you are doing it in a very i wrote deliberative and repetitive way but when when you are talking about something you have talked about a lot and you sort of know where you going to go right n this out we have many conversations this ism it is somewhat analogous to a golf's wing war's how you want to do it is con be all kind of errors that an to creep into your execution of it in real time but there is you be basically have a pattern and you have certain linguistic patterns which you are following ism again none of this is the proof of a free will but i will grant you that in a phenomena logically it it feels different then just waiting for the next thought to come but my point is i is that even if you are ism and you can trim know to the simplest possible thing and you take two things you t to drink right you may you you coffee and you t and you are deciding which to have i both or on offer you get two cups in front of you and and the question as which you knower i here have got watering have got coffee which om mi going to drank next it is it is incredibly it is the simplest possible decision and no matter how long i make this decision process i could literally sit for an hour trying to figure to which to reach for next and i could have my reasons why and i could have my all myself talk there is it's there is going to be a final change in me that is going to be the proximate cause of me deciding one over the other and that no matter how laborious i can make it seem in in terms of my reasoning about it ism it is going to be fundamentally mysterious as to why i went with one rather than the other re whatever story i have because it is it it is it is still ben to be as mysterious as you thinking of job's drummer hand you absolute of the existence of mailmen to just as much and yet she simply did not occur to you right's it is it is fundamentally mysterious there people who are even more famous than job's drummer to you right who whom am sure you may be somebody you have thought a lot about but but there they're people who if we could just inventory your conscious life going back last ten years they're people who you have thought about more than joe'sdrummer yet they did not appear right d that is that is mysterious right and they could have but they did not and ism and what what ism saying is that this mystery never gets banished in our experience whatever stories we have to tell about it bike because if the story is oh well i went for the water because some i youknowi i i think have been drinking to much coffee an i listen to drew superman's podcast and he was saying talking about caffeine i think a price good for us bey i down over year cops just say that is actually the causal chain i listened your podcast to something about caffein now ism now ism self conscious about my coffee and take right but that is just just adding what couple of links to the chain there is the still these fundamental mystery of well why did i find that persuasive and why why did i find a persuasive now and not five minutes ago when i was drinking the coffee right why did i just remember it now or why was it effective not what you you only have you are experience in every moment it is precisely what it is and not one bit more and this subsumes even moments of real resolve and efforts and picking yourself up by your bootstraps and changing everything you are on a diet and you are tempted e chocolate and you think you are bout to reach me this now ism not ism not break in this get this diet is actually in a stick right et why did that arise in that moment and not at this analogous moment on your last it right and why did it arise now to precisely to the degree that it did why why will it be as effective as it will be and have the half life that it will have and not ten per cent more or less all those are always mysterious dear could we give a as we do before am an evolutionary an a development a explanation and evolutionary explanation might be that am directed attention an action is metabolically demanding it would be a inefficient tor impossible for us to be in constant deliberate action with access to all the relevant information as to why we would do anything our ideas literally spring to the surface a at the last possible moment a in order to offset a he metabolic the great metabolic requirements of having ideas that r relate tidal directed action or that go directed action is expensive that is one idea the other idea would be and we know this as a fact which is that initially the brain is fairly crudely wired that is not true within the narial circuits the control breathing a heart rate et camera but within the narrow circuits of a sensory perception thought at camera the fairly crudely wired and then across development there is a progressive pruning backhand am a also in parallel to that a strengthening of the connections that under lie directed action and thought a and here i do not mean directed as in free will i mean just that that can i can decide to imagine an apple and imagine that apple for instance am but your dares seers to be some maintenance of the the random fine random wiring in systems i mean we seem this even in in worms in flies in in you known a called lower o invertebrates and lower vertebrates and we see this in humans and it seems to be a that there is a lot of background spontaneous activity enough some collectrodes into the brains of a human's macaw carnivores and miles and in every case most of what you hear is called fashion has nothing to do with hashish u a radio miners ere picking up a bunch action potentials was er listening to a chorus of action potentials but it is rare define inner on that faithfully confirms to represent some sensory stimulus in the world and you can arrange that marriage experimentally that you can arrive at the strong signal o noise events but i was always struck by how much noise there is in the system all around all the time enable argue is the noise really noise et camera and you know a there is still lot o bade about that but i can imagine that some of the o the spontaneous nature of thoughts just relates to the fact that there is a lot of background spontaneous activity in the brain now why that is is the whole other discussion but a but if i were to for set up to constraints that there is a lot of spontaneous activity it is gonagenerate random thoughts thankfully not much random action although there is lot bit of random action in our daily lives and then against that say will any deliberate thought or motion is going to be expensive it is a metabolic we expensive organ to begin with and you deserted evolution has arrived at a place where am spontaneous quivering up of things upon which deliberate thoughts and action are superimposed is the best arrangement over all for this very metabolically demandiorgan is that is that o mean what i basely gave was this kind of a biological description of of of one just one narrow aspect of it but can we get comfortable with that and the reason i ay get comfortable is that you knife and here i enmity ism forcing a little bit of a strip teas towards what i think i and everyone else wants to know which is how to meditate and why in particular meditation convinces us that something does not necessarily have to be eliminated but that was actually never there have e were we are now set up of a sort of almost a i you are not contradicting yourself by any means but in my mind there is a contradiction and here is the contradiction i love this statement that meditation over time or done properly reveals to us that actually not trying to make the gap between after an observer go away it was actually never there to me that is one of the more important statements that i perhaps have ever heard and it inspires me to go further down this path of meditation because have never experience that ism not deliberately and certainly not through meditation if i ever experienced it it was transient enough that i ism intrigue to to currency more on the one hand you are telling me something was never there and there is a profound experience to be had by any one that is willing to do the work to arrive at that experience of the loss of that illusion on the other hand ism hearing that there is a am a profound gap that really does exist which is that yo we we believe that our thoughts are am somehow from us i and indeed therefrom in in the craniavault some place may been the body a it as well but that we over a a tribute the degree to which we are that and that is us in a way that is volitional that we control and at once ism hearing that there is something there is an illusion that we can eliminate n on the other hand ism hearing that there is an illusion that we cannot eliminate and maybe these are unrelated and upbringing them in it in it in an unimportant way that seems only important to me but somehow i i cannot resolve these two and maybe the thing to do then is is can we separate them in terms of a practice to witness them that would allow us to resolve them separately right i think i ism hearing the primly there is this i but let me like an a back at the whole free will discussion consists it is if it really is the clips idea of this in thathat ism the obverse of which is the illusiothe illusion of the cell at least i i might b n net i is o get they are the opposite sides of a aye acari because to me they seem very different yen essence know csbeause what ism calling the sense of self and what people what i think most per all feel as their your sense of self is the this feeling of i me is it is the feeling of being the locust of attention but it is also the feeling of being the locust of agency i can do the next thing i i who is doing this who is reaching for the cup i am right i i intended this and now ism doing the thing you may end my intent my conscious intention is the proximate cause of my reaching right ism ism the out and ism the author of my thoughts and actions essentially and ism and my and my specific uses of attention rights i can i can pay attention to the breath i get lost an thought i come back to the breath bi ism the lot that the ins on some level the thoughts themselves are more or of my doing something i with with almost a authorial intent right ism think likeyouat look what the he's has got talking about ism i know ism think i know it you know who is thinking the thoughts i am right lie that that the person who really does not get what ism saying is thinking something that rice what the fuss has got talking about i y i know ism here ism self ism ism ism m a body of a mind i can reach for things that these are these intentional actions are different from things that happen to me right i voluntary action is different from an involuntary one a having a tremor is different from consciously deciding to pick up a glass rectify obviously everything ism saying about meditation and the self and free will in order to be a same picture of a human mind and a reality has to conserve the data of experience such that yes i can acknowledge the difference between a tremor and a a deliberative you know voluntary motor action ism and you know and the things you do volitionally are different not just psychologically and behaviourly but they adjust have different implications for thy dining a court of law you accidentally hit some one with your car or you didn't on purpose that still at a distinction that matters right it is in importantly tells us a lot about the global properties of your mind such that we have a sense of what you are likely to do in the future you are someone who likes running over people with your car you are a a psycho path who we need to worry about you are some one who did by accident well then you may be i culpable for for the level of negligence that ta allow that to happen but yours you are very different person and we we we treat you differently and we were wise to ism my we pecan those witless back at all of that ism there is this men there is some fundamental ththerere some false assumptions of you the underlying logic of this process which i think it is worth addressing and it is actually i was a cool found object in the news that i i i talk about at one point i forget were it is not in in the waking a bap but there's a story hthatthi stumbled on on the internet a i things about twelve or thirteen years old of a ism a tourist bus in i think was norway who shat someone is in a northern rope and had about thirty people on it and one person was not was a described as an alien woman a another all the went they went to a rest stop and everyone got off the bus a and they shopped and had luncheon and that this an woman changed her clothing a for whatever reason and they all got back on the bus a i think the relevance of it being an in woman is the language barriers that that that explained what later happened i everyone gets back on the bus the amen woman has changed her her clothing and the buss is about to leave but then some one notice as hay that there here was an sin woman wo got off the bus who is not it has not come back yet and the tell the driver this i and the poses e problems now every one's waiting for this person to return but in fact everyone was on the bus that this woman had just changed her clothing was not recognized by her fellow travellers a everyone gets concerned as this this tourist does not she show up and they start looking for right and they cannot find her and a search party is formed and the alien woman because of the whatever language barrier a thought i herd that there was a missing tourist she joins the search party which in fact is looking for her right and this goes on into the night and their readying helicopters that in a further a dawn patrol to find the dismissing tourist now it some point along the way i think was it three in the morning this tourist realizes that she is the object of the search right and obviously the whole thing unravels she she confesses that she changed her clothes and that the problem dissolved but the problem is not solved by the the logic that the seeker is expected right sos it is not true to say that the missing tourist was found in in the way that was expected right cause a missing tourist was never lost the missing tourist was part of the search party right and when you think about it from her point of view what happened she is part of the search party she is looking for the missing tourist not knowing that the she in fact is the missing tourist what happens at the moment she realizes that everyone is looking for her rightly what what is the the search is not consummated in the way that is implied by the project of everyone is use of attention i and yet the problem evaporates and there is something deeply analogue about the structure of that and the the the meditative j earning it precisely in again not talking about all the changes in the e possible changes in the contents of consciousness that could be good which again cut that come along for the ride anyway when you when you do the thing ism talking about it is not on this point of looking for the cell and not finding it and there is the sense that look at the self is here and it is a problem it is the the string upon which all of my conscious states mostly unhappy ones are strong right it is it is the thing that is at the center of my anxiety it is it is it is the it is the thing that i do not feel good about is he thing that on criticize i sort of let implied ism it is the center of my problem and now ism trying to feel better and meditation has been handed to me as a as a possible remedy for my situation and and it is build is a remedy in fact it is it is it is ism ism hearing from the sky that this is the thing that is going cause me to realize that myself is not where or as i thought it was ism now's going to look right and again you are you are the sense is i start out far away from the goal here i start out with a problem ism now meditating on the evidence of my enlightenment right i i can feel my problem i feel that ism distracted and intractable and i feel as the sort of cramp at the center of my life that is me and ism not as happy as i want to be ism not as confide as i want to be ism ism more intractable than i want to be and now ism pain attention to the breath right ism this is what the search party feels this is what the the confused tourist feels in her own search party and she is she's looking she is looking for the missing person and this or are the the angle of o the inclination of all of this is and the logic of it is all wrong understandably i given how we we all get into the situation but it is useful to continually try to under undercut it and ism recognize that the that the thing that is being looked for is is actually right on the surface which is either the there is no one looking there is no place from which you are paid your pain attention to the breath or to sound or noticing the next thought arise this sense that you are over here doing that thing is actually what is to be thinking and not knowing that you are thinking you are not there is it there is a thought is an undercurrent of thought that is going inspected in that moment and ism there is just a there is a continually looking for the mind a looking for the center of experience a looking for the one who is looking which again which is the kind of the the orienting practice here and it is a lot more i say about this obviously ism over waking out but ism it is it is the experiment you have to perform in order to get ready to recognize that this holt is the search party was formed in in error essentially and that the problem that you are trying totusalve with this practice does evaporate in in a similar way which is you do not actually get there in the way that you are hoping for right is like you drop out the bottom of this thing in a in an unexpected way it is not ism there's actually another a cone off similar am parable or or anecdote that i do not non remember men or suffer and ism sure s been appropriated in a different ways but by many different traditions but there is this you of the the case of somebody is lost in a town and there they are asking for directions you know you can put the put this in in in man hate and you canlessy wandering manhattan in your your stories you n know where anything is not yous stop and ask some one you a what you wear a central park and the person thinks for a second they says i oh him unforced you cannot get to central park from here right if that is a very strange and yet you think bout that for second you realize look that's a at'sn't absurd climb there is no place that you cannot get to from the place you are starting yo know on earth right ' no familiar to describe the physical a relationships between anything and the world yet that just not the world we live in right somebody is a funny thing is it but it but on some level that is true of meditations you cannot get there from here that the sense of you the sense of you as subject is not brought along to this thing you are looking for right you are you are it is almost it most your you are you are making a fist and you are trying to get to an open hand the fist does not get to take that journey as a fist rightly you do not the fist does not go along for the ride the fist comes a part right and and on some level that our subjectivity is a e kind of an into intend attentional fist it is it it is a contraction of energy again it is it much bound up in thought for for a most of us most of the time that is and t t when when properly inspected there is just this evaporation of the starting point but there is not this there is not this fulfillment of ism going to get this fist is going to just going to if i if life gets good enough if i get concentrated en a focus enough if i austere enough if i renounce enough if i desire less if i enough with enough good an intentions this fist is going to move into some sort of sublime condition right that is not the logic of the the process i i really are these a models and analogies for conscious experience both as most people experience them and a harbor them in ends as a way to frame what is possible through a through a proper meditation practice do want to talk about what a proper meditation practice looks a bit but at some point am i do want to raise a a model of maybe even just perceptional awareness to see if it a survives the filters an and you provided a but first just even if briefly in the we and return to it what does this meditation practice whore set of practices look obviously a the a is a wonderful tool have started using it as a mention the beginning my my fathers been using it for while in many people of drive great benefit from it but if we were to in break it down meditation into some basic component parts as we have broken down a normal perceptional experience in some of its component parts yo a i can just throw out some things that i associate with meditation and maybe you can elaborate on in halls mere may not be applied for instance am there is almost always a a ceasing of motor robust motor movement i know there walking meditation and forth that seems sitting or lying down and perhaps not always but often limiting our visual perception closing the eyes am directing a mind's eye some place is there a dedicated effort toward generating imagery am what are the component parts and where ism really going with this is why would those component parts eventually allow for this dissolution of the fist or the am the realization that there is no am distinction between a actor an observer and so ye the i will subancer the second question first ultimately meditation is not a practise that you are adding to your life it is not it is not a doing more of anythings that you actually ceasing to do something t is ultimately non distraction i may it is ultimately recognizing what consciousness is when you are no longer distracted by the the automatic arising of of thought its not the thoughts do not arise not that you cannot use them as not that you become irrational or or a i unintelligent to me i all that you you still have all your tools but there every everything is in plain view an there the is an analogy and into benbuddhism which i love which is a you come in the fine of stage of meditation a thoughts are thieves entering an empty house n now there is nothing for them to steal is of u in the usual case thoughts are there really is something in leopard he every time a thought comes ism not meditating any more and and not only that i feel terrible because of what ism thinking about most of the time right and it is totally understandable at thoughts seem a problem in the beginning and yo for certain types of meditation they are explicitly thought of as a problem because you are trine to focus on one thing to the exclusion of everything else including thought and that is a you what i call concentration practice earlier and that is a it is that is a training that can be good to do it becomes a tool that you can use for whether kinds of of of insight but is a very specific and kind of riddle skill in the end iris is is to skill just am in to attention of one thing ism a do that well that everything else can a fade out and it somewhat analogous to what you you described in the visual system if you if you quit blazer focus to one fixation point everything else in your visual field begins to to fade out but but meditatively if you have a later focus on any one thing what whether the breath or or a candle flame whatever it is you not only tit dos me flislis us the breath for for a second a cause your eyes are can be closed a in you can lose all sense of everything that you can lose all sense of hearing and youyoure your physical body can disappear and i literally can become incredibly subtle and vast and drug a and many people approach meditation thinking conclimbing the latter of those changes into subtlety and vastness that is the whole that is the whole game right and it can be a deeply rewarding game to play and it also does come with all kinds of ancillary benefits a me all the focus and the calm and the and the second of smoothness of emotional states an me all that comes with greater concentration and it it can be quite wonderful a but again at best that is a tool to aim in the direction that ism talking about now with with respect to meditation which relates to more or what i would call in a mindfulness generically a and ultimately cane ism non dual mindfulness mindfulness generically and for for most people certainly in in the beginning dualistically is just the pact is of pain careful attention to whatever is arising ones own right now in the beginning it is it is it is natural to take a single object the breath as a starting point is not of an anger a but very very quickly owing over the course of even in your first weak of doing this people you knowteachers and a various sources of information will recommend that when once you get some facial at one you once the difference between being lost in thought and actually inattention to the breath well then you can open it up to everything t sounds and other sensations in the body and and a mood s in emotions and even ultimately thoughts themselves and very quickly you can recognize that thoughts are not intrinsically the enemy to this practise they are also just spontaneous appearances in consciousness that can be observed a but for some considerable period of time people will feel that there is a place from which that observation as happening right there is just say you know am now the one who is being mindful a and however a tenured that sense of self can be and pagan i can you can get very expansive and you can you can lose yours you get anything just a modicum of concentration it becomes very drug and you get you yet the the boundaries of your body dissolve than you feel feeling of having a body can disappear and a and you if your eyes are closed your visual feel can may most people when they close our eyes initially they just forget about their visual field but it is if you close your eyes right now you notice your visual feel is fully present and it is you recall it dark but is not quite dark there is a sort of scintillating a some field of of of color and shadow a that is there been the darkness of your closed eyes and that can become a sky domain of on vast a a you know visual expression that opens up as you as you get more concentrate with with your eyes closed right you you can very much be aware of seeing with your eyes closed n in meditated practice a but from the point of view of mindfulness the logic is not to care about any of the interesting changes in experience that come as a result of practising in this way because what you whit the the the underlying goal is is to be more and more equanimous with changes is not to grasp ut what is pleasant or interesting and not to push what is unpleasant or or you know boring or or you know otherwise not engaging away a what you want is just a kind of a sky mind that just allows everything to appear and you are not clinging to anything or or or reacting to anything could ask you what your thoughts are about the differences between nouns adjectives and verbs in the contexts of what we are stalking about in your describing and there reason bring the elf is that a as i know everything biology is a process we we would never ever say oh the perception of that red line on a painting is in is a now right i me tit is an event in visual system our your abstracting some understanding about that thing in the outside world and i think it is very useful in thinking about the brain a in a people know us i notice hat i excuse me actively avoid the use of the word mine because i figure i especially with you sitting across from me that all a a step in it if i if i do but the brain generates a series of perceptions or would have you by through processes not nouns and when thing about biology i thing of development is a is a is an ark of processes am aging is an ark of perception is an act proxy they just exist on different time skills and a little bit of what ism hearing is that inside of an effective meditation practice there is a little bit of it of a am certainly non judgement but discarding of the the noun and the adjective a modes of language red apple of it is a red apple but then you we need to eliminate some other adjectives about it is a rotten apple it is a in a ripe apple and instead view the appearance and disappearance of that apple as a it is just a thing a process as opposed to an event and now events could we could really get into the language aspect of the duchess reveals how am diminished languages to describe the workings of the brain at somelevel am i do not o if any of this resinates but it but it seems to me the goal or one of the goals is to start to understand the algorithm that is the fleeting nature of perception but do not focus on any one single perception and then do not even focus on one single algorithm but to at some level there say am what is revealed to the meditator over time is some sort of macroscopic principle about am the way perceptions work at a deeper love right that there that there serve a a deeper principle there that sits below a certainly our normal everyday awareness but that in paying attention to the mechanics of all the stuff and not judging those mechanics not naming those mechanics or just naming them and let them pass by that there is some action function some verb is real and that maybe that verb maybe the word to describe that verbs mindfulness maybe mindfulness is is really just a verb to describe that i do not know am butts there anything here a mi create mi like creating just useless straw or if there is if there is actually a seed here of something real but to me any time i not understand something in biology ere psychology i train brought in the time domain an thinking terms of verbs not nouns or adjectives your yer no theta is very useful and that is somewhat a case and to this distinction i making between dualistic an nondualistic ways of experiencing the world is even you dualistically everything is still a process right and and we are misled by the reification the noun talk gives us and this this apply is not just to something mindfulness but even to something thyself right the sense of self is also a process and is is s itsuverb i is not it is a work worth selling more than we ourselves right and i and there i even even appropriate uses of of the herself that do not go away even when you when you recognize that the the the for subjectself is an illusion there the states of self right were you you can recognizing your life that you inhabit very different modes of of being depending on the contact their moments where you just by walking into a certain building you suddenly transition into a different state of self suddenly you pass through a door and now you are a customer in a store right we know what that custom or feeling is you are now the person whose getting the attention is a very kind of formalized type of attention from the person who is running the store and ore a restaurant your customer and a restaurant right that say i i just remembers of this kind of running i that is a it was born of a mismatch o of this it'll come back ness him but m there a we would go though you can be youyou can be a student in the presence of a teacher you can be apparent in the presence of a of a son or a daughter you can be spouse and presence in the present of your spouse and all of those shadings of godlike the the change in context i really does ushering some fundamental psychological changes in just the states of consciousness that are available to you i d and it is and some of this is really imei'm sure we can understand a lot about this been o personally and and you o generically but it is pretty mysterious a man i coming their people who i know whom i know ism with them in a certain way and based on something on getting off to them i i cannot be that i ism i am effortlessly one way with them and there is no way i could be that way with somebody else right it is just on on oh it is pharimonds or their in their face just the way they are their facial expression but that they're people with whom ism really count i effortlessly funny and they're people with whom you could not even it would never occur to me to be funny no matter what happened you less li and and i have longstanding relationships with with these people select it it is just very i you know all that is very mysterious but anyway the the difference there is is not in this core sense of subject in relationship to all the objects it is in con the the states of self and but an and all that is just is very very right all this this pattern of changes it is a pattern of what is available and what is not available the capacities that are the are the come on line or not i in in those serious contacts i but now the the memory just had which i had had had a long time that was one these these moments where i realized the power of these shifts in contexts for states of self i once a i was e ism a young man i think was i was i probably twenty tor and single and you just trying to figure out how how how do you meet women an how to how does one get confident to do this well and ism i i i walked into a restaurant and a ism o kind of a woman was walking toward me i you knowhow to toward the front door the resting but she is walking toward me in away where i just by default assumed she was the hostess in the restaurant i but she was not as the hostess she was jot say a i some one who just eaten there i guess i i walked through and she comes out an sot that that t find about misunderstanding in me that set up by little just this change in architecture and i and i just set high to her in a way that i would i presumably i would say high to any hostess who was coming up to to ask me whether were i want to sit am but what id actually happened as i had said high to a total stranger in a way that i tended at that point never to say high to tell strangers cause i was shy and u know just a ism but apparently i gave her a ten thousand what hot high of like lee all of the confidence you would have if you if you were that sort of person and it just ushered in a complete this is i went to my table and this woman i came back into the restaurant gave me her one number right which was something it was just that bought completely foreign experience to me and it was base completely on my misunderstanding of the situation i was right and and anyway that among the understanding us among the misunderstanding that one can have and then ism action engage in life i a that was of some one of dappenone yet you know but but then you realize that booklet but then there are certain people who recognize this machinery to whatever were or have n unnatural aptitudes for bringing certain things on line or not such that o ka they can make these state they can consciously make these states of self you know this kind of this level of gregariousness say available to them indifferent you in the circumstances where it is is actual useful to the if if you if you are single and you want to meet people well as is is actually very helpful to to feel confident enough the just say high to stranger is and of somehow they are doing anatto be to be know on line in that way where at that point in my life in that circumstance by hat by default i was going t ignore this stranger who i was passing by in the doorway of a restaurant but thinking she was the hostess i was engaging her fully ism anyway you can consciously again this does not invoke free will at all but yes you can consciously side to play with this with these mechanisms such that you can decide you what state states of self i would be more normative to have on a given what you want in life and and you can become increasingly attentive to the ways in which you get played by the world your kind of instrument your mind is a kind of instrument your brain as a kind of instrument titis continually getting played by the situations you were in and you can become more of i and intelligent curator of your conscious states in your conscious capacities just by noticing the changes in you i i in graduate school this some had talk about i think it some point in waking up this being very stark for me because i had i i was a you no an old graduates do and had had taken eleven years off at standard you between mysoph morn junior year wrights i when i went back to school la about a living the petit was debut it is o stamford at this you you might know this i they have the stop out policy were you never really drop out you just stop aster you i can always go back and don't have to write letters saying that you still exist every of two years as you do in other schools anyway i showed up after eleven years and but you now o i was really on a dead line and i felt late for everything on and of you a finishing my degree in as quickly as i can ism as non to graduate than i jump in to graduate school and ism an old radar doing and ism i there's real sense of con of urgency ism late i should have done this earlier i want get the stuff done i but then nine eleven happened and i you ask just as i had finish my corse work at you of getting my my party i i was just getting into my research but nine eleven intersected with my life in such a way that i just had to drop everything and write my first book and i did that and then i just had to drop everything in write my second book because of the response to the first book and as mentally i had four years where i was a wall d doing my party but i was still had a toe in the lag and i was still showing up occasionally but i was becoming this kind of cautionary tale from the point of view of grad school but was also becoming hie a famous you r send my famous a writer i as my first book had been at n your times best cellar and i i just i was you knows i was getting some notoriety's or a writer and si was doing things liken i was giving a head talk but i still had not finished gradual school wright it was just it was some i think that time it's write maybe i had just finished gradual school when i beget the ted talk but ism anyway did i was in rowing in two boats and one boat was sinking or you're showing every cosign of of being damage and i was literally in a ouzo getting letters from the head of the department saying that were concerned about you but on the other hand i was becoming a but the queasy celebrity in that world too i you a least in a world that was overlapping i was having the experience of going in the the moment were this crystallized with for me in a in a fair my peculiar way was i have a meeting it three o'clock with my adviser who is just the i mark coin an the brain mapping center an you see hi as a fantastic i ism great adviser i i did not extract as much wisdom from him as i should have ism brilliant scientist and you know he is for him ism late r at least in my head he is not that he was righting me hard but at my head ism very self conscious about how ism not living up his expect expectations at this point ism i have a meeting with him t three o'clock and ism just kind o wilting under might his gaze an my own imagined inner gaze of his ism but that two hours later i have a meeting with his boss a dinner meeting with his boss who wants to meet with me to get advice on launching his book we have the same publisher but ism the much bigger author at adnorton and and he's coming me for advice ism and ism rick ashamed between two diametrically opposite self states that i again this comes down to architecture as literally the state i was in walking into one building and then leaving and walking into another building on the same campus ism and they were completely opposite self concepts an on in in one contact ism a fuck u in another contacts ism a celebrity then you have mastery and virtuality and and and were developing it very quickly ye and but begin this a kind of stark version of that but every one has some version of this just in bouncing between talking to their mam and then talking to a their best friend and then talking to a stranger than and to talking to some one who is who is very successful talking some one is not very all you notice your vulnerability to all of this stuff and ultimately what you want is a level of psychological integrity that that is truly divorcible from that now that you ism not ism not saying you are ever going to get at perfect this there is always going to be some i mean it i i cannot i cannot talk about the ultimate fulfilment of this process ism not ism not ism not a buddhi i must saying i i i finish the project but ism i think there is more and more you as you became become sensitive to these changes and you become sensitive to what is to actually not be psychologically reactive and i not be definable bi your own self concept your own you're not identifying with anything you are not hanging your hat on anything you are not thinking about yourself in terms in in inn in the kind of terms that you would export to others and then care about what they think about you right your there is a kind of invulnerability i that that arises that is not born of being well defended it is born of a a being evaporated rights you are no longer keeping score in those ways i once again were are at the i really appreciate that description because i these days ism ism really intrigued by i something we haveknown for a long time that i you certainly familiar with is prefuntaf quartet as ability to establish context dependent rule sets a strop task will be a basic example of in reading numbers or letters on on cards and then switching to having to report the colors of the letters are members are written in basic task but freevfon the quartets obviously important for setting context dependent thought and behavior in directed action an at an but within the context of all these different i variations of the self depending on graduate school or relationship were sitting alone in one's room yet there different rule sets arise but in somehow we are able to have a sense a coherent sense of self that encompasses all of those ism functional people can i a toggle between them as needed and not overlap them inappropriatelyles not the extent that it is i career failing or life failing although there are sad examples of that many of which exist in a the twitter space i know several colleagues not directly of mind but people who i through mistakes made with their thumbs where they forgot context i ere forgot to realize that the context on social media is near infinite but a content tat exist in their head might not be clear in the way that they communicated something and they lost their cops by saying what were perceived as insensitive things in some cases we are in fact offense of intensive things in some cases its debatable right i in any case i think that the the the image that now comes to mind or relates to something you said several times that ism it is not about eliminating something it is about revealing that something was never actually there and then in terms of sensory experience and this these different aspects of the self have this image in my mind of of i it'd not an experienced cut diver but have done enough of it in a born wet suit you were complete wets it with the hood and this idea you know you're born into that wet suit you might think that now you you nogeup or lean up against a wall and you experience it one way right and but were you to shed that wet suit you withers the incredible landscape of some atisensory experience that i had no idea the goes way beyond levels of sensitivity rid know you can fine to point discrimination and light strokes and is to be positive or negative pain in other ways to but we you describing as a century that the wet suit was never really there it but was created through a series of in of action steps an what i think what were a migrating towards here is a end of i for most none into give i or non reflective action steps that reveal to us that in fact we are not wearing the what suit now you raised one am topic which i i think is analogous to the sweatsuit which is this notion of distraction then normally distraction is masking what would otherwise be a a better experience of life i i can think of distraction as falling into two different bens one would be the kind of distraction that is internally generated the fact that thoughts arise and pull me down different alleyways and avenues of my of my brain in my thoughts in my experience and then the other would be a an end that that would compete with my ability to really focus on something and then another form of distraction which captures my ability to focus intensely but has me focussing on the wrong things and here i think the judgment of wrong is it is reasonable to include if for instance ism being impulsively yank to something on social media i being impulsively yank to someone else is pain and experience and somehow confusing that with my own experience this is an empathy but just in yanks around my attention as a rootlike s calcic over here over there ism not feeling as if ism the one standing behind that spot control or ism not the spotlight recent is to keep with the where we have been building up here could you tell us alibi about distraction and tell me whether not these two forms are in any way accurate or in accurate i be happy for them to be inaccurate whether r not the other forms of distraction that we need to be on the look out for and again i think what most people are seeking is what is the way to much is enhance our ability to focus but dished this wets so cloak that limits our experience that ism calling an that you have called distraction yet get what this to distraction as is one component it the the other hat aspect of it is identification with thought i identical that the the feeling of self is bound up in the sense that that ism the ism the thanked ism the one attending ism the one ruler on the innerkind of the inner homunculus that vulnerable to experience ism and think it can be gratified by it or not and it is constantly trying to improve it or initiate negative aspects of it ism is the is the sense that there is kind of a a ride or on the horse of consciousness as supposed o just consciousness and its contents it again it if it rise atop this illusion of control ism et camera too go all way back to to the the question you asked about just what is in i what i recommend as a starting point for for meditation i some of your assumptions are in fact true yes its it is it is i often recommend the beginning people close their eyes and you do a sitting practise of at an in tit is different from a walking practice and you can do both but people tend to start you a sitting with your eyes closed but again ultimately where this is going is it is not an art of meditation properly recognize is not an artifice that you are adding to your life it is not it is not even a practice it is it is less rather than more and and therefore it is all coincident with a youeverpotentially every waking moment there is nothing there is nothing that you can do with your attention once how to meditate that inprincipl excludes meditation cause my meditation is just a a recognition of an intrinsic character of consciousness in each moment and all you have in each moment it is consciousness and it is contents whatever you are doing a in the beginning you you you will be very deliberate and precious about deciding to practice meditation you will set aside ten minutes in the morning and you will do that and then and it will seem very different from the next ten minutes when you are spilling out on to your to to duelist and your your transfigure out what the day looks right but ultimately you want to erase this boundary between formal practice in the rest of life such that there is it it is just not remotely findable and and i and that that is that is achievable and i think from the very beginning you can relax this conceptual distinction between meditation and its antithesis because it is not it is not at the level of anything you are doing it is the level it is at the level of what is happening in your relationship to thought you know i what what can you notice when when you note it is the transition from and the by the by stable percept and or you are looking at the at the am the image and you see nothing you will say this of the dalmatian you know is just the spots on the paper and you just you do not see you do not see anything and then all of a sudden the dalmatian or the face of jess or whatever the images pops out and then you see it it is the transition from nothing to something right that you the practice becomes the transition from being lost in thought and then waking up and brit you very much breaking the spell of thought identification with thought is very much waking up from a dream and having it is that that transition the the whole you having a dream and this couple things are true there my it it really is a kind of it is it is a it is a psychosis that is just not we do not problematic because you are safely in bed and you are not moving o unless you have got some kind of in ta sleep disorder you are not walking around harming yourself or anybody else but to be in bed and to not know it and to think you are running along a beach or your n tat getting tried for murder and a court of law or whatever the thing is that you are completely delusional about right that is psychosis right and ans it you are fundamentally unaware of your circumstance and then you the two things can happen there you can either be come used within the dream right which is interesting in this whole as a whole phenomenology of that which am can be practised but more commonly you can just wake up from the dream and all of a sudden the problem you thought you had is no longer there and a and you have a completely different context for your conscious likely now you are in bat you're safely in bed all all the while there really is something analogous when you break this identification with thought rat you are just your having a thought that seems to be some kind of you you i moral or psychological emergency and and yet you can you can the moment you see daylight around it the moment you see that that the mind is larger than then that this mere appearance right then you have it suddenly have a degree of freedom that that a moment ago was just unthinkable right and you are also you recognize you outcome to in a way you recognize your circumstance in a way that you were not a moment ago when you were just talking yourself when you ware just identical to that conversation i this all all to say that that ultimately meditation limit is again there is another apparent paradox here many people do not know much about meditation will say things well for me running is my meditation or scheme or rock climbing or plain the guitar was something they to do that gives them an experience a flow that is what that is what they go to to feel better and that that is the opposite of all that in the chaos of their lives or the that not their time on twitter whatever it is in virtually every case it is it is not true to say that that is effectively meditation you are not kin by learning to play the guitar you are not in to learn what ism calling meditation and you are not in a learn it by psychlane or getting getting no matter how good you get at any of those things you are not in to learn it by doing those things but paradoxically when you are not really but it can seem a paradox once how to meditate then you can meditate doing all o those things right meditation's totally compatible with playing the guitar scheme or your doing any ordinary thing you to do right once how to meditate and again it is totally natural in the beginning to formalizes that and to set aside time each day to do it because it is a it is a training and it is something that in the beginning you have to get used to but once you have once you are getting used to it then there is no good reason not to be experiencing this thing ism calling meditation this the insight young that the the centrelessness of consciousness that the the non self would of consciousness i you should experience it when you are plain your favorite sport or when your you haven a conversation with somebody and the then the real then to come back to your initial assumption about eyes closed a lot of practice it even formal practice can be done eyes open and it is important to do it eyes open because much of our angering of our sense of self is is base on visual use me witaui just we we know that you've people the right visual use you can trains locate their sense of self you in give them an out of body experience you with a t with a video display where y can literally make them feel you go there is a body swapping illusion you can make them u can make them feel that there in another person's body looking back at their body if you if you you run the cameras the right way have done this a seeing in to midship of you they create an avatar for you and then your bodily movements generate the movements of the avatar and you start gaining presence as they call it in or lingo very quickly and then pretty soon you lose sense of your own bodily representation and you and it is a little easy of what is curious to me is in going back into t you course never left but back into your actual body when the goggles pop off the world seems almost overwhelming the number of sensory stimuli entering a laboratory room which is actually quite sparse exactly what you describe this translocation of of notions of self through usual experience but conversely when you lose the sense of self wit the the sense self om talking about it can be especially vivid and insolent with eyes open because because much many of your reference points to self would are delivered visually right especially into social situations an ism talking to you you are looking back at me rightly you are the implication of your gaze is that ism over here behind my face implicated by your gas this of the sense that your looking at something is the sense of self in that social contacts right and and if your if your facial expression changes some saying something and if you confurrow your brow what is a heals it you and i can read into that facial change some inner state of yours that is being of sailing in to me all of a sudden we have got this sort of dance of ism noticing you reacting to me and i f that is that is changing the way ism feeling about what ism that hat that is that is the g of the the purview of every neurosis everyone did not want right and every relationship i ad a gorfrom whenas a postal who's it who is very very a she is brilliant really still as and show said that every relationship the referent is is their four arrows simerosly still es and said there is the arrow of a that shows talking to me she said you me to you and cone of what you proceed coming for me and then there's you to me and then there is an arrow from the middle going right back at each one of o which is our own perception of what the other person is thinking bat us and its feeding back on the other arrow and she give me this very clear but am model of easily relationships in i the relationship failed but it was good while i lasted i should say and am but the four grow model of relationships actually shows up in every type of a one one of one of relationship an is probably in under description of the total number of arrows but as i think it is exactly wee describe is a perception of self through the eyes of other whether not we are in pathic or not strongly shapes the way that we access different context dependent rule sets about whatvergan a saynoncisand h very dynamic ye but t the freedom that i think we want and people can sometimes experience this just help hardly but that the thing that the center of the bulls i from the meditative point of view is to get off that ride entirely and to is of o losing the sense of self in this context of of a a social encounter is to is to give up your face essentially you're so and what what that entails is or what that gives you is the free attention to actually just pay attention to the other person and the other person is now no longer quite an object in the world for you there is really just a kind of totality of which that person is a part ism and din the actually man o martin bomber the the a mystical i jewfish philosopher i talked about the and of the i how relationship and this i think it at is been long times hen have read bomber but i do not know if he goes you far enough to be truly non autistic but this distinction between i i now ism because the the thaw part of it is is i think potentially this i again it is been several debit since i read read him but there is there is a there is a way of beholding another person were you have the free attention to simply behold them right godlike you're no longer you great you no longer care what they think about you you do not feel ironically implicated by their gaze you do not feel you youyou are simply the space in which their appearing right and you are free you there is just there is no and and people can feel and your your by definition you're no longer self conscious right and when with and this phrase self consciousness really does get at this what ism calling the self that the illucoryself as a kind of contraction and and you can you can notice this for yourself just imagine what is to go from not being self conscious to suddenly being self conscious and that the the proximal cauls of this you u almost invariably is suddenly recognize icing the somebody is looking at you rat's your you are in a startup and your you are alone and you are read in the newspaper whatever is is that now sounds highly anachronistic happened three years since have held a physical newspaper instar bus a but you are you are you are just mind your own business and you look up and you just your seeing a room full of strangers but then you noticed that some one is just looking at you and that moment of i contact right suddenly that throws you back on yourself it's a kind of suddenly you are the object in in the world for that other person that recognition is a the tightening there the ki kind of contraction there is a is a a a further ramification of this this feeling most of us have most of the time of being the center of experience the tight at the place you feel it is it is we are all walking around with a fist and in moments of self consciousness the risk its really tight and that and that is some that is the thing that gets fully relaxed when you discover this this what ism it various points call the nature of mind or that nodal nature of consciousness is just that there is no center to this experience and when you recognized no center then even when you are gaze is aimed at another person's gaze there is no implication going back to the center cause the is no center right and and rather than that being an an experience of weird detachment or confusion or or it is it is actually can experience of greater relationship because you are no longer you no longer defend you are is to you are not defending anything over here you are not you are not braced against anything you are just the space in which that person is showing up and it is it it is it it is of an experience of being much more comfortable in in the presence of another person when you whatever your relationship because you are not contracting right and then when you do when you have that again and this is meditation and this meditation that is totally compatible with having a conversation with somebody and then when you notice yourself contracting when you notice you are not doing you are not meditating any more you are just you are actually reacting they just said something or looked a certain way and now your fastback upon yourself in relationship to them that becomes a kind of mindfulness alarm right then that that it it becomes the the the unsatisfactoriness of that psychologically becomes more and more salient right and it is some because that is not one that is not the way you want to be in the such it the antithesis of being as as comfortable as you were a moment ago but to it is it is something you are doing in necessarily right s your your or you are again you are making a fist when you do not have to make a fist riband it is i again you can leave aside all those circumstances were is appropriate to react to some one and i you know am into martial arts and self defense and yes you are not supposed to be just this puddle of goo out in the world who can be just mistreated by people and and you never put up resistance but it is som psychologically it even of even if a state anger or contraction it is sometimes normative and appropriate the question is how long is it normative and appropriate for how how long do you want to stay angry for i in my experience feeling is iconoclastically negative emotions anger and fear are appropriate as salient use in they they orient you to in up an emergency are a potential emergency but then in dealing with the emergency they are almost never the state you want of being you knows likely you do not youyou it is it is better to actually be calm in an emergency you know o absolutely i think that and again the language is is in sufficient to describe wat what you are telling us what i think o what comes to mind for me is the a distinction between situational awareness and self awareness and we need both but under conditions of e a emergency true emergency or motivated desire we need to did down the amount of self awareness in order to be more effective within the situation rareness m but you said nothing very important in my labs en working on a fear states for a long time some get confess ism get to an rob this from you but all credit you every time i describe is that that the that the the fear of the threat detection state or set of events a acts as a as a flag but is not meant to persist in the way that o the flag went up if one is to be in they're most adaptive state actually joke welling an i were talking about this he has it tussle to about detachment and open gaze things at my labinterested visual system in autonomic interaction o white broadening the gaze literally broaden is the time domain of thinking a you have come up with new a solutions to complex problems and real time and on and and you are describing every day said of interactions where that can be very useful and yet there seems to be something about the way you describe meditation in what you have manage to arrive at and on what practitioners of meditation can arrive at which is something more than that ligate it is not just about being effective or optimizing all the language we see thrown around a lot in the space that i live in these days but but something fundamentally more important about how to experience life and the self this this realization that what you thought was there was never really there there but that therefore constraints that limit that and to try in fracture those constraints one by one would you say that meditation as a practice done for a few minutes each day or with the a that it is ay am kind of step function is a very non lingering terms of people's progress am i certainly going to go am start doing more meditation based on this discussion truly am because any time some one describes a am that there is become of a it that we have been living in i i become obsessed with the idea of dissolving that math that is a very adoptive very thankyou for using that one there is no better marketing total which as i realized what you are not trying to do here but that is thou me to capture my my a efforts you tell me that there is a with that ism living in and that it can be dissolved than that opens up a better landscape am you what is the the process is do some people make progress very quickly do some people a experience kind of step functions towards progress what is the meditation practice look over time a do you still meditator to give you just threaded it through your do git so your writing your daily life your coffee your time with your wife et camera ye atlas just to come back to to to talk by the with for a second to the there really what you just enunciated was a con of a second doorway into this whole projects they the the usual door is thug the door of suffering for lack of a better word people feel unhappy in a variety of ways and they get more sensitives to the mechanics of their own unhappiness and meditation it is one of the things on the menu the scene that is is explicitly build is a remedy for for unhappiness and i and it is and that is next i think is probably the most common path to this but another path is just intellectual interest me just wanting to know what is real so about the mind subjectively in an first person why and and that there is the is no contradiction between those two things about a motive ate by both of them but i yet it istle totally valid doorway into this i there definitely step functions a it would say there there at least too emit the the and i really really articulated along the lines of of am the frame work have been describing of of dualistic and nondualistic mindfulness or i saw in the beginning you are going to start out you know finding in point nine percent people start out dualistically pain attention and and noticing the difference between being distracted by thought and then being on the object of attention whether is the breath or sounds or whatever and eventually that that opens up to all possible objects of attention including thoughts and and that there is still this fluctuation between being distracted and then being a mindful of what never and the fact that it is open to all possible objects differentiates this type of practice from anything that is narrowly focused on one object a mantra or a visualization or so sit you knows those are other pas of practice that are more concentration based i and interesting but the the benefit of mindfulness is that very quickly you realize is by definition compatible with all possible experience because you are not artificially contracting your attention down to something you're t you are just being aware of the next thing a sight a sound a taste a thought i the first step function is to very clearly experience the difference between being lost and thought and being clearly aware of any part of experience including thought and to notice the freedom the comparative psychological freedom that gives you r i say you can your something is made you angry and now you are thinking about all reasons why you should be angry and have every right to be angry and what your going to tell that person when you see them and and then you notice you are thinking right and you notice the connection between the thought and the anger right you it the minute spent lost in thought about what is making you angry is the thing the drag through the physiology of anger right and the moment you noticed that once your mindful once you can be mindful you can notice thought as thought and how quickly that dissipates that it the language and the imagery just you you could not hold on to it if you wanted to and then you notice the physiology of the anger is just this you con a meaningless a conifer incandescence that has its own half life and degrades very very quickly when you are no longer thinking about the reasons why you should be angry you cannot hold on to the anger the anger itself dissipates right and from from the point of view of the one who is being mindful this is tremendous relief o and atminimom it is a degree of freedom you can at that point decide well how long do i want to be angry for right is a useful to stay angry to one to be angry for one minute two minutes five minutes ten minutes or cause been before you have that capacity to be mindful you are going to helplessly be as angry as you argon to be for as long as you are going to be that way just based on the kind of the time course of you are thinking about at brooding about it telling your wife about it you do not likely just the the o no it is just going to be this conversation based misadventure in negative a states of mind a and you are you are going to be the hostage of that for as long as you'll be the hostage of that you have nothing you can do apart from just deciding to check out and watch game of thrones again for the third time right it it is just you can divert are attention to something else which is ought sometimes of good thing to do but mindfulness even dualistic mindfulness gives you this capacity to just observe the mechanics of this and then get off the ride when when you whenever you want that really is a step function first there was a time when the time before you could do that and the this a time after which you can do that the other step function is noticing that there is no one who is doing that an this i the nonduality that the selflessness the the centrelessness of awareness or at the fact that there is no place from which the mindfulness is being aimed but the fact that it is just this open condition in which everything is appearing be o thought's included to to have you as at that point your mindfulness no longer becomes it is no longer this this dualist i effort to strategically pay attention to anything as opposed to being lost in thought it is just what is left when thoughts when when when the present recognized thought unravels even before it unravels what is recognize is you are simply identical to the condition in which everything is appearing again this is not a ism not making a a a depoctrochokra metaphysical claim about the mind this is not i to say the mind isn't what the brain is doing ism not saying that you are recognizing the consciousness that gave birth to the universe and not not making any broad claims about metaphysics ism just talking bat as a matter of experience there is just this condition in which everything is appearing right and what you are calling your body again as a matter of experience i not saying that we cannot have third person conversations about physical bodies in the physical world but as a matter of experience the only body you're ever going to directly encounter as your own is in appearance in consciousness i consciousness is not in your body what you are calling your body is in consciousness you visually appropriate steptively is lie everything is just appearing in this condition and again you are not aiming that you're not this is not a rootlike that you are aiming at the body or at you nowhere is just this condition in which everything including anything you could call yourself is appearing and i yet that is the second step function is to recognize that this is alias is already true consciousness already without this thing you have been calling your ego e hoping in you hoping to to unravel it through meditation consciousness is not going get any more selfless any more central's any freer than it all always already is recognize as such and s of that is that is the ta that the step function at that point is your mindfulness of that point the thing you come back to when you are no longer distracted is that that recognition again and again and then it become yet it becomes compatible with anything you would do and toy answer your question yes i i still practice formally you knave sometimes you are for frequently but not i i definitely mislays and i do not do it for i man i you know i do not rule out that hat possibility i wont go back on retreat at serious times just o you checking with at and see if that makes a difference but ism i tell you know i tend to sit for ism i m intended i eve designed my life that i can spend a lot of time meditating without having to be formally meditating long it'll go for hike for two hours right and when ism doing when ism hiking is i identical to what ism doing when ism quote meditating uniting in a chair you knave doing nothing but meditate ism it is ism yet i may i just i getting the ism very ism i very interested in a racing the boundary between what people are calling meditation and and the rest of life and that that in in in teaching these things i tend to emphasize that from the beginning because i i think it is it is very easy to set up ism is to get to get gulls by a bunch of assumptions that that cause you to be very i split in your sense of what your life is about and of sort of banking my meditation over here because ism i o meditating two hours a day diligently and you knowtithin can be really good for me and then over here is the rest of my life which is not nearly is wise or is useful or is this is the stuff that is still the area of my problems and ism i thing it is useful to recognize you have got one you've go one life and you have got this this it this single condition of consciousness and its contents in every mode of life and there is something to recognize about it and you are always free to recognize that you truly even in your dreams right i mistress not this it never stops that is that is what i tend to emphasize earlier you told us that meditation is not about changing the content of conscious experience and in a different podcast that you were on heard you say something to the effect of that normally we are in our daily experience and unless we are trained in meditation unless we dissolved this illusion of the gap between a actor an self an observer that we require certain sensory events to create collisions within us and with the natural world that sort of you know blast us into a different mode of being i wanting house that as a way to frame up this idea that some things such as psychedelics but also a very long hike a very long fast am you w knows a banquet i different types of life experiences do exactly the opposite of what your describing meditation does which is that they actively change the contents of our conscious experience much that we often remember those for the rest of our lives your could you tell us why psychedelics can be useful and here i give the soviets that may be feel am obligate to give as well but this were talking about you safely in responsibly age appropriate conflicts appropriate i deal with some a clinical or other type of guidance the guilty issues obeyed et camera all that stated you psychedelics to me are in experience of a altered perception internal an external perception altered peacetime relationship somewhat dream a thing t was plan poison at hazard for long time time about the relationship between psychedelic states in dream states a because of this distortion of peacetime dimensionality am and i haven i experimented with them much am have been part of a clinical trial three doses of m d m a which certainly altered my the the quality of my conscious experience and ways that led to a lot of lasting and t e least for me valuable learning yer what you whatever your thoughts about psychedelics an terms of how they intersect with the discussion that we have been having and am what utility do they play and o recognition of the self or in other sorts of brain changes we so ye calls as price in all those habits that people can anticipate i these drugs are not without their risks and it is it is one promise that we have this single term drugs are psychedelics which names many different types of substances another are not all the same and they're o i empty may is not even technically a psychedelic i think has moment's therapeutic value and it actually was my gateway drug to this this whole a if concern i becoming package and right it is as serf an inpedomin and a pathageyei y it it is often can package yean pay began not package a m package and nan i pathagener an entactogin it is it is been called i but it does not tend to change perception in the way that classic psychedelics do and it is it is it is also carton uric but it is it is not i it has to be in in some part differently than m even elastin and sylisip and which are much more similar and can classic psychedelics both are also certain magic but they are not merely and they are they are also different and and the her dose you take of these drugs the more you at lower doses everything can seem the same at hidroses they he the they begin to diverge i a we can talk about the the a farm a colony if you wanted to but i the i i would just say that for many of us e certainly from me psychedelics were indispensable in the beginning improving to me that this was the that ta first person interrogation of the mind was worth doing to i was somebody who at you a seventeen or eighteen before i had any real experience with i with empty may or elite or syliciban i if you had taught me how to meditate at that point i think i would have just bounced off the whole project i think my mind was i i was just i was i cerebral in my just mi engagement with anything i was skeptical of any of the the spiritual to he religious in spiritual traditions that that have given us most of our meditation talk i that i think i just would have i en i know many of these people in i have i have tried to teach in a richer do and to meditate and dance den at to meditate have ambushed them with meditation and being a bothy nothing i group set in and and one on one not not can but a but richer i i i ambushed on my own podcast with a guided meditation an he just from his heap u no he closes his eyes he looks inside and there is nothing of interest to see it is just it is this not he does not have the the i the conceptual interest in him that would hit would cause him to to persist long enough to find out that there is a there there right now this is not a problem with list or suicide under media may am i know that if i gave him a hundred micrograms of list or five grams of of mushrooms or your twenty or twenty five telegrams of salicin i that is probably not the analogous dosage to the fivegrams of mushrooms fivegrams of mushrooms would be more than that i i i i forget what it is of oaf empty ma may be a hundred and twenty telegrams i think the apsides is a which is the one that s under coin of charges as a hundred and twenty five milligrams with the option of the seventy five milligram rest i i went i redyes writhe facts that come to to hand a i but this not there is just no possibility that nothing's going to happen right now something with with a psychedelic with with empty am most people tend to have certainly under any kind of guidance ton have a very a positive in a pro social experience i but with a psychedelic you might have a a i i a somewhat you terrifying experience if you have quote a bad trip you know f you and have certainly had those experiences on on list and and to some gran silisidment but i the prospect that nothing is going to happened is just you you a million an nearlion million cases out of a million just not in the cards in me just just near physiologically somethings gong to happen with the requisite dose of of a one of these drugs and if if that thing that happens is is psychologically at all normative and pleasant and interesting and valuable which it is much of the time and certainly under the appropriate set in setting and and guidance i it can be a lot of the time for you knowversually everybody again their avoids if you your prone if you think you have a proclivity for skis ofriendia or dipole or disorder this is almost certainly not for you and anyone doing i the the the studies it john's hoping for for i the therapeutic effects of of any of these drugs there there ruling out people with first agree relatives with with any of these clinical conditions i but for somebody me at eighteen who did not know that this was an area of of not only interest but would be the the center of gravity to the rest of his life if only he could pay attention clearly enough to see that it could be right i i was some one who very likely again i do not know i do not have the counterfactual in hand i do not know what would have happened if if some one had forced me to meditate for an hour at that point but i know i was not interested in it until i took empty a ma i i know i was not having these kinds of experiences spontaneously that get that showed me that there was an inner landscape that was worth exploring i i was a very hard headed skeptic who was very interested in lots of things but there was no alternative to me just thinking more about those things right i ma the idea that there is some other way of grasp being cognitively at the interesting parts of the world beyond thinking about the world right i just that just would not have computed for me at all right and if you had i stand id literally d no one ever gave me a book to read or a net have had do not if you the noun meditation very likely meant absolutely nothing to me before before i i took my first dose of thatithis case was empty o ma i what the drug experience did for me is it just proved you make the that the limp one of limitations of a drug is that you obviously you matter how good the experience the drug wears off and then you are back to immoral in topless your usual form and now you have a memory of the experience and it can be a fairly dim memory men some of these experiences are discontinuous with normal waking consciousness that it can be trying to remember a dream that just disappear degrades of the course of seconds and then it couldhave been n the most intense dream you have ever had and for whatever reason you can barely get a purchase on what it was about and ism you know there is some psychedelic experiences that are now is to that but for most people most of the time there is a residue of this experience and with something empty may they can be quite t quite vivid ism where you recognize oke there there was a way of being that is quite different than what ism tending to access by default and it is different in in ways that are just i you obviously better and and an psychologically more healthy an it is it is possible to be healthy psychologically you n a way that i i never imagine right and the then when you bethel when you link it up to the traditional literature around any of this stuff again much of it is shot through with with superstition and other worldliness of of religion and at youngish as one i think you are listen listener's probably know have spent a lot of time criticizing all that but there is a baby in the bath water to all of that rights i guess it is not that somebody jess or the buddhi or any of the matriarchs and patriarchs of the world's religions it is not that they are were all conscious frauds or temporal epileptics or there is there is a there is a pathological lends that you can put on top of all that but once you have one of these experiences on psychedelics or on a drug empty a may that there is a there there that unconditional love is is a possibility right that that i feeling truly one with nature right i may just one with nature that your you could spend ten hours in front of a tree and find that to be the most reward in experience of your of your life right that is a possible state of consciousness now may it may not be the state of consciousness you want all the time you doftwant to be the crazy guy by the tree who cannot have a conversation about anything else but once you have one of these experiences you recognize oke there is that there is some reason why ism not having the beatific vision rite now and i cannot even figure out how to aim my attention as to have anything it and that is a problem right because it is it is available right and it is it is the best it it is among the best things that it has ever happened to me right and now ism can only dimly remember what that was i how do i get back there on some level and that seems that invites again a logic of changes a logic of seeking changes in the contents of consciousness which set someone up for this this i protracted or seemingly protracted and and in a fairly frustrating search to game their nervous system as to have those kinds of experiences more and more i and again it is not that that is principle fruitless but it is from the point of view of the the core insight of in the core wisdom of we know what i would take from went a tradition buddhi which is not in is not the only tradition that has given voice to this but its i would argue his given it you voiced to it the most in the most articulate way am again leaving aside any of the superstition and and other worldliness and miracles that you know we do not have to talk about at the moment i you certainly do not need to endorse in order to be interested this of ism and that is the the frication between the all of the utility of psychedelics and what ism talking about under the cupric of meditation is at this point of toque once you realize there that there there what do you do and what's the logic by which you are led to do it and it is possible with if if your only frame work is the good experiences the good feels you had on on a whatever drug it was and a a further discussion of of what that path of changes can look and i can come in a religious context yucomein just a purely psychedelic context or re of some combination of the too i i think you can be misled to you can just in be misled to just seek lots of pique experiences you trying to string together a lot of pique experiences hoping there gong to change you every one of which by by definition is going to be impermanent vitamins it is its first it was not there then it is there and then it is no longer there and then you've got a memory of it right the quiet what i think it is what every one really wants whether they know it or not and their right to want is a type of freedom that is compatible with even ordinary states of consciousness which which can ride along with them into extraordinary states of consciousness and what i had not done psychedelics for twenty five years cause i met again they were superuseful for me in the beginning then i discovered meditation on the basis of of those experiences got really into meditation and realized look get this is a much more or this really is the you conventionally this makes much more sense to me this is delivering the goods you know in terms of my experience ism there is no need to keep having these you know seeking the pique experiences with with drugs but it been on a twenty five years since i a done that and and tit was is resurgent and research on psychedelic and i was being asked about psychedelics and i was talking about there utility for me but again these were distant memories and i and there was also one type of psychedelic experience i was i was aware that i had never had i had never done a high dose of mushrooms i blindfolded i every every mushroom trip it'd ever had had been out nature and interacting with is been a very transformed sensory experience of the world and of other people it had never done in alone blindfold ad just purely inwardly directed and at a high dosage had done high doses of list but ism but not i mushrooms ism i did that and it was very useful and i i spoke about it on my podcastness actually is i think if you search a say hairs mushroom trip on you two if you get the the the nineteen minute version of that of my describing that drip it was incredibly useful and but it what was hat was doubly useful was my mindful n these training in the context of that explosion of synesthesia i mean it was it was it was such an overwhelmingly strong experience ism and there was many it moments wear it could have gone one way or the other based on my sense of just coquet am going to try to resist this it was s it was it was it was truth irresistible because f just much but ism there were moments where i was aware of get this is letting go of self you kin this context is is the thing that is going to is make the difference between heaven and hell here and because there is there experiences that are extreme you cannot even tell of its agony or ecstasy it is just it is just this everything is turned up to eleven right and it in the difference between the two is the tipping point is just s on it really has kind of a highway act in some sense can just fall to one side or the other and ism yes what i think people want is ism they certainly one o be able to extract from the psychedelic experience wisdom that is applicable to ordinary states of consciousness s what is the thing you can realize y in a moment of having a conversation with your child that is not distracting you from that relationship it is not a memory of when the world dissolved or when you were indistinguishable from the sky but it is just a way of of a way of having free attention and unconditional love in this totally ordinary and potentially chaotic human experience which can be psychologically fraught and you can meet iterations of yourself that you do not that are that are not equipping you to be the best possible person in that relationship and what we want to do is cut through all of that and actually be in love with our lives and with the people in our lives more and more the time and that is my there is ism not saying that is the ask that repeated psychedelic journeys are not cannot be integral to that project but but that it that the project cannot be being high all the time right whatever is extractable from that the the the occasional psychedelic trip has got to be capable into ordinary waking consciousness and the point of count the real point of contact does can run through this what have been calling the illusion of the self and again it is to that part is discoverable without any changes in contents right you do not have to suddenly feel the energy of your body be rush out and be continuous with the ta the ocean of energy that is not your body right it that is an experience that is there to be had rid is no doubt but this the truth is just looking at this cup is just as formless and as mysterious as that right when t is seen in the right way and that and that is that is what mean o meditation encourages want to recognize why share the experience that emdiama o significantly altered my perception of what is possible in terms of an emotional stance toward self and others ye including the animals right something that runs very deep for me in that i been kind of actively suppressing in in suspicion my dog down but also i mean ism not a i soft know how to fragment except ta sat my lab did animal research for years and i was always very conflicted about it ye because i love animals and yet i want t understand the brain and we needs o work on animal brains and i we romance or a it it'll be very direct about this my elaborate have worked on many species have worked on am mice an rats have worked on am timidly have worked on i dene some cat experiments have worked on a large non human primates in c including my cars a i no longer work on any of those species have worked on cuttlefish zephlopogs i a discussion for another time brilliant little as etreturs maybe maybe as smart as us or who knows a maybe smarter and now i work on humans because i could not reconcile the challenge inside me which was my love of animals and working on them i just could not do it any longer n an eddy a may did not set that transition that transition actually been set a lot earlier now something i really grappled with it did not keep me up at night but it was always in the back of my mind in any event i hope what we discovered was was worth while but this is a that is a bigger debate and have strong feelings about this and maybe it is a topic for an another podcast but ism very happy that now i work on humans and they can tell me if they will not be part of the experiment or to and and i trust them and ai trust their answers i think that eddy a may have in its rolls an and pathagand i think really did see and understanding of what is real and true think truths that begum hey do not i felt that they did not hit me square in the face i just could the feeling behind the conflict made itself evident and what to do about it made itself evident i suppose eddy a ma did i did assist the transition purely human research as suppose to m in or search om the other thing that i notice it it is it it made it not scary to confront things that were scare to confront in my conscious life and i could think about things in my conscious life but it made it brought them close in a way that i could get closer and closer to the flame and then gain some understanding i have still i amazed at how answers arrive both during the session and in the weeks in months that follow if one puts the attention to it i think that is why it is important have a guide of some sort or to have some some pseudo structure because otherwise you can one can get attached to the sounds in the room an just and there is probably meaning there but i wanted to do some deeper work i have not had experience with sylicivan at least notions my youth and i do not recommend young people do it i regret doing list in syliciban as a young person i do not say that for politically correct reasons or liability reason i just think f my mind was not developed and m but ism intrigue by something here is the question how is it that syliciban in particular and hydosyliciban and the ego dissolution that people talk about rum sylicbban how do you think that lines up with some of the experiences that a you have been describing for a adequate meditation practice is that something that i did not experience on eddy may in fact if anything i experience for the first time what really feeling a a isolated container i was in the difference band how empathy and being bounded having another words good boundaries an empathy could be sin biotic i experience that for the first time there and i i do think that there is learning inside of these states that translates into everyday life when one as not on these states the last thing it'll say is no i do not feel the u the impulse to go and do twenty more eddy amasessions i think that the three is part of this study were a very effective for me and as they say if you hear the calling again yet you might do it but ism very curious about suicide and particular and must notion of ego dissolution because we have been talking about thyself wat there are different ways in which the sense of self can be a loaded or expanded or this lots of experiences that can still have a kind of center to them but be you very novel and and transformational a and one can ready those as a kind of goal state right and it is sort of that there is a contestant in buddhi that i think it is useful it does not translate well to english in or can set up a o a false associations in english that that are unfortunate but tit is a concept of emptiness in buddhi which a sounds again kind of gray and dispiriting in english but it is a a what it the what it is it is recognize terms are or things unconditioned unconstrained open sateless risk its it is a there is a and and that is when ism talking about non duality when talking about that the loss of a sense of subject and the what is left in buddhi that they would often describe what is left as emptiness but it emptiness is not a something it is not a it is innocent importantly its not the same thing as unity write is not is not a one as right because it is it is what is what is at when when the center drops out of experience it is not you are suddenly merged with the cup right it is it but now granted at in hatches is where sylicipen another psychedelics can give a false impression of i think what the goal is you can have kind seeming merging experiment toucan have unity experiences on psychedelics which can be quite powerful especially with nature with other people and with nature where you can just feel thing of the the energy of your body becomes a it incredibly vivid and powerful s it your just everything is just mean a buzzing with in a life energy and then hen you touch another person's hand or you touch a tree there can be this continuity of energy which can be this overwhelming experience of and again this is a a a just a twenty megaton change in the contents of consciousness i this this is not non ordinary state of consciousness but is is a give some indication of what of how this happens when back in the day when i was a in my twenties i was experimenting with with a this zealously but a some friends and i a decided we have this brilliant idea we would would camp above mere woods and then take me is a ellestay at dawn and then walk down you alike a a mile i think from the campsite into the into the actual proper grove of trees and and you a commune with the giant redwoods the tallest trees on earth a as we dropped the acid at dawn and we start walking but the acid came on almost immediately and we did not get ism got nowhere nearer the woods and we got stopped by a tree that was just a an ordinary n o twenty foot oak tree the most boring try in the world and that tree absorbed the nest next six hours of our otherwise a conscious attention because it was just it was the tree of life i it was as i could ether would be no better tree a there's it were toning but non ordinary states of unconsciousness wherein a emerging with life and with with the world is possible and that is a ism not ism not saying that kind of experience is not possible but there is a sort of a expanded self reification is it is a kind of ego dissolution but there is there is a kind of dignity this sort of goes along for the ride as well or can go along for the ride and the real insight and emptiness the real sort of centreless center of the bull's eye is a recognition that that in some ways equalizes all experiences and pagan its it is it is just as available now in the this ordinary podcasting experience as it is when you are merging hands on with an oak tree and on four hundred micrograms of acid and this is you n of the this is the whole universe am and as it it is it is the it is the equality of those two experiences that that that is this concept of emptiness captures which a comconcept of oneness does not quite capture it's oneness is really this this pique experience of being dragged out of you or you are somethingness into a much bigger somethingness right emptiness is just no center right and that everything is in its own place right there is still sights and sounds and sensations and thoughts and feeling but there is just there is no there is no center and there is no clinging to anything there is no clinging to identity there is no clinging to the good stop there is no there is no resistance to the bad stuff there is not this pleasant and unpleasant get sort of strangely equalized and there is as very as it is it is very expansive and it and most importantly it does not block anything yet if for whatever reason if your nervous system is set up to have the oh my god ism now merging with the tree experience that is best possible from the state of no center right and then and and on my that my recent now not recent three ears ago was right before covet a but my last big psychedelic experience there's i was very much experiencing that whereas in far as i at the pique there was no me to remember any of any of the stuff but n o in far as i could experiment with is this really different from anything else there is a kind of equalizing to the the emptiness recognition even in the in the presence of a completely transformed near physiology and and that is a again there is there is a point of contact in the that the real point of contact between psychedelics and meditation for me is but for my experiences on psychedelics there is i d think there there is no way i would've had the free attention to be interested in in the in the project at all am and there other aspects ore the project is not just having this inside into selflessness it is it is all of the ethical ramifications of that is just what kind of person do you want to be what are your values what is what what is a good life altogether when you are talking about relationships and been a political engagement and the changes you can make in the world or not make or is just inn what kind of person do you want to be there is there is there is a much larger consideration and i as you discovered yea inexperience on empty may and really you both both expand your model of what is possible and what is desirable what is normative an just what kind of what and of self do you want to be in the world a and it can also help you cut through things that are inhibiting you your actualizing any of those possibilities in ordinary waking consciousness have certainly found that to be the case i mean you raise a really important point which is that am once these learning take place these understandings take place in side of psychedelic journeys and a i do believe they translate did normal plasticity i do want a i the point for people oftentimes you will say this i mushroom or this a psychedelic a it opens plasticity but of course plasticity has to be directed some place plastic is just a process racking or anything else underlying neural process and i i think it is a possible for me to understand what compartments of my life have been impacted by om these three empty may sessions but i a in some ways i wonder whether not not just the transition away from an for research but also a a a deeper realization of the love for learning and sharing information i will not go far to say this podcast is happening because of that particular session but these things a the splay out in tumultible domains of the self and i do think that am the key features that feel most important to me to mention are that a it really identify a true loves things that i truly having mad me less a less cautious about feeling how intense those loves really are and then also lower the inanition point of exploring what that what would that mean rather no and one of the means the bring the sup and why i thing it important tat you mention a issues around politics and ethics and anythings have displayed out from your exploration of psychedelics meditation your science philosophy in all the things that are you and of course that is only a subset is that much of what i here any much of what i here and see in that can self help space contradicts itself and leads back to t the origin without a lot of a progress and and for instance we hear absence makes the heart grow fonder but than out of side out of mind you hear about radical acceptance but then what of its radical acceptance of non acceptance i doming there are some experiences and people for which i radically accept the fact the i want nothing to do with them your and is that some emisupost to transcend that these are the questions i think that people lot of people from exploring things meditation because they feel well is the idea to just be of with everything is radical acceptance just well just enabulldos me with it with with things even if there u not i might as to somehow a surpass the idea that they are harmful and i do not think that actually the way any of the snuffs post to work although i do not claim to be the authority on it either i i think notions of radical acceptance and a radical honesty and and any number of different sayings that one can find out there are really the the most salient beacons an guides that most people have in order to try navigate tupharias in their life including the relationship to self but others and political orientations and i feel almost all those things can be used to anchor down in a stance that may or may not be informed or to open up to ideas and i think the none of this can really be solved in a single practice it sounds but it does seem to me based on what you have told us to day is that only through a a a deep understanding of the self as it really is as opposed to this illusion that you framed up could we actually arrive at some answers about what is actually right for each an every one of us yo me there is one generic answer that i think can be extracted both from psycho psychedelics and from meditation and just from thinking more clearly about the nature four lives and it is it is to become more process granted and to and can be more more sensitive to the the moral the moratmorage character of of achieving our goals right nib's not ism not against achieving goals i have a lot of goals have a on ism ism very busied a lots of things i want to get done and and i ism ism as satisfied as any one to finish a project and but if you look at the time course of all of that fulfillment and youuoue few lessons every one i think has to draw one is most of your life is spent in the process right my got the moment at which the goal is in a fully conquered that is just me that has a you know it is a tiny duration and is very short half life and you are it it the moment you you arrive at it it begins to receive because in the meantime you have all the other goals that are have appeared on the horse and you have got people asking what you arguing to do next and you in some sense if you are if you are focus on goals you have really you can never arrive right and i think what we are what we are looking we are we are all looking for in life weather we are ever thinking about sight you taking sycodelics or were practising something meditation we are looking for good enough reasons to let or attentionfully rest in the present right nowt its that that is the logic of success l the sent the settle have got a the things i want to do if i could just get rich enough or fit enough or dining my sleep well enough or you improve my life and all these ways get the right relationship would not be great to be married on i want to start of family i want all of these these things why do i want these things i want these things begs ism telling myselfthis is not it is not that all of those things are wonderful right ism not ism not discounting those relative forms of happiness or sources of happiness cause it is all completely valid to is its complete about to want those things but in the press is for one thing is absolutely clear it is possible to be miserable in the presence of all those things right it is and you can add you can add great wealth and fame and everything on top of that it is i possible it it is possible to be absorb miserable having everything any any one could seemingly want right e just have to open a newspapers to see people living out that predicament right i spectacularly wealthy famous healthy successful people who could do anything they want in in life apparently and yet they are doing this thing that is completely dysfunctional and making them i needlessly miserable i i will not name names but there enough of a notion ever come to mind of the moment ism there is a there is a clear dissociation between having everything and happiness that is possible and is also possible to have very little and almost nothing and to be quite hap my i may you might not have met these people but i have met people who have spent ten years alone in a cave right know they come out of that cave not floridly faradic or psychotic they come at at cave beaming with compassion and joy and am tit is they been taking em to may for ten years essentially and they come to of the cave and want now they are going to talk about it right i and ism not entirely recommending that project any one if ism outstand that is that is a psychological possibilities we have a doubled dissociation here with you can have everything on be miserable we can have nothing and be beaming with with happiness i what is it that we actually want en all of our seeking to arrange of the props in our lives and our and or and the story i have a convincing enough story to tell about ourselves that we are doing the right thing what a what is all of that effort predicated on is predicated on this desire and this expectation that if we could get all of this stuff in the right place and not have anything terrifying to worry about right everyone we love is healthy for the moment right and we are healthy and that e we have got something to look forward to on the week end and there is not some it does not o u know plumbinglak in the house that we have to immediately respond to and we our house and our career is going fine and there is something good to watch on netflics and we have all of it right now can we just actually give up the war right can we can we can we fully locate our our sense of well being in the present moment is it can we relax the impulse to bred about the past or think anxiously about the future for long enough to discover that all of this here is enough right because our life our life is we have this finite resource of we absolutely have the finite resource of time but within this the the finite resource continuum of time we have the even more precious resource of are attention that is that that can find or ours or our fulfillment in the present right and cause even if we are even if ore guarding our time to do the things that are most important to us we can spend all of that time wore you regretting the past or be o anxiously expecting the future and telling it just balancing between pass and future in our thinking about ourselves an our lives and basically just dancing over the present and never making contact with it right wat we i think what we want is ay's a circumstance where attention can be located in the present in a way this truly fulfilling and unless you have pad some kind of radical insight that allows you to do that on demand and you are in some sense hostage to the circumstances of your life to do it do that for you your your constantly trying to to engineer a state of the world that will propagate back on a state of self that will make the the present moment good enough and what meditation does and psychedelics to some degree does this but meditation very directly does this it reverses the causality and n lets you actually change change state such that you can be fulfilled before anything happens right nothing youyoure happiness is no longer predicated on the next good thing happening you can been the presence of the next good or bad thing already being fulfilled and already been to peace this there is a then they misleading sounds we can we can throw it at what is left there but it is i tranquillity peace freedom lack of contraction lack of conflict a all that is ay can be more and more of a default and all that is also compatible with deciding you know yet why not get in shape why not engage this project why not change your career m you its not i s not that you need to be somebody who who ex your point you can note is all of these nonoptible things because no matter how much you meditate you youyou are very livery likely going to spend a lot of your time still lost in thought still identified with it and still wanting still carrying about the difference between dysfunction and and normatively in your life right and an is o the question is what can you what can you locate when is really is how much can you puncture that seeking happiness project with recognition that you are already free that is that is what that is what meditation makes possible you can keep just a thousand times a day letting some daylight into this search space and it is but it is still compatible you can me working out is a great i frame and wish to look at this because me what in working to when you when y when you really work out ism thinking sing mostly of mi's really i anything but is seen resistance training or cardie or something you git to you your intentionally putting yourself in classically unpleasant circumstances physiologically is of if you if you were you know imagine what is to do anything to failure right if you just check in what in what that is at the level of sensation i m that is is spastically a metic it is feels a medical emergency and that if you are tapping that experience or some other reason if you woke up in the middle the night and felt what it feels to be dead lifting on your tenth rap on a et where you are going t youyou would fail at eleven right but that is just that is an emergency but because you understand what you are doing in the gam and you have sought it out and as actually is actually something u doing right and you can you can get a real opening but it from from doing it ism that what what you are doing when you are going that is you are your owning a kind of a my your you are actually i transforming a a classically negative experience into something that is in almost intrinsically positive i certainly the net on it is positive ism you can do that and in and being able to do that is more and more o the experience of being actually at peace even while exerting really intense effort in in one direction you can be straining and ism sure physiologically showing a lot of stress and i am sure that you sort us all is up and you knowhow know blood prat pressures up heart rate is certainly up ism it as it is it is as far as the body's concerned is is mistress as far as the eye can see but you really can be deeply equonomius and at peace because again because of the frame around it because of the concepts attached to it because what you are doing what is happening and you want it ism you that that that is an attitude you can bring into other stressful things that take effort to accomplish and it is not is not that you just need to be a push over when you learn how to meditator when you take mama or downy you y work on yourself in any of these ways but ism what i think you i think you want to find as you want to find your point of rest in the midst of o any struggle i would say that the certainly empty a may but and again have less experience with meditation and i but they really i think put us ultimately impositions of what can only refer to is real strength i see o make what before seem impossible decisions or even concepts or emotional states to even think about for any period of time without deliberately distracting or avoiding in some other way and be able to lean into those with with open eyes and i think that is to me that is my definition of strength i do not know what other people considered but u i there is i there is deafly something real there in each case this may seem a divergence but i and many other people are very curious about a recent decision that you made which was to close your account on twitter ism you still have an insure on account i notice a a bid never let me my team manages that i give never i love friendlier orini've been there all ire see seeing oh it is pretty good action can a imagine what would happen if you did a it that they there doing good job with it i but your decision to close your count on twitter ism i think grabbed a lot of eyes and ears and i there is a lot of questions about why it was a very large account i it correlated with a number of things that for the outsider people might be wondering about i you leadership i you you no people who had been booted off brought back one at least invited back on r and on i you are certainly not obligated to explain your behavior to me a ere anybody else i for that matter but ism curious if you might share with us i what the motivation was ism for taking the account down and and how you feel in the absence i o ai mean your thus presumably i freed i to do inherit i was getting an arthritic right told mi and a but if you do not mind share i thing there is there is a lot of curiosity about you and your routines you been very generous an sharing that of your knowledge i and but also what what makes what makes you take what motive at i pretty big decisions that it was not a major platform for you r i it was it was the only social media platform have ever engage may you said i have an into gram i have a casebook account i i never never use those as platforms rid is not never on them i never fought never followed people have never an all the posting as just come from it just marketing from my team ism but twitter was me and i you for better worse and i i began to feel more and more for worse and it was i it was interesting because it was very i e been have talked of bat a lot of my podcast about just my my love hate relationship with twitter over the years many good things came to me from twitter and i was was following a lot of smart people and it had become my news feed and my first point of contact with with information each day i was really attached to it just for that reason just as a consumer of of content i and then it was also a place where i was a i genuinely wanted to communicate with people and react to things and and and i i would see some article that i thought was great i would signal boost took to my the people following me on twitter and that was rewarding and i was i i could literally help people on twitter lie he men the was a there were you other people who have raised lot of much buttoned for on twitter just by a signal boosting there go for mes and and is i was engaged in a way that seemed productive ism but i was always worried that it was producing needless con list for me and was was giving me a signal in my life that i was being lured into responding to and n taking seriously that was out of proportion to it is it is representation of any opinion or set of opinions that i i should be taking seriously i was noticing that that i again this evolved over years and this is long before long along long predated i recent changes it into twitter i but i was noticing that many of the worst things that had happened for me professionally were first borne on twitter ism just e some some conflict i got into with somebody or something that i felt i needed to podcast about in response to twitter i it is s much of it would t is either is genesis was twitter or it is the the i the further seen of it that became truly unpleasant and dysfunctional happened on twit it was just twitter was part of the story when it was got really bad and i have had vacations that have gone sideways just because i got on twitter and said something an than i had to produced a controversy that i had to respond to and the had to do a podcast about that and bought and just and it was just oke this is a mess right and at that point on i i you have friends who youknow also had big twitter platforms who would who would say yo why are you why are you responding to anything on twitter just tweet and ghost you o just do to have in long got rogue and yes i down and t re i to get get you now give me talking to as to billmore i and both of them engaged twitter in that way men they i think they basically never look at there attentions they never see what is coming back at them they just they used it effectively the way i use or do not even use instar grammar face book a mi do not even see what is going out there in my name i and i i could essentially do that for myself on twitter presumably and i did that for some periods of time but then i would continually decide oke now it is all balance again maybe i can just communicate you came it was very tempting for me to communicate with people because would see somebody it clearly misunderstanding something i had said on my podcast and i think like why not clarify this misunderstanding right and in and my efforts to do that almost invariably produced a this sometimes it was a kind of lingering a process of of discovery but often it was just kind of a stark confrontation with what appeared to me to be just lunacy and level once on a scale that i never encounter elsewhere in my life id never meet these people in life right i and yet i was meeting these people by the tens of thousands on twitter and it was the the thing that began to worry me about it and again didn't understand that people have the opposite experience untwine depending on what you are putting out in what your the kind of topics your touching you could have just nothing but love coming back at you on to it i wright i but because ism very essentially in the center e politically and because i myiasis now on my podcast s not in the waking up a ism often criticizing the far left and criticizing the far right ism basically pissing off every one some of the time i say and it is very different if if you are only criticizing the left you hate i no doubt you get hate from the left but you have all the people on the right who just reflectively and tribal are are expressing their solidarity for you wright and who are who are don't king on your enemies for you and when when your enemies come out of the wood work and if you are only criticizing the right you get a lot of pain from the right but you have got the people on the left who re tribally identified with the left who were who were just going to reflectively defend you if you're in the center criticizing the left as hard as any one on the right ever criticized the left criticizes the left and you are also criticizing the right as hard as anyone on the left criticizes the wright you are getting hate from both side all the time and no one is reflect if rereflecively and truly defending you because you pissed them off last time you you might be getting hate from the left now and ha people on the right agree with you but they cannot forget the thing you said about trump on that podcast you a two podcast ago ism they are not going o defend you and what i i basically created hell for myself on twitter because it was am i just i know it was just a theater of which just pure cacophony most of the time and what i was seeing was at me was no way there this many cycle pats in the world but i was seeing cycle pasts everywhere i was seeing the most malicious dishonesty and i just goal post moving and hypocrisy and and it was just a in some of its trolling and some of its real confusion and some of it is psychopathy but its it was dark that ism i worried that you was actually giving me a a very negative and sticky a view of humanity that was ma one it was i think it is not at yuan accurate but too it was it was something i was returning to much because i gan i was checking twitter at least a dozen times a day and ism sure there's some days where i checked at a hundred times a day and it was it was again it was my main source of information as constantly reading articles and and the putting my own stuff out ism that it became this kind of fun house mirror in which i was looking at the the most grotesque side of of humanity and feeling implicated in in in ways that were importantly important because it was just you was reputationally important or seemed to be important ism i know a lot of these people is not these were not just faceless trolls these are these are people with whom i have had relationships and some cases friendships who because of what largely trump and bovid did to our political landscape in the last half a dozen years ism were beginning to act in ways that is that that seemed hastarclly dishonest and and crazy making to me i was just noticing that i was forming of a view of people who i actually have had dinner with that was way more negative based on their twitter behavior then i think would ever be justified by any way they would behave in life with me i mean that like never i was never going to have a face to face encounter when any of these people that was this malicious and dishonest and gas lighting and weird right as as what what was to happening hourly on twitter it and i just began to become more sensitive to what this was just the residue of all this in my life and how and just how often the worst thing that the worst thing about me in my relationship with the people in my life you another just talking to my wife or my kids was just the fact that i had been on twitter at some point in you previously in the previous hour and there was some rest ado of that you've in my interaction with them what what he is trussed out about what re you annoyed about what are you pissed off about what cannot you get out of your head ism what is the thing that you now fou you need to spend the next week of your life focussed on because it went sideways for you all of that was twitter a a little am little a hundred percent it was twitter ad and ism i just at one point i it was action on thanksgiving day i just looked at this i just just amanita there's very little thought went into it i mean literally i'madi you know there was more thought in involved than you whether i wanted coffee when you asked me when i showed up here i mas just it as certain why just i just saw it and i just i just ripped the bandit often and ye ism and to answered your other question it is been almost wholly point positive as you might expect given than the lit me of of a paying an discomfort i just ran through but ism i been it is also it is it it is surprising to recognize how much of a presence it was in my life given the sense of what is now missing i mast the there is it was there's no question there was in person a vindictive component to it and when you see i m when i look at what plans doing on twitter forget about his ownership of it and am ism not i have got a lot to say about the choice as he is making i for the platform but just his personal use of it is just obviously in expression of m i do not no ta diction is the clinically appropriate ism term but his dysfunctional attachment to tweed to using the platform forget again t forget forget about changing it and owning it but just hither just the degree to which it is pointlessly diserruptin the life of one of the most productive people in any generation ism i that was also instructive to means i because i know melon i iiijus ism he is from but have a friends i view of the situation it is obviously not good for him that he is spending this much time on twitter ism that a i i i just brought that back to me is well it is not this is what is doing to melon and he is got all this other things he could be doing with his attention how much of my use of twitter is actually a good idea and you no optimized to my well being an the well being at the people around men ism anyway it was there was an addictive component to it i think and s when that got stripped off i i i do notice that there is and there is some third times i pick up my phone i realize it this is the old me picking up my phone for i for reason that no longer exists that is not that much i an i w i have a slack channel with my team and have got ye male obviously but s that is not much of what i was doing with my phone really in the end and it is just my phone is much less of a presence in my life and and it is it is almost wholly good but ism yet i is there is i think there is some danger in i or some some a possible danger in losing touch with certain aspects of culture which again ism not even sure this is question of how how much is twitter real life and how much is a just a massed illusion i do not know but in far as it actually matter is what happens on twitter ism or in far as i was actually getting a news diet which ism not going be able to recapitulate for myself or ism just not in fact onto rich recapitually for myself even if i could ism if any of that matters i have not discovered that yet but it is hemming there is it was taking up an immense amount of band with and it is it is impressive think i said i i this i amputated of a a phantom limb writer it was not a real limb but it was it was a this continuous presence in my life that ism that i it is it is weird it actually relates to the concept of self and in surprising ways because i i felt there was a part of myself that existed on twitter and i it i just p performed a a suicide of that you that self river that is that this is ending right now and it is no residue this one to go back an check that just it is gone i and i didn't even i did not go back and look at might what is interesting to considers that you o have been on twitter for twelve years i do not keep a journal idea twitter what in my time line would have been a kind of journal i could have gone back to a specific hour in a specific day and looked at what i was e paying attention to him that could have been an interesting record of just who have been for a decade and i probably a pretty humbling record if who have been for a debate ism in terms of the kind of things a captivated my attention but i did not even it did not even think to go been n a staying of nest logically just look at any that or see if any of it was worth saving or arriving or think i just just defeat and it was som i and my my actual sense of who i am and my engagement with with my audience my the the world of people who could potentially know me what is it mean to be to have a platform where do i exist ritually my sense of up all of that got truncated in a in a way that ism it is much less noisy i mean its amazing how much cannot get fucked up now in my life like it is with twitter almost anything could happen it it the next tweet was always an opportunity to massively complicate my life there is no analogous space for me now and you knows is e what ism in a saying your podcast what i mys sand my own podcast what ism in right next that is much more ism i deliberative and i you the opportunities to take my foot out of my mouth or to reconsider all whether anyone of this is worth that is t worth is is the hill i really want to die on now ism it it is much more ism can be much more considered and idea think all of that is to the good ism but even more important than that is the there is not ism not getting this continuous signal that is always inviting a response whether on twitter on my own podcast or you in anywhere else ism and it is dues much less noisy and my life is much less noisy and and cluttered and that is the that is define feels better i just as a hundred per cent better i'mhobut to hear that i know it inner f people miss you there but ism you sound happy i sens we anguine happiness and i ism several things come to mind i first all thank you for sharing your you are ration all there and how it went i think for copulating what you must have walked around in circles for hours talking about about others fly as many good to visions a executed right e m you ism a big fan of calnuports work the epic in many ways call have never met him but in we know a oh other through the the internet space ye really had of his time with this notion of deep work and limiting distractions i think he is even got a book about a world without meal or something really extreme here am he to deserve some credit as he had band somewhat a proximate caught as he had been on my podcast and hear had encouraged me to dele to twitter a cause i had been i had been a sort of in in it reaching some kind of i yet a crime's point with it i prior that podcast once i we talked about it and i had i had recorded that podcast but had not released i to recorded the podcast the day before i want up to leading twitter but had not yet released i soda you my o my podcast with him benin the into to it i i then give a post more on my to dead hin it but he was of he was one of the last people who was in my head round these issues and id i know it was it was not by acts and i had invited him on the podcast as i increasingly wanted to think about know whether this was totally dysfunctional well ism a big fan calnuportzi and i i am on sociamidyam on twitter i had some a hi friction interactions there and i have a process for dealing with this in to avoid i friction confrontations on line but in grams a much friendliereplace by the way if if i want to come over to we the nice care that coo he ids actually hang out strong frame i am not looking for a substitute yo cake's tat i did i do not let me entice y over there you but i think that this notion of o am really being able to access would call calls deep work what ricrubin talks about an being able to touch the source of crew creativity and focus and on a regular bite does require that one have certain types of and in some cases zero interaction with certain platforms that merely being on a platform and blocking people that would just will not provide i think a lot of energy opens up and ism facing by this concept of energumen we only half much energy ye neural energy to devote and in many ways what you describe there really i think striking parallels to what talking about all only last hours which is that sometimes the thing that feels powerful that has such a gravitational pull and that we think this is experience this is life as sous the way it is actually is an illusion and when you step away from it you realize that there is this whole other dimension of interactions say that was availableall along but that we a for whatever reason were intervening in by way of our reflective distracted behavior think there is a there is a there is a poet i was a hard case but i i got got religion on this point a it is a good hand will say i want to say a couple of things first of all u every time you talk la i learn much and that is in the dimensions of noria science even hard corridor of circuitry type stuff which i as from my home when you talk about philosophy or a er meditation or second relics and even politics some atomic that ism a woefully under educated and but you have does amazing ability to to blend and ensenergise across things and i think today what what occurs to me is that not only is that no accident because of your training and your the rigor and the depth at which you explore these different topics but also your openness to it but i think at least for me above all is because i think you are able to encapsulate this idea of the self and and the different ways in which we each in all compotentially interact with the environment and and our inner landscape your description of meditation i have to say is now has forever changed the way i think about meditation i would no longer to think of as a perceptual exercise i on the podcast have been talking about as something to to do for these various benefits the benefit set of refocus you've stress it cellar of which certainly exists but what you describe to day has a has such an allure an a any hold such a promise that as i mention ism certainly going to change my behavior an and i know ism speaking on behalf of many many people i just one extend my thanks for your coming here to date teach us even more because of course yo of your podcast and the a the waking of a and the fact that regardless of the political landscapes regardless of the what nor a science feels about psychedelics or that where things are at any point time you strike me as somebody who is very committed to sharing knowledge and thoughtful deep discourse o that people can benefit and there are very few people you in fact there is probably only just one and i feel very grateful to be sitting across a the table from him for these last hour an i i why really enjoy this and wont t congratulates you on what you built here because your podcast is is everywhere i just come contain know ism a a fan and i even more than ism continually seen the evidence of you reaching people and and benefiting people is just just really me this was the one o the best examples of in a new media just carving out of space that the you people did not really know existed ecus i this is not tell a vision as not radio is not and and all o sone people have time to hear a conversation of great lanktthat goes into net ready scientific detail on you don't hormones i my who would have thought that was even possible and ism yet i just congratulations as fantastic a ay amir happy opportunity to talk to you and

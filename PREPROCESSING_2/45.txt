the benshpirshos monterbakexpress if vein perhaps he is a right not a privilege the fend your right that express vein a come wish men yesterday comely arris said something extraordinarily wise it was a rare moment of shining brilliants from our very historic vice president here she was every electro the always talk about this is then's election of our lifetime dozenth this on is i have been in for suntan blest thing the course ting present ha many thitsuations were it becomes clear to ma that there in a people of every again andante by the way coati something about being the first that let than and the mat to be a limited by other peoples limited a understanding of who can do what yes indeed twenty twenty four is shaping up to be most election of our lifetime not just an election the most election in other words a complete oho while america awaits the supreme court ruling on whether or not colorado can bar dona trump from the ballet other statesturn out considering how they can follow colorado suit and bathe leading republican candidate in america the likely nominal for the presidency from the ballot entirely according to the your times there least fifteen other states besides colorado considering barring trump from the ballet including four state lawsuits in michigan organ new jury and was consol and eleven federal loses and plasma arizonan about a new york the ego south caroling texts for most virgin west virgin and women right now the cases in arizona and michigan have already been dismissed in true favor but they have now been appealed if the supreme court does not take up the colorado cats just leave it there then trump will remain off the ballot in colorado and we can be sure this insanity will be repeated anywhere there is a democratic supreme court or legislature and governor in fact jest yesterday the californium lieutenant governor arena coolanackus wrote a letter to the californium secretary of state begging for her to quote explore every legal option to remove president dona trump from californium's twenty twenty four presidential primary ballet hilariously cenolaccus is apparently illiterate she writes in her letterquote the constitution is clear you must be forty years old and not an insurrectionist actually have to be thirty five but same difference now it is clearer the colorado supreme court is legally in the wrong even trump's biggest tractors say here is trump's former turning general bulbar who's hardly been a trump ally in the days since the twenty twenty election as you know i strongly opposed on a true for the republican nomination but i think that this case is is legally wrong and untenable and i think this kind of action of stretching the law taking these hypergressive position tho try to a no trump at of the race a a countopordoctive the back fire as i sea feeds in grievance just a fir feels on oxygen and this is can and a as grievance that helps and here is cries crispy who is running a campaign simply and specifically to throw dirt in trump's eye i do not believe bottle trump should be prevented for the cristylites this place court o these should be prevented for the cristulates is for the voters of this country well that does not matter those who hate trump believe that it is morally justifiable to use literally any means necessary to keep him from the white house according to a brannewpoll from fugue fifty four per cent of america approve of the colorful of states supreme court's decision to boot trump from the ballet including eighty four per cent of democrats majority of america according to this poll believe that the collar om statesprimcourt should boot trump from ballot does not boat particularly well for the actual election cycle that is not because these people believe the legal theory behind wat the colorado supreme courtjust did it is because they believe that any club available to slam trump in the skull must be used they're in the same camp as merry trump trumps geese who know one had ever heard of five years ago but who is now made a nice crew for herself bashing her uncle fabulously to day from the colorado supreme court a who ruled the donate trump pastoral trump the insurrection is anti america anti democratic fates to for some pis or reason is leading the republican dominated confess by fifty points or something is not eligible to be on the ballad for the republican primary in that state this is amazingnews yes it is going to go to a the united states supreme out but if they are able to read english they should concur with this decision this legal scholar who is a psychologist by the way has for legal thoughts jo bison is fomenting all of this by supporting the rational behind the colorado ban yesterday he was asked about the colorado state supreme cortruling and he said that trump was certainly an insurrectionist and that should presumably bar him from the ballet her zero question says our tottering old president no wonder republicans are up in arms if democrats are going to claim that the law can be used as a club and simultaneously that they are awaiting citizens merely following the law trump hands are similarly in pick up any club at hand that's why trump hands are increasingly cheering his applause line about temporary dictatorship here is some of those fans for example they cannot say that he is while there i man they are saying that's coming after his political opponents but lithely that is exactly everything there accusing this man of doing his lithely what has been going on at for the last that is why have no wan day one dictator that is why have no never dictator means he is doing to drill baby drill it'll s n me up that dictatorship anywhere o gay again the idea is that trumps language bat to tutorship anal the rest of it by which you really means just using executive authority in the same ways the biding panorama used executive authority when people say this sort often the reason their saying it is specifically because democrats claim tat they are protemocracy at the same time they seek two thwarted in a variety of ways and if democrats truly seek to bar true from the ballad across the country republicans will presumably do the same thing two democrats hurts teases lieutenant governor dampatric arizona try this about ten years ago tut our laws different it simply says that our log forcemeat can rest any one a take the men a do backed check photograph to finger parents if they saw them cross the border i legally a we can do that or if they happen to reveal in the treetop that they across o legally and then the district will send the back and we will escort them to the border and they've a choice they go to jail or they go back if they go back and try to come back again a we are rest again the penal to get thief at the higher were fat of in far see what happening colorado to my lar makes me think except we believe in democracy of texts maybe we should take job off the ballad and texts for allowing eight million people to cross the borders since he is been president again section three of the fourteenth mermen does suggest this you take sides against to america if you take side to the media's enemies if you undermine the constitution maybe that acts as caused to move somebody from the ballot america is indeed on the precipice of something truly dangers question are there now any conditions under which republicans willaccept a widen victory at this point if tolidine winds the twenty twenty four election how many republicans are going to simply say o ka done here and elections an election on the other side are there any conditions under which democrats will accept a trump victory and if not what comes next the answer is nothing very good twenty twenty four is indeed going to be very election the most election as comely arris says get ready in one second we will get to the polls dona from wait out in front nationally ut some interesting things happening in new samphire in the primary first are you traveling for at the holidays if pure talk has he covered because they just added international roaming to over thirty countries that is correct wet you are making calls on a beach in the bahamas on the steps of bucking pals or a your violet an sauntering you can dial away and here is the but part there is no rat increase pure talk still saves the average family almost a thousand dollars year with plans starting just twenty mum month pure talk is tho gift to keeps on giving they put you on a media's most dependable five not work the covering is second to nones a stop dragging your feet switch on over two pure talk a veteran owned wireless company with simply the best you us customer service teem now with t international roaming over thirty countries go to pure talk dot come slash of per right now and make that switch you will also save an additional fifty per cent off your very first month of coverage that is pure talk dot coma slash shipper to start saving on wireless to d abusing buttock for all my calls for years at this point h covering is excellent they share a big tower network of one the big guys go to pure talk dock come slash restart saving money to day pure took is simply smarter wireless and again when go t are ticktock come slash perils have an additional fifty per cent off your very first month of coverage okas looking at the national pollsdonal trump is experiencing on surprisingly a fairly significant bump after the cover at of supreme court just did what it did according to latest quinipiac pole trump is up nationally sixty seven per cent to eleven per cent for to mantis an eleven per cent for hailed two thirds of the national vote behind donate trump in the various states began we trump continuing to need fairly significantly in iota the latest fuck business poll has trump up at fifty two per cent to mantis at eighteen and nickel hailed at sixteen even if you combined both of their per centares theywould be at thirty four per cent eighteen per cent behind donate trump he has a significant lead over in iota new hampshir is a bit of different story according to a new s b s pole new samphire trump is at forty fore but nick hailed is at thirty per cent chis christy is at twelve per cent if you added together chis christie support an nickel hale support if crispy wore to get out of the race as he show that wouldlook a competitive state they need move down south to south caroling and things could theoretically get a little interesting be oppose nickel hale is the former governor of south caroling nationally speaking the trump verses biding poles they art tightening a little bit quinipiac has widen up one forty seven to forty six the consist yugof has them tide at forty three morning consult has trump up by two at forty for to forty two and again this is out works as trump gets back in the headlines the poles ten to tighten but tween trump and by this is why anybody who is suggesting that is can be a run away for trump i do not see the evidence for that anybody who suggesting the is can be a run away for widen won't to the evidence of that either this thing could seriously go either way and a lot is to pending on the candidate strategy hoiden is going to try to run a basement strategy pandas can work would we the current president of the united states doll trump should be running a basement strategy if donate trump runs a basement strategy in twenty twenty for he does exactly what hoiden did in twenty twenty f just goes down to his basement and watchers sharked from now in ti the election very solid shot that he becomes president again but one the big problems that the ran we is having is this is a big election you're focus for dona trump but for the republican senate for example republicans have the upper hand in a bunch of center races that they need in order to regain the majority in the senate but the iron the has no cash cops all the money is getting sucked up into trump world and trump does not spend the cash on re publican candidate in these various areas according to rob priors who's a political tunnel research director for the chlorine targebook he has statistics on are we cash on hand at the end of nonmember by year in twenty sixteen the iron we had twenty one million dollars on hand in twenty eighteen twenty seven million dollars in twenty twenty fifty eight million dollars twenty went one sixty five million dollars as of twenty twenty three the are see cash on hand is less than ten million dollars being no one is giving to the a rend we it's a real problem if you are looking in a bunch of competitive congressional races and senate races where dona trump is not cling to spend one god of his time tater that is the reality of the race and again the at the idea that trumpet con a walk way with the thing i understand that trump does not strategy and trump really does not planning is on the ground game is not really existent he serve throws it out there and then hopes and praise that victory will urge maybe it will ism not saying it cans ism just saying that right now the aren't is short on cash trump has no ground game and no actual strategy in a lot of these states the best thing he could do right now it is get him prose on board to actually run the on the ground get out the vote campaign if he wins the primaries which presumably he will and then he needs to go t the basement and shut up and watch mobile be bad president speaking of which jobidon's presidency it continues to be a mass he cannot take clear political positions on nearly anything on the one hand you have the state department for the united states saying that israel should basically be allowed to defend itself by taking out compass which is good your secretary state tony blinking saying that yesterday what is striking to me is that even ans again we here i many countries urging the and to i s conflict withe at all to see i her virtually join sang demanding a moss that its stop hiding behind civilians that it lay dot it is are that is surrender this is over to morrow if moss does that this would give et over a month ago six weeks ago if moss i done that and how could the how could it be that there are no demands mad of the aggressor and only demands made of victim it would be good there was a strong in national voice pressing moss to do what is necessary to endless it obviously that is good bat the same exact time the united states is dow negotiating with the most i sleeve international politics a wretched hive of common villainy the united nations in order to facilitate the passage of some sort of can security council resolution about sees firers and humanitarian aide

military strategy gaze the mounting civilian deathful and humanitarian crises are unacceptable and not in line with america interest nor to thy advance the cause of security for our all israel we also believe it jeopardize efforts to destroy the terrorist organization commons and secure the release of all hostages from our positions on the intelligence arm service and foreign a fairs commit behave consistently push for israel to shift its militaries military strategy there his been no significant change now have a question what is it what its elite that change like seriously all recommendations welcome people keep saying that israel ought to be more humane than end preserve civilian life better they needs to go in on the ground and be more careful israel has lost but a hundred and thirty soldiers in the gossip already all of them very young men and israel is sacrificing those lives in order to save civilians obviously but there is this bear mentality that now prevails among many america in which war does not exist or if war does existed supposed to be clean it is most be precise that is not how war works this letter includes the following idiotic line by the y we know from personal and offal painful experience you cannot destroy a terror ideology with military force alone and it can in fact make it worse well the way the you actually destroy a terror ideology is with long term occupation pacification in counter in and counter in surgeon tactics that is actually how you destroy a terror ideology over time it is certainly is not by making confessions to terrors which is what a sense fire would be as blinking correctly stated and meanwhile composes openly thanking it is allies in the western world literally spokes person fromossi yesterday its should o video

wednesday traders reacted with relative calm even as shipping companies thatverted more cargoes wall turn if hooves while the threat of more severe destruction persists the responsive energy markets has been muted compare with dramatic moves in prices sparked by some other passed fabrics violence in the middles will limen to compares nineteen seventy three of course s there is the gift oil in barge for salty arabia but the reality of the situation is that when you have again ragtag wroth you pirates in inflatables with ones are holding up one of the key choke points for global trade that is a serious problem and as not just a serious problem because of what happening in the red sea it is a serious problem because once states that hate the united states one's countries that have interest adverse to our own realize that they can drive america off the ball in the area of freedom of the seas they can really affect the global economy in significant and severe ways pasha ya map this a map of maritime choke points across the world and a lot f people do not think about exactly how the stuff that you want gets to you but the reality is that there are these choke points on places where huge percentage of trade actually moves s if you cannot see the map there are again a bunch of things labelled on the small try to describe for you places that trade moves and in these are bottlemaks places that very often are are close to nations that r adversary until to the united states the number one choke point the primary choke point for aria is place called the strait of mullock it is very close to china and has the ability if you close it to really affects china economy alternatively because it is very close to china you could see china attempt to make a aggressive moves in the strait of aloha it accounts for about twenty five percents of all traded goods and a third of all seaborne oil and that that is it that is a choke point another choke point the titan straits in china is threatening titan they are also threatening the titan traits which is a place where a lot of trade moves if you look at for example the strain of hormones is one the areas the on is currently threatening thirty percent of all oil traded on the world's oceans passes through the strait of or moves is it moves from the middle east and down through the bad elmandub strait which t another place where a lot o oil moves ad then up through the to us canal again all these places threatened bit iron and randan proxies soy have china which is threatening the titan traits and the stratamalocka and you have middle eastern controls adversarial to america iron threatening the strain of hormones the babelmandub strain as canal forcing people to travel all the way around the southern tip of africa the cape of good hope which the much longer trip it increases all of your prices what this really means is that again if america does not guarrente freedom of the seas then what you are going to end up with is a crater global economy at the be has of countries that hate the united states and seek to curb our power and the chines are seeing the weakness apparently according to a b canoes last night chines present elusion ping told president ha bite directly at their recent summit the china will reunify with titan it was unclear whether basion plans to use force in its efforts to reunify with titan but she indicated they will try at first to do peacefully k words there being at first s has said as much publicly what is noteworthy is that he said this bluntly to the president at a summit intended to thaw of their relations john derby told report is that i not can get into specifics of the discussion between the two leaders i think you can understand o noon to read out that private conversation he said presidency has been public and clear about his desires for reunification that is non something different or new we have been clear and the president was hear with yogis an with presdentgue we still at here to the one china policy we do not support in dependents for titan we also on support a change in the status duo unilaterally and certainly not one by force and as the president has said there is no reason for the to come to blows asked about whether you us involvement in two other local conflicts you crane and gaze alters is previous commitment to defentiwan from any chines military action bi and reiterated in nonmember the u us position in favor of the one china policy which is basically just let us not talk about this one chinapolicies sure titan is part of the one china policy and also if you attack titan will defended probably ti strategic vagueness began said look i reiterate what have said as have become president and what every previous president of late has said that we maintain an agreement there's one china policy ism not on to change that that is noon to change and that is about the extent to which we discussed it apparently in a read out of the summit china at quotidian ping elaborated on his principal position on the titan issue and point it out the titan issue has always been the most important and sensitive issue in sing us relations china attached importance to the relevant positive statement's made by the united states at the bally meeting china will be unified and inevitably will be unified according just military in intelligence g has been instructing his military to be ready by twenty twenty seven to invade titan that obviously is a timeline that could be moved up pretty dramatically if g sense is global weakness by the west in unwillingness to use for example naval power in pursuit of the freedom of the sees that could continue to be a serious rob and it goes also to a general belief in the united states that we can randomly sort of cut off our own military without real consequence t the america people we spend o much money we should be more isolationist and all of the rest that is in fact also a massive problem when it comes to america under investment that is particularly true with regard to the navy the navy does the biggest share of the lifting when it comes the war making in during freedom of trade and did a recent facts episode all about this you go check it out on you the but the navy represents about twenty three present of our annual military butch that slower than but the army and the air force not only that the s has sure operating naval carrier stay than it did for decades to go thou us navy keeps hung about growing while shrinking relying and better t acknowledging make up for lack of ships one of the things that we have seen historically with you us military policy is whenever the us militaries well will do it fewer but better that tends to work out not particularly well with you talk about the occupy ton of rock or the or talking about envy it not using much more military technology but down graduated oscillation that does not actually work you need e lots of ships in the water to challenge to the chines we have three hundred fifty five ships now they do have what they call a gray water navy meaning that they are really relegated to coastal areas to do serious battle but the thing is the time strait for them the s basically a coastal battle admiral charges record commander of youistri each a command sedan twenty twenty to as i access our level of deturnsagainst china the ship is slowly sinking it is sinking slowly but it is sinking as fundamentally they are putting capability in the field faster than we are as those curves keep going it is not on a matter how good our operating planes or he good up commanders are or how good our forces are or not can have enough of them that is a very near ten problem undersea capabilities is still the one true a metric advantage we have against our parents but unless we pick up pays the terms of getting our maintenance promise fix getting new construction going if we can't figure that out we are not onto put ourselves in a good position to maintains strategic turn to national defenses on quote again when s is threatening titan the reason he is doing that is because if the united states an italics cannot even to our the soothes an pagan in to our a massive military power the chines and that does have serious spill over a facts an know everybody to pretend that war making and economics are completely disconnected from each other that isolationism has no actual consequences that is wrong not only is that wrong its connected to a bazar view have how the economy works in general it'll get to that in just one second first have ben talking bout my helices matters for years have had my hell's mates an know almost the debate at this point my love it it is the if

while all this foreign policy isolationism and vacillation it is connected to a a deeper view of the america economy that i think is totally and deeply food if the reality is freedom of the seas has allowed you to live a better life style freedom of the seas ye spread of democracy the spread of liberalism the possibility of free trade all these things have a real world impact on you turkey in the united states is possible but super duper expensive it's basic e con one o one you get you go down to the local mcdonaege you pick up a hamburger for a couple of boy do much it it take to produce that hamburger in your back yard i grot the to go and buy a cow to then slaughter the cow process toe cow to grove the wheat to grow all the ingredients to do all the stuff a lot of money supply chains supply lines comparative advantage all of these things matter it is why efficient yes are created tat allow you to go get pretty much any front you want on amazon for an a fordable price it is why people have been living better lives consistently over the course of time it is because of the rise of free trade it is because the broadening of supply lines it is because of that comparative advantage that many people to rip upon it is because of for lack of a better turn libertarian economics now i am not a libertarian when it comes to social policy because i think libertarianism is ignorant of what it is that makes human being tick when it comes to social policy because we are not just atomized individuals where members of communities and was it is really important part of being a fulfilled human being capable of living e full human life and experience and building institutions and raising families and all the rest however when it comes to economics there is this phrase that is been used been toss around a lot by people on the right of late ill ay that two cheers for capitalism and always think o myself that is that is that is a due phrase as suppose of three cheers for capitalism why is capitalism does not solve all your problems well a i mean a ism ism always confuses why any one would think capitalism would solve literally all of your problems only a marksists materialist would think that economics can solve all of your problems economics console all you problem it console some of your economic problems but a cantsolve spiritual problems it cannot solve the romps your having without wife economics is not going to solve whatever family issues you have or whether you're church is breaking down in fact depending on t economic system it can exacerbate some of those conflicts what economics can do depending on the system is make things better and cheaper and more plentiful and innovative that is what economics can do when people say two cheers for liberal for i for economics or to two cheers for capitalism i think myself tin thing two cheers for a hammer well no i mean it depend what your doing for getting a nail three cheers for the hammer if you are if you are holding a baby zero cheers for the hammer what what exactly is it that you are attempting to do with the tool what is the system you are describe it the reason that comes to mine in's because have had sort of this long standing debate with tucker carbon about the nature of economics in the united states and what we should be pursuing tucker n i to this really interesting interview couple years ago now privy long in that a five years ago now where we talked about of the role of the government in the economy and tucker has a significantly more socialistic view of the economy the i d just platonlys the even he is in worse for example many of the plans of senator elizabeth warren is not a slandering and sucker i mean it something that he will say openly and clearly h ho was during an intern the other day with glen greenwood who is also bee a guest on my program and do an there talking of an con economics and tucker went into this ran about the evils of liberty ran economics and i think this is short sighted i i i think it is really damaging to the future of america prosperity and it relies on a bunch of falsehoods with regard to how the world works no ism won her listen to this be i again i think this has spill over effects for foreign policy it assumes that the best policy is going to be protectionists the high tariffs around america borders are whatcan make america people wealthier and better off it assumes that in uninvolved amebic on the world's fear of somehow going to make america citizens better off its all predicated on this notion of economics that ignores the importance of comparative advantage and price structure and all the rest in favor of vaguer concepts beauty now again ism not anti beauty but when i need a harbor i more interested the hamburger than i am in the venostomilo in any case hurts talker n can i won break this downelopics it is interesting i think a lot of people ill have a waging the being ow demonstrable fact that libertarian economics was a scam perpetrated by the beneficiaries of the exotic that they were defending the created this whole intellectual never second it'd i do not lit i do not this conspiracy theorizing about the nature of libertarian economics library economics as the government should not control the free flow of goods and services that is all the return economic see a free market has property rights for you and government cannot get involve the is the opposite of a conspiracy theory i conspiracy is when a group of powerful people restructure in entire economy a round particular interest for example if you were to push for it a protections policy that is a policy design to protect specific people in your country in a particular industry from competition from other people on the country and also elsewhere that is the goal of it that is an actual cobra of powerful people shipping the economic system for everyone a baseline rule which is that you have freely alienable goods and services you can alienate your own labor you can some one can pay you for your labor at a given wage a that is that is not a conspiracy me giving you the ability to actually trade with other people ism ism confuses to how that would be a conspiracy by me not may not end to the benefit of people who are less competitive in a particular industry and there may be very good reasons to protect certain industries for example for national security reasons i think that we shul be cutting down on trade from china because i do not think we hold en ricing are enemies that is a different thing from saying that economically speaking there is its gut this the secret group of libertarian economist who for their own benefitliy melton freedmen with sitting the backromanies i been to be rich and the only way ism going to be rich is if there is free market economics u that is that is just not true it is just not true there is a a kind of politics that lot of people are engaged in these days called eroticism it is a basic philosophy that suggests that the reason your opponents are doing the thing they are doing is because of their own emotions are doing because a badly motive it because they want the worst for you i think on ugly way to do politics must a actual evidence that that is the a es it is a conspiracy way to do politics it turns out that some people have ideas that different from you sometimes it is because there corruptor there being paid o what ever it is but many cases it is because the just disagree i only tucker saying what he sayingttye's being paid off because he is a vested interest and stop account of object to this idea that anyone who disagrees dis agrees because they are french actively harm somebody else i i do not thing that is the case when your talking about for example free market economics here is moretucker natural frame work to justify the private equity calltsure that is hall it to the country that is e in personal unit seen at a close my who life i think it is a fair spent ism i think a smarter way to i sassing economic system is by its results you can assigned whatever name you want to the economic system of the nite stages can can it market capitalism you can call it we you call all host to different things but i i do not think any that is useful those are boring conversations they can't you ask does the economic system produce a lot of dollar stores and if it does it is not a system that you want because it degrades people and it makes ta lives worse and it increases exponentially the about of ugliness and your society and anything that increases ugliness is evil and its just cot lets or star there if it is sucking it system why we have always dollar stores look that that is not amazing statement why exactly are dollar stores the revolt evil first of all i should point out a this plant that according can some reports eighty eight per cent of america shop a dollar stores at least occasionally my family shops at the dollar sore at least occasionally almost a third of respondence in the twenty twenty one can some report survey they shop at dollar stores more than once a month this sees a really deadest attitude it seems om dollar stores are good you buy things for high dollar or a least you did until hoiden took offish and flay to the currency now's the five dollar store it is good to have products a your disposal for cheaper this a good thing why are we frowning upon this it seems to me a much much worse systems a siskin the produces no dollar stores a system that produces more expense if goods and services that force your family to pay more a system that for example relies on gilds and does not pretty stout or relies on governments i our bred lines better than dollar store was there are few choice says when it comes t economics dollar sores are actually not in out when he and then he shifts into this discussion of it increases ugliness pomp went i out ugliness r we told louis to physical stature of dollar stores thesornotlyc gorgeous gothic edifices es it t there not beautiful to look at hell obviously that is true obviously it is true that is dollar sores are not beautiful to look at they will like big box stores also that is one of the reasons you can get the product for cheap at the dollar store it if they look gothic cat cathedrals that if the charge you on product in order to pay for the gothic cathedral looking place ere you buying your tomatoes which you be weird t there is this kind of break that is happening here where from an elect perspective they do not that it looks bad tat there is an ugly store at the corner of own that makes it possible for you to feed your family that seems rely elemis to me it also seems to be disconnected from history if the go to hungary which is a country that a lot of people love and and has a lot of history to it and allot of the architecture that is spectacomin wood push is an incredibly beautiful city i can tell you because this is thewy the worked an hungary for hundreds of years nobody was running the farmers market from the church that a hut outside the equivalent of the dollar store in hungary is not a gothic cathedral a gothic cathedral is a gothic cathedral the equivalent of a dollar store in hungary for hundreds of years was an out door stall in the market that was significantly worse for produces than for example ai dollar store here is a thing about america america as always one the beauties of america the reason we were world power this one hers we have always been a mason and then obviously dominant world power it is because in america function frequently defeats beauty as a priority isamericans are a pragmatic and practical people who are seeking to better the lives of their citizens throat things economic opportunity which means more dollar stores not fewer dollar stores not only now shop at them tons people work at them go back to elects to topfull ready in eighteen thirty one and this is nothing new i i know where this idea came from that america was always filled with gorgeous edifices it is not true the vassmajority of early america history was filled with abandoned log cabins here is what elects to toil writes in democracy in america quote thus the european quits his cottage to go to inhabit trains aplanatic shores and the america who is borne on the same coast plunges in turn into the solitudes of the center of america this double movement of emigration at never stops it begins deep in rope it continues over the great ocean it follows a cross the solitudes of the new world millions of men advance at once toward the same point on the horizon their language their religion their moors their stories differ their goal as common they were told that fortune is to be found somewhere toward the west and they off in haste to meet it sometimes man advances quickly the wilderness reappears behind him the forest is only bent underneath his feet as soon as he has passed it recovers it is not rare when passing through the new states of the west to encounter abandoned welling in the middle of the woods often one dis covers the debris of a hut in the deepest solitude and one is astonished to come across partial clearings which at last at once to human power and human in constancy in rope we habitually regard restiveness of mind an moderates as idea for wealth extreme love thou independence as great social dangers it is precisely all these things that guarantee a long and peaceful future to the america republics is elects totokefill ready in eighteen thirty one to centuries ago without these restive passions the population would be concentrated around certain places an wood as among us soon feel needs difficult to satisfied what a chappy country is the new world where mans vices are almost as useful to society as as his virtues the america republics an our day are companies of merchant form to exploit an common the wilderness lands of the new world and busy in a comers that is prospering another he talks about what exactly log cabins looked in america he says quote at the extreme limits of the con federated states on the boundaries of society an wilderness stands a population of party adventurers who in order to flee the poverty ready to afflict them under their father's roofs have no fear of plunging into the solitudes of america and seeking a new native country there scarcely arrived at a place that will serve as a refuge for him the pioneer hastily fell som trees and raises the cabin under the leaves now might build a dollar store nothing offers more miserable aspect than the isolated dwellings the traveller who approaches them toward evening perceives from a far the flame of the hearth glittering through the walls and at night if the wind comes up he hears the roof of foliage rustling in the midst of the trees of the forest who could not believe that this poor cottage serves as he refuge for coarseness and ignorance yet one must not establish any re nation but tween the pioneer and the place that serves as his refuge all is primitive and savage round him but he is to speak the result of eighteen centuries of work and experience he wears the clothing of the towns he speaks their language he knows the past is curious about the future argues about the present his a very civilized man who for a time submits to living the middle of the woods who plunges into the wilderness of the new world of the bible a hatchet and newspapers it is difficult to imagine how incredibly rapidly thought circulates within this wilderness there is scarcely a pioneers cabin where one does not encounter some odd volumes of shakespeare i recall having read the fetal drama of henry the fifth for the first time in a log house and the sort of scorn that is being poured on people who shop at the dollar store in the name of the people is very weird to me i do not understand it it does it make sent what makes lives better four middle class and lower in come america is freedom of the sees trade better product at a cheaper price and their lives contract public

building that that same cretin couldhae ben label it could a been levied at track housing across america the nineteen thirties forty fifties here the golden hero when every one was seeking a house by thewy our houses now much bigger but these were the this the golden ear according to many of the people who are now proclaiming the america economics has done us wrong those track houses are ugly they are not beautiful but the purpose of the track house was to give a man a plot of land to live on and a house to have and they were built cheap if you're been these wood frame houses from nineteen forty they were thrown up and they all looked the same and here is a picture of track housing incincinaty this look beautiful to you this picture of track housing incincinaty this it not beautiful this is not this not ad to the beauty there on gorgeous about these track houses incinsinaty except for the opportunity provide to a person to live in his own home with his family maybethese people shop at the dollar store i do not know it turns out that more than forty million housing units were built in the united states during the thirty year period following the en of world were too at least thirty million of those were single family homes and a huge per centare o those were these track houses and again thrown up do not look eastern colonials are not beautiful all they did is provide people with opportunity that is what libertarian economics actually do people buy these tracks of land they build track houses an then thy sellthem and as for the notion that library economics as sort f hollowed out america ism sorry but it is not true it is simply not true there certain industries in the united states that have gone away as the world supply chains have become more broad and divers we do not make lot o tea shirts here in the u hinted states any more for example but has life becoming easier for the normal america over the course of time absolutely it has and anybody who denies that ho take a trip back to nineteen eighty and see how the milkman is working tho trug but the cost of food for example according to madman to pe writing over human progress they started with the nineteen nineteen nominal prices of forty two foditems ranging from a pound of sirloin stake to a dozen oranges can they assessed how much timeyouwould have to work in or to buy those things in nineteen nineteen and then forward to to day they say quote we find that the unweighted average time price of our for of our forty two food items fell by eighty seven per cents between nineteen nineteen and twenty nineteen the total time price i either nominal price divided by the nominal curly wage of our basket of forty two food terms fell from twenty seven point three hours of work in nineteen nineteen to three point eight five hours in twenty nineteen by that is an excellent way of measuring whether life's gotten easier or harder not on terms of wage numbers or price numbers because those are fungible there there changeable to twinfleetian statistics in value the dollar anal the rest of it the question is how long you had to work in order to earn a particular good well when it comes to food you had work eighty seven per cent less to day for the same basket of food for which we have had work a century ago does that mean that library economic betrayed everybody then sound it to me sounds far from it to me an again the problem with all of this is that when you throw that out when you throw out that entire system you fail to recognize the counter which is what happens afterward when you get ride the freedom of the seas when china does grab those choke points when the us coal is closed when we go isolationist when the united states retreats within warn boards d you think life gets better for america or worse for america markedly a lot worse for america when all those dollar stores to sappearicas nothing cost dollar any more do you thin it is easier for america live or harder for america to live and by the way toucan have a lot of time left over and money left over to build those beautiful gothic art architecture pieces that is the real question america has prospered because a america is free when it comes economics free market economic suddensolve all your problems but it is tends to do a really good absolving the economic part of your problems ardigize the rest of the show is continuing right now your not con remiss it we will be asking a question whether the senate is on get anything done before the end of the year if you are not

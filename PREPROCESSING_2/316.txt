welcome to the superman lanconcans us science science tace tolan forbid i ma our supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing colds and flues we will talk about what a cold really is and what a flue really is in terms of how they impact your brain and body and of course we will discuss how to avoid getting colds an flues there are indeed some excellent science supported techniques to avoid getting colds an flues but of course it is impossible to completely avoid ever getting a colder flue in your lifetime we also discuss how to more quickly get over a colder flue should you happen to catch one during to days discussion it'll talk about the immune system it'll give you some mechanistic understanding of how your immune system works and i promise to make that discussion accessible to everybody regardless of whether not you have a background and biology and with that understanding of how your immune system works you will be in a much better position to understand which tools that is which protocols to implement should you be exposed to a colder flue or if you are trying to get over a colder flue more quickly than you would otherwise you will learn about some potent behavioral tools for bolstering yourimune system and we will also discuss various compounds that you might consider taking to enhance the function of immune system to ward off or treat colds an flues i will also be dispelling a number of common myths about treatments for the common cold and for the flue there are owe many ideas out there about what one could take or do in order to avoid getting the older flue or more quickly get relief from a colder flue however many of those are pure myth there is just no science to support them an indeed their some science that counters those ideas but the good news is there are indeed science support o behavior o protocols and compounds that one could consider in order to avoid entreat colds in flues before you begin i emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in researtrols at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the spongers of to day's podcast our first sponsor is juke jive makes medical grade red light there devices now there is one thing have consistently emphasize on this podcast it is the incredible roll that light can have on our biology of course ism always telling people that they should get sunlight in their eyes as soon as possible after waking on as many days of their life as possible for sake of setting creating rhythm daytime moodfokis an alertness and improve sleep now in addition to sunlight red light and near inbred light has been shown to have passive effects on improving numerous aspects of cellar and organ health including faster muscle recovery improved skin health and wound healing even improvements in acne or that is removal of acne reducing pain and inflammation improving my ta conjugal function and even improving vision itself what set shove apart and why it is my preferred red light therapy device is that it has clinically proven ravelings meaning it uses specific wavelength of red light and near free light combination that trigger the optimal cellar adaptations personally i use the handheld jive every day the channel jumps about the size of a thick piece of toast and i also own a jive panel that allows for full body exposure and i use that one approximately five times for week for about ten to fifteen minutes percussion if you would to try jive you can go to jive spelled j o o v v doc come slash superman again that is jive doc come slash

spent a lifetime working on the biology the visual system i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to seek clearly rock understands those challenges and has designed their eyeglasses and sunglasses accordingly that you always see with crystal clarity rock eye glasses and sunglasses are designed with a new technology called float fit which allows them to fit perfectly and not move around even when you are active in fact whenever ism wearing my rock eyeglasses or sunglasses i usually forget that ism wearing them i happen to wear rock eye glasses at night when i drive or if ism reading at night and i wear rock sunglasses during the daytime if it is very bright especially from driving into sunlight if you would to try rock eyeglasses or sunglasses you can go to rock doc come that is a o k a do come and that there the code supermen for twenty per send off your first order again that is a of a do come and enter the code superman at or scout oka let us talk about the common cold first off no unfortunately today i cannot tell you the cure for the common cold because indeed there is not one one interesting question however is why do not we have a cure for the common cold and the reason is that the cold virus as it is referred to is actually a bunch of different viruses some colds are caused by one what is called cerotype of the virus other colds are caused by a different cerotype of the virus there are over one hundred and sixty different types of what people call the cold virus now cold viruses fall under an umbrella of a general category of virus is called rhino virus as you can remember that easily because rhino sounds vino shorn the rhinoceros horn whishes of course in the center of the rings face which is where your nose is and the cold almost always causes some degree of naval symptoms in humans s either runny nose or sneezing or stuffed up nose or sometimes unfortunately all three now the reason we do not have a cure for the common cold is that all of those different stereotypes of the cold virus mean that the virus itself has a different shape on its outside and as a consequence even if you have been exposed to a cold and you have developed antibodies against that cold virus the next cold that comes along very likely has a different shape and therefore your bodies antibodies to the cold virus it combated successfully before cannot latch on to and defeat that next different cerotype of the cold virus now cubit later out talk about the immune system and how those different antibodies are generated but for the time being understanding that there are lot of different types of cold viruses explain first of all why we do not have a cure for the common cold but also why you can get multiple colds within a given year or even within a given season because even if you develop antibodies against one cerotype of the cold virus a different cerotype can come along and you can get sick again with that new cerotype of the cold virus how d you catch a cold now one of the problems with the cold virus being cold the cold virus and the fact that indeed there are more cold virus is present and transmitted between humans in the cold winter months of the year is that people generally assume that it is the cold temperatures outside that actually give you a cold virus and that is simply not true however what you heard isolated if you're mom most likely but mayor dad said my do not go outside without a sweater or jacket on you are going to catch a cold are you going to catch cold has propagated this a the myth that the cold temperatures themselves are the cause of catching a cold virus and that is simply not true the virus that we call the cold virus is spread by breathing or by sneezing or by people sneezing or coughing or breathing on to their hands and then touching surfaces and then other people touching those surfaces and then touching most likely their eyes in order to self in fact no we are going to get into the details of how f are the virus can spread with a sneeze how long it can survive on the hands et camera but for the time being know this the cold virus is a pretty stable virus in that it can survive on surfaces non human or human surfaces meaning skin or on a table or on a glass or on a door handle for up to twenty four hours for all you hypochondriac's out there i probably just gave you little spike in cartisall and for you non hypocondracts i hope what i just said use you to the fact that just avoiding people who are sneezing and coughing is not sufficient to avoid getting colds in flues however the fact that a cold virus is alive and well on a given surface let say on a door handle does not mean that if you touch that door handle that you will necessarily be infected with that cold virus and that is because your skin i shall provides in excellent barrier against most viruses in bacteria your skin also includes a lot of anti viral substances on it even if you have not put any of that alcohol stuff for the hand sanitize or stuff on your skin is a very important barrier component of your immune system or gan to talk about that elicit later but if somebody has a cold in the happily perhaps you know while their nose or sneeze into a tissue hopefully into a tissue and then discard that tissue the cold virus particles are extremely small how small well most of us are familiar with thinking about centimeters or inches if you think about a millimeter being one one hundredth of a centimeter well you can take a millimeter and you can divide that up into a bunch of little slices also such that you get the micron the micron is one one thousand of a centimeter and if you want to get a sense of how thick or thin that is the side of a credicard the little inside of a credicard is about two hundred microns thick if you set your credicard flat on a table and that you look at it from the side that tiny tiny thin little edge that is about two hundred microns the cold virus is made up of particles that a probably in the range of about five microns or it is extremely small ism in the cold virus therefor with a good sneeze or even a light sneeze can spread rely far now the good news is those particles are relatively heavy they do not tend o mist about in the air for very long they tend to fall down on to the ground or on to surfaces but as i mention before it they can survive for very long time on those surfaces should you touch your hand to a door handle or table or shake the hand of somebody that has cold virus on their hands either because they themselves have a cold or they contact with somebody else head cold virus in it somehow landed on their hands just cause the other person sneeze all these scenarios are very realistic that cold virus will not in fact you unless it can get inside of your body and one of the primary entry points of it getting inside your body is via the eyes by wiping that cold virus on your eyes now you may think o cay ism just not king to touch my eyes but a lot later we are going to talk about a study that shows that almost always indeed almost always when you meet somebody new you touch your eyes and the frequency of people touching their face that is the region of the face around the eyes and their eyes throughout the day is extremely high this is one of the primary routes by which the cold virus is transmitted from one person to the next but of course there is also theugrhout that were all familiar with which is the person that is sneezing or coughing ore blowing their nose into tissues and then throwing them in the trash and not washing their hands after each in every time they do that an important aspect of to day's discussion that we will get into once i also present you what a flue is and how it differs from the cold is that we are going to need to talk about what stage of infection people are actually contagious with the cold or flue and there is actually a lot of mythology about this in fact there is a lot of just lying about this people will be coughing or sneezing and they will say o yam not contagious any longer or people make up these things oh if you had the flue for two days than you are no longer contagious or that you cannot be contagious until you have symptoms we are going to go through all the aspects of contagion and how coughing or sneezing or how long you have had a cold or flue actually relates to whether not you are contagious in a little bit but for the time being know that the cold viruses very very small it can be transmitted through the air it can be transmitted via contact from skintoskin contact and it can survive on surfaces for up to twenty four hours and when you touch those surfaces or a person with the cold virus most often the way it is going to get into your body and infect you that you get a cold is by touching your i region though touching other regions of your body can also pass the cold virus into you for incense the mouth and lips but that is actually far less common we will get into that in just a little bit now different cerates that is different types of cold virus tend to create a different array of over all symptoms such that one cold might be a really cortical bad cold others are more mild some tend to induce more runny nose others more stuffy head and a obit of fever or in some cases a lot of fever one thing that is important understandings that if people are going to be infected by the cold virus they tend to develop symptoms one to two days after they were exposed to the virus now the good news is if you are exposed to the cold virus that does not necessarily mean that you are going to catch that cold virus that is if you retune system can fight off that cold even if you have never been exposed to that cerotype before then you will not actually have that cold than you will not transmitted put differently it is possible to avoid getting a cold virus even if you have never been exposed to that cerotype of cold virus and you happen to come into contact with somebody who has that cerotype of cold virus or you touch a surface of some object door handle at several that has particular cerotype of the cold virus on it and got forbid you then wipe your eyes that does not necessarily mean that you are going to get sick and a good portion f to day's episode is going to focus on tools that are supported by science that allow you to bolster uromeun system and greatly increase he probability that even if you are exposed to a novel cerotype of the cold virus that is one that is new to you that your bodies never seen before that you will not get sick another thing to understand about the colvirus is the you are generally most contagious to other people when you feel at your worst that is when your coughing and sneezing and yet the stuffy head watery eyes and on but you can also be contagious to other people when you are starting to feel better that said most of the date o point to the fact that about five to six days after you hit your peak of worst symptoms or i guess we should say your near the dip of worse symptoms cause it is such an awful state to be in you are probably exiting the plays in which you are contagious now i wont to be very clear that does not mean that if you have had a cold for five or six days that you are no longer contagious if you continue to experience sneezing and coughing watery eyes in the evening your feeling much worse firstling in the morning you are feeling especially groggy et camera well then you are still contagious another way to framethess is those people that con tine to show up at the him and show up at work they tell you ye i got this cold but have had it for a few days ism no longer contagious in there wipe in their eyes and there blowing their nose frankly they do not knowhow they are talking about they are basically a walking talking breathing sneezing coughing cold virus vector a vector is a rout for passage of a virus please if you are sneezing if you are coughing if you are still experiencing the symptoms of a cold stay home stay away from other people as much as possibleand i realize that some people simply cannot avoid going to work or cannot avoid interacting with other family members or other people they have the cold virus but this mythology that if we have had a cold for a few days and we are starting to feel better but were still exhibiting symptoms that were not contagious that is pure method's simply not grounded in fact now there is nothing that can be done about that first day or two after which were exposed to a cold virus where we are not experiencing symptoms and it is quite possible to pass the cold virus on to other people but i think that every work place every home environment every him every society would benefit greatly if people who were sick with the cold did not expose other people to that coldvirus as much as possible and indeed this is a serious issue it is not just about a few sniffles and watery eyes there is an enormous financial and mental health cost and physical health costs to people getting the cold and that is not just about people who retune compromised or elderly people what were generally referring to as the cold to day can be mild it can be moderate it can also be very severe and it can exacerbate other health issues that people have and will talk about that elicit later and how to offset some of those healthishes o was now let us talk about the floveirus the floveirus is as i mentioned a virus and just wit the cold there are different cerates of the floveirus there are also different general categories of flu virus you have got your a type floveirus is your beetle floveiruses and your seat type floveirises and by the way ism saying floveirises but of course am referring to influenza but it is just cold of commonplace nowadays to refer to influenza as the flue similar to coal rises the different types of floveirises exist based on the different types of phones that they express on their surf's in fact in the news over the last few years there been a number of different floveiris strains that have been described according to their surface proline characteristics things the h one and one virus what is h one and one h one and one describes the different types of prolines that are expressed on the surface of that particular floveiris now the most common type of floveirises are in that a category of flues this is the type of flue that cause the punish flue now the punish flue which by the way did not originate in spain people think it probably originated in new york perhaps elsewhere but certainly not in spain killed anywhere from seventeen to fifty million people depending on which literature you read that is an enormous number of people and it occurred in four different waves of infection that occurred between the years nineteen eighteen and nineteen twenty the punish flue was a type a h one and one virus and actually it is worth noting that this winter season there have been some cases of h one and one already reported in the united states and elsewhere woof course the goal is always to contain the propagation of those floveirises and that is done through a number of different approaches the best and most reliable approach of course is to not come into contact with somebody that is carrying the h one and one or any other type of floveiris however based on the way that the floveiris infects the body the way that the symptoms emerge and the ways that virus is propagate that cannot always be avoided one thing to know and i consider this of fortunate aspect of floveiris biology is that the floveiris unlike the could virus can only exist on surfaces for about two houris after about two hours it tends to die off the floveiris is most typically passed by human human contact or coming into contact that is walking into a cloud of somebody is sees that contains floveiris or somebody is cough that contains floveiris and yes it is possible that shaking some one tain could actually introduce floveiris to your hand and then if you wipe your eyes or it'll talk about a few other portals of entry for the lovers and couldviris in a few minutes can get into your body and infect you and yes you can pick up the lovers from surfaces however that is far less common than the floveiris passing from human human contact now there arrant as many different types of floveiris as there are types of coldviris and that is why there have been attempts at making floveaxines or called flu shots i think most people are familiar with the signs and advertisements on line and in the work place and school saying you get your flu shot this season the reason that flu shots can exist at all is because there are limited enough types of floveiris present in a given year that specific taxies that is flue shots can be generated against that particular strain of the flue virus how effective is the flue shot and i want to be very specific here when we say the flue shot singular it sort of implies that there is one flue shot that can combat all the different types of flue and as you just learn that is not the case we probably should be saying the flue shots but just for sake of simplicity when i say the flue shot i mean the flue shot that is given inagiven flue season that is directed at specific strains of the flue because researchers have determined that that particular strain of flue or strains of flue are the ones that are most abundant for that particular flue season studies have shown that getting the flue shot reduces one's risk of contracting the particular flue that is most abundant that season by about forty to sixty per cent but of course the flue shot is completely ineffective at combating any other forms of the flue virus and of course colds or other types of upper respiratory infections studies home also shown that taking the flue shot can reduce the severity of one symptoms if they in fact get the flue anyway now personally i do not typically get the flue shot and the reason for that is that i do not tend to go into environments where i am particularly susceptible to getting the flue i do not work in a hospital or clinic i do not tend to interact with large numbers of people on a daily basis for me have opted not to get the flue shot now that does not mean that have never contracted the flue as i mentioned earlier i tend to get sick with a cold or flue about once every eighteen to twenty four months and the severity of that cold or flue has range from minnow at one point a very high fever in one case buartypically a moderate fever and the usual symptoms of always that we have been discussing and have manage to get over those without having taken the flue hot pretty easily now of course we also do not know that those were actually flues despite the distinct differences between the symptoms of cold and flue most people do not really know whether not they have a cold or flue this is another thing to think about when considering whether not to get the flue shot ultimately because at least to my knowledge most workplaces do not mandate that people get the flue shot i could be wrong about certain workplaces but my experience is that most workplaces do not mandate that people get the flue shot when you take the fleshpot you are really hedging a bet your hedging a bed against the fact that you will be or not be expose to that particular strain of flue virus that is most abundant that season or strains of floveiris that are most abundant that season and that the flue shot that you are taking is directed at those particular strains again in my case i do not tend to take the flue shot but of course you need to make the decision that is right for you for instance if you have family members that are immune compromised or you work in a school or you think that you are exposed to a lot of flues or you are concerned about transmitting flue to any one individual or group of individuals those are all things that need to be taken into consideration and of course speak to your physician i will also say this which is that i mention that have tended to catch cold s or flues at a rate of about once every eighteen to twenty four months and when i say a cold or flue i mean a serious one one that keeps me in bed where i have a fever and ism sweating what i have done and i continue to do is because i pay pretty close attention to how well ism sleeping or different life events mi different work outs et camera and i put those into my calender and i have a short hand to do that it only takes about thirty seconds each day cade did this work out it was kind of level seven out of ten intensity got good sleep last night or poor sleep and i know what good and poor sleep is for me and that is about the level that ism charting these things i have been able to go back and look at the events preceding when have come down with a cold or flue again i do not know whether i was a cold or flue but before i got sick and have seen for instance have ever done two hard work outs in a day something i never do any longer have tended to get sick after that if have tended to do hard work outs and then expose myself to cold temperatures while traveling especially traveling over sees that tended to precede those colds or flues which again for me a very seldom it is a limited day to set this is entirely anew date i meaning related to my own history of getting colds or flues but it is something that i actually recommend people do which is you don't to pay attention to when you first start to getting symptoms pay attention when you got over a given what you think is a cold or flue and then to look at what was happening in the days before in that day i do nothing it is possible to do hyper precise forensics on a cold or flue right man you could have gone into the a station put your credit card in the machine to you grab a drink out of the refridger and picked up a cold or flue from the handle of the refrigerator or from the credit card machine or even from the gazump you simply do not know however if you look at the pattern of behavior travel sleep exercise sorts of interactions you are having prior to getting a bad cold or flue chances are you can a learn something interesting and be able to avoid getting a serious cold or flue at least to some extent going forward and have done that i think fairly successfully because i can tell you that the frequency your colds or flues that have come down with has indeed been dropping from year to year where as a debate to go i tended to get colds or flues probably about once a year and in some cases even twice a year though that was pretty rare that really expanded to about once every eighteen months and then in the last five years i think have gotten sick a two times pretty badly with a cold or flue and then once with a kind of mild cold or flue i tell you all that just as an example of how you can start to think about how your immune system interacts with different types of behaviors different types of situations such that you can learn something about your immune system and what is going to best protect you against getting colds and flues going forward which of course is a great thing to do because we all think that we can get out there be around people the are coughing and sneezing we can go to the him when it is crowded and winter of that person over theirs coughing but mana bustee a stay a few feet away no big deal and while i do not want to turn anyone into hyprocondriacts that is how you get infected that is how you get a cold or flue and at the same time i do not think any one should get to the point where they're afraid to go into a jam or afraid to go to the work place but i will say once again if you are sick with a colder flue if you are coughing sneezing blowing your nose runny eyes and your walking into work were the him or on to public transportation an you are telling people ism not contagious your lying i to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is a g one a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that also contains adaptigencs i started taking a g one away back in two thousand and twelve the reason i started taking it n the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it insures that i get enough periotic and robotic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realize is not just important for the health of our got but also for our man system and for the production of nauru transmitters and uromodulators things dopamine and teratogen in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are number of things in a g one including specific micro nutria's that are hard to get from whole foods are at least in sufficient quantities a g one allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that i need robotics robotics the adaptagens and critical micronutrient any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them a g one because a g one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try a g one go to drink a g one dot calm slash supermen and you will get a your supply o vitamin d the k two and five free travel packs of a g one again that to drink a g one dot calm slash supermen now the diabolical thing about the flue virus is that just the diabolical thing about the cold virus you start shedding virus that is you are contagious about twenty four hours prior to the onset of first symptoms for you that means that you can be a flue viral vector even when you are not having symptoms that is just the unfortunate aspect of these viruses there very clever they do not have brains but these viruses have adapted to propagate from host to host to host they have a drive to continue to stay alive and to infect more host even though they do not have a brain they have a sort of a let us call it viral intelligence and as have said several times now if you are still exhibiting symptoms of the colder flue you are contagious however with respect to the flue you are most contagious during the three days when you feel the absolute worst when your fever is at its worst well talk anyhow to deal with fever elicit later when you are coughing and sneezing headache all that when that is at its peak that is when you are most contagious again i realize that people cannot always avoid contact with other people and live under the same roof caretaker is interacting with the person that has the colder flue and i do wont to remind you something i said earlier which is just because you come into contact with a colder flue does not necessarily mean that you will come down with that is be infected by a colder flue whether or not you come down with a colder flue is of course dependent on whether not you come into contact with h you cannot catch a colder flue that you have never come into contact with just you cannot get even by a shark if you never go in the ocean however the probability of coming down with that colder flue of it getting past your immune system barriers and infecting you is going to be strongly dictated by the different aspects of your immune system for which there are three major aspects which will talk about next and of course the things that you do to bolster those three aspects of your immune system ora let us talk about your immune system i have to confess that even though i spent well over three decades being a student of and a researcher of the nervous system the immune system is o cool and i say that because it has its incredible elegance and logic to it it basically consist of three major lines of defense there is a physical barrier or rather a set of physical barriers that exist between the organs of your body and the outside world and you are probably immediately thinking skin and yes it indeed it includes your skin but also some interesting things the mucosa lining of your nose and mouth and even some of the liquids that are on the surface of your eyes will talk about those in a moment then there is a second line of defense which is for any virus or bacteria or fun is for that matter but to day were talk about viruses colds and flue viruses any virus is that get pass the physical barrier of your skin and the mucosa lining of particular regions of your body well then you have what is called the innate immune system the innate mine system is this very generalized response system it is general in the sense that it deploys a basic set of agrochemicals that are not specific to the particular virus that is made it into your body not only is it not specific to a particular cerotype of the cold or a different type of floveirus but it is not even discriminating between cold or floveiris this thing we call the innate immune system is ta generalized response system to go and combat viruses it could be a cold tit could be a flue it could be a bacteria it could be a fungus hit could even be a physical object and your innate mine system response by saying oke let us go deal with this now the third component of euromune system ifs what is called the adaptive immune system and i alluded to this aspect of euromune system a litobat earlier the adaptive mine system is the aspect of our immune system that recognizes because the innatemune system told it that something has infected the body at some level that some organ or set of organs and theirs an emerge my and the adaptor immune system goes in and in a very targeted way figures out what sorts of profanes it needs to produce that is antibodies to combat that specific cerotype of virus o case of the immune system has a physical barrier component and it is not your skin some other things as well you've got your innate immune system which is this gene alined response system and then there is the adapt of immune system let us talk about the physical barrier component first and this is actually good opportunity for us to just take a brief step back and realize that any time we are talking about our physiology there is going to be a mechanical set of features and there is going to be a chemical set of features right now we are talking about the mine system and the me chemical feature or the physical feature of the inion system is this barrier between the organs of our body and the outside world and the most obvious of those is the skin you are contained in this bag of stuff that we call skin the skin is not just for putting clothing on and for adorning with jewelry or tattoos if that is your thing watches et camera your skin is a living organ in an of itself i think we are most accustom to thing about the heart an the lungs and the liver in the brain as organs of the body but the skin is an organ of the body is well as a bunch of different layers of cells from the outside to the inside actually the skin cells themselves are made in the deeper layers of the skin and the migrate out towards the surface of the skin and at the surface of the skin on top of those cells and made by those cells are different types of chemicals that actually serve as antibacterial and antiviral agents meaning if a cold virus or floveirus or other type of is lands on the skin it can neutralize an kill that virus your skin is a very important physical barrier against viruses such as the colder floveiris getting into your body and infecting other cells and tissues now your skin is not contiguous meaning there are holes in it let us think about those holes for a second we go from head to foot it is pretty obvious that your eyes have these two openings and those are openings in your skin right as you open your eyelids beneath there are your corneas the shining part of your eyes and a little it further back at the back in er lining of your eyeball you have a very thin three cell layers that piece of tissue that we call the curl retina and i say this because the neural retina is actually a piece of your brains you have two pieces of brain that line the back of your eyes and that is the light sensing tissue in the back of your eyes now i say this because what the means is that it is a very short distance between the opening of your skin that we call your eyelids and your brain now most of the brain of course is contained in the cranial vault within what most people call the skull but your brain is not far away from those openings that we call your eyelids as a consequence on the surface of your eyes those corneas the shining part of your eyes on the outside they are a bunch of different chemical features there are tears that are made by your backroom glans but there also a lot of anti bacterial agent that actively kill off stuff that could potentially infect your body could make it into your body make even into your brain if you have ever awoken up in the morning and you have some crust on your eyes and you an think of that cross that cutting yellowy stuff sometime its yellow i nothing kind of gross that is locally dead bacteria that your eyes have successfully defeated during your night sleep when you wipe those away you are taking the casualties of a war that you one during your night sleep and you are whisking those away now as we descend a little bit further down the face there of course the nostril openings and the nostril openings ten to be kind of sticky right their moisticky and warm you not to put your fingers up them right now you just know their moisticky and warm itch fingers but your nose please the mucosa lining of your nose is actually of very important substance that is sticky in order to trap viruses such as colds and flue viruses and then chemical components within the mucosa lining can neutralize them that is the best case scenario there are of course scenarios in which the cold or floveirus takes residence in your mucosa lining and can make its way back into your sins passages an can then in fact other cells and tissues of your body because the virus replicates and spreads throughout the body and then going afford little bit further down i realize this is obvious you have your mouth and what is really interesting is that your mouth also as mucosa lining which is sticky and has chemical components to neutralize in coming viruses but we know that the type of mucus and the type of bacteria that live in your nose and mouth that by the way are very healthy for you and encourage healthy union system function that is act as ways to neutralize viruses within your nose and mouth are very different your nose in your mouth they seem similar at the level of erewhile it is warm and sticky in there there is mucus but they are very very different tissues in fact if you think about your mouth its this incredible structure that not only lets you eat and breathe and out through although i suggest most people be nasal breathers for most of the time of their day and night if you can of course sometimes you have her mouth breath but keep this in mine the others big opening in the front odor face and bacteria getting in the all day long viruses are getting in their all day long and in most cases you are successfully combating those viruses and bacteria because the mucosa lining of your mouth and your nose for that matter and the microbioda those little micro organisms thathave taken residence in your nose and mouth are helping to contribute to fight off bacteria viruses provided the microbiota there are diverse and are of the type you want which will talk a little bit more about later and then descending further down the body of course their other openings in to your skin barrier namely the your urethra of the penis or vagina and of course the vaginal canal the genitals of course have their own mucosa lining and as you can imagine it is distinct in terms of its physical make up and its chemical make up from the mucosa lining of your nasal passages and mouth and the of course we have the rectum and anus which is the outflow pathway of your intestines which are post digestive and there too you have a mucosa lining for which yes certain types of viruses and bacteria can infect that aria but what we know is that the primary entrycites the most common ways in which colds and flues get into your body the way they breach that physical barrier that we call your skin is through your eyes your nose or your mouth and there are a lot of data some of which conflict and frankly there need to be more data in order to really resolve this but it seems the primary entry sight for viruses to get into the body tends to be the eyes were the mouth and we can get into some of the reasons why that would be but if you think back to our conversation about the way that colds in flues exist in the world either as aeirosauls or on surfaces of objects or on surfaces of skin well then what ism about to tell you next will make it o obvious why the eyes and the mouth are the primary sides of entry for colds and flues and if you keep that in mind there is a good chance you can avoid a lot of colds or flues that you would otherwise catch o case before i talk about the important roles of the inmate and the adapt of immune system in keeping colds in flues at bay it'll tell you that you have a problem and that problem is that you tend to touch your eyes very often in fact you tend to touch your eyes most often after you shook somebody ease's hand now why am i picking on you where in fact ism not ism picking on all of you and a picking on myself included because therehave bee several studies now primarily from room nobles slab at the whitesmen institute showing that when people encounter another person and they shake their hand they either touch their eyes or touch another region of their face very close to the eyes or that they touch their hand to their mouth now there are bunch of theories as to why people do this there is the idea that people are actually sniffing their own hand and in particular sniffing their own hand more often after they shake some one ease's hand as a way to detect what memo signals exist on the other person not necessarily conscious smelling of the other persons smell but rather some sort of unconscious mechanism by which we take the chemicals of the person we come into contact with and we bring them to our nose our eyes or in some cases a upper lip and that our factory system that is the neurons that exist just behind the back of our nose ore processing that information and getting all sorts of important information about how street the other person is their hormones ah whether not we recognize them the fact that they are different from us that is right we are also smelling ourselves all day long poems lab has shown this that people are and walking round in their own odor cloud we tend to touch our arm pits we tend to touch different aspects of our body yes and smell ourselves multiple times throughout the day this is all being done unconsciously i suppose some people are doing it consciously and that there is a lot of information about our physiology and health and when we do this after shaking somebody is hand that there is a lot of information about the other persons physiology in health that our nervous system grow factory system in deep parts of our brain that involved in primitive tight behaviors but also some pretty sophistic gated behaviors are taking into account now nous noble was a guest on the hubrumen lab podcast i encourage you to check out that episode if you have time it is a fascinating voyage into the factory system and noxious conscious smelling or sniffing of things we go oh that smells good or that smells bad t or that person you knows somebody i want a mate with or hang out with or avoid it is also unconscious processing of call memo signals chemical signals but the reason i bring up these studies now in the contacts of colds and flues and how to avoid getting colds and flues is as a reminder that we are pretty much wired to contact our own face with our own hands at the level of our eyes nose and upper lip and around the eyes very shortly after we touch somebody ease's skin and if you are mindful of it you can actually avoid bringing colds or flues to your face now in doing are you are going to short circuit a bunch of other important biological processes involved in understanding what is going on in your environment because you are not bringing in those smells bi suppose that is possible but with respect to avoiding colds and flues it seems a pretty good trade off to me the point this try to make here is that in order for you to catch our colds or flue that cold or floveiris the little particles of cold and floveiris need to make it into your body and the primary entrysides are eyes nose mouth and the primary actions by which we bring colds and floveiris's to our eyes nose mouth are by touching other people or by touching other surfaces that have cold or floveiris just remind you cold virus can exist up to twenty four hours on a given surface floveiristans to die off after about two hours on a given surface and we are bringing that to our face we are literally bringing the virus to ourselves a little bit more conscious a awareness about that fact means that you can probably avoid colds and flues to some extent how much well it is unclear it is unclear because as you recall some people have and are passing along cold or floveiris prior to any symptoms and of course it is possible that you can walk into an arisall cloud of cold or floveiris even if a person is not there and you do not come into contact with them but semiconscious awareness of these routs of passage for the color flowers i do believe can reduce the probability that you will catch a cold or flue and of course ism not encouraging people to never touch touches an important part of social connection and social bonding but if you start to thing about these portals of entry for the colds and floveiris into your body well then you you do not perhaps might think twice before hugging some one kissing them on the cheek during a time in which you are trying to actively avoid getting the cold or flue now i feel little bit funny about sharing this information because again i do not want encourage peoples always be it i arms distance you n i fakefistsbumping a know keeping a gap between them again touch isn't important component of social connection but since to day's topic is colds and flues and how to avoid getting colds and flues just you cannot get eaten by a shark if you do not go in the ocean there is a much lower probability that you are going to get a cold or flue if you are not touching a lot of hands and bringing those hands to your eyes nose or mouth i suppose one way around the sort of do i hug do i shake hands thing is to just be conscious of the fact that when you shake somebody is hand that you are very likely to touch your eyes or face within the next thirty seconds or and maybe you and up being that person who outcome hand sanitizer on your hands sometimes that can feel awkward to do that rain front of somebody you knows consenting a signal lie hand want you to infect me but guess what you d want them to infect you oke let us imagine that a colder flue virus makes it into your system it breaches the physical barrier of your skin and mucosa lining now you have in mind all the deferent ways that could happen and all the different was that could be prevented but we are starting at a point here a hypothetical point whereby that colder flue virus has made it into your body your immune system has an absolutely exquisitely sophisticated way of knowing you verses other meaning cells within your body that are of you and cells of your body that are from other organisms or viruses from the outside world and when viruses such as a cold or floveirus are detected in your body your body might not even recognize that it is a cold or flowers it might not even recognize ha its virus at all it just knows that this thing that is in me is of other it is not me have never seen it before this is not me these are not my cells these are not the chemicals that ism producing and yourmune system is amazing in that way and when it occurs your innate immune system launches a response what is that response well first of all the response is very rapid right colder flue makes it into your body and your inmate immune system immediately or near immediately launches an attack on that invader or invaders because as soon as the virus gets in your body it is going to start replicating as quickly as it can what happens white blood cells that your body produces will go to the cites where those viruses are and the by the we those viruses are basically getting into cells of your body and then high jacking the genetic machinery of those cells in order to replicate within those cells and then eggs it those cells and then go in fact more cells that is how these viruses work your bodies making white blood cells things neutrafills natural killer cells macrophages these are what we call effector cells that act as a kind of impudent system and go to the sites that those viruses exist and the cells that they have infected and start thing to physically barrier them in and also you specific chemical mechanisms to neutralize and kill those viruses again any time you think that biology think mechanical features and chemical features of a response now a key component of the innate amuse system is what is called the complement system not complement all you look very nice to day but complement oke the complement system which exists in the plasma within your blood these are chemicals in your blood stream that go and mark specific cells that have been infected or viruses with a signal a chemical signal that essentially looks an eat me signal to these other cell types of yourimmune s system such that those natural killer cells go through the body and go looking for the cells that have this eat me signal on them and try and destroy those particular cells the other thing that you are anateomiane system does is that the cells that have been infected and that are undergoing damage remember they have cold or floveirus within them in their his jacking the cellar machinery of those cells and using it to produce their own virus more of the virus and as a consequence the genetic machinery of those cells is not able to do a bunch of other things that it normally can do or t least not as well well those cells that are really hurting release a help me signal and then in response to that help me signal yourimune system release s what are called cidakinds things interleukin one interlunar six tumernacrosis fact or lava just fancy newspeak names for different types of molecules that go to the side of infection and try to help or assist to remove that infection and they also try to assist the repair of the cells that have been infected by those viruses now one of the mechanical or physical consequences of these chemical signals interlunar one interlucansix takeoff all again those are all cydocines being drawn to a particular cell or region of cells that have been infected is that it create some physical swelling of the area it impacts the musculature the veins and capillaries that feed that area and in response that they put more blood there out get some swelling or you will get in some cases the release of histamines right we think of anti histamine drugs well histamines are an aspect of yourimune system they move around in your body in these really conceals calls mast cells and master marcels and when the histamines are released that are becomes cone of hot and swelling it is what we call edema and that whole areas marked as really a site just a crashside on the side of the roads hey we have got eat me signals to get the debris in the bad stuff out of here try get those viruses out of here we have got help me signals to try and help the injured cells just you would try and help people at a car crash and there is a bunch of swelling there is additional blood flow sometimes there some other physical features as well now the important thing to know is that the inmate mine system is very fast and it is agnostic to the type of infection in fact it does not even matter if it is of bacterial physical fungal or viral infection but it certainly is not paying attention to the exact cerotype of cold virus or whether notes an each one influence or another type of influenza the way to thing about the inatomiune system is that it is a very fast and non specific response to a viral or other type of invader now that is all a bunch of biology but if you think about it let us imagine a scenario were u go to a party hang out the party you don't see any one coughing or sneezing but maybe one person there has a cold virus or they have a floveirus and they are not even aware of it they are not con to come down the symptoms for another day or you talk to that person you shake hands if you touch your eyes maybe do not but you are exposed to that cold or floveirus you home yo sleep you wake up the next morningyou feel fine and then sometime the next afternoon ane strip feel tickle in your throat o say to feel just a little bit of fatigue or always do you have that colder flue well possibly i yet we do not know for sure but assuming that that colder flu virus did not need make it into your system then you are innate mine system is starting to create a set of responses that we talked about a moment ago but it also tends to impact things that the level of your brain such that you cannot feel and i do not feel quite right i feel a little bit i do not feel great and there a lot of reasons why you would feel that way and will talk about those reasons a limit later but does that mean that you are necessarily coming down with a colder flue well technically yes you are innatemune system as deployed to fight this foreign viral invader but wether or not you actually get a full blown colder flue or put differently how severe that colder flue infection is depends on whether not your innate immune system can fight off that colder flue at the outset and indeed there many cases we believe where you get exposed to a colder flue it makes it into your body but your innate immune system is sufficient to beat it to fight it back this is one of the reasons why it is important that if you are starting to feel a bit under the weather and you think you are coming down with a colder flue that you do certain things in order to make sure that your innate immune system is both ready and that it can launch a full scale attack on that colder flue virus we are in a talk about how to do that alibi later ism not trying to withhold it is just it is important t understand that just because the virus makes it into your body does not necessarily mean that you are going to get a full blown colder flue and in fact that innatimune system sometimes is sufficient to prevent that colder flue from replicating enough that you get the full blown set of symptoms and that is kind of an ideal scenario we are defiling on to talk to day about what to do if you start to feel a little bit of always what to do if you discover that oh you know that person i was hanging out with at the party the night before they are really sick with a colder flue because there are things you can do to increase the probability that your innate immune system can handle the battle sufficiently such that you never have to get to the next component of the immune response which is the adapt of immune response i to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood engine to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health cols have long been a believer in getting regular blood work don for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood last i made your problem with a lot of blood test out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and forth but you do not know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy because they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of alldthose things metabolic factors lipids hormones et camera but it gives you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition behavioral modification supplements et camera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you would to try inside tractor you can go to inside tracker doc calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside tracker's plans again that is inside tracker doc cam slash supermen o case of the third layer of your immune system is our adaptive immune system and this is an amazing aspect of you the self we talk about up until now the physical barrier the inatemune system cool but the adapt of immune system is really a mind blower the most important thing to understand about your adaptor immune system is that as the name suggests its job is to create antibodies specific to the very intruder that made it into you and infected your sells the very specific cerotype of colitis the very specific type of influenza such that you defeat that virus but then in an amazing way your adapt f immune system also maintains a memory of that battle and keeps within your body believe it or not within a population of stemcells which are sells that can rise to more cells such that if you ever encounter that same cerotype of coldviris or same strain of influenza again that your antibodies can immediately neutralize that colder floveiris the adapt of immune system has the ability to make propenes that have a particular shape on their surface that matches the shape of the thing that ourimune system is trying to kill now the adapt of immune system has two basic phases in the first phase the adapt of immune system makes these things called immunogulobulence is and the immune globulence comingdifferent forms the i g there is i m their other types of genus well for sake of to day's discussion know that the initial wave of antibodies that the adaptor immune system makes are of the i m variety n the ileum antibodies can travel to and latch on to the surface of the cold floveiris and it matches it pretty well it is not perfect but it matches it pretty well think about of for in since of particular cerotype of cold virus or the ah one and one flowers having in a very particular contour on its surface the item approximates that contour such that it is better fighting that color floveiris than is the inmate immune system but it is not a perfect fit however the adapt of immune system does not stop with the production of those seems the adapt of immune system takes that information about how precise or imprecise that fit is between the igeemianabodies and the surface of that particular color floveiris and then in an amazing way send signals back to the stemcell populations in the bone marry and other tissues and then more antibodies come out of the i g variety and the i g prove s are very specific to the shape of that particular cold virus or flowers such that the ages then can rebind to and neutralize those viral particles he when we talk about the immune system were talking about a physical barrel that if it is breached a cold or floveirus takes residence and starts to replicate the innate immune system launches at generalized attack on that color floveirus and then the adapt of immune system kicks in usually couple days later first with the production of antibodies that are pretty specific to the particular virus that happen to make it into the body and infect cells but then there is a second wave of production of antibodies and those antibodies are incredibly specific for that particular cold or floveirus and as i mention earlier the adapt of immune system then acquirers a memory of the specific fit between a given antibody that it made and the viral invader and the successful battle that those antibodies waged on that viral invader and that memory is maintain such that if the next week ere the next season you encounter the exact same cerotype of cold virus or same type of floveirus will then you already have antibodies ready to be deployed sometimes the antibodies continue to circulate in your system sometimes you need to generate more of them and the umiak system is that amazing it can actually send a message back to that stem cell population in the bone major or elsewhere say hey listen this virus that we beat a few weeks or months or years back its back we need more anybodies and boom your adapt of immune system churns those antibodies out and kills the virus now it is a final point about the immune system have been talking a lot today about sells travelling to an killing virus stand sending signals eat me help me et camera it is important understand that while sells can migrate through the body a lot of what were talking about here is the movement of propenes through the vascular through the blood system of the body but there is another system that is very important for all of this that is collaborating with the vascular system and that is the lymphatic system we do not have time to go in to a whole lecture about the lymphatic system but suffice to say the lymphatic system can pull stuff from the blood such as viruses but also cells that have been beaten up or cells that have been eaten and are contained within other cells such as macrophages and it can do some filtering of those different cell types and it can produce its own useful chemicals that then can be reintroduced to the blood stream in order to help combat the infection now this becomes very important when later we talk about how specific forms intensities and durations of exercise can increase the ability for your innate immune system to combat infections that your adaptor immune system perhaps does not even have to get involved in the battle because your innate system handled it there are data to show the exercise of sufficient intensity in duration but not excessive intensity and duration can recruit the lymphatic system and recruit or increase the activity of the innate immune system even in the absence of an infection such that if you go to that party in you encounter that person with a colder flue you can defeat that colder floveirus at the outset and never have to deal with making antibodies that colder floveiris at all o case now you of a fairly sophisticated biological understanding of what colds are what flues are and the way that your immune system works to fight off viruses colds and flues with that in mine i think now's the appropriate time to start talking about what the scientific purrevued research says about how to a low your immune system to function at its best such that you can combat colds and flues meaning if you are exposed to a cold or flue that is if it breaches that physical barrier of your skin and the mucosa lining of your nose your mouth or gets into your eyes that you stand the greatest chance of defeating that cold or flue at the level of your innate immune system such that your adapt of immune system never even has to respond to it by creating all those specific antibodies now fortunately there are a lot of differ things we can do to improve the function of our mine system in fact i feel any time the winter months roll around we start to see the same list of thing surface on line and in the press and i do not want to diminish these things they are in fact the bed rock of maintaining and enhancing the function of your innate immune system what are those well some of these will be pretty obvious things getting enough quality sleep each night we know for instance that if your sleep deprived especial if you stay up all night but certainly even if you only get if the percent or seventy five percent of your sleep requirement that your innate immune system is going to offer its not going to be as effective it combating flues or colds in addition to that we know that exercise of specific type and specific duration and specific intensity can serve to bolster the innate immune system and will talk about the specific exercise protocols that can best achieve that we also here and it is absolutely true that we need adequate nutrition if we are in a colonic deficit for instance if were trying to diet through the winter months which many people tried to do that can place our inmate immune system in a bit of a compromise state that said things intermittent fasting or even longer duration fast have been implicated and here i really want o underscore implicated in brief improvements in the function of the innate immune system however extended fast or not eating enough calories to maintain bodyweight for many many days in a row can actually compromise the function of the innate immune system it'll go into this a bit deeper in a moment and then of course we here about stress that were all spoke to regulate our levels of stress not get to street and here i have to put an astrict next to those statements because yes indeed chronic stress meaning stress that continues day after day after day or even short periods of stress that impede our ability to sleep at night can indeed reduce the functioning of our innate immune system however it is also clear that short bouts of stress provided that they do not inhibit our ability to sleep that night can actually enhance the function of the immune system and this is something that i do not think its talked about enough we hear often that cotincortes all is bad it is a stress torment listen cortex all is fantastic provided that it is elevated early in the day and not late in the day or evening also cortex all does have thresholds beyond which if it is too high can be bad for us but it is also the case that if coatis all levels are too low that is bad for us and it is especially bad for the functioning or vermin system because luck corticords of which coatis all is have an important role inactivating those natural killer cells of the inateimune system they are one of the primary signals by which those interlucans interlunar one and interlunar six are deployed in our body and very often will hear stress increases inflammation and indeed interlunar one interlunar six or pro inflammatory you might think omaganus i don't want that i want coatis all i do not want these interlucans elevated but guess what the inflammation response is also an important component of that innate immune system that allows us to combat infections in trying to keep our net of mine system tuned up i realize that is not a biological statement tuned up but keep our mine system functioning at its best we want inflammation available as a tool to combat infection we want cortex all available as a way to activate that inflammation and other aspects of our immune system we just do not want much cortex all and much inflammation that we cannot sleep and that our got microfilm suffers and that brings me to the other component that is important for the basic functioning of your name immune system that you can be at your strongest when you inevitably encounter those cold and floveiruses why do i say inevitably the f you exist in the world that is if you live on planet earth you are going to be bombarded with different viruses and bacteria and fungasisn all the stuff throughout your days and yes in those winter months because people are spending more time indoors and there touching each other and surfaces more breathing on each other more sneezing on each other more and on and forth there is more propagation of colds and flues we take a step back and we ask how can i have my immune system as strong and ready as possible to combat cold and floveira cyst we get to those basics it is make sure you are getting enough quality sleep each night how much is enough however much you need in order to not feel sleepy during the day except may be the requirement for a short nap of anywhere from ten to thirty minutes not everyone requires that but that is perfectly normal to have an afternoon dip in energy that can be restored with the short nap or non sleep de breast will provide links to non sleep see breast and other tools in the shown o captions that our zerocost tools to allow you to recover your energy some people just simply take a nap in that sort of thing if you want tools for improving your sleep and making sure that your getting enough quality sleep each night we also provide a lingtaris eurocosts sleep tool kit that details that in peri form in just lists out the things that you can do or take if that is your choice and on and forth and of course we have done episodes on quality nutrition and what that means we have done episodes on stress and how to combat stress and we have done episodes on the call got microfilm but right now i just want to mention that the got microfilm which are the trulians of little mycobacteria that interact heavily with the immune system and help support the subsystem you want keep the gut microfilm healthy you will notice that we include some tools relate to the gut microfilm here in a moment and and this is very important keep in mind that the microfilm does not just exist in the gut often these days we hear about the got microfilm and ism o happy that the got microfilm is getting the attention that it deserves in the contacts of mental health physical health and performance but we cannot forget that the microfilm also exists on the surface of the eyes and in the nasal passages and indeed the microfilm that specific to the nasal passages as i mention before is very different from the microfilm that exist within the mouth and the microfilm that exists within the mucus of the nasal passages seems to be the most effective at combating any viruses that we encounter especially cold and floveirus is will ideally u would never encounter a colder floveiris we know that if the colder floveiruses going through the nasal passages you stand the greatest chance of combating that particular cold or flue what does that mean this is where i get to make a strong push for being a nasal breather certainly in sleep you want to be a nasal breather but also throughout the day unless your speaking or unless your exercising hard enough that you need to breathe through your mouth or unless your eating being a nasal breather is known to provide the right million the right environment to keep that nasal microfilm at its healthiest and to promote the diversity of microbioda in the nasal passages that can best protect you against colds and flues and here are growing number studies that point to this fact it'll provide a link to one that i for much which es entitled alterations and or nasal ferangeal microbiota and salivary prolines in mouth breathing children this is but one study pointing to the fact that being in nasal breather is a good thing mouth breathing children and mouth breathing adults meaning children and adults that default to mouth breathing tend to get more infections of of the upper respiratory tract including colds in flues consciously focussing on nasal breathing is one of the best things that we can all do to combat any colds are flues that we might encounter early are we talked about trying to avoid touching your eyes at least without washing you hands first we sanitizing your hands first after you meet somebody keeping a mind that most people do that unconsciously here we are also saying when you enter a room you are angingout with people you are waiting for public transportation or your work are walking down the hallway unless you are exercising hard unless you are talking try to focus on being a nasal brother there are bunch of other reasons to be in nasal breather as well but this is one of the primary ones and it'll provide a link to another reference which is the book jaws by my colleagues at stamford which talks about nasal breathing in the importance of nasal breathing but also the degree to which children and adults open themselves up to increase levels of viral infections as well as bacterial infections but viral infections in particular when they rely on mouth breathing and the incredible benefits of doing this very simple zero cost thing of whenever you can consciously remember to breathing through your nose as oppose to breathing through your mouth and just as an additional point about nasalbreathing because i cannot resist telling you this i just think it cool such an interesting adaptation when we breath through our nose we heat the air it away that is very different from the way we heat the air when we mouth breathe and by heating the air that is coming into the nasal passages it shifts the probability that cold or floveiruses will successfully imbed in the mucosa lining and infect the underlying cells and get into the other sells and tissues of our body this whole thing about nasal breathing is important and effective at the level of temperature regulation of the milieu within the nose and therefore the viruses that and up in the nose as well as the mucosa line in the chemicals made by the mucosa lining and again the nose is of very different place then the mouth in fact it'll provide a link to yet another paper ah which is entitled human nasal microbiota it is a really interesting paper its she interview with the scientist whose expert in the nasal microfilm talking about how this structure within our nose really is the primary defense sight by which we destroy potentially incoming viruses if it sounds overly simple just breathe through your nose it is very simple but it is also very effective now it is also clearly the case that keeping your gut microfilm is advantageous for keeping your inmate immune system at its most robust level of functioning and i should mention that your gut microfilm is not just about your stomach younowt we hear the word got we think stomach but it is actually the entire length of your digestive tract from your mouth out the other end and different microbiota exist at different locations along that tract of mucosa and there are couple things that one can do in order to make sure that the gut microfilm is best supported along that entire length the first one is that and this was covered on the episode that we did with my cole just in sonunberg who is a world expert in the gutmicrobium and that is to consume anywhere from two to forservings of low sugar tormented foods per day things sour trout things kimchi things keeper things cumbocha it can be a little bit of work to figure out which of these you and which ones your willing to consume on a regular basis but it is very clear e that the brine you know that an a salty solution around the sour trout and by the way when i say sour cat will were talking about here is the type that has to be refrigerated it contains what are called live cultures as opposed to the sour rot that can exist in the unrefrigerated portion of the store or pickles that also have that brine and that have to be kept in the refrigerator even before there open and of course things yoga which have active live cultures those are the sorts of things that are going to best support the diversity of microbioda along the entire length of the got microfilm such that you are got my crobyom can do its job in supporting your nervous system but here especially in the contacts of to day's discussion your i tune system now the low sugar component of low sugar tormented foods is important because what we know is that if you are consuming yogurts with a lot of sugar or you are consuming cabuccho with high levels of sugar or your consuming pickles or sour cry that have a lot of sugar in them your probably can a start to creates some other issues related to the sugar what you are really looking for these low sugar tormented foods and they can be a little bit tricky do seek out in the store but they are usually there and once you identify the ones that you you should really aim to get two to four servings of those per day you can also consume a periotic or robotic in the form of capsule form things eight y one athletic greens also contain periotic robotic but it is very clear that consuming two to four servings of low sugar fomented foods per day is among the best ways to promote health of the got mcrobiom and that the got microbyom is important for t keeping the inmate immune system thriving such that it can combat the colds or flues that are trying to bombard your system now there is another tool that you can use to enhance your got microfilm i have to warn you the s one might make a few of you cringe a little bit but this is one that i actually started doing about four months ago it is a interesting one it to it dates practice om older potency traditional medicine practices but it makes really good logical sense to be fair ism not aware of any enema's control trial exploring the use of this protocol but it is simple and completely cost free and it stands strongly on the logic of how the gut and or microfilm work that frankly i started doing it and youknow whether not placebo effect or not i do not know but i feel better and it is easy to do and it stands to potentially improve the function of your got microfilm enough that i figure i would at least share it with you and then you can decide what this protocol essentially consists of is before you go to sleep at night or in the morning you pour yourself a little bit of water whatever water you happen to consume just clean clear water and then you take a sip of that water when you wake up in the morning and you swish it around in your mouth and the you swallow it a those of you the a a gross let us think about this is it really gross to swish a lie bit of water around in your mouth and then swallow that water when you first wake up prior to brushing your teeth of course well it might seem gross to you but throughout the night when your sleeping especially if you are a nasal breather while you sleep the environment within your mouth is such that you are breeding a lot of bacteria you are creating all those little mycobacteria that potentially can inhabit your directs of tract and provide at least some of the substrate for the microbioda and your digestive tract to thrive and if that seems gross you keep in mind that is what having a healthy got microbioum really is all about the protocols very simple at zero cost you take a swig of water swish around and swallow it oddly it does not tasted u in fact it all just tastes swallowing and infected takes swallowing a low bit of water it is not as if it tastes am bad breath or something that it is a very simple protocol that again no rhenomized control trials but really stands on the logic of how the oral microbus in the got microfilm interact and because what we are talking about here is supporting the function of your got microfilm such it supports the function of your name one system such that you can avoid colds in flues it is to me it seems a pretty low bar yes o cay to torture urinatamune system you want to get that quality sleep as often as you possibly can you want a support that got microfilm in the ways that we just ascribed what about exercise we hear it all the time exercise is good for us it enhances the immune system and on and on unless an ism a huge believer in exercise i personally to do three bouts of cardiovascular exercise per week one long hon medium one short and i do three bouts of resistance training each week all of that and specifically what i do is available to you as a zero cross protocol in the form of a media we have a link to that in the shown actions ills have a whole episode about foundational fitness and on and on the discussion we region to have now is about what general forms of exercise actually do support the innate immune system and and this is really important what forms of exercise actually deplete our innate immune system this isn't talked about enough i think there are certain intensities and durations of exercise that make us more vulnerable to colon files we are going to discuss that before we do that i want it just briefly touching to something that i hear a lot which is the question if iu'mfeeling a litlebit run down should i exercise or not and to be ones there is not a straight for to answer to that question it is impossible for me or for you to know whether or not you were indeed exposed to a colder flue and you are starting to combated at the level of your natemune system where weather not you are just ow feeling a obit sluggish however what we do know is that if you are feeling manage at the level of the body your body is feeling different it is feeling heavier your feeling tired you feeling tired at a time of day that does not make sense giving your usual patterns o being tired you are feeling tired in a way that does not make sense given how much sleep you got the night before i t i man hear what were talking about is ruling out any possible in a life stressor you are up too lade or you drank coffin at the wrong time or something that what we knows that you are if you are feeling that general malaria across your whole body it is fairly likely that your coming down with something and that your best response to that would be to go home take a hot shower bath it'll explain why youwould want to do that in a few minutes and then get into bed early and even if you cannot fall asleep to just be as still and as relaxed as possible we know that if you push into bouts of intense activity or even just push yourself to engage in activity when your feeling run down at that for whole body level may be a little tickling your throat you are going to compromise the function of your invite immune system and it is very likely that you are going to get more sick than you would otherwise us here is my suggestion if you are trying to feel run down at the level whole body always or you just do not feel right you are best off taking a hot shower bath and getting into bed urges getting into bed and trying to rest and get as much sleep probably even a habit of extra sleep and here is why that whole body always that extra fatigue that is not easily explained by other factors in your life have to do with the fact that when you are inmate immune system is activated meaning it is already combating a cold or fly interleukin one and interlunar six have a way of interacting with a particular brain area called the dorsal raft nucleus which is chock a block full of neurons that release serotonin and serotonin from the dorsal raft nucleus acts on specific regions of your hypothalamus ere is the peptic region for those of you that want to know and other airs of the hypothalamus that generate a state of sleepiness in addition when we are getting sick our sleep patterns change we feel we need to sleep more but we do not feel as rested from that sleep and the has to do wit the ways that serotonin interacts with some of the components of the brain circuitry involved in sleep that controls slow wave or deep sleep and this is a whole discussion unto itself actually covered a lot of the mechanistic aspects of this business of immune induced sleepiness and always associated with feeling sick and an episode about interactions between the nurse and immune system that i will also provide a link to in the shownote captions but suffice to say if you are feeling that whole body always and especially if you all s have a love it of a throat tickling just not feeling right for you you are not accustomed to feeling that way at that time of day or night well then i encourage you to get rest because chances are t your already combating and infection however if you are out an about a lot during the winter months or your interacting with a lot of people by virtue of work or public transportation or whatever the gem et camera your school teacher make your kids are coming home with colds and files and you are not yet feeling that always you are not feeling any throat tickle you are not getting that kind of on and a burning ore tickle within your naval passages when you breathe yon we are all familiar with these things that watering the eyes that kind of precedes the getting the full blown cold or fly well if your not experiencing that stuff and you want a keep your inatemune system strong enable to combat off colds in flues then we know that exercise can be an excellent way to increase the output of that innate immune system what i mean by that is the appropriate intensity in duration of exercise can act as a stressed that promotes a bit of inflammation yes the release of city kinds and a bit of activation of the inatomune system including the production of more white blood sells natural killer cells such that your sort of prompting the gnat amuse system to almost think that there is something to battle such that if you ever encounter in infection you can defeat it right off the bat we'egoin to get granular here about what we mean by proper intensity an duration of exercise there is a wonderful review that was published in twenty nineteen in the journal of sport and health science entitled the compelling link between physical activity and the bodies defense system and there is a lot to this review article but of just the high light a few of the critical features that are going to directly relate to protocols that i think all of you are going to be interested in first of all we know that exercise that is of sixty minutes induration or less and that is intense but not all out effort here we are not talking about percentage of single repetition man weight here were not talking about seven need to eighty five percent of one's via two man what were talking about is you subjectively gauging what is a ten out of ten effort lake you could not do any more you could not contribute any more effort to that exercise bout and that is trough whether not where time about resistance training exercise or party of vascular exercise running or rowing or things of that sort what we know is that if you do that sort of exercise for about sixty minutes or less you promote the exchange of components between the blood and the lymphatic system that increase the circulation of those cells and chemicals within the inatemune system such that not just during exercise but for many many hours afterwards may be even as much as twenty four hours afterwards your inmate mine system level a baseline activity is ramped up allowing you to better combat infections such as colds and flues o case to this is an incentive for getting regular exercise of sixty minutes or less per day making it of sufficient intensity for your inatemune system to deploy more of those chemicals and for your lymphatic an blood circulation to increase their exchange of materials enough that your natemune system is bolstered however it is absolutely not the case that more is better in fact it is probably the case that less is better here is what we know for sure and this review cover sort of the extreme of these examples but for instance people that do bouts of walking each day for about sixty minutes brisk walking experiences increase tell function that is an a mine cell that goes out in combats cold in love erases and natural killer cell activity those increase increase macrophage function you are now familiar with these cells if you do not know exactly what they do just keep in mind that your hart about these in the context of what the innate immune system does to go out and fight colds in flues cytikinds increase but not dramatically o case to this is a mild inflammation response stress hormone such as quarters all appenefgfr nor upon errand also called adrenaline and nor adrenaline those are deployed is well sixty minutes or less of this moderate to high intensity exercise creates this mild stress of sponge and in increase in the function of the innate amuse system however people that run a marathon and as i recall a marathon is twenty six point two miles if ism not mistaken they experiments a very different pattern of immune response to that long bowed of exercise here we are comparing one hour of exercise to three hours is hat what it takes to run marathon have some friends their marathoners ism to seen about three may be four hours if your really slow but somewhere between in two and a half and three hours of your trained up and you are doing it you are doing them regularly well here is the point people who just ran marathon and people who have been training for a marathon and are approaching that marathon are severely immune compromise the levels of their tell function are way below baseline meaning the ante to mine system is not functioning nearly as well as it would if they were to not exercise at all their natural killer sell activity is also greatly diminished these are huge huge reductions in these cells that is in the function the innate immune system and their stress hormones and there inflammatory molecules such as side on circulating in their blood are extremely high now again we are representing opposite ends of the spectrum here with one hour or less of exercise daily verses twenty six point two mile marathon exercise or half marathons as the case may be and let me be very direct ism not discouraging people from running or training for marathons or half marathons i think that is create just understand what you are doing to your mine system when you do that and take the necessary precautions but i think most people listening to this are trying to think about ways that they can avoid getting colds in flues and certainly running marathons is not going to be the way to do that quite the contrary the way to do that is in addition to the other things we have been talking about to get regular exercise may be not every single day ism actually a fan of taking one at per week completely off from exercise you should on that day it'll do some son an cold if i have it available to me but the point is this you do not have to exercise for an hour a day in order to get this improvement in the innate amuse response data show that you can get this improvement in innate amuse response with as little as twenty minutes per day and probably even as little as twelve minutes per day however if you are going to try and accomplish this increase in the innate immune system function or output with ha shorter bow of exercise such as twelve minutes it better be twelve minutes of very high intensity training in fact that is what lands on my to for me it is fridge but it is a really matter which day the week there's one day of the week where i do a very short bout of party of vascular exercise but ism sprinting hard for anywhere from twenty seconds to a minute ad than ism taking a brief period of rest in the repeating that for a total of twelve minutes now some people here oh only twelve minutes of exercise required and they default to twelve minutes every single time they train i do not think that is a good idea i think that we can take the law of averages here and say the following i do believe every one should do a commination of party of vascular training and resistance training perhaps i think in general not on the same days but if you are going to do that and you want to maintain healthy man system function my suggestion when i do is unless it is the long bowed of party of vascular training that do once a week and long for me mean sixty to ninety minutes and sometimes longer if it is a height which certainly does not require that much intensity i suggest warming up for about five to ten minutes and then limiting your total work out duration to about fifty minutes maybe sixty minutes if that is what is required to complete what you need to do in order to keep with your exercise goals but to be very careful about exceeding seventy five minutes of exercise in any one single exercise about and you remember back to the beginning of the episode when i said that i track what i do on a day to day basis and i do not do it in a very detailed way but i do take note of when have got in a bad fleer cold i can tell you that in almost every single case where have got in a bad flyer cold there two things that have proceeded that bad flyer cold one is sleep deprivation typically it would be nights where i got two hours of sleep or less for more than one night okay the second thing is any time that i really pushed it with exercise and when all out and i went for seventy five minutes and then i continue to ninety minutes and then may be later that day because somebody invited me on a run or something that i also did that second run or that second work out of some kind could be running in the morning an wait training in the afternoon some people can do that kind of training on a regular basis even and not get sick i am not such a person have manage to maintain fairly consistent fitness output meaning the three party of vascular in the three wait training sessions per week for more than several decades now and part of the reason i think have be able to do that is because i do not ever push too hard for too long within a given work out this is really a call for moderation interns of the duration and intensity of the exercise that you are doing but we are not talking about really being laid back we are not talking about easy work outs what were talking about is an hour or less of moderate intensity to high intensity exercise depending on the duration of that exercise and keeping in mind that when you are doing that you are activating that inmate immune system you are literally creating an immunerous sponge your increasing inflammation your increasing those side kinds your increasing stress hormones we have to start to think about exercise for what it is which is a form of stress that induces adaptations doctrine gall and talked a lot about this in the series that he did on exercise physiology its a excellent series at covers everything from strength to hypertrophic to speed to endurance nutrition supplementation can find all that at hurt laved calm very easily exercise is a very potent tool we know that we know that in the contact of changing ascetics body mass composition you increasing muscle reducing fact we know that in the contacts of reducing resting heart rate reducing resting blood pressure we know that in the contacts of all these other health metrics here were talking about using exercise as a very potent tool to increase the function of the nae one system to keep you healthy not just though the winter months but around the year and especially if you are getting less sleep if your interacting with kids or adults that our carrying infections home from school or work on a regular basis or may be even working an environments a hospital or clinic where your regularly interacting with patients that have these issues one thing that i often get asked is if i am sleep deprived should i exercise and that is a little bit of a tricky one my initial response for many years was no now if your sleep deprived your better off not exercising however i now need to qualify that answer because their data showing that if your sleep deprived and you exercise especially you exercise early in the day and it does not destruct your sleep schedule it is not making you go to sleep even later the next night that it actually can cause some adjustments in the function of your immune system and in the way that you regulate your blood sugar that offset some of the negative effects of sleep reprobation that said you should never ever compromise the amount of sleep you could get in order to get exercise such that you run yourself down what ism really saying here as if you get one bad night sleep should you skip your work out and you feel i u now ism not feeling sick and i should i work out or should i i go back to sleep probably going back to sleeps the better idea but if you do not have the option to go back to sleep for whatever reason you cannot fall back to sleep than you would be wise to do about of exercise but i would suggests reducing the intensity and duration of that exercise by about twenty five percent may be even fifty percent and that should allow you to offset any of the negative effects of sleep approbation for that one night keep in mind exercise is not a replacement for sleep and then to allow you to get to sleep at the appropriate time later that night and back on your regular casual keeping your night in system tuned up and ready to combat any colds or flute now one more point about exercise and here were also going to dove tail in and important point about nutrition in the review that i mentioned a few moments ago they cover some of the data from studies exploring the post exercise stress response this is the post exercise induced increase in things coatis all those natural killercells the production a white blood cells and on it is very clear that if you are in a state of chronic stress because your exercising a lot and for because you are not sleeping enough or for whatever reason may be you have a lot of life stress it is very clear that in jesting c carbohydrates after exercise can help attenuate some of the inflammation that exercise in dudes when we talk about carbohydrates were talking about rice oatmeal posses those sorts of things call complex carbohydrates and fruit post exercise has ben shown to a senate to reduce some of the markers of inflammation by about thirty to forty per cent when contrasted with water only in take especially if you are training fasted for those of you me that to wake up in the morning and just drink fluids for me its water your hamate coffee and by the way have said before that people should delay their canine and take ninety minutes if an only if their experiencing in afternoon crash but that if you are exercising firstling in the morning it is perfectly fine to ingest your canine right away that gives you a increase in energy for that exercise that certainly would i do on days the i exercise but if you fast and then you are drinking affine and then you are exercising and that exercise goes longer than sixty minutes certainly if it goes longer than seventy five minutes you would do well to invest some complex carbohydrates may be also some fruit perhaps not immediately after exercise but within the forty five minutes ore or hour or after exercise that you're not camping up those inflammatory molecules and leaving them ramped up for many hours into the morning andthroughout the day because of course this episode is not about exercise in nutrition but here were talking about the roll that exercise in nutrition play in helping us combat colds in flues by increasing the function of that inmate immune system and the reasons why carbohydrates can have this effect on cortical at veterans an interesting in important discussion into itself will love it for another episode but keep that mind also ion about you but a nice bull of oatmeal some fruit and a proline drink or some eggs after an hour or of exercise in the morning when i have not eaten anything since the night before tastes really really good continuing with the theme of things that we can do at the level of behaviors to improve the function of our inmate immune system and combat colds in flues perhaps even prevent us from getting colds in flues at all but certainly help combat them if they've initially made their way into our system but we have not developed full blown symptoms and we want to prevent those full blown symptoms is the use of deliberate heat exposure in particular sand is a nice study on this that was published very recently twenty twenty three the title of the study is the effects of a single and series of finish sand sessions on the immune system response and heat shock proline seventy levels and trained and untrained men it is a very interesting study they compared athletically trained and non athletically trained men as most of you probably know when you get into a hot sand tartrate increases there is face of dilation there is the increase in the release of heat shock proteins thirsty increasing things dinorphan which if its sufficiently hot are increased to levels that make us feel kind of agitated and not good we have to actively calm ourselves in the sands o ere not tinker about an easy cruise at a hundred and fifty degrees ferenheit were talking by getting up in to the you a hundred and eighty degree ferenheite or two hundred ten degree farenheit range maybe even hire if you are a heat adapted and the t the dinorphan makes you feel lousy in the short term but that regulates a bunch of different biological mechanisms that give you kind of low level euphoria and actually the capacity to experience more feelings of well being from the endorphins that you make after you get out of the sand this is o important t understand whether not were ting by exercise or deliberate could exposure deliberate heat exposure what happens during the heat exposure cold exposure or exercise is more often than not just the trigger ford the long termadaptation that were seeking just exercise increases your heart rate and blood pressure but then leads to reductions in resting heart rate and blood pressure and on and forth this study is interesting in there lot of different take always from the study because they compared these two different populations i just give you the top contours of what the protocol entailed there were ten sanasessions each of those sand sessions were three rounds of fifteen minutes of sand one session meant going into the sand the sand was of we given temperature but i think for most people what scan o work in terms of what parallels to study is going to be somewhere between a under and seventy six and two under and ten degrees ferenheite depending on how heat adapted you are always be safe do not do this if your pregnant o this if you are a child et camera there during three rounds of fifteen minutes each separated by two minutes during that two minutes they take a cool shower with a cool off in some way they are not going into a coal plunge but the cooling off with a cool shower and there during that three times that is one session they do ten sessions those sand sessions were spaced apart by at least a few days and the entire experiment meaning all ten sessions were completed within a three week period and then a bunch of things were measured the amount of white blood cells and immune cells that were deployed after the first session verses the third verses the eighth verses the tenth and on as well as the levels of cortical and inflammatory markers are look i things measured in the study here is what we know sandbag says there calling them resulted in ta statistically significant increase and cortical concentration after the first end the tenth sand session o case every time you go into the sand you are getting in increase in coatis all we know that because the heat is a stressed again do not think about heat as the of you just con relaxing in the san and nice you are getting a cortical response cortical is a lucocorticoid stress hormones it sometimes called which can be a good thing if it sets in motion a number of other things such as the increase in the activity the anatemiun system and indeed that is what they observed after and here on paraphrasing after the first and tenth san a baths they witnessed an increase in lucasite count lucasites are a particular type of cell of the ananemiun system however only after the last san a session did this change reach statistical sign against in the trained group what they observed was that athletes who are trained are used to being in high heat conditions because of their athletic training people who are not trained in athletics are not use to that there are a lot of different ways to look at these data but the simplest take away is that if you are already very heat adapt because you do sand regularly or you exercise regularly well then it is going to take a stronger stimulus or more sand either longer or hotter or more frequent to get the sorts of increases in innate immune response as compared to some one whose never done sand whose not exercising regularly and that just make sense if something is not stressful to you you are not going to get the stimulation of that innate amuse response and the over all take away from this study was that i do believe that if you are feeling run down a little bit or if you are just trying to keep colds in flues hat bay having some regular is practice of getting into the sand for three rounds of fifteen minutes separate by two minute cool off you do not necessarily have to do a cold shower or cold plunge in between although i do not see why you could not or would not be could also just get out the saran be in the cool air and then get back in or perhaps you do something more akin to what is been shown another studies that explore the relationship between heat exposure an immune response which is to do two rounds of twenty minutes or one round of thirty minutes than the sand whatever you can do safely and comfortably keep in mind safety's you do not harm yourself i say that not to protect me but to protect you that sand is in effective way of increasing the activity of the innate amuse system it increases glucoside levels yes it increases coatis all levels but in a way that promote the activity of the inmate amen system however and here we are back to exactly the same thing we said about exercise if you are already feeling really run down feeling on a heaviness in the body you do not feel well yous trying to get some sniffles do not get in a very hot sand but for sake of keeping colds in flues at bay sure do three rounds of fifteen minutes in the sea between a hundred seventy six degrees two hundred ten degrees whatever you can safely tolerate take those two minute breaks in between may be do a cold shower or coolish shower may be just stand outside the sand and between you are feeling really strong do a coal plunge for a minute or two minutes in between you do not have to but you certainly could and then get back in and then repeat or just do one twenty minute session or thirty minute session all of which have been shown to promote the activity the nnateamun system however and i realize has said this before but feel i need to say to gain especially for you hard court exercisers or people that really feel i can push through if you are already sick and you have the symptoms of a colder flue you want to limit the amount of stress to your body you want to get into bed and sleep if you cannot sleep you want a relax you do not want to exercise you should not exercise not only do you stand to get other people ill by going places where you exercise but even if you exercise at home or in total isolation you are going to prolong the duration of that illness because there are many many reasons why being still slowing your circulation and allowing your inmate and then in that case you are adaptor inion system to kick in and combat those infections is going to get you back into a regular exercise and work regiment much much faster than would be the case if you were to push through o case o now we get to the portion of the discussion that i think probably many people are anticipating which is what can you take to reduce the probability of getting a colder flue or short en the duration of a colder flue and i actually put out a call on social media i asked the question on instergram and on x formerly call twitter no what a you do for a cold or flue and what a you curious about in terms of what one can take for colder flue and i got thousands upon thousands of answers however many of those answers converged on some common things things taking garlic i heard for instance that some people are chewing a raw clove of garlic every day during the winter a i heard about people who take fermented garlic some people swear by ecanatia some people swear aby ecanatia vitemancy an zinc now there are far too many compounds that exist in the wellness and indeed in the medical literature to cover all of them some going to highlight a few that i think are especially interesting and that have been shown impure viewed science to be potentially useful some of these you have heard of before and some of them i think are going to be surprising or at least new to you first let us consider what most people believe to be a very effective way to hasten colds or flues that is to make them last shorter duration of time than they would otherwise maybe even prevent colds or flues the big one there is vitemance we hare all the time vitemanc antioccident i grew up in anuria ware the gromwell prize winning chemist lines hauling who is a fanatic about vitemancy he took many many grams of item see each day used to tout the benefits of vitamin we here is the deal there is some evidence and it is not great frankly that points of the fact that taking six to eight grams grams that six thousand eight thousand milligrams a item an see predate that is a lot of vitemand see each day can perhaps to lay the onset of a cold or shorten the duration of a cold here were going but very hidroses and not a very robust effect should mention that for most people who are not accustomed to taking much vitemand c if you were to take six to eight grahams of vitemancy in capsid or powder or pill form chances are your going to experience some significant gastric distress some people can build up to that level or take it with food in a way that does not cause that gastric distress but many people experience gastric distress is been a lot set about vitemancy and its other potential rolls and are physiology and i soft want to touch on those now because it may have some interesting rolls and other aspects of our physiology but have to say that in scouring the literature on item and we i encountered a recent paper this was published twenty twenty three and the title this paper is retraction extra dose of vitemancy based on the daily supplementation shortens the common cold ameba analysis of nine randomized control trials what is this paper that was recently published why is retraction the first word in the title well turns out that the met analysis of nine randomized control trials showing a small but significant improvement in the outcomes for colds and flues or reduction in probability of getting colds and flues that study was retracted and it was retracted on the basis of multiple instances of an error in which the placebo groups had been double counted in trials more than the two intervention arm there were some serious data analysis flaws in that met analysis now that is not to say that vitemancy is of zero benefit for reducing the probability of colds and flues but must say provided that your getting sufficient mounts of vitemancy from your food an take may be also obit near item in mineral supplement if you take a foundational supplement a g one or something similar almost certainly your getting enough item an we it does not seem that taking hidroses of item an c and i would place sit e grahams of item any in the hide range is going to be affective for treating or preventing colds and flues more data may arrive in then your future but vibrancy is problem to a very good investment if you are taking it solely for the purpose of enhancing eurmean system function and staving off colds and flues now what about item and we here a lot these days about the importance of having sufficient item in d levels and ideally everyone would get the item in d levels measured by regular bloodies i do get my blood worked on every six months i find it be incredibly informative tells me what is going on below the hood in ways that i never could be aware of were i not to get that tests but i realize that the is a costs to those tests and not everyone can afford them i think most physicians would agree that supplementing with anywhere from a thousand to two thousand i you a item and per day is probably safe for most people and will buffer that level of item india their system such that their unlikely to be deficient and unlikely to far exceed what safe in the body however there are people who need higher levels of item in d supplementation in order to achieve sufficient amounts of item and for their mental health and physical health a invited and is involved in a lot of differ processes in the brain and body now it is clear that people who are item indeed deficient these are people whose item in de levels have been measured oftentimes have diminished immune system function and are more prone to acute respiratory tract infections the s e very lengthy and very interesting review entitle item an d supplementation to prevent acute respiratory tract infections systematic review in reanalysis of individual participant data this is a beast of a thing am i did read it all very very interesting many many studies the exact take always from a large review this of twenty five rentimized control trials is a little bit tricky i mean they did conclude that item and d supplementation did reduce the risk of acute respiratory tract in faction among all the participence however the degree of prevention was small moderate in some cases they did point out however that just because people with low levels of item and tend to get colds in flues more often than people that do not does not necessarily mean that item and deficiencies are the reason for that for instance we know that people they get regular sunlight exposure and as every one knows idea big big proponent of getting sunlight in your eyes as early as possible in the day after waking up and if it is cloudy out to get even more time outside if you can and if you cannot get access to sunlight for whatever reason to perhaps invest in a ten thousand locks light tablet you can find these unlike at reasonable cost in a hundred dollars to two hundred dollars in some cases getting sunlight sets in motion a huge number of different things including increasing the amount of item and in your system but a bunch of other things as well increases in carts all increases in dope and increases ceretonan that cascade toward and relate to improved in man system function what is the take away here i think that for most people supplementing with a thousand to two thousand international nuts of vitemnd is probably safe however if you need more item and you will not know that unless you take a remind last that is you measure the amount of remind in your blood stream and some people indeed need five thousand to ten thousand i u of item and per day but you do not want to overdose yourself on vitamin that is if you already have sufficiently high levels of item and in your system you are getting sufficient sunlight well then taking ten thousand or more international puts of vitamin could possibly be detrimental i think it is fair to say based on the reanalysis and review that i mention a moment ago the other papers that i was able to glean that vote em and itself is unlikely to b the sole protestant against colds and flues but it is probably a good thing to include in your general kit of nutrition and supplementation tools if your goal is to keep your inmate in your system fighting off colds and flues sufficiently other things that in perhaps support the anatemiun system are going to be as i mentioned earlier the things that support they gotmicrobaium those lot sugar for rented foods may be a prelatic probiotit capsid may be something athletic greens a u one although certainly you could achieves sufficient microfilm support from foods if your careful and intentional about the foods that your select now the other compound or substance that we often hereabout in the contacts of colds a flues is ecanatia ecanatia is a compound that as been propose to improve a man system function now when you go into the data and you explore what does taking ecanatia tinctures or other forms of ecanatia really do to avoid colds and flues the answer that comes back is not much if anything now is taking ecanatia dangerous probably not however it has been shown in a few studies that people that take at fanatic regularly at high doses can potentially impede the function of their innate immune system that is reductions in white blood sell count reductions in those natural kill er cells my suggestion would be if you absorb love a at fanatic for whatever reason you are convinced that it helps you that you reserve to taking it when you are trying to feel little bit run down or perhaps just in the winter month not months plural but month when you are most prone to those cold and fluent sections but then not taking it continuously throughout the year and certainly not for more than four weeks at a time but again if you are doing that just know that there are not really any strong scientific day to support the use of ecanatia by contrast they are pretty darn good data that support supplementing with zinc as a way to combat colds and flues in particular colds now here the dosages really matter it is been shown that if you take less than seventy five milligrams of zinc supplement form to trying impact the probability of getting or shortening a common cold it is not con a work you need to take a hundred milligrams or more and now a hundred milligrams or more of zinc for some people is going to cause some ghost distress if you take it on an empty stomach have actually made the mistake of taking i think it was fifty milligrams of inch on an empty stomach and i felt really cautious did not feel well do not take zinc on an empty stomach and if you are trying to shorten a color flue that you think you have already contracted or you've trying to keep a cold or flue at bay cause you are round people cuter flues or your just worried about it taking a hundred milligrams of zinc perhaps divided up into two doses of fifty milligrams each or may be a hundred milligrams all at once but making sure the you take that with at least a moderately sized or full meal certainly could be advantageous keep in mind that people that are older than sixty five are perhaps the ones that need to supplement zinc the most also keep in mind that children meaning people younger than fifteen should probably not supplement with too much zinc that can be problematic and certainly pregnant women should talk to their doctor before supplementing with zinc indeed any him you arguing to take anything whether not your young old pregnant or not you should consult your physician before you take anything or remove anything from your health protocols one of the more interesting aspects of supplementing with zinc that i was able to find in the literature is a three times faster recovery rate for people that already contracted a cold in this study people were not taking a hundred milligrams but the dosage came pretty close they were taking ninety milligrams per day of zinc acetate and they experience a three times fast a recovery a t from that cold compare to peoplewho were not taking the zinc now of course there could be other factors as well but the study was fairly convincing given that zinc is fairly lo cost given that it is generally safe for most people and the fact that if you take it with food it does not cause i any discomfort supplementing was in at a level of anywhere from ninety to a hundred milligrams pray probably no more than a hundred and twenty per day seems like logical way to stave off colds and flues and reduced the duration of a cold or flue should you contract one now i want to be very clear that have ben talk about colds in flues kind of in i in concert kind of treating them more or less as the same thing some of that is for sake of time and simplicity most all of the study showing a benefit of zinc our study showing the benefit of zinc for the treatment or the hastening of cold not for flue specifically however i consulted with a few physicians n one of whom is expert in this area and he that i did not see any reason why you would not take zinc if you had a flue there is no reason to think that it would introduce any kind of increased risk but again consult with your physician before taking or removing anything from your supplement regiment now a lot of the compounds that were discussing are sort of conventional in the sense that i think most people have probably heard of them already perhaps the most esoteric sounding one thus far as acanatia which we established jolly not very helpful for colds are flues but we vent oi about within and see when we ben talk about zinc within indeed an you sure yo getting your sunlight supporting your microbial and on on one compound that ism messing most people perhaps have not heard of but that is very interesting that in fact have taken before and that i stop in my supplement cabinet in case i feel ism coming down with something is genocidal sitting or back what is nap back is a precursor to gludothion what is gludothion gludothion is the master antioxidant it is involved in reducing what are called reactive oxygen species which build up in cells that are very metabolically active reactive oxygen species build up even more in sells that are under stress or a body that is underdress and it also has the property of reducing reactive nitrogen species reactive oxygen and reactive nitrogen species significantly increase under conditions of infection and having sufficient levels of gludithion is a good thing now enecedal cystine is used in certain clinics oversees and in the ass as a way to treat mystic fibrosis because it is also a mucaletic consists fibrosis is the build up of fluid in the lungs and a mucalitic substance is something that lumens up the mucus and allows it to flow more readily out of different cavities the body including the lungs the naval passages and sicknesses and indeed last winter i did unfortunately get a cold told you about once every eighteen to twenty four months i get a cold and it was a pretty nasty one i was feeling supercongested at first i thought it was an ear infection pretty quickly i realized i had a cold and i was feeling congested i was not sleeping well and it was suggested to me to take enecedal sit n bandit up doing that at a dosage of anywhere from six hundred to nine hundred milligrams three times per day as a six hundred to nine hundred milligram capsule depending on which brand purchased low different versions of this out there on the market i took it morning late morning and afternoon and indeed it is a powerful mucalitic that mugusdestarts flowing out a you better have an extra box of tissues handy and that greatly relieve the pressure in my sicknesses and the reason i liked using back is because have actively avoided using decongestant that one can purchase over the count a most econgestencs are of the awful one agonist variety what is an a for one agonist it causes azo constriction that azo constriction can be beneficial in preventing some of the intense congestion that one gets when you gather a iciness infection or a cold or a flue but then when those decongestion wear off one tends to get a rebound increase in congestion and its really painful headache et camera in addition some over the counterdecongestens can be have it forming not a scarily addictive but have forming and they do not seem to have any other positive health benefit i prefer not to take decongestence if i can avoid it i had a very good experience with back and the use of back and a seal sitting as a decongestion and also as a way to event getting colds in flues is not an entirely new idea in fact there is a paper dating back to nineteen ninety seven entitled a tentation of influenza alike symptomatology and improvement of selmediated immunity with long term andaseedal sitting treatment now in this study they looked at people were taking six hundred milligrams of enesedal sitting twice per day for six months and what the observed is that the people who took and a sedalsistine had a significantly lower probability of contracting influenza now this is but one study there's been a few other studies and unfortunately there is not a large body of research looking at back as a preventive for colds in flues but the at on this paper are interesting enough and i was compelled by them enough to seek out a physician who i notice was answering my prompts on social media about what he use for colds and flues and when i put that out there as i mentioned i got thousands of responses on both twitter as and on instrogram and one particular physician who happens to have a future account his name is doctor sweet he is a medical doctor he works in intensive care unit and he deals with a lot of patients who have different strains of flue in fact he was the one the cued me to the fact that this year there seems to be a fair number of each one and one floveiris going around and remember the each one and one floveiris while it is not dead let every one it can be quite severe in some people we do want to be on the lookout for and trying to avoid getting each one and one if we can i spoke to doctor sweet he was very generous with his knowledge about andasedal sitting he did acknowledge and ill acknowledge again here that it would be great to get more randomize control trial data on anasedal sitting but we did talk about this paper this nineteen ninety seven paper and he did mention that he and other clinicians that are forced to be in the hospital dealing with patients all through the winter and all your long the'regettng bombarded with cold in flue exposure all the time that the meaning he and some of his colleagues deliberately take enesedil sitting as a preventative to trying reduce the probability of getting colds in fleece and while we do not want to make too much of any one study or anew data which is what we are describing when i tell you about a physician who told me this or what i did and experience that i think it is worth paraphrasing the study that i mentioned before an s prevented the symptomatic forms cause by here the tongue of the a eh one and one influence of virus quite efficiently since the large majority of infected subjects in the placebo group seventy nine per cent developed clinically apparent disease verses only twenty five per cent in the not group in other words approximately eighty per cent of people in the study who did not take enteral listen got influenza whereas only twenty five per cent of the people who were taking enesedl sitting contracted influenza that is a fairly dramatic difference and certainly the fact that eneseedel sitting has been shown to increase gludifion that is it is primary mechanism of action as far as we know and the fact that increases in gludithionor generally healthy and good for us and the fact that anesedal sitting is still available legally over the counter and the quass at least currently it is the some years back as you may have heard the it e called for removal of enesedil sitting from over the counter sales that i should point out was based on the fact that certain supplement companies were making claims about anesedal sitting as a treatment for hang over and making a bunch of other claims for which there was no real data but either because the it e was effective in getting those companies to cease those claims and or because of advocate groups which worked very hard to trying keep eneedil sitting available for over the counter sales as far as i know at least right up until prior to recording this episode enesedal sitting is available for sale over the counter whether not you decide to use enesedal sitting as a preventative and there again the dosage is about twelve hundred milligrams per day divided into two different dosages of six under milligrams each or if you decide to take enesedl sitting in the manner that i did which was not as a preventative but once i had a cold confident off apparently got the cold decide to take nine hundred milligrams three times per day avoiding that in take close to sleep because it did disrupt my sleep if i took it two close to sleep because of the way that the mucus would flow readily would essentially i know it sounds rose by felly g was filling up the back of my throat call postnasal drip but it felt post naval waterfall and i decide to restrict my intake of enesedil sitting to earlier in the day only and of course there is the third option which is that you ought to not take nesedil intine until more rhenomize control trials are published we are not take need sitting at all because you are of the sort that thinks oke with some sleep shot shower a good meal some chicken soup a below garlic who knows if you have some other tools in techniques that you li like you that ginger ta lemon et camera maybe that is all you need and if that is all you need and that is all you want in order to deal with a cold or flue be my last i certainly am not here to convince anyone that you have to take a certain supplement but i did feel i e remiss if i did not cover what are generally refer to as the called preventatives and treatments for colds and flues things zing idem index vitamin we we now know that unfortunately tenement s gets a drive remind our an a at least as the data stand now but the these other things zing and potentially and a septal sitting that can be beneficial in shortening the duration of colds or flues and perhaps even helping us avoid getting colds or flues all together if you are learning from and ore enjoying this podcast please subscribe tar you tube channel that's a

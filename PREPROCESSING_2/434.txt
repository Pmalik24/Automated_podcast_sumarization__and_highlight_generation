welcome to the supermen lapodscuss science science pay li man your supermen and on a professor of neurobiology and entomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to discuss light and the many powerful uses of light to optimize our health we are going to discuss the use of light for optimizing skin health appearance and longevity for wound healing for optimizing hormone balance and for regulating sleep alertness mood and even for offsetting to media one of the reasons why light has such powerful effects on many different aspects of our biology is that it can beat translated into electrical signals in our brain and body into hormone signals in our brain and body and indeed into what we call cascades of biological pathways meaning light can actually change the genes that the cells of your bodies express and that is true throughout the life span today i will discuss the mechanisms by which all of that occurs a promise to make it clear for those of you that do not have a biology background and if you do have biology background it'll try and provides sufficient depth that its still of interest to you and i promise to give you tools very specific protocols that are extracted from the pureovieu literature that will allow you to use different called wave lengths which most of just think of his colors of light in order to modulate your health in the ways that are most important to you for those of you there are thinking that the use of light to modulate health falls under the category of woo science pseudo science or bivouacking well nothing could be further from the truth in fact in nineteen o three the bell prize was given to need prison he was iceland he lived in denmark for the use of phototherapy for the treatment of lupus there is more than a hundred years of quality science emphasizing the use of light and as you will soon see the use of particular wave lengths or colors of light in order to modulate the activity of cells in the brain and body while it is the case that many places and companies are selling therapies and products related to the use of flashing lights in colored lights promising specific outcomes from everything from stemisel renewal to improvement of brain function and some of those do not have any basis in science there are phototherapies that do have a strong foundation in quality science and those are the studies and the protocols that we are going to discuss to day but i thought that people might appreciate knowing that over a hundred years ago people were thinking about the use of light for the treatment of various diseases in for improving health and indeed many of those therapies are use to day in high quality hospitals and research institutions and of course clinics and homes around the world one of the more exciting examples of phototherapy in the last few years is the beautiful work of doctor glengeffrey university college onion the jeffrey lav is known for doing pi and peering and very rigorous for search in the realm of visual narrow science and in the last debate or they turn their attention to exploring the roll of red light there for offsetting age related vision lost what they discovered is that just brief exposures to red light early in the day can offset much of the vision lost that occurs in people forty years or older and what is remarkable about these studies is that the entire duration of the therapy is just one to three minutes done just a few times per week what is even more exciting is that they understand the mechanism by which this occurred the cells in the back of the eye that convert light information into e electrical signals that the rest of the brain can understand and create visual images from will those cells are extremely metabolically active they need a lot of a t p or energy and as we age those cells get less sufficient at creating that a t p and energy exposure to red light early in the day and it does have to be early in the day allowed those cells to replenish the mechanisms by which they create a t p it'll talk about these experiments in more detail later in the episode and the protocols that you could apply those protocols should you choose but i use this as an example of our growing understanding of not just that phototherape's work but how they work and it is through the linking of protocols an mechanism that we meaning all of us can start to apply phototherapies in a rational safe and powerful way before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls stamford it is however part of my desire effort to bring zeros to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and treason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which are vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and esentaly with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens tit get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to truth lentic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer the will give you five

of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the to my and on again go to athletigreen stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fiery travel packs and the year supply of videmendy three canto to day's episode is also brought to us by elements elements is an electrolight drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar one talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element elements do come slash supermen oka let us talk about light first i want to talk about the physics of light and i promise to make that very clear even if you do not have a background and physics and then i want to talk about the biology of light meaning how light is converted into signals that your brain and body can use to impact things organ health or disease or how you can use light in order to repair particular organs your skin your eyes your brain et camera the physics of light con be made very simple by just illustrating a few key bullet points the first bullet point is that light is electromagnetic energy if the word electromagnetic feels daunting to you will then just discard that in just think of light as energy and think of energy as something that can impact other things in its environment now the way to imagine light or to conceptirolize light as energy is that all around you light is traveling in these little ravelings and the reason for those either watching hm making a little wavy motion with my hand is that is actually the way that light energy moves in little waves just sound waves are coming at you and impinging on your ears if you can hear me talking right now that is happening those are sound waves meaning the movement of air particles out there impacting your ear drum will light energy is just little bits of electromagnetic energy traveling through your environment all the time in these little waves and in pinging on your brain and body and eyes et camera and as i mention before energy can change the way that other things behave it can cause reactions in cells of your body it can cause reactions in fruit for instance right you see piece of fruit and it is not right but it gets a lot of sunlight and it ripens that is because the electro magnetic energy of sunlight had an impact on that plant or that tree or even on the fruit directly as a parallel example of energy and its ability to impact other things we are all familiar with food and the fact that food has calories carry is a measure of energy it has everything to do with how much heat is generated when you burn a particular article of food believe it or not and it turns out that how hot a given article of food burns gives you a sense of how much energy can provide your body in terms of your bodies ability to store or use that energy again think of light as a electromagnetic energy but really put that word energy into capital letters in bed that in your mind going forward and you will under stand most of the first bullet point of what light is in terms of the physics of light now the second thing that you need understand about the physics of light is that light has many different wave lengths and the simplest way to conceptualize this is to imagine that cover of that pinkfloid also when there's a prism you have a white beam of light going into that prism and then the prism splits that beam of light into what looks a rainbow you got your red your and your greens your blue as your purples at camera any time we have light in our environment that is called white light it includes all those ravelings but sunlight and other forms of light also have other wavelengths of light that we cannot see when we think about the rainbow that is just the visible spectrum of light there are are also wavelengths of light that are not visible to us but that are visible to some other animals and that can still impact your brain and body because there is still energy at those wave lengths give a few examples of this humans are not a species that can see into the simpler red realm of the spectra a pit viper meaning a snake that has inpour red censers however can sense in the impaired if you were to walk through a jungle and there is a pit viper there it sees you as a cloud of heat emission because your body is emitting simpler red energy all the time your casting off impaired energy the snake can see it you cannot if you were to put on a particular set of goggles that were infra red goggles well then you would be able to see the heatomissions of any organism human or otherwise that could emit simpler red energy let us take the opposite end of the spectra we are familiar with seeing things that are blue or green or very pale blue but as we say below that meaning even shorter wavelength light is out there ultra violet light is a really good example of light energy that is coming from the sun and is in our environment is being reflected off surfaces all the time we do not see it and yet if it is very bright outside that ultra violet light can burn our skin as you will learn to day's episode ultra violet light and also positively impact us in fact i will describe a particular set of new results that show that ultra violet light viewed for just a few minutes each day or landing on the skin for just a few minutes each day can actually offset a lot of pain it actually has the ability to reduce the amount of pain sensed by your body and we now understand the specific circuits in the brain and body that allow that to happen it'll talk about that and the related protocols a littlest later the importanthing to understand about the physics of light is that there is energy at all these different wave lengths we only see some of those wave lengths which basically is to say that light impacts us at many different levels and the call levels that ism referring to are the different wave lengths of light and your welcome to think of the different wave lengths of light as different colors but do understand that there are truly colors of light that you and i cannot see and yet that have powerful impact on your brain and body now the third bullet point to understand about the physics of light is that different wave lengths of light because of the wave that their wave travels can penetrate tissues to different depths this is very e very important to day we are gong to talk a lot about red light therapies and near import red light pharmacies those are call longer wave lengths longer wailing just think of a bigger longer wave right a bigger curve as of us a short wavelength light which is going to be shorter it a short wave length light would be something blue or green light or ultra violet light blue green and ultra violet light because it short wave length light does not tend to penetrate tissues very easily it has to do with the way that the physics of light inner acts with the physical properties of your skin and other tissues of your body but basically if you were to shine you v light on to your arm for instance it could impact the skin on the surface of the arm and maybe some of the cells just beneath the top layer of skin but it would not penetrate much deeper long wave length light red light and near for red light has this amazing ability to penetrate through tissues including your skin and if we were to shine red light or near for red light on to your arm it would pass through that top layer of skin it might impact a little bit but it could central deeper into your skin not just to the skin layers but made even down to the bone made it in down to the bone marrow and for many people this would be hard to conceptiollize it you think a wait i gat the skin there does not the light just balance off and the answer is know because of the wave that long wave length light interacts with the absorbance properties of your skin absorb since properties is just the way that the skin takes light energy and converts it into a different form of energy and your skin is not able to take long wave length light red light and near i for red light and absorb it but the tissues deeper in your body can if you shine red light or near and for red light on to the surface of your skin you will see a red glow there as ha reflectance on the surface of your skin but a lot of the photon energy the light energy in those longer ravelings is indeed passing through those top layers of skin into the deeper layers of skin and can even make it into the deep layers of your arm and as we start to transition from the physics of light to the biological impacts of light just understanding that the different wavelengths of light impact a tissues at different levels literally at different depths will help you better understand how light of different colors of different intensities and how long you are exposed to those colors and intensives of light can change the way that the cells and the organs of your body work and if it did not sound heard enough that you can pass light through particular tissues and have them land and be absorbed at tissues deeper in your body well it turns out that different wavelengths of light are also best absorbed by particular called organ tells with in your cells what are organelle organs are the different compartments and different functions within a given cell for instance your mitochondria which are responsible for generating a t p and energy in your cells those exist at a particular depth that a pitiful location within a cell they are not all at the cell surface they sit somewhat deeper in the cell the nucleus of your individual cells contains dean and that is its at a particular depth or location within your cell different wavelengths of light not only can penetrate down into different tissues and into different cells of your body but they can also penetrate and access particular organelle meaning meticondria or the nuclear or the different aspects of yourecells that a responsible for different functions this is exquisitely important and it is exquisitely powerful because as you will learn to day particular wavelengths of light can be used to stimulate the function of particular organelle within particular cells within particular organs of your body i can think of no other form of energy not sound not chemical energy not drugs not food not touch no form of energy that can target the particular locations in our cells in our organelle in our organs and in our body to the extent that light can in other words if you had to imagine a real world surgical tool by which to modulate are biology light would be the sharpest and the most precise of those tools now let us talk about how light is converted into biological signals there several ways in which that is accomplished but the fundamental thing to understand is this notion of absorption of light energy certain pigments or colors in the thing that is receiving the light energy meaning the thing that the light energy can es on are going to absorb particular wave lengths of light now i promise you that you already intuitively know how this works for instance if you were to sit outside on a very bright sunny day and you had a table in front of you that was metal you might find it hard to look down at that metal table because it is reflecting a lot of light of particular wavelengths if that table were pitch black however it would not reflect quite as much and you would be able to comfortably look at it if that table were red it might be somewhere in between if that table were green it would be also somewhere in between but let say it were very light blue well then it might reflect almost as much as a able that were just metal or a weight table surface the absorbance properties of a given surface will determine whether not light energy goes and stays at that location and has an impact on that location or whether not it bounces off every biological function of light has to do with the absorbance or the reflectance of light or light passing through that particular thing meaning that particular cell or compartment within a cell i to make it clear how this works by using the three primary examples of how you take light in your environment and convert it into biological events we have photo receptors in the back of our eyes these photoreceptor come in two major types the called rods and the cones the rods are very elongated they look rods and the cones look little triangles rods and cones have within them photo pigment they have dark stuff that stacked up in little layers rods absorb light of essentially any wave length they're some variation to that but lets you say it rods do not care about the different colors of light they will absorb light energy photon energy if it is red if it is green if it is blue if its yellow does not matter as long as that light is bright enough and returns out that rods are very very sensitive they can detect very very small numbers of photons and rods are simply what you use to see in very lowliest conditions will return more to vision later the cones come in three major varieties at least for most people who are not color blind you have called red cones green cones and blue cones but they are not really red green and blue in the back your eye they are cones that either absorb long wave length light red that absorb medium wavelength light green or short wave length light blue the reason that they can absorb different wave lengths of light as they have different photo pigments much as the example i gave before where you have different tables outside and the sunny environment and some are reflecting light more than others others are absorbing more than others well too the photoreceptor meaning the cones are absorbing light of different wave lengths to different extents and in it absolve incredible way your brain is actually able to take that information and create this perception that we have of color but that is another story altogether that will just touch on a little bit were later but that if you want to learn all about you can go to are episode on vision that is photoreceptor in the back of your eye absorbing light of different wavelength rosin cones the other place of course where light can impact our body is on our surface on our skin and skin has pigment too we call that pigment melon we have within our skin multiple cell types but in the top layer skin which is called the epidermis we have corrading cites and we have malanacites and the malanicites are the cells that create pigmentation of the skin and of course there is wide variation in the degree to which there is pigmentation of the skin which has to do with genetics also has to do with where you were born and raised how much light exposure you have throughout the year rights o people toward the equate told have more malanicde activity than people who are located at the north pole and of course people live at different locations throughout the earth regardless of their genetic background or where they were born and as you all know with light exposure those malanicites will turn on genetic programs and other biological programs that lead to inhancepigmentation of the skin which we call panning the way they do that is by absorbing you v light specifically with malanicites we have a very specific example of how a pigment absorbs light of a particular length in this case ultra violet short wavelength light which in turn creates a set of biological signals within those cells that in turn creates changes in our skin pigmentation we have photoreceptor we have malanicites and the third example i to provide is that of every cell of your body what i mean by that is that every cell of your body meaning a cell that is part of your bone tissue or your bone marrow or heart tissue or liver or spleen if light can access those cells it will change the way that those cells function for better or for worse for many organs within our body that reside deep to our skin light never arrives at those cells a really good example this that will touch on later is the spleen unless you have massive damage to your body surface unless you literally have a whole in your body light will never land directly on your spleen but the spleen still responds to light information through indirect pathways and those indirect pathways arise through light arriving on the skin and light arriving on the eyes a key principle that i am going to return to again and again to day is that the we sin which light can impact the biology of your organs your cells your organs and the tissues and indeed your whole body can either be direct for instance light on to your skin impacting skin or light on your photoreceptor impacting photoreceptor of your boy or it can be indirect it can be light driving on your photoreceptor the photoreceptor than in forming anothercell type which informs another cell type which then relays a signal and kind of a bucket brigade manner off to the spleen and says to the spleen hey there is a body you've light out here we are actually under stress in fact there much you've light that union to activate in immune program to protect the skin and in response to that the spleen can deploy certain signals and certain cell types to go out and start repairing skin that is being damage by you lid we have direct signals and we have indirect signals but in every case it starts with light of particular wave ling's being absorbed by particular pigments or properties of the surfaces that those light waves land on and as you recall from our discussion about the physics of light remember it is notjoust about light in pinging on the surface of your body light can actually penetrate deep to the skin and access at least certain tissues and cells of your body even though you cannot see those ravelings of light they are getting into you all the time perhaps the best way to rape this discussion about the physics and the billy of light with a bit of a bow is to think about light as a transducer meaning a communicator of what is going on in the environment a round you and that some of those signals are arriving at the surface and impacting the surface of your body but many of those signals are being taken by cells at the surface of of your body meaning your malanicites in your skin and the photoreceptor of your eyes and then being passed off as a set of instructions to the other organs and tissues of your body lighten impact biology in it very fast moderately fast and slow ways but even the slow ways in which light can impact biology can be very powerful and very long lasting just as it quick example of the rapid effects of light on our biology if you were to go from a room that is dimly lit or dark into a very brightly lit room you would immediately feel very alert he might say no that is not true sometimes i wake up and its dark and a kind of stumble out and its lighter out in the next room and it takes me wild awake up ah but if we were to move you from a room that was very dark to very bright a signal conveyed from your eyes to an air of your brain stem call the locust sedulous would cause the release of a adrenaline similar to the release of a adrenaline if you were to be dropped into very very cold water all of a sudden ours immediate wake up signal to your brain and body s that is an example of a rapid effect of light on your biology it a very typical one but none the less one that has a hard wired biological mechanism at the other end of the spectrum are what we call slow integrating effects of light on our biology what i mean by that are ways in which your body is taking information about light in it the environment not in the sort of snap shot acute cense but averaging the amount of light in your environment and that average light information is changing the way that your biology works but even though this is a slow process as i mention before it is a very powerful one the primary example of this are called circanual rhythms circanual rhythms are literally a calender that exists within your body the uses not numbers but a mounts of hormone that are released into your brain embody each day and each night as a way of knowing where you are in the three hundred and sixty five day calender year that might seem kind of crazy but it is not crazy the earth travels around the sun once every three hundred and sixty five days and depending on where you are on the earth where you live you are going to get more or less light each day on average depending on the time of year your in the northern hemisphere in the winter months days are shorter nights are longer in the summer months days are longer nights are shorter and of course things change whether not your in the northern hemisphere of the southern hemisphere but none the less in short days you have more darkness that is obvious and if you understand that light a riving on the eyes is absorbed by a particular cell type call the intrinsically photosensitive ganglia cells just a name you do not need to know the name but if you want as the called intrinsically photons give ganglions all also called the melon cousin cell because it contains an cousin a photopigment that absorbs short wave length light that arrives through sunlight those cells communicate to particular stations in the brain that in turn can neck to your call pineal gland which is as little decided land in the middle of your brain that releases a hormone called melatonin and the only thing you need to know is that light activates these particular cells the intrinsically photosensitive melonopsen cells which in turn shuts down the production of melatonin from the pine giant if you think about this interns of the travel of the earth around the sun across the year what it means is that in short days because there is very little light on average landing on the cells the duration of melatonin release will be much longer because as i mention before light inhibits it shuts down melatonin whereas in the summer months much more light on average will land on your eyes because days are longer even if your spending more time in doors on average you are going to get more light to activate these cells and because light shit's down megaton and production what you will find is that the duration of megaton and release for the pineal is much shorter melatonin is a transducer it is a communicator of how much light on average is in your physical environment what this means is for people living in the northern hemisphere your getting more megaton and release in the winter months than you are in the summer months you have a calender system that is based in a hormone and that hormone is using light in order to determine where you are in that journey around the sun now this is beautiful at least to me its beautiful because what it means is that the environment around us is converted into a signal that changes the environment within us that signal is melatonin and melatonin is well known for its roll in making us sleepy each night in allowing us to fall asleep many of you have probably heard before i am not a big fan of megaton and supplementation for a number reasons but just as a quick aside the levels of melatonin that are in most supplements are far too high to really be considered physiological they are indeed superphysiological in most cases and melatonin can have a number of different effects not just related to sleep but that is supplemented melatonin here i am talking about our natural production and release of melatonin according to where we are in the three hundred sixty five day calender year indigenous melatonin meaning the melatonin that we make within our bodies naturally not melatonin supplemented has too generalcategories of of effects the first set of effects are called regulatory effects and the others are protective effects the regulatory effects are for instance that melatonin can positively impact bone mass melatonin can for instance turn on the production of osteal blasts which are essentially themselves that make more bone for us that make our bone stronger and that can replace damage aspects of our bone megaton is also involved in maturation of the gonads during puberty the ovaries and the testes although there the effects of megaton intend to be suppressive on maturation of the overseen testes meaning high levels of melatonantend to reduce tactical volume and reduce certain functions within the testis including spin production and to stocerum production and within the ovaries melatonin can suppress the maturation of eggs et camera now i do not want any one to get scared if you been taking melatonin most effects of melatonin on those functions are reversible but i should point out that one of the reasons why children do not go into purity until particular age is that young children tend to have chronically high and doginists melatonin and that is healthy to keep them out of puberty until it is the right time for purity to happen melatonin can increase bone mass but reduces gonad mass to speak ah it is going to have varying effects depending on the ratios and levels of other hormones and other biological events in the body but as you can see megaton has these powerful regulatory effects on other tissues i should also mention that melatonin is a powerful modulator of placental development for any one that is pregnant four considering melatonin supplementation please please please taught your obguian tastier other doctor as well you want to be very very cautious because of the powerful effects that melatonin can have on the developing feeds and placenta for people that are not pregnant in fact all people melatonin has a powerful effect on the central nervous system as a whole your brain and final corder of the major components of your central nervous system and melatonin because its associated with darkness which is just another way of saying that light suppresses melatonin melatonin is thereby associated with the dark phase of each twenty for our cycle it can have a number of different effects in terms of waking up or making our body feel more sleepy and it does that by way of impacting cells within our nervous system literally turning on certain brain areas turning off other brain areas and it does that through a whole cascade of biological mechanisms a bit too detail to get into today melatonin is regulating how water asleep we are intends to make us more asleep incidentally it is regulating are timing of puberty and its regulating how our gonads the testisand overseas function even in adulthood to some extent and it is regulating bone mass as a mentineformelatonian also has protective effects it can activate our mine system it is among chemist potent antioxidants it is known to have certain anticancer properties and things of that sort which is not to say that you simply want more melatonin i think a lot of people get misled when they hear something melatonin has anticancer properties that does not mean that just cranking up the levels and melatonin by supplementing it whereby spending time in darkness and noccanani light which would of course in habit melatonin is going to be beneficial for combating cancer that is not the way it works it is actually the rise and fall of melatonin every twenty for our cycle and the changes in the duration of that melatonins signal through out the seasons that has these anticancer and antioxidant effects when we think about light impacting our biology the reason i bring up melatonin as the primary example of that is e because melatonin impact many important functions within our brain and body but also because hormones in general not always but in general are responsible for the slow modulatory effects on our biology and amusing the is an example of how light throughout the year is changing the way that your the different cells and tissues and organs of your body or working and that melatonin is the transducer of that signal at this point we can say light powerfully modulates megaton and meaning it shuts down melatonin melatonin is both beneficial for certain tissues and suppressive for other tissues in functions which we do wit this information well it is very well establish now that one of the best things that we can all do is to get the proper amount of sunlight each day and by proper i mean appropriate for that time of year in the summer months where the days are longer and nights are shorter we would all do well to get more sunlight in our eyes and again it is going to be to our eyes because as you recall the panel sits deep in the brain and light cannot access the pineal directly at least not in humans in order to get light information to the pineal and thereby get the proper levels of melanoma according to the time of year we should all trying get outside as much as possible during the long days of summer and spring and in the winter months it make sense to spend more time and doors for those of you that suffer from seasonable effective disorder which is a seasonable depression or feel lo during the fall and winter months the ways t offset this we did entire episode on mood indicating rhythms where we describe this it does make sense for some people to get more bright light in their eyes early in the morning and throughout the day during the winter months as well but none the less changes in megaton and meaning changes in the duration of megaton and release across the year are normal and healthy provided that you're not suffering from depression it is going to be healthy to somewhat modulate your amount of indoor out door time across the year the o thing understand is this very firmly established fact which is light powerfully inhibits platina if you wake up in the middle of the night and you go into the bath room and you flip on the lights and those are very bright overhead florescent lights your melatoneand levels which would ordinarily be quite high in the middle of the night because you have been eyes closed in the dark presumably will immediately plume to near zero or zero we would all do well regardless of time of year to not destroy our melatoneand in the middle of the night in this way if you need to get up in the middle the night and use the restart which is a perfectly normal behavior for many people house the minimumamount of light required in order to safely move through the environment that you need to move through melatonin needs to come on early in the night it actually starts rising in the evening and towards sleep but then as you close your eyes when you go to sleep melatonin levels are going to continue to rise at least for several hours into the night again if you get up in the middle of the night really try hard not to flip on a lot of bright lights if you do that every once in a while at not going to be a problem but if you are doing that night after night you are really disrupting this fundamental signal that occurs every night regardless of winter spring summer et camera and that is communicating information about weary your brain and body should be in time and i know that is a lowly bit of a tricky concept but really our body is not meant to function in the same way during the winter months as the summer months there are functions that are specifically optimal for the shorter days of winter and there of functions that are specifically optimal for the longer days of summer again try to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle of the night and for those of either are doing shift work what i can say is try and avoid getting bright light in your eyes in the middle of your sleep cycles even if your sleeping the mile the day begun have to work at night if you wake up during that bout of sleep really try hard to limit the amount of light which is going to be harder for shift workers right because there generally lotmore lights on and bright lights outside to you would want o close the blinds and limit artificial light inside one way to buy past some of the in history effects of light on melatonin is to change your physical environment by for instance dimming the lights that is one simple way very low costwayinfact you will save money by doming the lights are turning them off the other is if you are going to use light using long wave length light because as you recall these intrinsically photosensitive melons and cells within your retina that convey the signal about bright light in your environment to impact melatonin to shut down melatonin respond a short wavelengths of light red light is long wave length light you now understand that from our discussion about the physics of light and if you were to use amber colored light or red light and even better dim amber or dim red light in the middle of the night will then you would probably not reduce melatonin at all unless those red lights in amberlights are very very bright any light provided its bright enough will shut down milestone and production one final point about mletonan and this relates to meletonand supplementation as well is that now that you understand how potently melatonin can impact things cardiovascular function an man function anticantsor properties bone mass gonad function et camera you can understand why it would make sense to be cautious about meloetonand supplementation because supplementation tends to be pretty static it is ex number of telegrams per night whereas normally in endogenously the amount of meletonean that your releasing each night is changing according to time of year or if you happen to live in an area where there is not much change in daylength across the year frincsance if you live near the equate well then your body is a custom to having regular amounts of melatonin each night when you start supplementing melatonin you start changing the total amount of melatonin obviously but your also changing the normal rhythms in how much melatonin its being released into your brain and body across the three hundred sixty five day calender year well ism somebody who readily embrace a supplementation in various forms for things sleep and focus et camera when it comes to melatonin ism extremely cautious and i think it is also one of the few examples where a hormone is available without prescription of r the country i just going a farmesseor drugstore order on line this hormone which is known to have all these powerful effects i get very very concerned when i hear about people taking megaton especially at the levels that are present in most supplements it is been recognized for a very long time and effect there are now data to support the fact that animals of all kinds including humans will seek out mates and engage in mating behavior more frequently during the long days of spring and summer that is right in season breeding animals of course this is the case but in humans as well there is more seeking out of mates and mating behavior in longer day times of year now you could imagine at least to mechanisms by which this occurs the first mechanism we could easily map to melatonin and the fact that melatonin is suppressive to various aspects of the called donate axis which is basely a anyway of saying that melatonin inhibits testosterone and estrogen output from the testes and from the ovaries i just one o remind people that both males and females make testosterone and estrogen although in different ratios typically in males versus females and that both testosterone and estrogen are critical for the desire tomato and formatting behavior he's broad misconception that testosterone is involved in mating behavior and estrogen's involved another behaviors but having enough estrogen is critical for both males and females in order to maintain the desire to mate and indeed the ability to mate i discuss this on the episode on optimizing testosterone and estrogen f you more details on that please that episode of the hubermanladpotcast o gets if melatonin is suppressive to the called gonatelaxis and reduces over all levels of testosterone and estrogen in males and females and a light inhibits melatonin than when there is moreallight than there is less melatonin and more hormone output from the goats and indeed that is how the system works but that is not the entire story it turns out that there is a second called parallel pathway meaning a different biological pathway that operates in parallel to the light suppression of melatonin pathway that provides a basis for longer days inspiring more desire to mate and for mating behavior if we think of the first pathway involving melatonin as sort of a brave on these reproductive hormones the second mechanism is more an accelerator on those hormones and yet it still involves light as ism about to tell you in animals such as mice but also in humans exposure to light in particular up blue lights short wavelengths of light can trigger increases in testosterone and estrogen and the desire to mate now what is especially important about this accelerator on the desire to mate and mating behavior and h among is that it is driven by exposure to light but it is not the exposure of light to the ice it turns out that it is the exposure of your skin to particular wave lengths of light that its triggering increases in the hormones testosterone and estrogen leading to increase desire to mate as it turns out your skin which most of us just think of as a way to protect the organs of our body or something to hang close on or ornaments on if you re somebody who has earrings and forth your skin is actually an endearing organ meaning it is a hormone producing and hormone influencing organ i promise what i am about to tell you next will for ever change the way that you think about your skin and light and the desire to mate and indeed even making behavior i think the results are best understood by simply going through the primary data meaning the actual research on this topic and to do i am going to review a recent paper that was published in the journal sell reports sell press journal excellent journal this is a paper that came out in twenty twenty one entitled skin exposure to u v b light induces a skin brain gonad axis and sexual behavior and i want to emphasize tat this was a paper that focused on mice in order to address specific mechanisms because in mice you can call knock out particular genes you can remove particular genes to understand mechanism you discant do that in humans in any kind of controlled way least not at this point in time and this study also explorers humans and looked at human subjects both men and women the basic finding of this study was that when mice or humans were i posed to u v b meaning ultra violet blue lights a short wave length light of the sort that comes through in sunshine but is also available through various artificial sources if they received enough exposure of that light to their skin there were increases in testosterone that were observed within a very brief period of time also increases in the hormone estrogen and i shall point out that the proper ratios of estrogen and testosterone were maintained in both males and females at least as far as these data indicate and mice tended to seek out making more and mate more there were also increases in donate weight literally increases in testy size and in o german size when mice were exposed to this u v b light passed a certain threshold now as i mention before the study also look at humans they did not look at testy size or ovarian size in the human subjects however because they are humans they did address the psychology of these human beings and address whether or not they had increases in for instance aggressiveness or in passionate feelings and how their per option of other people changed when they were getting a lot of u v b light exposure to the skin before i get into some of the more important details of the study and how it was done and how you can leverage this information for yourself if you desire i just one a high light some of the basic findings over all u v v exposure increased these called sex steroid levels in mice and humans the sexstoryed hormones when we say steroids we do not mean anabolic steroids take n exogenously i think when pe will hear the word steroids they always think steroid abuse or use rather steroid hormones such as testosterone and estrogen went up when nicer humans had a lot of u v b exposure to their skin second of all u v v light exposure to the skin enhanced female attractiveness o the perceived attractiveness of females by males and increased the receptiveness or the desire to mate in both sexes u v v light exposure also changed various aspects of female biology related to fertility in particular logical growth logical and beg maturation are well known indices of fertility and of course correlate with the menstrual cycle in adult humans and is related over all to the propensity to b come pregnant u v v light exposure enhanced maturation of the physical which just meant that more healthy legs were being produced these are impressive effects first of all they looked at a large number of variables in the study and the fact that they looked at mice and humans is terrific i think that oftentimes we find it hard to translate data from mice to humans to the fact that they looked at both in parallel is wonderful in the mice and in the humans they established a protocol that essentially involved exposing the skin to u v light that was equivalent to about twenty to thirty minutes of midday sun exposure now of course where you live in the world will dictate whether not that midday sun is very very bright and intend or is less brights maybe there is cloud cover at camera but since imagine that most people are interested in ways to increase testosterone and or estrogen in humans and are not much interested in increasing tesastron in mice i am going to just re view what they did in the human population or the human subjects what they did is they had people first of all establish a baselineand the way they establish a baseline was loved unusual but will make perfect sense to you they had people wear long sleeves and essentially cover up and avoid sunlight for a few days they could measure their baseline hormones in the absence of getting a lot of u v b light exposure from the sun or from other sources now of course these people had access to artificial lights but as have pointed o on this podcast before it is pretty unusual that you will get enough u v b exposure from artificial lights throughout the day and in the morning you need a lot of u v b exposure or we should be getting a lot of u v b exposure to our eyes and to our face into our skin throughout the day provided were not getting sunburnt this is actually a healthy thing for mood and for energy throughout the day it is only at night that stilly between the hours of about ten p m and for a m that even a tiny bit of u v b exposure from artificial sources can mess us up in terms of our sleep in our energy levels and on and that is because of the potent effect of u v b on suppressing melatonin the point here is that they establish a baseline whereby people were getting some artificial light exposure throughout the day but they were not getting outside a lot they were not getting a lot of sunlight and then they had people receive a dose of u v b light exposure that was about twenty to thirty minutes outdoors they had people were short sleeves no hat no sunglasses some people wore sleeveless shirts they encourage people to wear shorts they were indeed wearing clothing they were not naked and they were wearing clothing that was culturally and situational appropriate at least for the part of the world where the study was done and they had people do that two or three times a week in terms of a protocol that you might export from the study basely getting outside for about thirty minutes two or three times a week in a minimum of clothing and yet still a wearing enough clothing that is culturally appropriate they were outside they were not sun bathing flipping over on their back in front they we just moving about doing things they could read they could talk they could go about other activities but they were not wearing a broad brim hat or a hat of any kind just getting a lot of sun exposure to their skin they did this for a total of ten to twelve u v b treatments that took several weeks it took about a month if you think about it two or three times for week for total often to twelve u v b treatments these treatments goes are just being outside in the sun and then they measured hormones and they measured the psychology of these male and female adult subjects let us first look at the psychological changes that these human subjects experience after getting ten to twelve of these u v v light exposure outdoor and sunlight type treatments they did this by collecting blood samples throughout the study and they saw significant increases in the hormones data estradiol which is one of the major forms of estrogen progesterone another important stirred hormone and testosterone in both men and women now an important point is that the testosterone increases were significantly higher in men that happened to originate from countries that had low u v exposure compared to individuals from countries with high u v exposure now this ought to make sense if we understand a little bit about how the skin functions as an endercron organ many of you have probably heard of item in d three which is a sidemen that we all make many people supplemented as well if they need additional vitamin d three we all require sunlight in order to a low item in d three to be synthesized and perform its rolls in the body and it turns out that people who have darker skin actually need more item in d the and or more sunlight exposure in order to activate that d three pathway then do people with paler skin and this should make sense to all of you given what you now understand about milanicites that elite that we miscast earlier because milaniites have pigment within them and if you have darker skin it means the you have more malanicites or that you have milanicites that er more efficient at creating pigment and as a consequence the light that lands on your skin will be absorbed by those milanicites and less of it is able to impact the d three pathway whereas if you have pale skin more of the light that lands on your skin can trigger the synthesis and assist the actions of icemen d three similarly in this study they found that people who had paler skin and or who originated from countries where they had less u v b light exposure across the year had greater meaning more significant increases in testosterone over all than did people who already were getting a lot of u b b exposure this led them to explorer called seasonal changes in testosterone that occurred normally in the absence of any light exposure treatment up until now have been talking bout the aspects of the study involving people getting outside for about twenty to thirty minutes per day in sunlight in a minimum of clothing there was an increase in testosterone observed in both men and women the increases in testosterone were greater for people that had paler skin than darker skin the data ism about to describe also come from this same paper but do not involve twenty to thirty minute daily sun exposure protocols it simply addressing whether not testosterone levels change as a function of time of year they measure testosterone across the twelvemonth calender this study was done on subjects living in the northern hemisphere for the entire year and in the months of canary library march of course the length of days is shortest and the length of nights is longest and of course in the spring and summer months tune jury august september and on the days are much longer n the nights are shorter and what they observed was very obvious they observed that testosterone levels were lowest in the winter months and were highest in the months of tune jury august in september now these are very important data lease to my enologies are the first data systematically exploring the levels of steroid hormones in humans as a function of time of year and thereby as a function of how much sunlight exposure their getting and what is remarkable about these data is that they map very well to the data and mice and the other data in this paper on humans which illustrate that if your getting more u v b exposure your testosterone levels are higher this study when a step further and explored whether not the amount of sunlight exposure that one is getting to their skin influences their psychology in terms of whether not they have increased desire to mate and on it is well known that sunlight exposure to the eyes can increase mood and i talked about this in the podcast episode with my guys doctor same hoar whose the director of the cronobilgy unit of the national institutes a mental health and summer's recommendation is that people get as much bright light exposure as they safely can in the morning and throughout the day for sake of both sleep and energy but also for enhancing mood and regulating appetite in this study it was found that both males and females had higher levels of romantic passion after getting the u v treatment in fact some of them reported increases in romantic passion from just one or two of these u v treatments they did not have to go through all ten or twelve in order to get a statistically significant increase in passion now when we talk about passion as the authors of this paper acknowledge there is really two forms there is emotional and sexual and they parts this pretty finely i do not ant to go into all the details and we can provide a reference in into the study if you to look at those details but what they found was that women receiving this u v v light exposure focussed more on increases in physical arousal and sexual passion whereas the men actually scored higher on the cognitive dimensions of passion such as obsessive thoughts about their partner and on regardless both males and females experienced and reported a increase in special passion and desire to want and we now know there were increases in testosterone and estrogen which of course could be driving the psychological changes although ism sure that those interact in both directions meaning the hormones no doubt affect psychology and no doubt the psychology these changes in passionate feelings no doubt also increased or change the hormone levels as well and i want a re emphasize that there was a component of the study that had no deliberate daylight sunlight exposure for twenty or thirty minutes but rather just looked at hormone levels throughout the year and found that the increase in daylength correlated with increases in testosterone and sexual passion now my opinion this is a very noteworthy study because really illustrates that sunlight and daylength can impact the melatonin pathway and thereby take the foot off the break to speak on testosterone estrogen and the desire to mate it also emphasizes that sunlight u v v light can directly trigger hormone pathways and desire to mate and making behavior now the study when a step further defining the precise mechanism by which light can impact all these hormones and this desire to mate and here understanding the mechanism is key if you want to export a particular protocol or tool that you might apply we talked earlier about how u v v light exposure to the eyes trigger's activation of these particular neurons within the eye and then with centers deeper in the brain and eventually the pine gland to suppress the output on melatonin and thereby to allow testosterone and estrogen to exist at higher levels because melatonin can inhibit testosterone and estrogen in this study they were able to very clearly established that it is sunlight exposure to our skin that is causing these harmony increases that they observed in mice in humans the way they did that was to use these called knockout technology the ability to remove specific genes within specific tissues of the body and what they found is that u v b light meaning sunlight exposed skin unregulated meaning increase the activity of something called p fifty three which is involved in the maturation of cells and various aspects of cellar function and the cells they were focused on were the coratinosites which you are now familiar with from our earlier discussion about the fact that the epidermis of your skin contains mainly corratnosites and milanosites sunlight exposure increased p fifty three activity in the skin and p fifty three activity was required for the down stream increases in ovarian size in testicular size and testosterone increases in the estrogen increases and the various other changes that they observed at the physiological level when animals are humans were exposed to sunlight these day are important because what they mean is that not only is it important that we get sunlight exposure early in the day and throughout the day to our eyes at least as much as is safely possible but that we also need to get u v b sunlight exposure on to our skin if we want to activate this p it three pathway in corratnosites and the testosterone and estrogen increases that are downstream of that p fifty three pathway even though the we knockout studies were done on mice they clearly show that if you remove p fifty three from the skin that these effects simply do not occur in terms of thinking about a protocol to increase testosterone and estrogen mood and feelings of passion the idea is that you would want to get the two to three exposures per week minimum of twenty to thirty minutes of sunlight exposure on to as much of your body as you can reasonably expose it to n i say reasonably i mean of course you have to obey cultural constraints decency constraints a and of course you have to also obey the fact that sunlight can burn your skin many people are probably going to ask what happens if you wear sunscreen but in theory because sunscreen has u v protection it would block some of these effects now not suggesting that people do away with sunscreen entirely i do hope to do an episode all about sunscreen in the future because sunscreen is a bit of a controversial topic skin cancers are a real thing and many people are especially prone to skin cancers o in no to take that seriously some people are not very prone to skin cancers and can tolerate much more sun exposure you probably familiar with the simple fact that if you gone outside on the beach with friends some people get burned very easily others do not you really should prioritize the health and the avoidance of sunburn on your skin however these data and other data point to the fact that we should all probably be striving to get more sunlight exposure on to our skin during the winter months end still getting sunlight exposure on to our skin in the summer months provided we can do that without damaging our skin another set of very impressive effects of u v v light whether not comes from sunlight or from an artificial source is the effect of u v b light on our tolerance for pain it turns out that our tolerance for pain varies across the year end that are pain tolerance is increased in longer day conditions end as we saw with the effects of u v b on hormones and making again this is occurring via u v b exposure to the skin n u v b exposure to the eyes one just described two studies that really capture the essence of these results ism going to discuss these in kind of a top contour fashion i will not onto it is quite as much depth as i did the last study but i will provide links to these studies as well the first study is entitled skin exposure to ultra violet b rapidly act of systemic aura endercran and a munisuppressive responses you might hear that an think oh munisuppress of that is bad but basically what they observed is that even one exposure to u v b light change the output of particular hormones and narrow chemicals in the body such as corticatropenhormon and data in orphans which are these indigenous opioid we have all heard of the opioid crisis which is people getting addicted to opioid that they are taking in drug form farmasuticles but here ism referring to endorphins that our body naturally manufactures and releases in order to counter pain and act as a somewhat of a psychological soother also because of course physical pain and emotional pain are intimately linked in the brain and body but they found was that exposure to u v b light increased the release of these data and orphans it cause essentially the release of an indigents pain killer now a second study that came out very recently just this last week in fact publishing the journal neuron sell press journal excellent journal is entitled a visual circuit related to the periaqueductal grey area for the anti nocosceptive effects of bright light treatment it'll translate a orbit of that for you the periaqueductal gray is a region of the mid brain that contains a lot of neurons that can release indigenous spirits things data and zeppelin things and zeppelin things mu opioid these are all names of chemicals that your body can manufacture the act as indigenous pain killers and increase your tolerance for pain the actually make you feel less pain over all by shutting down some of the neurons that perceive pain or by reducing their activity not to a dangerous level night there not in a block the pain response that you burn yourself unnecessarily or harm yourself unnecessarily but they act as a bit of a pain killer from the inside if you heard the word antinosusceptive noseception is basically the perception or the way in which neuron's respond to painful stimuli you can think of susceptive events in your nervous system as painful events and there a musing abroad brush i realize that the experts and pain will say oh it is not of really a pain circuit et center et camera but for sake of to day's discussion it is fair to say that nosusception is the perception of pain if this title is visual circuit related to the pariocuoductal grey which is this area that releases these indoors opioid for the antinosuseptive the anti pain effects of bright light treatment the key finding of this study is that it is light landing on the eyes and captured by the specific cells i was talking bout earlier those intrinsically photosensitive melonopsand gangland cells is he long name for them but these particular nods in your eye end in my eye incidentally that communicate with particular brain areas these brainairs have names if you wanton them for you ifphysionatos are for you ultrocurious folks they have names the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus and the introgeniculate leaflet the names do not matter the point is that light landing on the eyes is captured by these melonopsin cells they absorbed that light translate that light into electrical signals that are handed off to areas of the brain such as the ventral geniculate and then the eventual geniculate communicates with this pariociductal grey area to evoke the relieve of these indigenous opioid that soothe you and lead to less perception of pain this is a really important study because it is long been known that in longer days or in bright light environments we tolerate emotional and physical pain better previous studies had shown that it is light landing on our skin that mediates that effect but only in part it could not explain the entire effect this very recent study indicates that it is also light arriving at the eyes an in this case again you v b light ultraviolet bought of the sort that come from sunlight that is triggering these anti pain or pain relieving pathways once again we have two parallel pathways is is he theme you are going here over and over and over again not just in this episode but in all episodes of the suburban alpacas because this is the way that your brain and body are built nature rarely relies on one mechanism in order to create an important phenomenon and pain relief is an important phenomenon we now have at least to examples of the potent effects of you b b light exposure to the skin and to the eyes one involving activation of tostastrone and estrogen pathways as it relates to mating and another that relates to reducing the total amount of pain that we experience in response to any painful stimulate for those of you there thinking tools and protocols if you are somebody whose experiencing chronic pain provided you can do it safely try to get some you v b exposure i day from sunlight i think the twenty of thirty minute protocol two or three times per week is an excellent one seems a fairly low dose of you v b light exposure it is hard to imagine getting much damage to the skin of course of you have very sensitive skin or if you live in an area of the world that is very very bright en has intend sunlight particular times of year you will want to be cautious he the warnings in considerations about suncream that i talked about earlier or about wearing a hat but the point is very clear most of us should be getting more u v b exposure from sunlight i can already hear the screams within the comments or the rather the questions within the comment saying wold if i live in a part of the world where i do not get much u v b exposure and i want to emphasize something that have also emphasize in the many discussions on this podcast related to sleep and circadian rhythms an alertness which is even on a cloud covered day you are going to get far more light energy photons through cloud cover then you are going to get from an indoor light source an artificial light source i cannot emphasize this enough i you look outside in the morning and you see some sunlight if you see some sunlight throughout the day you would do yourself a great favor to trying chase some of that sunlight and get into that sunlight to expose your eyes and your skin to that sunlight as much as you safely can an when i say as much as you safely can never ever look at any light artificial sunlight or otherwise that bright that its painful to look at it is fine to get that light arriving on your eyes indirectly it is fine to wear eye glasses or contact lenses in fact if you think about the biology of the eye and the way that those lends work that will just served to focus that light on to the very cells that you want those light beams to b delivered to whereas sunglasses that are highly reflective or trying to get your sunlight exposure through a win shield of a car or through a window simply will not work ism sorry to tell you but most windows are design to filter out the u v b light and if your somebody whose really keen on blue blockers and your wearing your blue blockers all day well do not wear them outside and in fact you are probably doing yourself a disservice by wearing them in the morning and in the daytime there certainly as a place for blue blockers in the evening and night time if your having issues with falling in staying asleep but if you think about it blue blockers with thee really doing is blocking those short wave length u v b wavelengths of light that you desperately need to arrive at your get in a and of course also on to your skin in order to get these powerful biological effects on hormones and on pain reduction and in terms of skin exposure these data also might make you think a little bit about whether or not you should where short sleeves or longsleeves whether not you want to wear shorts a a spirit or pants it is all going to depend on the contacts of your life and the social and other variables that are important of course i do not know each in every one of your circumstances i cannot tell you to do ex or why or s a nor would i but you might take into consideration that it is the total amount of skin exposure that is going to allow you to capture more or fewer fotanths depending on for instance if your completely cloaked in clothing in your just you now exposed in the hands o neck and face such as i am now or whether not your outside in short sin a shirt you are going to get very very different patterns of biological signaling activation in those two circumstances many of you ism guessing are wondering whether or not you should seek out you v b exposure throughout the entire year only in the summer months and that sort of going to depend on whether or not you experience depression in the winter months call seasonal effective disorder some people have miles some people have severe forms of seasonal effect give disorder some people love the fall in winter and the shorter days they love bundling out they love the leaves they love the snow they love the could than they do not experience of psychological lot it verses tremendously and there are genetic differences and a birthplace origin differences that relates all this but really it has to be considered on a case by case basis i personally believe and this was reinforced by the director of the honor chronology unit the national institutes a mental health smarter that we would all do well to get more u v exposure from sunlight throughout the entire year provided we are not burning our skin or damaging our eyes in some way in addition to that during the winter months if you do experience some drop in energy or increase in depression or psychological loads it can be very beneficial to access a sad lamp or if you do not want to by a sad lamp was oftentimes that can be very expensive you might do well to simply get a belly d lighting panel have described one before and i want emphasize that i have no a filiation whatsoever to these commercial sources but have described one before anal describe it again and we confide a a link to a couple examples of these in the show no an the show note caption use me this is a nine hundred and thirty to thousand locks flux light source that is design for drawing it is at lily a drawing box as a thin panels about the size of a lap top very inexpensive compared to the typical sad lamp i should have when i position on my desk all day long i also have at have skylights above my desk ism fairly sensitive to the effects of light in longer days i feel much better than i do in shorter days have never suffered from full blown seasonal effective disorder but i keep the hat light source on throughout the day throughout the year but i also make it appoint to get outside and get sunlight early in the morning at several times throughout the day and if it is particularly overcast outside or there just does not seem to be a lot of sunlight coming through those clouds i will try to look at that light source a little bit more each day in order to trigger these mechanisms now some people may desire to get u v b exposure to their skin and they want to do that through sources other than sunlight and there it is a literate more complicated there are of course canning felons which basically are beds of u v b light that is really all they are a never been to one i know people do frequent them in certain parts of the world there of course people are covering their eyes they are only getting u v b exposure to their skin typically because the u v b exposure or intensities rather tens to be very very high and you can nicely damage your eyes if your looking at a very very bright artificial u v b source up close you really have to explore these options for yourself sunlight of course being the original and a still the best way to get u v b exposure without knowing your particular circumstances finances genetics or place of origin et scenery i cannot know whether not you need to use artificial sources you are going to have to gage that meanwhile getting outside looking at and getting some exposure of u v b on to your skin is going to beneficial for the vast majority of people out there and in fact it is even going to beneficial for people that are blind people that are blind provided they still have eyes often maintain these melons and sells even if your low vision or no vision getting u v b exposure to your eyes can be very beneficial for sake of mood hormone pathways pain reduction and forth a cautionary note people who have relight is pigments macula degeneration or glaucoma as well as people who are especially prone to skin cancers should definitely consult with your opthemologists and dermatologists before you start increasing the total amount of u v b exposure that you are getting from any source sunlight or otherwise there are additional very interesting and powerful effects of u v b light in particular on a man function all the organs of our body are inside our skin and information about external conditions meaning the environment that were in need to be communicated to the various organs of our body some of them have more direct access to what is going on outside for instance the sells in your brain that reside right over the roof of your mouth your hypothalamus that control hormonout put and then control the biological functions that we call circadian functions the one that change every twenty four hours well those are just one or to connections meaning snaps is away from those sells in your eye that peace u v u v v light souse me other organs of your bodies such as your spleen which is involved in the creation of molecules and cells that combat infection well those are a long ways away from those cells in your end in fact there long ways away from your skin there are beautiful studies showing that if we get more u v b exposure from sunlight or from appropriate artificial sources that spleen and immune function are enhanced and there is a very logical well established circuit as to how that happens your brain actually connects to your spleen now it is not the case you cans simply think o case spleen turn on release killer cells go out in combat infection however you v b light arriving on the eyes is known to trigger activation of the neurons within the called sympathetic nervous system these neurons are part of the larger thing that we call the autonomic nervous system meaning its below or not accessible by conscious control s the thing that controls your heart beat controls your breathing and that also activates are flips on the s switch of your immune system when we get a lot of u v b light in our eyes or i should a sufficient you v b light in our eyes a particular channel a particular set of connections within the sympathetic nervous system is activated and our spleen deploys immune cells and molecules that scavenge for and combat infection if you notice that you get fewer colds and flues and other forms of illness in the summer months part of that could b because of the increase in temperature in your environment because typically longer days are associated with more warmth in your environment suppose to winter days which are short whenthend to be colder out well that is true but it is also the case the people around you have fewer colds in flues and that you will get infected with fewer colds and flues and other infections because if those infections whether not their bacterial or viral arrive in your body right if you inhale them or they get in your mouth or on your skin your spleen meets those infections with a greater output in other words the soldiers of your mine system the chemicals and cell times of yourmune system that combat infection are in a more ready deployed stance if you will you net to no more about the immune system and immune function i did not entire episode about the immune system and the brain in a you can find that at superman label to come talk about sight of kinds we talk about killer cells cells cells et camera a lot of detail there we often thing about the summer months and the spring months as fewer infections floating around but in fact there are not fewer infections floating around we are simply better at combating those infections and therefore there is less infection floating around we are still confronted with a lot of infections were just able to combat them better what does this mean in terms of a tool what it means is that during the winter months we should be especially conscious of accessing u v b light to enhance or spleen function to make sure that our sympathetic nervous system is activated to a sufficient level to keep our immune system deploying all those killer teasel's and b cells an side of kinds that when we encounter the infections as we inevitably will right were constantly being bombarded with potential infections that we can combat those infections well and as just a brief aside but i should mention a brief aside that is related to tens of thousands of quality studies it is well known that wound healing is faster when we are getting sufficient u v b exposure typically that is associated with the longer days of spring in summer it is known that turn over of hair cells the very cells that give rides to hairscells are called stemcells they live in little call niches in our skin with these hair stemcells and your hair grows faster in longer days that too is triggered by u v b exposure not just as the skin but to the eyes that is right there's a study polish in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences couple of years ago that show that the exposure of those melanous and ganglancells in your eyes is absolutely critical for triggering the turn over of stemcells in both the skin and hair and also turns out in nails if you have noticed that your skin your hair and your nails look better and turn over more meaning grow faster in longer days that is not a coincidence that is not just your perception in fact hair grows more skin turns over more meaning it is going to look more youthful your benches remove older skinsells are replace the with nurse sells and all the renewing sells and tissues of our body are going to proliferate are going to recreate themselves more when we are getting sufficient u v b light to our eyes and also to our skin and well some of you may think of light therapies such as red light therapies are u v b therapies as kind of new a or just bivouacking again a phrase i do not particularly this notion of bivouacking cause it implies using one thing for a purpose that it was never intended to have well it turns out that u v b exposure an red light as we will soon see is a very potent form of increasing things wound healing in skin health for very logical mechanistically back reasons while i cannot account for everything that is being promoted out there an terms of this light source will hep your skin look more youthful or help omhealior scars the mechanistic basis for light having those effects makes total sense but what you should consider however is that if the particular light therapy that your considering involves very local application rather than illuminating broad swaths of skin and if it has no involvement with the eyes meaning there is no delivery of u v b or red light or the other light therapy to the eyes it is probably not going to be as potent a treatment as would and more systemic activation of larger areas of kind and the eyes now again a cautionary note i do not want people taking technologies that were designed for local application and beaming those into the eyes that could be very very bad in damaging to your retinal and other tissues certainly when one you taking bright light of very high intensity of any kind and getting cavalier about that typically the local illumination of say a wound or particular patch of any or some other of form of skin treatment involves very high intensity light and if the intensity is too high you can actually damage that skin and as will talk about in a few moments most of those therapies for modifying skin involve actually burning off a small very thin layer at the top of the epidermis in efforts to trigger the renewal or the activation we stemcells that will replenish that with new cells there is a fine line to be had between light therapies that are very localized and intense which are designed to damage skin and cause reactivation of new stemcells e there not stairwells or skin cells et camera verses systemic activation across broad swaths of skin in the eyes really have to consider this on a case by case basis but at least for now just consider that increases in hormones reduction in pain by way of increases in and kefflin another indogionous opioid improving immune status by activating the spleen and on and on really are all the downstream consequence of illuminating large swaths of skin and making sure that those neurons and within the eyes get their adequate u v b exposure or other light wave length exposure not simply beaming a particular wave length of light at a particular location on the body and hoping that that particular illumination at a particular location on the body is going to somehow change the biology at that location our apologies just really does not work that way it is possible but in general systemic effects through broadscale illumination and illumination to the eye combined with local treatments are very likely to be the ones that have the most success now i to shift our attention to the effects of light on mood more specifically we talked about this interns of seasonal effective disorder but many of us do not suffer from season effect of disorder i to drill ill deeper into how light impacts mood and here i want to again paraphrase the statements of doctor samerhitar at the national institutes a mental health i should mention the director of the chronobile unit at the national institutes a mental health and perhaps one of the top one to two to three world experts and how light can impact mood appetite circadian rhythms and forth same stated on the podcast and he said in various other even us as well the getting as much u v v light in our eyes and on our skin in the early day in throughout the day as a safely possible is going to be beneficial for mood there is also another time of day or rather i should say a time of night in which u v v can be leveraged in order to improve mood but it is actually the inverse of everything were ben talking about up until now we have a particular normal circuit that originates with those melanous and cells in our eye that by paths all the areas the brain associate with circadian clocks everything relate to sleep in wakefulness that specifically dedicated to the pathways involving the release of molecules doom the nuromagulator that is associate with motivation with feeling good with feeling there is possibility in the world and on and forth another molecules as well including ceretonan and some of those in dozens opioid that we talked about before that particular pathway involves a brain structure called the perry hobenular nucleus the peryhobenular nucleus gets in put from the cells in the eye that respond to u v v light and frankly to bright light of other ravelings as well as as you recall if a light is bright enough even if its not u v or blue light it can activate those sells in the eye those sells in the eye communicate to the very hobenular nucleus and as it turns out if this pathway is activated at the wrong time of each twenty four hours cycle mood gets worse dooming output gets worse molecules that are there specifically to make us feel good actually are reduced in their output while u v v exposure in the morning and throughout the day is going to be very important for it elevating and maintaining elevated mood avoiding u v v light at night is actually a way in which we can prevent activation of this i to peryhobenular pathway that can actually turn on depression to be very direct and succinct about this avoid exposure to u v v light from artificial sources between the hours of ten p m and four a m and if your somebody who suffers from low mood and over all has a n of mild depression or even severe depression of course please see a psychiatrist see a trained psychologist get that treated but you would do especially well to avoid u v v exposure from artificial sources not just from ten p m defer a m but really be careful about getting too much exposure to u v v even in the late evening eight p m perhaps to four a m i cannot emphasize this enough that if you u u v v light you activate those neurons in your eye very potently and if those cells communicate to the peryhobenular uncles which they do you will truncate or reduce the amount of dooming that you release if you want to keep your mood elevated get a lot of light you v b light throughout the day and at night really be cautious about getting you v b exposure from artificial sources now let say your somebody who has no issues with mood you are just the happiest person all year long or maybe you just have subtle a variations in your mood you feel great about that turns out that you still want to be very careful about light exposure be tween the hours of ten piamrso and for a m in fact even during sleep there is a recent study that just came out in the proceeds in the national academy of sciences and it is entitled light exposure jeering sleep in pairs cardie metabolic function this is a very interesting study where they took human subjects young adults and having them sleep in rooms that had different lighting conditions either dim light or slightly bright light now many people cannot fall asleep in brightly lit rooms they acknowledge this these were not very brightly lit rooms these were rooms that had just a little bit of overhead room lighting a hundred lucks which is not very bright at all or they had them sleep in a room that had very dim light which is less than three lucks if you want to get a sense of how bright three lucks is verses a hundred lucks i would encourage you to download the free a light meter i have no relationship to the a it is a pretty cool lap however have used it for a long time where you can basely point your phone ad a particular light source sun or otherwise and you just press the button will give you an approximate read out of lucks which is the light intensity that the phone happens to be staring out at at that location it is not exact but it is a pretty good back of the envelope measure of light intensity these subjects were either sleeping in a very dim room three lucks is very very dim or a somewhat dim room a hundred lucks in this study they measured things megaton an levels they looked at heart rate they looked at measures of insolent and glucose management now in previous episodes have talked about how glucose blood sugar is regulated by insolent because you do not want your glucose levels to be too high hyperglycemia or too low hypoglycemia and the harmony insolent is involved in sequestering and shuttling glucose in the blood stream physically how well you manage glucose in the blood stream can be indirectly measured by your insolent levels and it is well known that sleep deprivation can disrupt glucose regulation by insolent however in this study subjects were sleeping the whole night through it just happens that some of the subjects were sleeping in this very dimly lit room three lucks and other subjects were sleeping in a somewhat dimly lit room a hundred lucks what is incredible about this study is that both rooms were sufficiently dim that melton levels were not altered in either case this is really key it is not as if one group experienced a lot of bright light through their eyelids and others did not megaton levels were not destructed and given ow potently light can inhibit melatonin this speaks to the fact that this very dim condition of three lucks and the somewhat dim condition of a hundred lucks was not actually perceived by the subjects nor was it disrupting these hormone pathways they also looked at glucose's response as they had people essentially take a fasting glucose test in different conditions i will not go into all the details but here's what they found in healthy adults even just one night of sleeping in a moderately lit environment this hundred lucks environment caused changes increases in night time heart rate which means that the sympathetic nervous system was overly active as compared to people that slept in a completely dark or in a very very dimly lit room decreases n heart rate variability and here i should point out that tartrate variability or each our v is a good thing we want tartrate variability they saw increases in heart rate decreases in heart rate variability and increases in next morning insolent resistance which is an indication that glucose management is suffering this is powerful the results of this study essentially indicate that even just one night of sleeping the whole night through in a dimly lit environment is disrupting the way that our autonomic nervous system is functioning altering called autonomic tone making us less relaxed is probably the best way to describe it even though we are sleep disrupting the way that are cardie metabolic function operates such that we have lower tartrate variability and increased insolent resistance this is not a good thing for any of us to experience while we have mainly been talking bout the passive effects of u v v light and other forms of light now we have two examples one from the work of hoar and collie showing that u v b exposure virtue parihobenula can diminish the output of dopamine and other molecules that make us feel good if that u v b exposures in the middle of the night or late evening and now we have yet another study performed in this case inhuman indicating that even if we fall asleep and sleep the whole night through if the room that were sleeping in has too many lucks too much light energy that light energy is no doubt going through the eyelids which it can activating the particular cells in the eye that trigger in increase in sympathetic nervous system activation and disrupting our metabolism and this study rests on a number of other recent studies published in cell which is a superb journal and other mourn showing that during the course of a healthy deep night sleep our body actually transitions through various forms of metabolic function we actually experience keetosist's states we experience gluconeogenesis we experience different forms of metabolism associate with different stages of sleep not something that were going into depth in this podcast we will in a future podcast what this study shows is that light exposure even in sleep is disrupting or autonomic in this case the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system in ways that are disrupting metabolism probably in sleep but certainly outside of sleep we wake up and have our first meal of the day or even if your intrmentin fasting you eat that first meal of the day if your sleep is taking place in an environment that is overly illuminated well that is disrupting your cardiac function and your metabolism have been talking a lot about u v b light which is short wave length light ivy light blue light may been some blue green light that is can be short wavelength light now i to shift our attention to the other end of the spectra meaning the light spectrum to talk about red light and simpler red light which is a long wave length light many called low level light therapies the acronym is l l l t low level light therapies involve the use of red light and offered light sometimes low level light therapies involve the use of u v b but more often than not these days when we hear else lefty low level light therapy it is referring to red light and near for red light therapies low level light therapies have been shown to be effective for a huge number of biological phenomenon and medical treatments i cannot summarize all of those now it would take me many many hours be an effective episode for curing insomnia but it would not inform you properly about the use of light for your health rather i to just emphasize some of the top contour of those studies and point out that for instance low level light thereby with impress light has been shown to be effective for the treatment of acne and other sorts of skin lesions been some really nice studies actually where they use subjects as their own internal control people who believe it are not agree to have half of their face illuminated with red light or near informed light and the other half of their face serve as a control and to do that for several weeks at a time and you can see pretty impressive reductions in skin lesions reductions in scars from acne and reduction in acne lesions themselves meaning the accumulation of new acne sis with low level light there using red light and informed light sometimes however there is a resistance of that acne to the low level light there be such that people will get an initial improvement and then it will go away despite continuing the treatment your probably asking or at least you should be asking how is it that shining red light on our skin can impact things acne in wound healing et camera well do understand that we have to think back to the beginning of the episode where i described how long wave length light such as red light and near i forced light which is even longer than red light can pass through certain surfaces including our skin our skin has an epidermis which is on the outside and the dermis which is in the deeper layers red light and impeded light can pass down into the deeper layers of our skin where it can change the metabolic function of particular cells let just take acne is an example within the e dermis the deep layers of our skin we have what are called sebaceous glands that actually make the oil that is present in our skin those sebaceous glans are often near by herfolicals is you have ever had infected heroical that is not a coincidence that herfolicals ten to get infected part of it is because there is actually a portal down and around the heroical but the sebaceous gland is where the oil is created that is going to give rise to ferenceis acne lesions also in the dermis in the deep layers of the skin a the malanacites there nocuous in the epidermis that also in the deeper layers of the skin and you have the stem cells that give rise to additional skim cells if the top layers of the epidermis or damage those stem cells can become activated and you also have the stemcells that give rise to herfolicals by shining red light or near for red light on a localized patch of skin provided that red light is not of such high intensity that it burns the skin but is of sufficient intensity that provides just a little bit of damage to the upper layers of the skin the epidermis and that it triggers certain biological pathways within the cells of the sebaceous glad and the stem cells within the hairball niche and the stem cells in skin what happens is the top layers of the skin are basically burned off by a very low level of burn and or the cells in the deeper layer start to churn out new cells which go and rescue the lesion essentially clear out the lesion and replace that legion with healthy skin cells this does work in the contexts of wound heeling getting scars to disappear it also works to remove certain patches of pigmentation there sometimes cases where people will get a red blotchiness o due to certain skin conditions or some darker pigmentation that they will not remover that they need removed because its potential a skin cancer threat now how is red light actually doing it within the cells of the sebaceous gland the stem cells et camera well long wave length light can actually get deepen to the skin i mention that before but can also get into individual cells and can access the called organelle which are described to the beginning the episode in particular they can access the mitochondria which are responsible for producing a t p now the simple way to think about this forsake of this discussion is that as cells age and in particular in very metabolically active cells they accumulate what are called are essay reactive oxygen species and as reactive oxygen species go up e t p energy production tho cells tends to go dow the general statement but its general statement that in most cases is true there are some minor exceptions that do not concern us that have to do with retypes different than the ones talking about now the way to think about this is that red light passes in to the deeper layers of the skin activates mitochondria which increases a to and directly or indirectly reduces these reactive oxygen species these reactive oxygen species are not good we do not want them they cause cellar damage cellar death and for the most part just inhibit the a that our cells work if you've heard of red light or term free light therapies design to heal skin or improve skin quality or remove lesions or get rid of scars or unwanted pigmentation that is not pseudo science that is not you science that is grounded in the very biology of how light interacts with mitochondria and reactive oxygen species some of you may also find it interesting to note that some of the cream base treatments for acne for instance cretinoid acid recon a is actually a derivative of vitamin and the pathway involving cretinoid acid and vitamin believe it or not is very similar to the natural biological pathway by which photo pigments in the eye convert light information in to biological changes within those cells the key point here is that light is activating particular pathways in sells that can either drive death of cells or can make those cells essentially younger by increasing a t p by way of improving mytocondreal function and in recent ears their been some just beautiful examples that exist not only in the realm of skin biology but in the realm of negro biology whereby red light and term free light can actually be used to enhance the function of the cells that for instance allow us to see better and indeed sells that allow us to think better now i to review those data because not only are they interesting in their own right but they also point to some very interesting and powerful application of low posters zero cost tools that we can use to improve our vision if you are somebody who is interested in the use of red light or near forced light called ellelelty low level light therapies for treatment of dermatologist issues anything relate to skin i will include a length to a excellent set of reviews the first one is legitimating diode in dermatology a systematic review of randomize control trials that one includes review of a very large number of studies came out just a few years ago in twenty eighteen and i think is very clearly and cleanly laid out for any one to access you can see the degree of effects of red light for since on treatment of acne or scarring et camera and it'll also provide a link to another review which is low level light therapy in skin stimulating healing and restoring for those you that are interested again in dermcologic issues in the kind of of restoring usefulness and the found of a general themes of of antiaging in longevity and how red light therapies can be use for that i will encourage you to take a look at those reviews what you are going to find is that rarely if ever is there a study looking at whole body red light illumination forsake of treating and improving skin and i mention this because i get a lot of questions about inform red sauna and global illumination with red lights will talk more about cases where global illumination of your whole body or we whole face with red lights might be useful but in terms of inferred sand have mention on this podcast before and i will certainly go deeper on this in an upcoming episode all about the use of heat and temperature for augmenting our biology but in general inform red sands do not get hot enough temperature wise in order to trigger some of the important effects on growth harmony and headstock prolines and some of the other things that sand has been shown to be excellent for that is a general statement i realize there are some inforedsonas that do get hot enough there are very few data on the use of whole body illumination with inform red sands that really point to any specific mechanistically supported effects almost all the passive effects that you are going to see of red light and low level light therapies certainly the one's discussed in the reviews that i just mention are going to be the consequence of very directed illumination of particular patches of skin that our seeking repair that people our seeing the repair of again i do not wan to disparage inbred sands but in general they do not get hot enough to trigger most of the positive effects that sauna have been demonstrated to have and it is unclear at all as to whether not they can enhance skin quality youthfulness restore a top layers of skin that are damaged a repair acne et camera more on heat sands and imferedsanas in their comparison in an up coming episode let us talk about a clear set of examples where red light and near him forced light have been shown to have plosive effects on our health and these are the data that i refer to at the beginning of the episode from doctor glenjeffrey at university college onion who again is a long standing member of the neuroscience community working on visual neuroscience and who over the last decade or has really emphasize the exploration of red light and near him free light for restoration of coronal function as we age this is absolutely critical we know that we do not accumulate many new brain sells as we get older and in some areas of our nervous system such as our nor rating which is the part of our eye that is responsible for translating light information to electrical signal that we can see we do not get any new sells after the time in which we are born the ability to keep our means healthy is extremely important for our visual system extremely important for our hippocampus and every the brain if aldol memory and should just mention that even if people do not get alsheimers there is always going to be some degree of age related to media sadly nobody is as cognitively sharp in the ye are before they die as they are twenty years before that is just never the case where all getting worse at thinking feeling perceiving et camera the question is how quickly we are getting worse any mechanism by which we can preserve or reverse coronal function turns out to be immensely beneficial the jeffrey lab has published two studies in recent years on humans that looked directly no on intended at how red light and near him forced light can improve visual function ism going to describe the parameters of those studies and then ism going to describe what they found exactly the mechanistic motivation for these studies again traces back to this effect of light on mitochondria to go a obit deeper into that mechanism just briefly that you can frame any potential protocol that you would develop when light arrives on cells including neurons that light can penetrate into the cells of its of the appropriate wavelength red light can do that can get into cells it can access the mite contra it can increase t p in general any time t p is doing its thing tat increase energy and cells it is involving this thing called cytochrome c which is an exudates any time you hear c a s in biology it is going to be an enzyme into involved in some process of degrading a molecular creating another molecule typically e t p an cytochrome c is going to give you t p now that is a great thing but it creates a by product a breaks things down such that you get these crosses these reactive oxygen species and those reactive oxygen species for those who youthen want to know are involved in things redo signaling and reactive oxygen species actually change which genes are made in a cell the goal of any treatment to keep neurons or other cells youthful and functioning well and t o presto prevent or reverse aging is going to be to increase a t p and to reduce reactive oxygen species and in doing to disrupt some of the normal pathways associated with age the jeffrey lab approach these studies with that understanding of how mitacondrea and reactive oxygen species in a t p work and what they did was exquisitely simple to the point of being elegant and what they found was really really exciting what they did is they had people subjects that were either younger in their twenties or forty years old or older view red light of about six hundred and seventy nanometer six hundred seventy nanometers would appear red to you and me they had they have them do that souse me at a distance that was safe for their eyes at about a foot away now a foot away from a very intense red light could actual be damaging to the eye they hade them do this at about a foot away from a re light that was of low enough intense that did not damage the eyes and they had them do that anywhere from two to three minutes per day and in one study they had them do that for a long period of time of about twelve weeks and in the other study they have them do that just for a couple of weeks what is remarkable is that when you collapse the results across these two studies what they found is that when looking at these subjects ranging from twenty eight years old to about seven t two years old the major findings were that in individuals forty years old or older in the forty to seventy to year old bracket but not in the subjects younger than forty years old they saw an improvement in visual function that improvement visual function was an improvement in visual acuity meaning the ability to resolve fine detail and using a particular measure of visual function which is called the trite exam t are i t a n titan exam which specifically addresses the function of the called short wave length cones the ones that response green and blue light they saw a twenty two per cent improvement in visual acuity which in the landscape of visual testing is and extremely exciting rest cult ay i think in most studies of improvements of vision you would be very excited to see in improvement of five per cent or ten per cent a twenty two per cent improvement in visual acuity even though it is in this very specific form of visual testing this trite exam or this trite score well that turns out to be very significant and translates to the real world in an important way in particular as we age we tend to lose certain neurons within our retina but we do not tend to lose cones we tend to lose rods we tend to lose other cells within the retain including the cells that connect the eye to the brain the called gangling cells cones for whatever reason are pretty resilient to age related loss however because rods en cones both are not just among the most metabolically active cells in your entire body but the most mantebolically active cells in your entire body that is right your rods and cones of the cells the demand and that use the most energy of all the cells in your body not your skin cells not your spleen cells not your stomach cells even if your tocalat not that cells the responsible for moving your mouth it is the rods and cones of your curl retina that are responsible for using the most amount of a t p and energy in you entire body and because of that those cells tend to accumulate a lot of reactive oxygen species as we age red light of the sort used in these studies was able to reduced the amount of reactive oxygen species in the rods and cones and to rescue the function of this particular cone type the short wave length o medium wavelength cones which if you think about the study is a little but surprising because it was red light and near him for red light not short wave length light that was used in order to create this improvement in cellar function but if you step back a lo bit further it makes perfect sense because there is nothing specific about the red light in the sense that it is not that it gets delivered only to red cones that red light and near him for red light is being absorbed by all the photoreceptor within the eye the rods and the blue cones and the green cones and the red cones is just that the red cones absorb that light best the important take away here is that viewing red light and near him forced light at a distance at which it is safe for just a couple of minutes each day aloud a reversal of the aging process of these anurans which some people have heard you say before and all just say it again the retina including your photoreceptor are not just connected to your brain there not just near your brain they are actual central nervous system tissue they are the only two pieces of your brain man your novenas are the only two pieces of your brain that reside outside your sculler at least outside the cranial vault here were being a reversal of the aging process in neurons by shining red light on those anurans now of course the jeffrey lab is primarily interested in vision and humans are most dependent on vision as the sense to navigate the world and survive this is really wonderful here were looking at a therapy that can reverse ad related vision loss at least in some individuals but as you can imagine the study was also done on these sells because they reside outside the skull and you can shine light directly on them right ism sure that there are many people out there who are interested in how they can improve the function say of the neurons in the brain responsible for memory and in a few minutes it'll describe that non in evasive applications of light to try and restore the function of those cells as well a little bit more about the studies from the jeffrey lap one of the things that they observed was a reduction in called prison d r u s and prison or little fatty deposits little collateral deposits that accumulate in the eye as we age we have all heard about collesterall within our veins and arteries and how that can clagarveins and arteries and how of course longing of veins and arteries is not a good thing well our curl retina being metabolically active requires a lot of bloodflow its heavily vascularity and prison are a special form of collesterall that accumulate in the eye as it turns out these red light and near him forced light therapies explored by the jeffrey lab were able to actually reduce or reverse some of the accumulation of prison and in addition to reducing reactive oxygen species the idea in mind now is that red light may actually reduce collesterall deposits and reactive oxygen species in order to improve neuronal function what should you and i do with these results or should we do anything with these results but firstofall i want it emphasize that even though these studies are very exciting they are fairly recent and more data as always are needed there some additional features of these studies that i think are also important to consider first of all the exposure to red light needed to happen early in the day at least within the first three hours of waking how would one do that well nowadays there are a number of different red light panels and different red light sources that certainly fall within the range of red light and near i for red light that one could use i do not have any affiliation to any companies or products that promote or make those red light therapies a do own a red light panel i confess i have started using this protocol i am older than forty years old i also have been experimenting with these red light panels as a way of addressing other changes in biological tissues for which ism doing blood work et camera and ism going to talk about that in a future episode but that of course is what i call anecdota it only relates to my experience some to day and certainly on all episodes the human land cast we emphasize previewed studies almost exclusively talking about anecdota only when high lighting it as anecdota if you are somebody who wants to explore red light therapy here is what you need to do you need to make sure that that red light source wherever source you happen nones whether not you purchased or make one in fact these red light sources are very very easy to make you could essentially take a bright flash light and cover it with a film or of filter that would only alow particular long wave ling's to pass through this would be very easy to look up on line and figure out how to do this you partly do this for just a few dollars or you could purchase a red light unit if that was ism within your budget and something that yare interested in you want to make sure that it is not bright that your damaging your eye a good rule of thumb is that something is not painful to look at and in fact i should just emphasize that any time you look at any light source sunlight or otherwise that painful it makes you want to squinch or close your eyes that means it is too bright to look at without closing your eyes i have that sort of a a but i would loth to think that any one would harm themselves with bright light in any way i do not you say that to protect us i say that to protect you of course because you are responsible for your health and again retinal anurans do not regenerate once they are gone and dead they do not come back there is no technology to replace them at this current state in time please do not damage your retinas is a red light source safe to look at if it is not painful to look at chances are it is and yet i would still encourage you to talk to your optometrist or opthemologist before getting into any extensive protocols but if you are still determined to pursue the sorts of protocols that are in the jeffrey studies certainly will provide a link to those studies again it involved looking at these red light panels blinking aloud for two minutes to three minutes every morning for a period of two weeks or more and if your older than forty that could very well have an effect if you longer younger than forty excuse me that is unlikely to have an effect at least that was what was observed in these particular studies the lights were not flashing it was continuous illumination again you are allowed to blink it does not after even be direct illumination can be somewhat indirect illumination much as we described for the use of u v b light before the wavelength of light is important it is red light and near i for red light that is going to be affective in this scenario the authors of this study emphasize that it was red light of six hundred and seventy nanometer in wavelength and near in for red light of seven hundred and ninety tanto meters in wavelength that were effective and that those wavelength could be complimentary that is probably wide or maybe it is just coincidental but it is a fortunate coincidence that a lot of the commercially available red light panels that you will find out there combine both red light and near in for red light however i wont emphasize that most of the panels that are commercially available are going to be two bright to safely look at very close up and fact that is why most of those red light panels are designed for illumination of the skin and oftentimes arrive in their packaging with i protectors that her actually design to shield out all the red light take the potential dangers of excessive illumination of the eyes with any wave length of light seriously but if you are going to explore six seventy and seven ninety nanometer light for sake of in enhancing neuronal function set it at a distance that is comfortable to look at and that does not force you to squint or does not make you feel uncomfortable physically as if you need to turn away during the period of that two to three minute illumination each day in terms of turning away from light it'll just briefly mention that that is not and accident or a coincidence that you have that response to very bright light there is a called photic avoidance pathway that involves sells within your retina these ganglia tells that communicate with yet another brain station of certain area of your thalamus that communicate to areas of your brain that areassociate with pain literally that can trigger headache and that can triggerate the squint reflex biology is just beautiful in this way too much light is bad for us and that it can damage our eyes and other aspects of our body if we look at a light that is too bright our eyes send a signal to the brain that gives us a sort of a headache and a desired to squint and turn away that can be a useful guide in terms engaging how bright a light should be or at least how far away you should be from a bright source in order to safely engage with that light source the studies i just described once again involve the use of red light early in the day within three hours of waking and are for the sake of improving neuronal function red light has also been shown to be beneficial l the in the day and even in the middle of the night and when i say middle of the night ism referring to studies that explored the use of red light for shift workers i know that most people are not working in the middle the night at least i hope they are not but some of you may do that from time to time all fighters for studying i confess i still pull all fighters every once and while to prepare things podcast and other did lines really try not to happens less and less as i get older because they think i get more disciplined and or less good at a pulling all fighters but i realize that many people are doing shift work or they have to work certainly past ten pimp may be there taking care of young children in the middle of the night and they have to be up in that case red light can actually be very beneficial and now days there a lot of sources of red light available just as red light bulbs you do not need a panel what am basely saying is that it can be beneficial to use red light at night the study id to emphasize in this context is entitled red light a novel non pharmacological intervention to promote alertness in shift workers beautiful study they explored the use of different ravelings of light blue light of four hundred sixty animators or red light or dim whit light of different brightness is at camera and looked at things light melatonin how much does light of a given color and intensity suppress melatonin they looked at coatis all a stress hormone they looked at wakefulness how much or to what degree could a given color of light increase wakefulness at different hours of the day the take away from this study is very clear if you need to be awake late at night for sake of shift work or studying or taking care of children et camera red light is going to be your best choice because if the red light is sufficiently dim it is not going to inhibit melatonin production and it is not going to increase costs all at night cortex all should be high early in the day or at least to be elevated relative to other times to day if you are healthy a late shifted increasing coatis all however nine him sort is all ten him cornball is well known to be associated with depression and other aspects of mental helthresh is a mental illness if you do need to be awake at night or even all night red light is going to be the preferred light source and in terms of how bright to make it well as dim as you can while still being able to perform the activities that you need to perform that is going to be your best guide it'll provide a link to this study is well aim it is a really important study because it emphasize that there are forms of light red light provided its dim that can allow you to stimulate the alertness that light landing on the eyes can provide the laws you stay awaken to do whatever work that you need to do it does not seem to alter melatonin production that is good it does not seem to alter levels or him of corpus all production yet another case where red light use correctly can be beneficial up in till now were been talking about the effects of shining different ravelings of light on the skin or on our eyes and the downstream health consequences of that illumination however one of the most important goals of science and medicine is to figure out how to change the health of our brain and of course our brain is contained within our skull and therefore we cannot yo shine light on to the outside of our head and expected to change the activity of neurons deep within the brain unless those neurons are linked up with our eyes or with our skin and as it turns out even though there are lot of brain areas that are connected through curl circuits and hormone circuits to our eye and believe are not also to our skin many brain areas are not brain areas such as the hippocampus which is involved in learning and memory brainareas such as ore no cartels well some areas of our neoqortic such as our visual correct our indirectly linked to our eyes if we shine light in our eyes we can change the activity of neurons in turned quarters but there are other brain areas that are not directly or even indirectly connected to our visual system not at least in any immediate way that raises the question of how do you change the activity of neurons in the brain well there is pharmacology you can take pills you can inject drugs that will change the pharmacology of neurons in the way they operate in fire course and to the presents are one such instants a opioid drugs are another a there is a huge array of psychoactive compounds meaning compoundsthat will change the levels of chemicals in your brain some of those work many of them also carry side effects it is all rather indirect meaning you have lots of different cells and differentaries your brain that utilize the and chemicals a drug for instance to increase ceremony and forsake of improving depression will also often have the effect of reducing certain neurons output of ceretonan in the hippocampus and cause changes an appetite changes in libido and on and forth you could imagine using electrical stimulation putting wires into the brain and stimulating specific brain areas in order to activate the neurons in those brain areas and certainly that works and has been done experimentally and is done during euro surgery examines et camera but involves removing a piece of skull o that is not very practical in principle light would be a wonderful way to modulate the activity of neurons deep within the brain but again the skull is in the way recent studies however have figured out ways that light can be delivered to the eyes to change global patterns of firing in the brain in ways that can be beneficial to the brain and the work that on referring to now is mainly the work of leeway size at empty massachusetts institute of technology and her colleagues and what they've discovered is that there is a particular pattern of be rain activity called game activity gam activity is one called wave length of electrical activity in the brain not wavelengths of light but wave lengths of electrical activity in the brain that can be restorative for certain aspects of learning and memory and can actually help create molecular changes in neurons that lead to clearance of debris and even reductions in age related connive decline the way to think about brain waves and brain oscillations is that neurons are electrically active that involves chemicals et camera and they can be active in very slow big wave forms as you can think of yon delta waves meaning you can imagine a wave of electricelectivity that come o long very infrequently a given neuron fires and then some period of time later fires and then some period of time even later fires or you can imagine that that same cell is very active fires fires fires free fires you can imagine its firing very often its going be short wave length right shorter gaps between firing or if its firing very seldom out going to think about that as longer wavering firing turns out that game waves are one pattern of firing that lead to downstream metabolic functions and biological functions that and up clearing away debris that s associated with aging in cells and that also lead to molecular changes that infants the kind of youthfulness of anurans to speak how do we induce game oscillations within the brain well what leeway big and callings have beautifully shown is that by delivering certain patterns of light flicker lights going on and off at a particular frequency the brain as a whole starts to in train meaning it matches to those particular patterns of light flicker even though many of the brain areas that do this are not directly within the visual system are visual pathway the studies that i referred to are several but the one that i to high light is entitled game in trainmen binds higher order brain regions and offers narrow protection what they essentially did was to expose subjects to forty hurts which is a particular frequency of illumination to the eyes its goes on goes off goes on goes off at a frequency of forty hurts and when they did that and they recorded the activity of neurons within the brain not just within the visual areas of the brain but within other airs as well they observed increased game oscillations meaning that the electrical activity of the brain at large started to match to the patterns of light that were delivered to the eyes this is really exciting and very unique from the different types of phototherapies that we been talking about up until now all the patterns of phototherapy that wee been talking about up in till now involved constant illumination with a given wave length here it is wave length generating patterns of illumination light on light off lie on high off at a particular frequency what they found for instance using this pattern of stimulation and by the way the stimulation was called genus game in trainmen using sensory stimulation g e and u agama in trainmen using century stimulation had a number of really interesting effects first of all it reduced called amyloid places and phosphorelated tow milord places and phosphoralated tow are associate with claimers and normal age related cognate decline this is incredible right a pattern of flashing light delivered to the eyes creates a pattern of national firing noxious in the visual areas of the brain but in other airs of the brain as well that in turn trigger molecular pathways that reduce some of the markers and the cause of age related cognac decline and claimers and in parallel to that they observed an regulation of some of the biological pathways that lead to enhancement of neuronal function maintenance of synapses which are the connections between neurons and on and on they have discovered and lists out a huge number of these bought biological effects both the reduction in bad things to speak and the improvement in good biological pathways and i find these studies exciting because first of all their non invasive right there is no drilling through the skull they are very tractable in the experimental sense meaning that you can imagine that if forty hurt stimulation turns out to be the very best stimulation protocalld to induce these game oscillations well great but because it is non invasive its fairly easy to explore if the hurt stimulation hundred hurt stimulation twenty hurt stimulation and to do that with different wave lengths of light and that is what is happening now the slab and other labs are really starting to explore the full range of variables that can impact oscillations within the brain and their downstream consequences again this is phototherapy but phototherapy be very different sort that we ben talking about up until now its phototherapy designed to trigger activation of biological pathways far away from the very tissue that being illuminated and it calls to mind the same sorts of mechanisms that we were talking about earlier where illumination of the skin with u v v light is setting off an enormous number of different cascades in different organs and tissues including the spleen the testes the ovaries and on again light has these powerful effects both locally on the cells that the light is delivered to but also systemically in terms of the cells that are changing their electrical and chemical outputs are modifying lots and lots of biological programs is there an actionable tool related to these studies yet well that sorter depends on how adventures you are right now these studies are being explored in the contacts of clinical trials in people with chimers de each and other forms of nonoily generation is it dangerous to look at a forty hurts flickering light well in general the answer is going to be no however if your prone to epilepsy for instance staring at a flickering light of a given continuous frequency can induce seizure right that might surprise some of you but it should not because as this study illustrates and is anyone who is ever been out at night to a club or something illustrates when you look at a strobe light for instance your whole world of visual perception changes but actually the rhythm at which you perceive music at which you perched conversation at which you perceive the movement of your body actually changes according to the patterns of visual flicker in most cases strobe if were using the sort of club dancing example your brain is in training to its outside environment given the power of flickering lights to in train brain rhythms i think at this stage its probably two preliminary to really suggest a specific protocol but i would deny keep an eye out for these sorts of studies they are coming out all the time and i think in a very short period we are going to see specific protocols that one could potentially use even at home and of course these are non invasive protocols in order to place the brain into a particular state notjust forsake of offsetting our degeneration but also for enhancing focus for enhancing the transition into sleep and other brain states as well to day i covered what i would say is a lot of information my goal was to give you an understanding of how light can be used to change the activities of cells organs within tho cells entire organs and how that can happen locally and systemically you talked about the power of light to impact are biology at the endocrine level neurons level a man level mood et camera through both illumination of the eyes and the skin and other tissues as well i realize that even though this was a lot of information there many aspects of phototherapy that i did not cover i know there is a lot of interests nowadays for instance in the use of red light and other wavelength light therapies for ovarian health and testicular health in fact i get a lot of questions such as can red light be used to improve testosterone output and if is that best accomplish by shining red light on the skin or directly on the goats on the testicles ism going to cover those data at a future time right now the studies that have been done in rodent i do not think are easily enough translated to humans and the studies that are happening in humans now are exciting in the sense that they hold a lot of potential but the data are not clear yet however the data using up be on the skin of men and women in order to increase hormone in particular test strong an estrogen ow put those data i think are very exciting and very actionable we talked about those earlier if you want more information on how phototherapy can be used certainly we will do

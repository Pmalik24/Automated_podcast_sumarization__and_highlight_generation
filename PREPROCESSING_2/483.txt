welcome to the superman japonicas science science face to s for ism andrhubermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring you zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of date and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if fore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic restock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element t do am slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element e licente dotcalm slash superman this episode marks the beginning of a new topic for the superman labor cast as many of you already know we go deep into a particular topic over for sometimes even five episodes we just closed out the episodes on hormones now we are going to talk about how to optimize physical performance and skill learning we are going to look deep at the science behind this as well as specific practices in fact today you are going to hear about specific tools that you can use to improve endurance and strength by up to ism not making this up three or four times your current capacity this is based on studies that were done at stamford and are currently in use by collegiate and professional teams if you are not a professional athlete or a serious athlete that is o k the topics this month and all the information we are going to cover are going to make you a better recreational exercise or as well if you are not an exercise dog our thinking about getting into that or if you live in the northern hemisphere and your just thinking about the beach this summer or fat lost muscle building that sort of thing this month we are going to cover all of that as well there is much confusion out there about how to optimize fat lost muscle building improvements in flexibility for instance or skill learning i know many of you are not focus on the cosmetic aspects of physical exercise but are interested n actual skill learning we are going to talk about that to i wanted just take us moment to reflect on something that came up last episode if you did not see that episode that is quite all right but last episode we were talking about the hormones a adrenalin and cortical and how to leverage those towards attention and learning and there was a little bit of confusion that i want to clarify i mentioned an optimal protocol for learning that involved leveraging a adrenalin also called epineferen and it involved four steps the four steps that i spelled out were to be calm and focus while one is trying to acquire or learn the new skill connive skill or motor skill then to have a spike in a adrenalin i mention ways to do that using cold or breathing or other tools immediately after the learning episode then to incorporate what i call nonslip deep least a twenty minute episode of a shallow nap or some other protocol amnesty are non sleep redbreast protocol of which we always provide lynx in the captions and then to try an optimize sleep later that night and the subsequent night some of you heard this and it a sunk in right away and it was straightforward others said weight i thought from a previous episode even before that you said you are spoke to do nonslip deep least immediately after learning no we added another step a the logic still follows that you want to be calm and focus during learning then you want a spike a adrenaline at the end most people get that backward they are drinking too much coffee or even taking neurotics and things trying to be really focus while learning some people are taking at er all recreational something i do not recommend that is i should getting the who process backwards if you look at the data n the physiology you want a spike a deadline at the end or immediately after a learning episode and then non sleep deep least and then sleep itself k for steps hope that clarifies things for you if you have any additional questions please put them in the comment section below oka let us talk about physical performance there are many variables to physical performance and we can manage physical performance and skill learning from a variety of contacts i made just a short list of some of the things that come to mind that can powerfully impact physical performance and skill learning some of them are what i would consider foundational they allow you to show up with your current ability and if you were to destruct those you would perform less well things getting a good night sleep things being properly hydrated things being well nourished whatever that means to you i know some of you to exercise fasted some of you prefer to have food a in your stomach or have eaten he couple hours before there are supplements there are drugs there are different ways to breathe there are many tools related to mind set visualization there are machines and devices it is just a vast space but it is not infinite and there are few things in the list of things that can impact and even optimized physical performance and skill learning that have an outsized effect that any of you can use many of them most of them are low to zero cost to day we are going to focus on what i believe to be one of the most powerful tools to improve physical performance and skill learning end recovery well talk about about we that is important and that is temperature many of you might think ho that is kind of boring i want to know about the magic pill that i can take that is can allow me a duncabascabalifi currently cannot or i want to know about the thing that is can let me run further and faster can a shed fat believe it are not temperature is the most powerful variable for improving physical performance end for recovery i would argue it is even more important than sleep because temperature itself is going to dictate how well and when you sleep and the depth of your total recovery there are two aspects to temperature of course there is heat and there is cold we are mainly going to focus on cold as a way to buffer heat and a previous podcast episode i talked all about growth hormone you can find that episode about fibroid and growthormone and how heat can be a powerful stimulus for increasing growth hormone which is involved in tissue repair and et camera can burn fat and improve metabolism in various ways however cold i would argue is even more powerful than heat as a tool and ism not just talking about putting ice packs on sore muscles or slightly sprained limbs and ankles and things of that sort we are going to talk about cold from the standpoint of thermal physiology this is a literature that rich in scientific information that goes back very deep into the last century where physiologists and burro scientists figured out that there are different compartments in your body that heat and cool you differently and that you can leverage those in order to double and as theme before even triple or quadruple your work output both strength repetitions and endurance this is not weak sauces that they say this is the stuff that can really shift the needle quite a bit and it is not just about performing well wont it is about being able to perform well and recover from that performance that you do even better when you are not incorporating these tools on days were for instance you cannot access cold or an ice pack or an ice bath or things of that sort k we are on to cover cold or can talk a little bit about the physiology of cold and heat and how they work because as you probably heard me say before if you can understand some mechanism if you just push yourself through a little bit of new knowledge into understanding a little bit of mechanism about how you work you will be in a far better position to implement the tools in the best and most flexible ways for your needs this is why at the superman lad podcast i never ever do a just list of the things that you should do i do not believe in that just tell me what to do first i tell you why you should do something what is the logical framework that it is grounded in and then we distill that down to specific protocols for those of either are too impatient for that there are millions if not billions of other resources out there that will take you into the coldosack of one photo call that will work and then stop working or might work for you indefinitely that is not how we work here this is about really understanding the mechanism that you can tweak things and modify things i just the timing in the dosage of things and really get the most out of these tools and protocols everything ism going to talk about pertains to both in durance exercise and strength and speed type exercise spring straight lifting endurance work and to some extent flexibility but we are going to cover flexibility in depth as well as another feature that is not often talked about which is suppleness or smoothness of movement over different ranges of movement in a subsequent episode let us start by talking about temperature what is temperature how does temperature impact the body and its ability to perform including learn new skills everyone probably remembers or is at least heard of the word homeostasis i that the body wants to remain in a particular range of temperatures that it does not to be too hot or too cold and i want to emphasize from the outset that there are many mechanisms that are installed into us by way of our evolutionary desire and our gene meaning meaning we were just born with the stuff ready to keep our body temperature in a particular narrow range heating up too much is just plain bad it is not just bad for physical performance it is bad for all tissue health if your brain heats up too much neuron start dying and those neurons do not come back case you may have heard about autogenesis the ability for the brain to regenerate itself for generate new neurons in adulthood there is very little nerogenerate nerogenesexcuse me in adulthood even alterant time after purity really and you do not want to lose neurons in the central nervous system if you get too hot thati'll happen it called hyperthermia you want avoid hyperthermia and you have many mechanisms that are built into you to avoid becoming hyper thermic the other thing that happens when we get too warm is that we have in all of our cells what are called enzymes you generally know if somethings an enzyme because it ends in the letters a s e right lipase is an enzyme that exist to digest fats you have proteases that are there to digest prolines right any time you see a s e chances are it is an engine enzymes or prolines and they have a particular structure and their structure becomes modified when heat increases and that is not good you want their structure to be of a particular type imagine a car with for wheels let you say the car is the engine if it gets too hot it is too of the wheels fall off and that thin cannot function one of the reasons why the body and nature goes through much effort to build in mechanisms to make sure that we do not become too warm is because when we get too warm t these enzymes do not function sells stop functioning they stop being able to generate energy they stop being able to digest things you stop being able to think end eventually those sell start dying off entirely keeping temperature in a particular range is really good you do not want to get too hot we have much more flexibility in terms of getting cold now you do not want to become hypothermic either you can die from hypothermia just you can die from hyperthermia however that you have a lot more range to be cold than you do to be too warm and in general the idea is to keep the body and bran in a particular range but any time we do anything our body temperature can shift for instance if you were to stand next to a camp fire or you are outside on a hot day various things would happen to dump heat f from your body if you were outside on a cold day or you were get into a cold shower or cold lake various things would happen to insulate heat within your body this is all pretty straight forward in obvious i realize now what are those things well there are a huge category of them when you get into cold water you secrete a adrenaline on a hot day if it is really hot or in a very hot sand or in the hot desert you will generate what are called heat shock propenes will which will set off other sets of cascades metabolic cascades by logical cascades but the simplest way to think about this process is that when we get cold we tend to azo constrict we tend our blood vessels tend to constrict and we tend to push energy toward the core of our body to preserve our core organs c our periphery our hands an our feat in our toes and our legs become colder and our core therefore can maintain blood to that area and we are insulating our core conversely when we heat up our blood vessels azo dilate they expand a bit and more blood flows to our periphery and more blood can move throughout the body generally and we will perspire we will sweat water will actually get pulled out of the blood to some extent moved up through sweat glands and will be brought to the skin surface that it can be dumped we are dumping heat animals as vary in their capacity to sweat some animals camels will not start sweating at first if they heat up what they'll do as they will spit they will dump heat by spitting cite dogs pant costly is off to my left airy pants when he gets too warm he cannot sweat or dogs can may be sweat a little bit but we can sweat and you have probably noticed that on a humid hot day you will feel much warmer just walking or running than you would with the equivalent exercise or movement that you would on a cold day and some of you probably know this but if you do not the reason is you sweat on a cold day but because the air is dry typically you will bring that sweat to the surface and provided your wearing clothes that alow some air to get out away from the bodies you are not wearing you now really tight spandacks tight clothing or something that er or you seal tight surra rap type clothing that sweat will evaporate off into the dry atmosphere whereas it on a humid day the reason you see people and tuna new york and for id on a humid summer day an they moving their shirts off themselves an you see people with big sweat stands an back sweat stands in all this kind of stuff is because their sweating as they normally would but it is humid and there is the humidity air does not allow transfer of that sweat into the atmosphere is readily and your hot oke without the evaporation your going to be warmer we have evaporate off sweat we sweat and we vara dilate when we want to dump heat when we want a maintain heat we vast constrict and we tend to not sweat the other thing that happens is you will get goose bumps called goose pimples they are sometimes called those are a throwback to the time where we had fur over most not all of our body all mama's in the cold have a process whereby a adrenaline is released at low levels typically into the body that a adrenalin activates what are called sympathetic fires they have nothing to do with sympathy those little fires which are neurons those fires that t what ism saying our fires are turn not clothing fibers reach up into the skin your whole body is covered with these little tiny neurons that reach up into the skin and when we are cold they actually mechanically take the hair logical and bend it up its some it is a process called pilot erection p i l o erection oke on a hot day you want to dump heat a on a hot day what would happen is you would actually not see those goose pimples because you want the hairs lying down which actually you think that might insulate you more but would actually let more heat dissipate out through the skin on a cold day you get these goose pimples are goose bumps which are really just an ancient carry over from the bodies attempt to make hairs stand up on end and when hairstep stand up on end in their very close together that traps air in between them and actually creates a sort of insulated blanket a warm air if you have ever seen an animal a a a malamute or a a husky you might think all that poor thing on a hot day what does it do and with all that hair well it can be warm that animal will typically pant and its hair will lay down which you might think would act as more of a blanket but on a cold day what will happen is there they will become very puffy they will their hair will stand up on end and that is actually trapping heat between the hairs and their actually quite well insulated it is very important that if you want to understand how you can leverage temperature for physical performance you have to understand that you have nasal constriction to conceive heat vase a dilation to dump heat that you have sweating to dump heat and you have conservation of fluids in order to preserve heat that is the most important thing in terms of understanding the mechanisms of maintaining and dumping heat and now the most important thing to understand is that if you get too hot not only to those enzyme stop working but your ability to contract your muscles stops oke ism n a repeat this because it is vitally important i t p is involved in the process of generating muscle contractions does not matter if your running a marathon does not matter tough doing a yoga class does not matter if you are going for a seven hundred pound squat the range of temperatures within which high t p con function and muscles can contract is very narrow somewhere round thirty nine or forty degrees serious it drops off and you will not be able to generate more contractions notes pretty hot but it that temperature can degenerate locally really fast now if you are too cold it is true it is hard to generate muscle contractions i got into doing some cold water swimming little while ago and we would joke that you come out of the water we do none wet suits i not recommending people do this necessarily unless your wit certainly with somebody else who skilled it doing it which i was you come out and you feel you have claws for hands you can you could never text on a phone for the first few minutes in the water was very very cold and you cannot remove your face and muscles will become rigid but heating up muscles causes them to fail to be able to generate more contractions put simply if you get too hot you stop exercising you may not even realize it but your will to exercise further you are ability to push harder is entirely dependent on the heat of the muscle both locally and your whole system let us talk about your whole system because i just describe heat dumping and heat maintaining i told you that increasing heat makes it hard for muscles to contract it will stop you from being able to run further and faster it will stop you from being able to lift more weights more sets more repetitions if you can heap temperature in range however in a proper range you will be able to do more work you will be able to create greater output you will be able to lift more weight more sets more wraps and you will be able to run further now there are data that i am going to talk about in a little bit that are absolutely striking that under score that statement they are data from my cole craghellers lab in the department of biology at stamford and there are data that are now being implemented there we first implemented o in a grant funded by dark but now in professional sport steams many if not all the enofelteams are now using this technology as well as military uses it and not just for sports performance but also fire fighters construction workers other professions where elevated heat becomes a barrier to performance and you can leverage this to really improve you are work out when i say really improve it is striking i met give away a little hint of this now and then o m en i tell you bit more of the data later after i tell you the protocols proper cooling of the body which has to be done in a very specific way has a lowed recreational athletes a college students and typical adults as well as professional athletes to go from doing their usual output in this case that hat what comes to mind best would be a particular a professional athletes admit we the forty nine or at the time was table do forty dips on its first set thirty twenty twenty busy to ten sets of dips unassisted with anything else that is the impressive o impressive especially since he of really la age my forty disses is a respectable these are strict full arrange dips and then by the tenth set there is a steep drop off using proper cooling of particular body compartments he was able to triple that within less than a week and maintain that performance even without the cooling approach it was actually a conditioning effect right it'll get back to the can't a little bit but there are other fantastic leaps of of a effort and leaps of performance that were demonstrated including endurance running before i continue any further i just want a under score again that overheating is terrible there is a famous example of this a this was about ten fifteen years ago when a number of dietary supplements that included things epinephrin which is a stimulant it is a data it batadernergic stimulant a drugs lembeauter all which were then band from the olympics which are still out there a been in recreational use which were data adronergic agonists of these are drugs that sort of mimic apaneferan a drentleine to some extent i i know m over simplifying this here they improve flat loss because the effects on metabolism but they heat up the body and what happen was this hit the press or widely is is high schoolfootball players and various professional athletes were dropping dead because they were overheating during practise or in competition much that clembutare all was band although everyone in a while somebody gets in trouble for using this a this there was an instance of this recently in professional boxing which was attributed to a bad meat that that contained the columbite r all i do not know what the force was a a i do not have any commentary about that but it still is in use but these drugs increase body temperature increase fat loss but carry a severe danger and that is the danger of hyperthermia in fact i would argue and i think in talkinisam folks a at i various professional fighting organizations it is very clear that a lot of the depths that one sees in professional combat sports may have to do as much with dehydration and overheating as it does with getting hit in the head which is e all bad but the things can compound they can have a synergistic effect and just a note about that and hyperthermia its dangers as well my first project ever in science was to a valuate the thermogenic effects of emdiama of ecstasy that was my a senior thesis in college actually and thermos what we found was that indeed drugs that remove your understanding of how warm you are cause you to not take on the appropriate behaviors to cool yourself right your they a constriction and your sweating those are autonomic those are going to happen no matter what unless you happen to take something that blocks that effect however the lot of things that we as humans do to prevent ourselves from overheating and the main one is stop when we are running in the d desert or when we are running very hard and suddenly we stop often times that is because the muscles are overheating it is a subconscious thing we will not often thing ah ism really much too warm it is just that we stop and it is a self preservation mechanisms sometimes it kicks in too early sometimes it kicked too late kicks too late you can die there is an instance in the nineteen eighty four olympics where the that was the first year i believe that there were a there is a woman's marathon i think that is correct and one of the front runners or a top picks for winning was heading into the stadium and all a sudden it seemed as if she was lost she was kind of wandering around not knowing where she should go and in fact she was in a position to win or at least take second place at least take silver got totally disoriented and did miserably in the race and she was hypothermic show running against that reflects to stop dumping heat is eat how do you dump heat in order to perform longer safely well in order to understand that you heft understand that the body has three main compartments for regulating temperature o it we do not just have a center and a periphery we have three main compartments and there one compartment in particular that all of you or most all of you i have to assume have and if you can understand how that works you can do tremendous things for your performance and for your recovery what ism about to tell you will allow you to perform better in all forms of exercise and it is not commonly known unfortunately ism here to try and change that you have three compartments for increasing or dumping heat in your body one is your core we already talked about that your core organs your heart your longs your o cankerous your liver the core of your body the other is your periphery which are obviously your arms in your legs in your feet in your hands but then there is a third component which is their three locations on your body that a far better at passing heat out of the body and bringing cool into the body such that you can heat up or cool your body everywhere very quickly those three areas are your face the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feat now the skin on your hands and on the bottoms of your feet and to some extent on your face are called glamorous skin that is g l a b o are o you as glamorous skin and what special about those areas of your body and the glamorous skin is that the arrangement of musculature a blood vessels capillaries and arteries that serve those regions is very different than it is elsewhere in your body now this has ancient roots typically if you were another mammal a bear or some sort of a you would have h air all over your body now we all know some pretty hairy people or presume you haveheard that there are these hairy people i know a few excessively hairy people castellan excessively hairy bud he is not a person obviously but all camels have hair on their bodies u somepeople have very light hair or very fine hair we do not have hair on these glamorous skin regions now of course you can have beard or facia hair growth but there still regions the cheeks and other areas that maintain the special musculature of selectively the hands and feet are real labor skin an the face is not always quite classified as glamorous but these three locations face want palms of hands not tops and bottoms of feet are very good at dumping meet and bringing in cool and the reason is there is a rule and vascular biology that blood moves from arteries to capillaries and then to veins and then back to the heart arteries which are the big ones obviously calories which the little fine ones where oxygen and carbondoxide are exchanged and tens which then bring blood back to the heart and other tissues of course in these three regions of your hands your face and the bottoms of your feet we have what are called a v as a vas are of varies special pattern of musculature a via are described in the medical text books you can find them in grays and atomy not the television show but the actual grays and atomy text book which is a real thing that exists and in all medical text books of let us talk about a via and what they are and why they allow these three regions of the body to heat or cool a selves more readily what are a v as a via are are turbo venous stenoses if you want to look that up you can just look up a via veins copulates arteries if you but all spell it for you a r t e are i o are turbo venue we e n o u s a trio venue anastomoses a n a s t o m o s e s are trio venous stenoses you want to know about arteriovenous astemosies trust me and you want to remember that they are in your hands the bottoms of your feet and on your face and in particular on the palms of your hands not the tops of your hands now before i said blood flows typically from arteries to copulates to veins and then back to the heart but a via are direct connections between the small arteries and the small veins they by pass the calories to some extent there little short vessel segments they have a big large inner diameter and they have his very thick muscular wall and they get in put from what are called agenerge morons they get in put from neurons that release nor upinefferent an pin effort which allows them to contract or dilate now there some rule of physics that talk about how the radius of a pipe and small changes in the radius of a pipe leads to massive increases in the rate and a mount of stuff that can flow through that pipe of it is a rule of physics that says essentially that a the radius is a proportional to the amount of stuff that can flow through something to the fourth power when i can ting tot make this a physic's class but if you want to look that up you can you can just look up how does the radius of a tube or pipe relate to how quickly or how much it can it stuff can flow through it what you need to know even if you do not want to know any of the underlying physics is that these navies allow more heat to leave the body more quickly and more cool to enter the body more quickly then other venous are trial capillary beds throughout the body in other words you can heat up best at the face the palms and the bottoms of the feet and you can cool down best at the face the palms and the bottoms the feet than you can anywhere else on your body when i say heat up or cool down i mean actually heat or cool the core end your brain of this is vitally important i realize we are getting down into the mechanistic weeds here but you need to know that these three compartments of your body palms bottoms of feet and face or your best leverage points for manipulating temperature to vastly improve physical performance o k i also want to point out that the work that i am going to tell you about is not work from my laboratory it is the work of as i mention my college crag hellers laboratory at stamford and we are going to have dragon as a guest to talk more about these discoveries they are his and his colleagues discoveries and how you can leverage them there building out some amazing technology i had a conversation with crag yesterday as a prelude to this episode end to the future conversation with him you are getting the very latest on historic what crag an his colleagues did really illustrates perfectly what these body surfaces can do and why they were studying over heating in athletes and in military and in construction workers and trying to prevent it and they did a bunch of experiments i will not go into all of them now but wat they essentially found was that cooling the palms palmer cooling aloud people athletes and recreational athletes to run much further to lift more weight and to do more sets in raps to a absolutely staggering degree let us talk for a sect n a bit more about we we stop why we shut off effort when we get too hot because in doing you will really understand how and why the best protocols exist for being able to do more work to be able to exercise longer and actually to feel good doing it you actually can make a doubling of your dips or believe it or not a tripling or quadrupling or more of your pull ups fairly straight forward i mention before that when muscle heats up enzymes start getting disrupted and eight p and muscles cannot work well and those muscles cannot contract bet's get a little more specific about that the enzyme that is involved here is something called private kinas you do not need to know about private kinas but what you do need to know is that it ends a c which means it is an ends me and private minas is essentially a rate limiting step it is a critical step that you cannot by pass if you want muscles to contract and it is very temperature sensitive therefore if you can keep temperature lower you can do more work per unit time you can do more pull ups and that actual is done by crag and his cole excuse me the pull ups were not actually done by crag i do not no how many pullups crag can you all ask him next time both cooled and uncooked how many pullups he can do but but the essentiallytid is they brought some one into their laboratory who could do ten pull ups on the first set and they were able to get ten rest two or three minutes get another ten rest two or three minutes and if you have ever tried this what you find is the you start dropping to eight seven six et camera now the person might not necessarily feel their over heating but the muscle is heating up then with their knowledge that these a v as that these that these portals in the palms are a great way to both heat the body but also to dump heat from the body they use the device and it'll talk about what you can do at home but a device where they had people hold on to what was essentially a cold tube now this is crucial the tube cannot be cold that it causes vast constriction because then the cold will not pass from the to to the hand and to the core but if it is the right temperature it is neither too hot nor too cold that cool from the cold tube passes into the hand these local palmer regions and then cools the core and in theory by lowering body temperature would allow the person or the athlete to do more work and indeed that is what they saw the actual data the specific data showed that subjects could do least the subjects they worked with on their first day with no cooling about a hundred pull ups across the this the very the time frame the they had of it might have taken anywhere from ten to fifteen or may be more sets depending on how skilled that person was but in a fixed amount of time then they came back and did the cooling they did it the very next day which if you have ever trained a muscle the very next day typically you would not do swell in its training if it took any damage from the previous sessions or you at least do swell but you probably would not do what they then observed which was they started cooling after every other set the person would just hold the cold tube cool down the body after every other set last everything else was kept the same and they found that they went to a hundred and eighty pullups which is incredible to near doubling and by doing this repeatedly over several sessions over several weeks they quickly went in the cooling group from a maximum of somewhere between a under and eighty and two hundred as i recall us for o estimating now to six hundred pullups in the equivalent amount of time which is absolutely incredible they then repeated this in a study on the bench press and actually the bench press study was pretty interesting because they actually had a control group that was admittedly taking specific amounts of anabolic steroids the anabaxteroid was testosterinsipiona which is essentially testastron and indeed the testosteroncipunate the steroid group improved at a rate of about one per cent per week inwards difference there were differences and the cooling group basically left all other groups in the dust it was just remarkable cooling the for i wont be very clear that it is not cooling the muscle was not at cooling the chest alone or just cooling the palms it was about allowing could to pass through the palms because of the unique vascular musculature that is the are these a via allowed these subjects to do far more work per unit time and the important thing is that if they were to come back after doing six hundred pullups or five hundred pullups you might say shall while that is on a create a situation where recovery is going to be absolutely impossible they could come back not used the cooling and they still saw a highly significant increase in the amount or the number of pulls or dips or bench press weight that they could do what that went is that it was both a excellent performance end in excellent training stimulus that they were able to recover from of i soft know if all of your following this but these are the sorts of increases in in exercise output that are absolutely staggering and that is why professional teams and the military and others capitalized on them very quickly and use these of now you may be asking what about insurance right not everyone wants to be able to bench press a lot for multiple reps and sets and i should just mention for the bench pressing it was i believe they were they found people that could bench press two twenty five that is two forty five pound plates on the forty five pound standard olympic bar for repetitions of anywhere from six to t en and then they have them do the same thing they i at set they rest two or three minutes sometimes up to four minutes than do another set repeat repeat repeat and with cooling they were able to increase the amount of work the number of rests with the same wight sometimes they did have to increase sets to approximately double soh pretty fantastic with endurance similar increases have been shown and the way that they would do those tests are a little but different and they also point to a really important mechanism of why we stop doing work at all when we perceive that we are putting in too much effort e gets right to the heart of the relationship between temperature in muscle and your will power those are directly related your body heat in your will power are linked in a physiological way some not talking about the kind of stuff that you see is kind elect click bate on the inner better increase will power now or become resilient now or never do this again if you want to be mentally strong ism talking about a physiological mechanism that exists in the body and brain that causes you to stop or that will allow you to continue to go harder and further than you normally would o was let us talk about will power and heat and how heat shuts you down in other words if you are cool if your body temperature is in a particular range not only can you go further but you will go further if you want to said differently if you heat up too much you will stop or you will die typically people stop there are individuals who will push to the point where they black out and die in the same way that and please do not do this experiment there are people who can sit down face to face and say let us hold our breath and whoever breathes first loses some people will just go until it is painful and then they will gasp and take a big breath there always those individuals who can override that reflex and they will go until they pass out and if you do that in water you can very easily die please do not do that experiment but there is a reflex that relates the body to the brain and the brain to the body that shuts off our effort when we get to hot what crew in this colleagues and now others have done is to do a test in the laboratory where rather than ask people to run outside until they absolutely do not want a run any more you put them on a treadmill and you set the speed they have to keep up with the treadmill and at some point they quit and you take groups and you do those in different temperature environments some people are running in a nice chilly laboratory they get their heart race up the may be their tartrate goes from forty or fifty base line tartrate may they gets up to eighty or a hundred and then they keep the rate of the treadmill going the same and they will just plateau they aren't into a steady state cadets a rhythm in their heart is beating at more or less a steady state eventually the by stop to they have something else to do but people will continue at that temperature and at that heart rate unless you start turning up the temperature in the room and it some point they will stop and they will stop much earlier when it gets hot because of something call cardiac drift k let say ism running and ism running at a steady cadence on this tread mill and my heart rate is eighty five beats permit or a hundred beats permit does not at let say a hundred just for sake of example well just making the room hotter is going to increase my heart rate further even though ism at the same output and the brain does a computation it is somehow figures out that there is a heat component that is increasing heart rate and there is an effort component from running that is driving heart rate and if the heat component and the and the heart rate output from the effort get to hit a certain threshold i stop k and some of you may think well there people who just run and run and run and never stop eventually every one stops maybe it is because the race ended may be it is because ah everyone else quit shall saw some stuff on line there these races where people just will continuously do the same loop until everyone else drops out and then one guy or gal keeps going and past everybody but typically it stops because the race is over or because people quit increasing temperature increases the rate of quitting in part not entirely but impart because of this thing call cardiac drift which you have probably experienced if you have been out on a hot day and your walking up hill you might stop to take a breath if you sit in a sand your heart rate will increase heat increases heart rate effort increases heart rate at a steady effort you will have a steady heart rate if you increase the heat in the environment that your engaging in that steady heart rate your heart ate will now go up do to cardiac drift and you will quit ki hollering colleagues have done experiments where they do palmer cooling under these environments and that is wonderful because not only does it enable people to go further and faster for much longer that is been shown statistically significant every time but it also protects the brain and body against hypothermia over heating coma nerve injury nerve death and actual death cause you can see why this is such a a valuable tool what are they doing well in this case too there having them cool their hands and they are cooling the palms fooling the bombs the feet is a little trickier but cooling the face could actually work as wellingword and talk about cooling the face and having corporate this at this point have just want really wanted to a impress upon you not impress you but impress upon you the fact that you have these three surfaces of your body that are very good at passing cold into the body such that it cools the u r body temperature and that is a good thing for health and safety and in order to maintain work output over longer periods of time or actuates do more work me to me the result is just staggering is the hundred to a under and eighty pull ups in the controls and then six hundred pullups in the cooled individuals right they actually also feel mentally as if they can do more work it is not just that they can there will power is adjusted somehow by these shifts in temperature now before we continue and get to the exact ways that any number of us can start to use this information and one talk about the opposite thing which is heating and we have to remember that these surfaces the palms in the bottoms of the feet in the face we are not just arrange with these alias the special ow ways to pass blood from arteries to veins in order to cool us for better athletic performance or to heat us a for on cold days but for both of those things now hollering colleagues and others have also explored how they these can be used to heat up the corpse there are times when we want to heat up our core typically we hear that most of the heat escapes through our heads will put on a hat when we go outside that is actually not true most of your heat escapes through your face the palms of your hands and the bottoms of your feet now you should know why that is the case what this means is that for postsurgery patients or for people that are hypo thermic indeed you want to heat the core right but actually i was on on swim recently where a friend became hypothermic he was kind of om luring his words and con a staggering round when we got him back on the beach we brought him over to the lifeguard station he turned out to be fine again this is why cold water swims or somethingthat you really need do in groups not alone and you really have to know what you are doing there were reasons for why this happened that day but we were basically people thought were little strange until they realize what what was happening we are walking down the beach basically sandwiching him between at our chest because we were still warmer than that than the ambient environment the environment around us we are pushing our our chests against him to try and warm him up to warm up his core in retrospect that was the wrong thing to do in talking with dragon on talking to other colleagues that work on the a thermogenesis a what we should have done was warm hit the palms of his hands the bottoms of his feet and his face because that would insulate the heat loss now he was very cold presumably there was vast constriction of the veins that these locations a and it is not clear that that would have been the only strategy to use but they have explored how to heat up postsurgery patients and one of the best ways to do that is to get warm socks on the bottoms of the feat get gloves on the hands and if it can be done safely to warm the face now of course you do not want to obstruct respiration and things of that sort but again the ability to pass heat into the body or to remove heat to the body is best done through these three surfaces i cannot emphasize that enough i mention before that you want to cool the palms or the bottoms of the feet although that is lo harder do or the face but not much that the blood vessels constrict because then you will not be able to pass cool into the body because those pipes got smaller and therefore you cannot pass cool into the body how can you start to incorporate this well crag and colleagues have a company that they have a spun out through stamford i will talk about that when we sit down with credit that has gene has made engineer devices that are optimal for this that are going to keep those a passage is a open keep the size of the those veins correct to pass cool into the body quickly for sake of a let sports performance and even recreational sports performance but you can actually start to incorporate this first of all i always get asked how cold should the water be should it be ice water should it be very cold water the answer is no if you want to experience some of this effect without a device one thing you could do would be for instance to do illume that the the him or the treadmill as an example you could do your maximum number of pullups stop and then you could actually put your hands into or on the surface of a sink that is presumably stopped up with cool water not ice water not freezing cold but cool water slightly cooler then body temperature before you started training would be a good place to start you do that for ten to thirty seconds then you could go back and do your next set you would repeat the cooling you would want to extend the amount of cooling somewhats you might want to do that for thirty seconds to a minute this is not going to be perfect you are going to have to play with how cold to make it in order to get the optimal effect but you ought to see an effect none the less the same is true if you're running and your fatiguing obviously you do not want to become hypothermic cooling the hands or the bottoms of your feet or the face would be the ideal way to dump heat in order to be able to generate more output now the face is something that we have not talked a lot about everything have told you up until now also says that if you are somebody who tends to get cold when you are outside say in the winter or even in the fall you tend to run cold warming your face is going to be the most important thing that you can do now it is unheard to do that without looking strains wearing a a schemas or something that but that is going to be more effective then covering and warming any other party your body although it be quite strange if you only had a schemas on an you aren't wherein clothes anywhere else on your body i do not recommend doing that outside that will get you into all sorts of other kinds of trouble would be good for anybody but now you understand the principle and the locations at which to deliver he in cold let us say that you are out for a run and you want to incorporate this cooling mechanism i talk to crag about this i said what would be the kind of a a poor persons approach to this before this device is a commercially availbhen he said well you you could take a a frozen a juice can if you have one of those who are a very cold can of soda and you would want a pass it back and forth between your two hands the reason the passing back and forth is really important is because you again you do not want to be cold that you constrict those venous mortals that will allow cold to go into the body now there are certainly people that are working on by handles and that can actually cool the hands you can expect with the olympics coming up people are aware of these data and are trying to incorporate into a number of things here is what you do not want to do and therefore sports teams that i will not mention by name or brand that have made this mistake and it cost them dearly you do not want to cool the core if you want to cool the body right if it is a very hot day and you are going to train getting into an ice bath first sure it will it will cool you down but that is not kin to be as effective as cooling the palms the bottoms of the feet and the face i have a friend who does some important a work in this space with people in various a let us you say cultures where heat is generated quite a lot they need to dump heat ice packs deliver to the face are something that they actually use in order to dump meet quickly now again you do not want to keep the ice pack on your face these are people that are very high work output right fire fighters and and similar at very high work output and then they will put this century its it is a cool face mask on their face it willow their corody temperature come down and then they remove it they are not keeping it on their long that they're getting the vase of constriction as to their number ways that you could do this and again ism not giving specific temperatures because it depends on how hot that day and how hot your body temperature is you can see why there is a need to create more devices for this but you cain see a a considerable improvement in endurance in straight and in all kinds of explosive any sort of explosive power type output in athletics by using the surfaces of the hands and and bottoms of the feet and face the one that have tried because in anticipation of this episode was the dips where the i would cool my hands i should decide to cool the bottoms of my feet as well beat it just feels good and is particularly hot out lately no shoes are socks on put my feet into a the bottoms of my feet just kind of hovering about a centimeter two below the surface of a bucket of water that was just slightly it felt cool slightly cooler than a body temperature or just basely what came out of the spigot after i let it run for lot bit and indeed i saw a sixty per cent increase and the number of dips i can do in a single session n it is actually he quite significant effect and you do not have to be perfectly precise in order to do it and of course if you want a heat up for whatever reason your in your camping or you are lost in the environment remember these three surfaces are going to be the beltway to heat your core as well up until now we have been talking about how to use cold during a work out in order to improve performance and indeed cold applied to the appropriate parts of the body the appropriate times can vastly improve our performance in endurance and strength now i want to talk about the use of temperature in particular cold to improve the speed and the depth of recovery recovery is obviously vital right during a wait training session or during an endurant session that is just the stimulus for getting better the next time and if you do not recover you not only will not get better but you will get worse there's a lot of interest in the use of cold in order to improve recovery in the short term we see this and probably the best example this would be fighters in combat sports between rounds or vastlats during in between quarters or half time that is one form of recovery the ability to go back in to the sport very soon on an order of minutes any where from one minute in between rounds in typical combat sports or several minutes and a half time et camera typically what we see is people cooling their core cooling the back of their neck cooling the top of their head it might be you know a a sponge with cold water over the top of the head or an ice pack on the back of the neck or in some case even wearing cold ice vest the rashly been done that is going to be a very inefficient way to improve recovery of that kind far better would be to cool the face the palms of the hands or the boys f the feet for the reasons that are described up until now submerging the body in an ice bath or taking a cold shower say up to the neck or up to the chest or getting under cold water or jumping in a cold lake or something of that sort or in the locker room getting under the cold shower also would be a terrible way to cool off the body quickly compared to the ways that i described through the palms of the hands the bombs of the feet or the face for the following reason first of all it is not optimizing those portals of the face palms the hands of feet and in addition if it is very cold and you submerge or you cover a lot of the body with that cold you are going to cause constriction of the very vessels and pathways that allow the body to efficiently dump heat again the key thing is to cool these one or two or three of these surfaces but not cold that you cause that the vase of constriction what is this mean for you it means that getting in an ice bath or a cold shower or putting an i s pack on the back your neck in most cases is not going to be as good as splashing cold water on your face are even just holding your face with in a damp cool cloth or or something of that sort it yours kind of counter intuitive you think oh if i just jump into an ice bath ism going to cool down much faster than i if i just could these one or two or three of these select regions the body but that is shall not the case and then of course there is recovery that occurs from session to session outside of the game or the match or the r the exercise o session and many people are now relying on things cry therapy which requires lot of expenseiof equipment big know o it liquid nitrogen driven a machine that those are not common for most people are accessible for most people but a lot of polar using cold baths or ice baths or cold showers and again that is not going to optimize recovery in fact it is going to have an additional effect that is going to potentially block the training stimulus when you get into an ice bath indeed there are provided s not very very cold i you get to a cold shower provides not very very cold you are indeed blocking some of the inflammation that occurs because of the training session but in doing you also a blocking pathways such as em tour mammalian target or rapamiasin which are involved in the adaptation for a muscle to become stronger or bigger put simply covering the body in cold or immersing the body in cold after training can short circuit or prevent the hypertrife or muscle growth response it has other effects that can be positive it can induce their agents is et camera it can reduce inflammation but it can prevent some of the positive effects of exorcise now has not been examine much for endurance work but let say you come back from around of endurance work a run or a bike or a swim getting into a cool bath or cooling that the palms the boys the feet of the face in my opinion based on the science would be better then completely immersing the body in the ice bath or the cold shower there is a time in a place for the use of the ice bath of the cold shower or the cold plunge those tend to be when you want to deliberately increase brown fat thermogenesis or when you want to deliberately work on mental resilient and in a subsequent episode on fat loss ism going to talk about how to optimize the use of cold specifically for increasing metabolism and fat loss but for now since retaking about the use of cold for improving performance and recovery the suggestion that ism going to provide is based on the work of crew heller and colleagues that have been talking about as well as a excellent book i mainly rely on text books an a special volume books which are collections of papers from experts in a particular area that go beyond standard kind of college level text books the one that have been relying on is called thermal regulation in human performance physiological and biological aspects by f e marina i do not know the publisher i do not know the author i do recognize some of the names of the particular papers there by just net of be clear the is no sort of business relationship or deal with them but an excellent texts call therm a regulation in human performance you can find it on line if you want to go really deep into this but basically what they show is that if you can cool the body back to its resting temperature for a and rest by resting temperature i mean within the range that you would see at any time of waking day but not in exercise just bringing the the body texture down to base line if you can do that the sooner you can do that after a work out the sooner that the muscle will recover that the tendons will recover and that the person you can get back into more endurance training more weight training et camera cold actually can be a very powerful tool for recovery but to maximize return to base line levels of temperature it is my belief based on the studies that are published in this book as well as my discussions with my cole crag heller and in reviewing the the literature over all that just simply cooling the entire body by jumping into an ice bath or a cold shower is not the best way to go you really want a rely on one of these three glamorous skin portals of the palms the bottoms the feet or the face now you probably know more than you ever wanted to know about how we regulate body temperature and how it can be applied to exercise both during the exercise cession and afterward to optimize recovery many of us all of us presume are also eating and drinking things and taking things that various times that can impact this process and because of that we should ask whether not those things are impacting body temperature and when we do that we find that there are certain things that many of us are doing that are actually impairing our performance for instance if you are taking a rework out drink or your ingesting a lot of caffeine or other substance to bring your body temperature up before exercise you are limiting the amount of exercise that you can do i can recall a time and college when i would drink a lot of a espresso aback then a a federal was sold over the counter i remember taking it it will really energize you for work outs you can generate a lot of energy and get extremely for as taken those things they do increase heart wait that can be quite dangerous i do not recommend people take them in fact i think at federal is now off the shelves as a a non prescription compound because various people died from taking it who ware sensitive to it or exercised in heat but looking back at that i realize it is a foolish approach it was increase for thoria genesis sure i might have burned a few more calories but actually when i look at the data that are coming from specific cooling and how that can increase in performance if done properly and then i compare that to the effects of taking some sort of thermogenic compound whatever it is some rework out or some pill or high levels of canine it is very clear that increasing body temperature prior to working out is the exact wrong thing that one would want to do you soft want a stay cold that you cannot generate good muscle contractions you soft want a bet i am coming out of the cold ocean youknow with claws for hands but one wants to have your body temperature in arrange that still lows you to work hard and perform well now in terms of recovery things alcohol we know a vast dilator those are going to caused people to drop body temperature s you might think oh will that sounds grate for recovery and i do not think people should be drinking who are have proms with alcohol in taking o alcoholics or the not of drinking age et camera ism not a drinker but do have a good friend who's a quite accomplished athlete who basically drinks a beer or to after his long runs or cycling and his argument as well a dumping body heat and i like beer and he is probably right it is probably a really good tool provided you do not have issues with alcohol that would preclude that as the tool or you are not of drinking age but anything that you invest after exercise that would increase body temperature is going to impede recovery anything that you do that lowers body temperature provided and safe ranges is going to accelerate recovery and that brings us to the whole host of compounds that people take that can increase body temperature and many people re taking these things in order to increase fat burning and increase metabolism but in my opinion it is impeding their ability to perform well and especially if the performance is something that your focussed on a side from body decomposition losing fat building muscle but even if your focus on losing fat building muscle left to ask yourself is the body temperature increase that ism getting from these compounds really worth it given that it can block or prevent my performance from being as good as it out in other words is it worth taking something that makes you feel very energized to go work out but then you now know that you are stopping earlier and your performing less well fewer raps fewer steps over all is it worth it if you had not takin that thing than you could perform much longer and at much higher capacity some of you are probably saying will that is ridiculous because when i drink a quadrupleexpresso and i papa whatever rework out or drink a rework out than i know i can go much further ah that might be true but the increase in temperature is also costing you on the recovery side and unless you are doing other things to improve your recovery and i know many people that are i do not judge but many people who are doing those things are also augmenting the recovery through hormonaugmentation and other performance i enhancing tools then for the typical person who is not doing that it is probably shooting yourself in the foot let us take a look at what some of those compounds are and what they do and just briefly review whether not they would be a good or a bad idea to include if your maingoals or performance or your main goals are body decomposition or both let just briefly discuss stimulants this could be affine this could be any other kind of stimulant that are typically in a a rework out drink or anything that might get you reed up before exercising this could even be very strong tea have mention ism consumer of mate i a yerbomate i love that stuff ah and i also drink affine i drink i love coffee a very kinds mushroom coffee black coffee espresso et camera ism a chronic affine user i do not think ism an attic but ism a chronic affine user meaning when i drink coffin my heart rate does not increase much that it feels a shock to my system some people are not affine adapted or the very affine sensitive here is the straight forward rule affine for somebody who does not drink affine very much will constrict the blood vessels and will increase retention of body heat and is probably a bad idea before exercise for somebody whose coffin adapted and is used to drinking affine it will not have that azo constriction of felt that is what the date a point to because ism adapted to it and but it will cause vast dilation and will allow me to dump body heat for me i use it before i train or do any kind of exercise because i can do that early in the day will not prevent me from sleeping and it causes vast dilation and then afterwards ism aware that it causes vas of constriction after the affine wears off for somebody who drinks two or three or more cups o coffee a day or mate a days who were talking and take of anywhere from a hundred to four hundred kilograms of affine what you want to do is you want to make sure that you would do that before exercise and probably not after exercise i just makes logical sense given what we know about thermal regulation and if your somebody who does not drink affine drinking affine before a work out is going to be about the worse than you could possibly do because it is going to increase corody temperature through its thermagentic effects and it is going to constrict your blood vessels and make it even harder to dump heat i do not suggest that people drink affine or not i just suggest that you think about whether it your affine adapted or not and decide whether not you want to drink affine in general you are gong to be better not drinking any affine than you are drinking affine unless you are a heavy coffin user or abuser in which case not drinking affine is going to give you vicious headaches and is gong to make it very hard to get motivated because you are just not used to it it takes about three weeks to get used to no affine it is brutal have done it before have done coffin fast i soft know ever want to do it again that is how painful it was but you get headaches because the effects on vest d dilation and constriction you affine seen moderate amounts and use it before your work outs not after if you do not coffin or you do not use it very often stay away from it anywhere close to exercise before or after for that matter one of the more commonly used compounds that is sold over the counter are nonsteroidal anti in flammatories things land all and advice and other trade names in the proven sodium things of that sort almost all of those drop body temperature to some extent and that is why it is often recommended that people take them when they have a fever although the whole business of dropping body temperature artificially when you have a fever is itself an interesting discussion whether not a that is the most adaptive best thing to do certainly you do not want fever to go too high can be very dangerous can kill you but artificially dropping body temperature with these compounds can be tricky now a number of athletes especially endurance athletes will rely on these nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs specifically to keep body temperature lower during long bouts of exertion this is a little bit of a form a colonic version of dumping heat instead of using palmer cooling om or face face ice pat cooling there relying on pharmacology to drop their cop body temperature that has certain obvious advantages those advantages should be obvious an the reasons for them should be obvious based on everything we have talked about up until now lower temperature allows you to go further harder with more intensity however they do have effects on the liver and they can also have effects on the kidneys and during long bouts of exercise or even short bouts of exercise water balance and salt balance are also going to be vital to maintain in order to perform well generate the best muscle contractions stay mentally alert and also to stay alive we will do an episode on salt electrolytes and water and water balance but you probably want o think carefully about whether or not you want to use nonsterodaantime flammatories before any training session just for the performance augmentation effect unless your working carefully with a coach whether not you have done that in practices and of course whether not you are in a situation where monitoring your body temperature carefully is gong to be important you might ask when with that be well desert races summer training and races winter rides you certainly do not want to get too cool either alcohol caffeine and nonsteroidal inflect anti inflammatory drugs because of their effects on temperature will impact performance and recovery but you want to be cautious about how you approach them i personally an more fan of using affine and moderate doses for the reason i describe before as well to use the cooling of the palms cooling the of the bombs of my feet right a by placing them into a bucket or a into a cool bath after after training or c fooling the face after training or sometimes even during training it just seems there is more of a margin to play with the variables to heat up the water cool it down a little bit om to include one palm or the other palm there is ja sort all sorts of o good perimeter space as we call it in science that you can play with and work with to find what works for you as whereas when you pop a pill sure you can adjust the dose and you can just it next time but once it is in you it is in you and the is can be some period of time before you can modulate it what have offered to day our ways in which you can use temperature to powerfully in improve performance and if you think about it you can vary that from set to set you can do your pull up s or your sprints and then cool your palms and then try and go with colder water the next round or warmer water the next round or do both feet and palms and face and you can do all sorts of things moment to moment and see what works for you again essentially zero cost or no cost whereas when you pop something you take a pill you are basically in that regiment for the next hour or too or more you can always take more but you cannot really take last you cannot rely extract it from your body in real time does not give you a lot of opportunity to place scientists which is what i to do because what i have always trying to do is trying o dining that the best protocols possible based on the mechanisms and data and if you can do that moment to moment that places you in a position of power once again we covered a lot of material by now after seeing this episode or listening to this episode you should understand a lot about how your body heats and cools itself and the value of that for physical performance i hope you will also appreciate that you have tools at your disposal to vastly improve your physical performance and should you try those please let us know how it goes if you decide to do palm or cooling during your runs or after your runs during your weight work outs during your yoga sessions whatever it is let us know please place that in the balance have giving you specific protocols and some direction but have also left it slightly vague because as i mentioned earlier i do not know all the environmental conditions i do not know how hot your yoga studio is or how cool your him happens to be or your body temperature or time of day remember your temperature will vary according to time a day we did whole episode about that relate to sleep typically your body temperature is rising early in the day and is coming down as you approach the late evening and late night hours for sleep in the mill the night your temperature is very low added absolute lowest something we call the temperature minimum we do not know exactly where you are at you need to take the information that you receive to day and should you try in in corporate try in do it intelligently do not cool yourself off much that you you become cryogenic and please do not warm yourself up in fact we did not talk it all about warming yourself up i because warming yourself up too much can be quite dangerous you never ever ever want to be hypothermic that is what your body in your brain or trying to avoid we talked a little b t about supplements but not the standard sorts of supplements i usually list off on these episodes rather we talked about coffin nonstaroid and antique lavatories and how those can impact temperature how alcohol can impact temperature i should just mention in closing that every time we eat we also increase temperature there is a eating induce their magic effect but that is a minor one that is a small one you would not worry about eating before training ah because of its effects on temperature because it tends to be really minor going forward we are going to talk more about temperature in other ways to improve physical performance and skill learning were going to talk about specific ways to accelerate fat lost to improve muscle growth to improve suppleness and flexibility these approaches in mechanisms are anchor deeply in borrow science and physiology in the relationship between our parietal organs which include our skin and are brain and all the organs in between it is really a pleasure for me because ism able to look to the textbook literature that exists an really came out over the last fifty to a hundred years and unlike a lot of arias of narrow science which are still sort of mystical consciousness an dreaming of which we understand a little bit about these core mechanisms of temperature and physiology which are powerful

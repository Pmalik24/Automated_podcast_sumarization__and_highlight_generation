from w s chico it is e special christian edition of this america life we have a bunch of things for you to day including later in the program christian on fire but let just get things off right now with a song recorded an event we did on stage a little while back on the twelve day of christmasmatuloa to me ttottintin nine anatto tell does t i have always hated that song i have always shad of that song i thought i that song is symbol of everything that is bad about christian i just say i have no bad feelings about christian i am a non combatant when it comes to christian as on stage talking bout the song cause we had this idea that we thought might make a really fun thing to try for christian and that is we organized a night of improve comedy and i know you saying or we how as hi go together why improve comedy in christian oke well this con tickled swanning stay with me this brutish writer and performer name dance kitten i saw him say this thing about christian that seems true he says that when you're kid and you wake up christian morning what makes christian feel magical is this fling of all my got is can be amazing the world is full of possibility anything can happen the fact that denticles even exist this literally magical being who ken to your home and kitten says this thrilled feeling that anything can happen that is the thing that is hard to hold on to once win become adults and if fact he says that many adults at christian they tried to we create the same christian year after year with the same everything over and over and over it is they lock in christian becomes the opposite of anything can happen that is why it never feels this magical to adults but it is possible to get back to that feeling and a payback to the plan for to day show one place that adults embrace that feeling that anything can happen and it is going to happen in than they make it happen is improve comedy were they walk on stage with no idea what anybody's going to say and then one person tries something they say something and then somebody else pitches in with the line of their own and that somebody else pictures in before you knowhow they have made a whole seen a whole world really and with than in mind we got these incredible improve comedians and we got a club to perform in and we did a show and we did the show in this particular style of improve were the people on stage they tell true stories about their lives and then those stories of true stories become the basis of the improphescenes that they then invent and those scenes lead them to other true stories that then we them into other improphscenes and on and son and on and i was there i things off with the story about that song about the song to twelve days of christian which is the song that i noticed even though just to say it again christian is not my day i am not somebody who celebrates christian at all of a new and ism not that kind of new whose parents celebrated christian anionic we were purer conic of people and we look down on the christian sonic news and if act i grow up in a suburb of baltimore that was jewfish i did not understand that we were in the minority and christian i do nothing it means nothing to me the day means nothing and most years i go to vagus on christian but i do really love christian music have always loved christmasmusic an and and at some point in my twenties as the to make a collection of christian semis and records and the worst song of all is the song the twelve days of christen and whenever it comes on i just think we is this still in circulation first of all the words refer to a wife and a world that none of us can relate to or carabao twelve words a weeping we what is what experience is that even referring toad then swans are swimming geese are laying are we in a worm climate of cold him it just raises many questions but also the form of the song is intensely boring and you i o talking about what you do the first one and then you go back and you do all the ones before which you already did you noway means to you do two turtle doves an a parts a picture can three french has two turtle doves and partinitures in then four calling birds three french has two turtle doves in a part of the five golden rings for going booths an just what is going to happen it is repetitious in the most boring way and then it is always sung very slowly which is annoying and i do not know why it is survive hundreds of years to still be around and and my only thought is five golden rings five golden rings is the hook of the song and you song the song right when you get to five golden rings everybody frees a sir's as f bring and just to you only man it is the drums that is the hook of the saw and without five golden rings this song would be nothing visa at this point this me back in the studio tugging it this most if i could jut describe the stage sitting on stools in a row there are six in prove comedians and we got some of the best people around for this kind of thing seriously we felt lucky they agreed to be in the show eighty batons ti sheers an made of the both on sturdy night live scout adds it he was on thirty rock and before that he was in second city as tammy sager chis gathered in mike bobiglia they not been o ready pro on before mike many many times they both have deep in prove backgrounds six of the are sitting on the stage on the stools and they listened to that first story that i told to kicking sow and my was the first were to stand up and speak or first of all i will not a a disagree within about that song i thing in some sense it sort of the fifteen bottles of beer in the wall of christian carols it see them it is repettedif i i think were the disconnect happens is that it is just brutish things fa what kind of america things which you put in that i abaldil baldy gal aoaktre made going in an oak tree yer we just get a see brutish the whole thing sing that is the problem have a squire yes we have been courting now for going on ten months and yo i pan playing in my mind with what to get you for christian lot maya wants i am sure that whatever you bring me on christian will bringing much who may i give it you now oh yes but soon before a christian have excited i think i did well all right here you are five golden rings o i would mes but have also brought you twenty three birds twenty three individual birds and fifty human people would you say a group let where e crises risen do you it i davit a old me the munch and if we could just go back for a moment to the five golden ring ah yes so to question question about wat what is the difference between a gold ring and a golden ring i beaus one seems to imply that it merely has the color yet none of the value when you cot me then o i am afraid to say be pretty call o rote mole than i expect old me the munch it had a squad do you remember when you first came cutting yes my memory is in tact what's it because i

ohoocildren gather you we have a class wide announcement ay the news this is never good a i was i was i was just canna tell a quick story a little listen we feel we keep tacking about a especially people who were always and experiencing a jewfish a exchristmas experience but i was the exact opposite where until i was thirteen years old i did not know jewfish people existed maybe and i loved christian much that i would get up three in the morning to try and look at my presence and on i just always felt such simple things would give me such overwhelming joy that i i i wish i could have that now one christian morning i was in my little christian gown and i crept down and there was a giant stuffed animal saint beard which is not a bike that you can ride or something that you can do with it is just in to sit there and your can a look at it and love it and as soon as i saw it i was happy i i i could not believe my eyes i fell to my knees and i my pant i us i the i this saint beard i just i t cut elf to my knees and just lasted ran i a i had till i creep into my parents room and say good morning ma merry christian sum give soiled myseland i see your help cries got the other impress stars o stage i do you have moments that of such incredible joy at at christian i not not the would take your body to that be betgivie me moments of just pure pure joy in that way that i think we readily have as the dust spoof when when i was a kid om my sister and i would a would get up really early and and stand of the top of the stairs cause we new were we were not allowed to go down stairs and my dad had this tradition he we went to wait for him to when we would just shake with anticipation a the top the stairs and a and wait and wait an an bother them my my parents to get out of bed and would pull them out of bed and they would take their sweet time putting on their clothes and getting their behaving it just just to torture us as i knew we were of the top of the stairs and my dad would go downstairs first you say was see if sat a came like look on the hall as at and seen evidence to you been here we walk into the dining room and we de disappear when youren't go o no nothing in here and we are up they were going to i the dining room as nothing the dine room got just count aside little sitting room and i same thing you disappears you does the same stick of of no nothing here and then he say inevitably say l now if he came the first couple years we were really nervous at maybe sand at did not come but then ye off for three or four years of this were of course you came shoe's everything in go family from he wit t the is what thefireplace is shat is no o come down in than cart everything into the dining room family room for go nothing here may we all go look up in the attic what is wrong with you i what is wrong with yours not to be the attic we guise your was haven and about point your stupid freshly shaven face towards the family to i want to talk to you guides about your dad o cant he has all timers he does not know where the presents are that is true we have been sand he was having fun but holly hell e come in he's gem i the see merry aristas thank you again i want to tell you something i never told you about chis i seen i leaving where sing for you for four hundred seventy to years your gin have a digger in that bad well have told you at it is magical time of you've told you we give presents to millions of children in the world we only my on as i let we gave that but i have not told you rudely has answer the red nose is litany get in tretidt ja the tat now for long for years we just thought it was adorable i feel bad we us to laugh and call him nail have a question i wonder what you let thing this ant i thing this makes me sound bad person did you christian loses a lot of the joy when you hidden age where you have to start buying presents for other people i have not hit that age not thousand per cent i to like tike takes a it it is a fun magic thing and then when you actually have to give back to other people becomes i thing that see si tor drag such a drag your appearance did not make you give presents your siblings to my sibling had one brother our elementary school men tad you let had this your element you our element you school had a thing that was just bad princsair cheap bred you would go in to that him and be a you by your dad a little screwdriver said we can buy your mamma plastic ring it was all the same stuff to every year my brother w it isn't interchangeable i got you the on fly water gray i got you the slap bracelet it a and our mam would give us the money anyway i ti this inn my sensinical my wife and i a do we do not give each other christian presence a because neither from us believing holidays eleven thatwell father i get ta he a w every fourth of jury you think a war is breaking out a u not to chrism's point a no neither of us the pressure of a having to get a gift and we just do not him sowers just now we do not want that in relationship w om the opposite when i grew up i remember the first do presence i bought and it still essentially trove me now is that a ism really excited for people to open the present i found or made for them and a watching them open other people's presence makes me angry an i bottom waiting for them to get to my present we ism going to walk you back on now and are you making found present me save thing what is what is unsure breathe end person ma ma o sweetie i got this for ye oh sweet it is a opera an mini paper pap don't at you get me o i great

on as great was going to say n be honest i did not get you anything but your present will be a father figure if you play your carts am i you wat i had there was no religious factor in my christian experience but it was all about creating your own magic i feel we had this family tradition where christian eve everyone had to do one trick which could be of any sorts and then if you you did your trick you got to open one present before you went to bed i now towrope professional performer all the tricks i mean it was all kinds of things i remember when you are might in uncle times a nostril

that is how you get back to the feeling of wonder that children have it christian when everything is new we have arrived ta at two of our programmed act two oily potter and the gobble of fire whale of our producers stephany to recently discovered to christmast tradition that still pretty new in our country that no kidding brought her joy no kitting made the world seem a bigger more wonderful place to her was this report i do not remember how we stumbled on my very first turkey explosion video but i do remember everything else about it the video is called why you should never deep fry a frozen turkey two fire fighters are standing at the ready in front of a fire track on a long somewhere in front of them stands a large pot full of hot ail on a propane burner another fire fighter in full here comes out with a raping turkey hanging from the end of a long stick he lowers the turkey into the pot it is totally submerged an wale naan the oil bubble and over flows spilling everywhere and a couple of fireballs even first out of the pot in gust and then just when you think its over here comes the must i suddenly an enormous twenty foot column a fire blasts out of the pot salmon himself has been conjured by way of poultry sacrifice i watch it again and again then i pulled in my charger chat me we shown call watch with me another time nap gray is just pleasure i saw in up next column and you to that the were more videos this turkey fire fire safety pieces put out by fire departments across the country we stopped counting at a hundred and fifty foveas they come from loosen depends e cola to canaille californium all made to demonstrate the dangers of deep frying a lot of the videos were clearly done as segments for local tea use stations but some departments employ different theatrical methods to amp up the drama on the passes some you slow my some play epic music as you watch close ups of the pot of oil some spray water in the pot obviously something you should never do with the grease fire as it doubles the size of the flames willing shatter even stars in one video titled eat fry love crated by state farm in it he is playing the net chef om one o moisterteaseo ti a to a to red and there is a dub stupe man natant amazingly this was also released by state farms as iiairaatier then there are the jack asked idiot a where regular people without safety gear lower turkeys into deep fires sometimes from alarming heights underneath trees and baseball hoops of course there's a subjoin r here of people who actually wind up catching their decks on fire and fly into a panic just saying your average turkey fire incident injures four people for because it is a spectator sports which is why fire departments do these fits ever hear but after my seventh time watching why you should never deep fire turkey it occurred to me that there's another reason why they do them i notice one of the firefighters standing in the back he was barely suppressing a grin assumed in on ham watch it again definitely grant i called him to ask about it his name is lieutenant dance caramel of the scabby county fire rescue that in one of the bigwig to been in the offs when you any drop a hurt your not a n assure how can come out here is some f the guides from the cargo fire department they have one of my favor at videos hi hi do all of you guides setting turkeys on fire had you doing the as of the way postobeded you just be put not hioestir ye wat what is your favorite par a out the flaming turkey tradition me big a i er and there good at it faggots fireball is two stories tall for explosion is huge be e a what is ha sending t where you are able to get it to be big here well word tot hoof the a om e nation e to git to be that to wait you will be but as o the worst case what can happen did you guys practise ye you'll we did to do pray that the boy oil not of the pop i sold it to the pot mad the the circle is big as possible quick signs lesson these for and turkeys are filled with ice i s of course is water and water his apartments with oil when the turkey hit the oil that ice turns to water turns to seem which wishes the oil out of the pot and when that hits the flame underneath to your basic turkey lying do not are as follows on do not put in a for an turkey you should taw your turkey twenty four hours for every five pounds that is chervil days for fifteen pounder to do not put in a wet turkey or a too big turkey three do not overfill the pot with oil or over heat the oil for do not do this inside and lastly most fire departments would tell you the most important do not is just please do not deep fry a turkey at all cargo double did all the dots while some far fighters he their demonstration pots to three fifty cargo took theirs to seven hundred the pot of oil is obviously already in flames and overflowing before the turkey gets anywhere near it an active bulcanal ani manage to find the first turkey fire the a from two thousand too it

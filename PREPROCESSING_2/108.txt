the sundae times reports that four women have accused mussels brand of rape or sexual assault and he comes out swinging jobidon's favorite union shuts down to trout and the immigration crisis continues to grow i benshkur of the sis the venshpuro so benchkiroshosponser express plan protect or all my privacy to day express be plans come lesbian the news that has engulfed much of the legacy medias engulf to the brutish media for sure a lot of media here in the united states is this massive expose supposed expose from the sundae times in the up accusing mussels brand a person i consider a friend of rape sexual assault and abuse from period two thousand six to two thousand thirteen now i did know russelbrand at that time i us if had known mussels brand would not resell at that time considering that mussels bran by his own admission in all of his writings and in all of his statements has basically admitted to being a sect attic and incredibly promiscuous and a person who would be considered to have engaged in incredibly vile behavior during that entire period and then russellbrand has remade himself and in the period write known mussels which is really the pas the or for years mussels has been a person who is searching for something meaningful he is settled down noisy he is married yes kids he is a person who is been trying to put together a good life now can i attest to mussel bran's character from two thousand sixty to thousand t thirteen i again i cannot i did not know him at that point do i think that mussels bran today is a good person yes i think that russelbran today is a good person now is a possible that your mistaken about people you think sure that is possible to but here is my problem with this particular attack on mussels brand from the media my promise the fireman during the time that russelbran was pretty flagrantly and obviously not only promiscuous but incredibly vile in the sorts of things that he said publicly about sex about women and all the rest of the sort of stuff the media work championing him he was a hero of the left at this time when he was engaged in this sort of behavior he was he was treated as some sort of person to early at this time he was not only on b basis on m t v who is being treated as a public celebrity while he was engaging this sort of behavior he was the impish devil who is who is having sex of as many women as wholly possible in doing intend sastruga now ten years later will mussels bran has fixed his life in is trying to make a better life for himself now he gets it with a full scale sundae times expose about all of these women now were got to go through some of the allegations with which mussels has been hit for mussels has denied all f the allegations and again in every situation are gigue about a ten year fifteen twenty year ago situation it is at he said she said theresjis no a to verify one way or the other whether somebody is telling the truth or whether they are not absent some sort of d an a evidence and even data evidence isn't in a fully explain what exactly happened if a man in a women are in a room together because consent or non contends is a matter of behavior in the moment it's not something can be evidence by physical evidence typically must your talking about god forbid some sort of full an mucous keep or something in this particular is were you haves my bunch of stories were women we bastard the time then were not happy or the won't happy afterward there is one allegation particular that teems pretty seriously the mussels has said that he is going to address before i get to the actual allegations the time in here t is that mussels whens in his win and he put out e pretty length he steepen talking about what he say coming because apparently but the sundae times in channel for were going around and fane dozens of women to talk to under it was pretty clear to him that they were going to watch the story at him hermit is what mussels had to see just before the story launched half there you awakening orders now this is not the usual type of video we make on this channel where we critique attack and undermine the news in all its corruption because in this story i am the news have received too extremely disturbing letters or a letter and an emu one from a mainstay media t we company one from a newspaper listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks as well as some pretty stupid stuffs er my communifestivales should be stop that i should not be a border attack mainstay media narratives on this channel but amidst this litany of astonishing rather bedrock attacks are some very serious allegations that i absolutely refute these allegations pertained to the time when i was working in the tantrum when i was in the newspapers all the time when i e was in the movies n as have written about extensively in my books i was very very promiscuous now during that time of promiscuity the relationships i had were absolutely always congenital i was always transparent about that then almost too transparent and on being transparent about it now as well and to see that transparency metastasized into something criminal that i absolutely deny makes me question is there another a general play particularly when we have seen cold and senior attacks before with jo organ when he dared to take a medicine that the mainstay mended in approve of and we saw a spate of headlines from media outlets across the world using the same language ism aware that you guises have been saying in the comments for a while watch out mussels there coming for you yo again too close the truth mussels bran did not kill himself i know that year ago there was a spate of arches resell brains of conspiracy ferns mussels bran's i wing ism aware of news medium making phone can sending letters that people i know for ages and ages it is being clear to me or at least it feels to me tike there is a serious and concerted a gender to control these kind of spaces and these kind of voices and ism in my voice along withal voice i do not mind them using my books and my stand up to talk about my promiscuous consensual conduct in the past why seriously ref are these very very serious criminal allegations also is worse mentioning that there are witnesses whose evidence directly contradicts the narratives that these too mainstay media outlets are trying to construct apparently in what seems the me to be a to overnight it attack now ought i were to gan for this any flout because of the theorist night a a theatigation but feel on being attack and plainly that working very lively tigthaso is he right about the timing is you right about the timing that is one of the questions here obviously because again all of these allegations some of them are not criminal some of them are very very criminal and there is no stature of limitations on raper sexual assault in the united kingdom or pretty much anywhere else in we which means that theoretically the police could still bring charges against him if in fact the allegations our true or if there is proof of the allegations but the real question here that i have again all get to the allegations themselves in just one second the real question i have here is why the sudden interest by the media in all these stories now meaning all these stories been floating around for fifteen ten years over a decent and only now do they see fit actually track down all the women who slept with mussels brand and try to find some who will make allegations or who believe that that they were victims of rape or sexual assault for mussels bran and all i can imagine were is that mussels bran crossed a particular political line that if you'd still ben on the right side of the line he media definitely would not have been going after him because you have to you but lorn about the motivations what exactly changed in the same way that nothing changed about jo organ from point ache to point be except his political viewpoint in the same way that nothing changed really about dona true between point at and point be except his political viewpoint in the same way that nothing has changed here about mussels bran from point eightopoint be accept his political viewpoint you wonder about the timing when he was engaged in all this behavior when it oud have been most plausible that he engaged in the sort o behavior alleged the me you are not only uninterested they were paying him ten years later when resell has isn't by the way not a right winger when mussels is just decided that he is not in favorable lot of for left winged narratives ranging from bovid to to likeness when that happens suddenly you have a coordinated attack a coordinated investigation to the sundae times and the and the talesman and the channel for news in written i find the timing at least somewhat suspicion say somewhat i mean a lot suspicions will get to the allegations in just moment because some of them again our pretty question will on their faces one allegation particulars very serious and then there some their pretty questionable on their face will gets that momentarily first on a talks you about the dailywires

you've men link get three extraverts for free express visions i complice pen e c p art yes us van dot con slashban o was the actual allegations here now there there certain women who obviously were not quoted and again it is not proof that somebody did not commit a sexual fault to a rape if he had consensual sex with another person but it does go to character there women were now coming out saying that they were contacted by the sundae telegraph e there or the sundae times rather that they were contacted by channel for and that they just were not covered because they did not tell the story the media wanted them to to to tell here is one women explaining that she had consensual sex with bran and was reached out to by the media i was contacted inti action es i regard a pit i mate about a safety an a wee hand that we sad together the vidiais kind of iron i some mi pay somewhere if he wanted a see n and that san somebody was as mas if he will be away mister brand they watt he's my story because it did not fit the narrative for that document try because he was not an cut to me we had a fan cost contacted me from o information and i did not contatebac because i kind of fell it i pe me anyway e i p yo bison it is the do cement about the olein i me mister ruse brand a again yet not all this s gun's be quoted by the media what are the actual allegation there the two sources that coordinated on the allegations against bran one is e show in the tuque called dispatches from channel for and i i have to admit it is a littlest weird that one ofthethings at they do here as they say that that none of the women were willing to come on camera to talk about the actual allegations instead they have actresses playing the women reading their tabs with just cannot strange just from a media prospective typically if you want to have a reporter your talking had read the actual words i get that i do not understand having actress play the woman and infusing the the lines with emotiontemen the that that is it's a strange move just from a production standpoint to me anyway here are some of the the quotes from dispatches i find and somebody bels what i was rebooting and i was said that is petting muscle brant bin sex a found i was lie o my god he write to me jet is t not onion for trying by acres when my rat happens is out way and he happen to call me and say have had a really by day please come over an i at first i said no my going fay and he is please come to common cote with me door was unlocked i just wanton is place he comes running out of the bacterin the cent he came am superconfuseus why the have actress to this be again on on and then on inn can i knowwhat he wanted mean that point ages a lot of these allegations towntalolike for example tho copy brine allegations member copy brine s allegations twenty five years ago their allegations that he was at a hotel and colorado and a woman came up to his room it three a m and then as it turns out most likely shad contextual sex them than she claimed she was rape in some of these cases were its women going to man's rooms at two a m that does not mean that the man gets to pertispatan rape it does mean the out to take into accounts all the circumstances when you hear a he said she said story and the sort of believe all women mean has alwaysbeen ridiculous it is no different thing believe all men in special ridiculous whenyou can men to find the words women or men but and when you look at these sorts of stories this is the problem in eerily with not going forth say a criminal prosecution at the time and allegation is made when you come forward ten years later of course the story is going to get analyzed and that is not being mean to the woman or cruel to the woman it is if were trying to get at the truth of a thing that either happened or did not happen you have the look t the circumstances surrounding the actual allegations gain gets o more on these allegations in just one moment first did that poor sleep can cause waitgain mood issues poor mental health and lower productivity i know that because om have experienced some of those things considering i the kid did everything

check that chop at b a m dot come flashes use code ben frump to forty per cent off o case bounce the actual allegations very long story from as i say the sundae times in the yuk and they say four women have alleged sexual assaults between twenty o sects and twenty thirteen when he as a presenter for b b s radio to and channel for and then in actor and holly wood films others have made a range of accusations about brand's controlling abusive and predatory behavior bran denied the allegations and set all of his relationships have been consensual it is we an go through some of these allegations because again there is this weird tendency when when allegations this come out n you see them also about people for example army hammer write the actor army hammer all these allegations will come out the wood work accusing army hammer of have engaged in rape or sexual assault and turns out t persons been in a long standing sexual relationship i the person where they had sex the person both before and after but we are supposed to somehow believe that in the middle was the rape in maybe that is true maybe that is not but it goes to credibility if you stay with the guy if you were the i before and you stated with the guy after therefore couple of situations that are liked us and then there are certain situations where there not against the law it is just the brand is supposed to be creeping which he has ad fitted to being between this en tire period that he was a creep with women for example the first story here is quote as her tax approached to rustle bran's home ace remembers the driver begging her not to go inside recognizing the destination he would sided task questions alive admitted she was sixteen in still in school she says the driver replied his daughter was the same age and and treated alive please him asking you not going there you could be my little girl i would want some one to do this for her he offered to take her home without charge but salicin sister she was fine he had just a sad look in his my she recalled alive whose name we have changed to protector identity now realized as she was not time during a relationship the later for about three months when brand was a b b we ready presenter she says he referred to her as the child and elegies he became increasingly controlling another emotionally sexually abusive at this time brand was thirty and she was apparently sixteen can now in the united states crime in the up not crime the age of consent in the up is sixteen and apparently brand ascertained the she as sixteen by asking her and checking which means scuzzy scum baggy behavior shore criminal behavior now if you are again in the use and the age of consent changes from states out prefer the age of consent be eighteen but if you are not going to have that then that is what it is according to the times brand made his name in commencing the early to thousand and also achieved the status of condones most lascivious lathario after h gave up drugs into don't too brand filled that good with sex in she that not five you received treatment for sexodiction at a clinic in the us his womanizing ways he once had he could sleep with eighty women in month som crown shagged of the year by the son three times have relationships of some the world's most beautiful women including cape loss and many pop starkly parry in twenty ten now again this goes back to what i saying before when he as engaged in this incredibly promiscuous behavior the media were championing him and talking about what a wonderful guy he was an there talking about how he was just this again sort of elvish impish figure on the world stage screwing as many women is humanly possible now this would have been an amazing time to check into whether any of those women were happy with the situation or wether all of them were or the some of them won't did they do at the time now because he was busy getting paid by all these same people only ten years later when he has flipped in terms of his personal life and in terms of the values she is houses now now it is worth while for them to come after him and it is the mediamotivation here is part of the story an is impossible to do without it ad then they go on about alive and and she in it gets very grab a contains about how she was aversion and he he as turn on by this again is anything here actually in accusation of criminality now it is it it is apparently an accusation of of grossness toward the end of the relationship alive says the bran sexually assaulted her now this is an accusation of criminality right she she says that effectively he forced her into oral sex and she had to punch him to get him off of her and all of this there is only one problem which his has quote the relationship ended when brand invited her over one day and she arrived to find another woman in his bed i was an go a said then why would you do this to me this is humiliating alive has decide to speak out now because she believe she was too young to be able to consent to a relationship with then as all man and the law should be changed protect those under eight i agree the law should be changed protect those under eighteen but the allegation of i legal behavior including forcible sexual assaults here right would not that if that is a criminal assault should not she have reported that is a police or shouldn't seureport it now you will notice the these are not criminal charges the police apparently are now soliciting the women to see if they want to come forward and do criminal charges far none of responded as far as ism aware then there is talk about how when bran was e channel for presenter there are basically people were sent in of the crowd to pimp for him to go pick up women and bring h bring the back stage say that a ho ad have sex with them now lame just point out that this is common practice in holliwood it is disgusting it is been vile for ever only people even pointing it out were considered prudes for doing it is totally fine in holly would up until the point it is not that is part of the changing standard here pretty amazing we they all knew i mean if this was the bad behavior why there port have question why is this news relevant that he was alathario who was sending people into the crowd of be c shows to pick up women ism just wonderingly what bill canton did the same thing to can present of the united states and the media dismissed it ism just wondering why exactly this is relevant now it would been relevant then but the problem is they're on the side of those values they are on the side of those values which as why they protected it then if it was bad then if is bad now was bad then apparently but according them was not bad then that this is why there trying to come up with with new allegations the new allegations being actual rape or sexual assault and rustle is denying all this allegations and we have get seat the proof but my the problem with a situation which you've unnamed women making allegations and these unnamed women are to makingtem criminally is that there is no way too a indicate the truth or falsity of the statements now the burden is supposed be on rustle around to disproof that this thing happen which just typically not the way their work typical you have to have a burden of proof that shows that the thing did happen i wave seen to many situations in the past few years of accusations that turn out to be either exaggerated or not trot brag haven't being most obvious example that comes to mine in my opinion the egg carrel story is not credible red there there just plenty of these allegations the are out there about famous men who have crossed a particular line and and i mean politically there and and the allegations and up being either false or exaggerated get to more on this in just one second first as we are big fans of our friend over at genuses do not just take my word for it men you should take my word for because people m i found been using genuses for years they first advertised on a radio show the i did back in man evangelist circle two thousand thirteen two thousand fourteen and e got some free product at the studio i brought at home my wife start using my momstart using it and then evenwhentey ware not an advertiser my parents ad my my mom and my my wife for using it as

haven delegates younger tomorrow say good by tot darken liverspot's bags in puffiness under the eyes crosse genu sell dot come slash air that's genu sell dot come slash chipping hay the sundae times article in includes other allegations and includes in allegation that tat this body a person who is quoted in that channel for clip by an actress which again ism come i keep come back that because it subadar ut why not just read the allegations the am reading the allegations out loud right now unless one who infuse it with an extra level of emotion as played by an actresswhich was strange haste meant lady e business woman who is then in her tires the exchange numbers bran later got ton touch tot the attesting in talking on the phone they met up at tune in tune twenty twelve at his house fella and hey went on to have consensual sects ka they they screwed and apparently she was unsettled by his glazed over look and then during one text exchange brand suggested not a bring a friend again he was in he's a a degenerate at the time they then met again in the early hours of the morning of jury first when she arrived at his house after he would pled with her to come over and this go get in the allegations stated before she is coming over in themiddle of the night he is obviously calling her to have sex with her clearly now does that mean that she contends everything t tells of course not does it also mean that she is in a situation she probably should not be in sure does it also mean that we now have a full he said she said to nares yes not only that she claims that he a he had another person in the apartment he says that a friend was already in the bedroom and you wanted her to join them according to lady and she is like no ism not happening were not doing that and then she accuses him of pushing her up against the wall and then raping her and then she has some acts and hear what the text say this and think the only proof in the story to support some of the allegations they're made quote ism sorry the was crazy in selfish i hope you can forgive me i know your lovely person and then she wrote back you scared the leap out of me you are right i am a lovely person and for you to take advantage of me that is unexpected you have a problem me help its dangerous that you think you can get your own way all the time you know how scary you are when that glazelook comes over you when a girl says know it means no i have to go and get myself tested last time you asked me condom or no condom when i say condom that does not mean it is optional youon't have the best reputation i pride myself on being save in trying to make the medications obvious this was bad when ism disappointed and he said ism very sorry you don't need to get tested i will somehow make this up too with love and kindness not my original i to which was more sex you been lovely mean i embarrass by my behavior sorry and then will you ever forgive me he visit again this the most telling allegation and most credible allegation may noddy i had told the friend what happened if she apparently went to the rape treatment enter at you sell santomonicot medical enter that same day and she share a copy of her treatment records apparently she provided her under were an other samples is evidence which were from s in at the time an officer from allipety was alerted by the center according o the notes she chose not to make a police report she said she did not think my words would mean anything up against his which again is a strange allegation in their two thousand twelve were not find my nineteen sixty thence say if she was world that if her saint's name is somehow released her name will be dragged through the mud should there be at the clinicfor the following of five months during her therapy sessions record shonadia was contemplating criminal or civil proceedings before ultimately deciding against it shrove brand letter hoping to regain some sense of power in the process and she sent it to her house and since you knowhow you put me through my body though you scared the sleep out of me on life first i fought any situation i be strong enough to fight to moron you completely broke me down gas that is by far the most serious allegation all the other allegations that are the lever here are pure he said she said with no real supporting evidence other than the allegation itself and again many of the allegations here include further sexual entanglements they go on after the actual sexual assault allegation ow are gun to find out what happened here ell presume there's textual hard evidence certainly that she ad consensual sex wot hem right me that is presume it the frozen samples would show but if she make contemporaneous police reports all of this could be made not only public with her name but also she could file criminal charges if those criminal charges are file presumably will be adjudicated we just ism i'minasay i do not knob's i do not know and you do not know and no one knows again i can i can say what i think of russellbrand today i cannot saywhat i think of russellbrand in two thousand twelve and i do not know that mussel brand would say what he thinks of russellbrand in two thousand twelve the thing that that i find non credible about the en tire situation is not that ligation which frankly towns she has supporting evidence and will we what comes up the thing that i find puzzling and bewildering is the media's decision to go whole hog on this story after spending years propping him up while he was engaged in thebehavior and apparently everyone in town knew about it you on must for his part he he put out it sweat after resell bran put out his statement saying of corse they don't the competition meaning this is why the media are going after him and he says i support mussels brand that man is not evil tucker crarlson said the same things had criticized the drug company's question the warning can can be pretty sure this is going to happen sure seems that way musk replied again the the media's decisions to go in a particular direction in cases this the pattern of who they go after who they do not is pretty obvious to every one which ironically enough under mine's actual credible allegations but also yo leads one to question why there doing this in the first place it will get to the rest of the

get started that w dot link to dot cold slash men ski meanwhile apart from the mussels brand to allegations which will continue i am sure to progress as the media covers them wall to all and one additional mother i should point out here that those of us who have always advocated for traditional sexual mores have been scoffed at n laughed up on the media for literally decades and it turns out the grip protection for both women and men is those sexual worries and only when mussels brand has embraced those are the media coming after him fullskill an hots engaged in transgression of the sexual mores he was a hero to the world the minute that he switches all the sudden the media are after him because this is one o the things the media love to do they're favorite charge is hypocrisy the the thing that they consider to be a crime in many cases they do not actual consider be a crime much of the behavior they discuss they are totally fine with it is when the person advocates a different standard morality even now ten years later that they say will he is a hypocrite hypocrisy you should recognize is not actually in attack on thebehavior hypocrisies an attack on the standard which presumably is why they are going out trussed branny as post when who is actually engaged in the behavior o cam meanwhile united auto workers are striking against the defrost three that be g m ford and stillantis they ware set to resume talks starting on sundae following the start of the most ambitious us industrial labor action in decades the first ism the you a w has gone on strike against all three automakers simultaneously is not coincidences that this is happening in the middle of jobidons administration it is happening for two reasons one the automakers are getting squeeze there getting squeezed because jobidon's new mandate that everybody shift to over to electric vehicles is creating mass of profitability problems at companies the are largely invested in gasp powered engines all these companies have built up their entire brands on making a portable and powerful gasp toward engines and now the bided ministration comes in in their trying to force all the automakers to completely shift their business model this cuts into profitability simultaneously you a w know that they have their man in the wite house jobiton is a union man who say he is a union man i my he has sympathy for the lions am mind he has bought and paid for by the unions and hasten since thin he seventy jobitdon has always bee a politician in the pocket of the unions and at they figure is they will get jobidon who cram down a settlements on the big three automakers where simultaneously unable to accept any of the deals tat are being propose not only because the demands are extraordinary but also because their profitability is being destroyed by the same began administration now siding with the unions as the walsterturnal editorial work points out shown fan narrowly want election as u a w president in march on a platform of new militancy against u s auto companies he now has the strike he appears to have wanted as the union simultaneously struck g m fort and glances on fridge for the first time in history fans said this thing boils down to one thing it is corporal greed the u a is calling walk outs to sleek plans to minimize how much it has to pay workers from its eight hundred twenty i million dollar strike fun while still causing pain for automakers puts bout greed but the w w is also not calling a strike of all of the people there justcalling astrict of some of the peoples that do not have to pay everybody m take wants a larger share of automate a profits but to trice big three ta is demands to make them less competitive against caretakers testlaht and lead to losses he wants a thirty six per cent pay in crease over four years a thirty two our work week thirty two hour work week what ism sorry who has at the what i mean if i i may not be a math genius but a thirty two our work wack is in eight hour day for days a week thirty to thirty two our work week in what world i come from a world win a forty our work week was the normal in eight our day five days a week thirty two our work with over time for additional hours the restoration of retiary help benefits which bankrupts all of these auto companies because again thus help benefits were benefits defined not contribution to fine and o find pen benefit mentions rattan for one cases and thy want cost of living adjustments s another words they want all the things the three automakers have raise their initial wage offers to increases between seventeen point five per cents in twenty per cent plus large one time payments and i prove that fringe benefits including time off but a thirty to our work week and restoration for retirement benefits for newer workers are non starters in many ways as the waster turn points out the strike is made in washington because of the bide administrations policy mandating rapid transition to electric vehicles the u a w knows e use require four workers to make and will jeopardize union shows making gas power cars but the companies already lose money on es and they worry about making too many concessions to the a w that will cause them to lose even more it is hard to overstate the costs of this coerce e v transition the bind administration with californium as coin forcer is mandating that e vs make up an increasing share of automaker sails two thirds by twenty thirty two californiand other progressive states plan to ban all new gas powder cars by twenty thirty five which by the way is not that fine the future it is twenty twenty three right now last year ex's made up three per cents of the trout automaker says i mean is amazing to think that jobiton has basically forced the automakers into this position and because again he is such a a bought and paid for union so the unions feel they can force these sorts of insane concessions down on the car companies harem jeoffreys again another democrat based union show ye he says that the we fighting for basic freedom which is weird s ain't thing basic freedom as of thirty to our work week and to find benefit pension plans i w haven't to destroy a little later on the her looking fort the standing i thoaverity with the no at it all the workers wo a fighting for the funomeno amercing tree wit ye

into some pretty strong head winds here the have got the jobidon impeachment coma farther by the way is saying that he is going to call hunter bison in any sort of impeachment action here he will be spent here was cemicarthy the speaker of the house saying just yesterday will you supper hunter bidinavin ton junior spend twenty hours therein haven even ans an ya e want i in they question him how cam you have not brought in hunter bit t first thing as i do not supper anybody i let come i forte i let committees do their work but think about this maria you would not know any of this if we were not in charge i i understand i in do you the one thing america public has the understand is there is a strategy behind everything we only follow facts hunter bid will get spent but wins the appropriate time do you do it because telibition wants it or do you do it around the facts in the timing when comer i think we should have the bank statements to actually know where did the money go you would know the questions to ask hunter bite by the way hunderbidon for his part he is responding to a all of this including the new gun charges against him by suing the caress over iris whistle blows who criticize the do ja probe and blew up his sweethartdeal in always getting all this money is we are just come of money to pays child suporpit es got plenty of money to sue the i as sets this interesting of all this would be very bad for the democrats the good news is for the democrats that the republicans again we are locked in a clash of stupid we are locked in it in it in a closet with a couple of morons just going at each other that is the democrat party and the republican party the republicans a stupid for a couple reasons their two things the make republicans in herentlandpopular a feeling of chaos and also when ever democrats can charge republicans with any sort of sexual hypocrisy it is their favorite thing to do soave not one but two stories along those lines four publicans first of course we have the crispy come story christinome who is the governor of south to koto apparently had a in absurdly blatant and public affair with hands trump ai quorloun dowry that is according to the our post i have sources of my own say that foeman no loony asker basely making the rounds being all cosy law months and months and montszigal publicly a ears walking interviews together and such according to the your post marry republican south to to to governor christinome has engaged a years long affair with long time tonal trump advisor quorum dowry who seems to be am a bit of a m he seems to be a wet letters gets around dusters apparently having a fairest with hopes while he was married with forbids and now he is having affair with christy come who also is married with kids apparently the para and less than to street about the relationship with one force ere calling a making out at a hotel bar at twenty twenty one sea pack which is a pretty grows it was not two a em h forces it was not we caught them in to dive bar miles way ts a lobby bar were everyone staying his a bejulian political operatives in journalist an elected round remember i saw with my own eyes and couple other people saw in the lateness was absolutely absurd the was enters one week after not a fifty one year old mom of three formerly indorse donate trump seventy seven for these twenty twenty four presidential nomination trump for his part by the way said even this week end that he would consider christy come for the vice presidential slot this is shortly after she endorsed him for the presidency obviously are you leading toward a woman i the concept but wit pic the best person but not the cons yes a lot of people knot wan governor know in worse to there for trump non i to you have her your i under i do i thin she en was ti he is en a great governor she gave me a very a full throated they do spent e beautiful an moment textually and the they do not seen a very good stay for m and telly she be one of the people like con side or for something else bey be but we have a lot of people i lot of great people of the re publican party yet m there is that we have christinom who apparently having a firth corn dowry a man who keeps som failing upward apparently and and then we also have lorn sober in the dumbest story of the recent pass lorn sober who the congress woman from colorado she a she apparently has a new you her newbeau is a person who owns s a bar that it stages drag shows occasionally s a gave friendly drawbar in canary twenty twenty assbeen gays weekend hosted an evening of cocktails appetizers and last at hooch which is the bar owned by quingaligar who is the the person who is canoodling with buyer a g again that is not the sandaled scandal here is that apparently buyer was caught on video getting frisky with alegar at a showing of needle news apparently she was raping and loudly singing during her viewing of needle news and then he was petting her breast and she was ism grabbing his hand to keep it there and apparently i there was some crochet behavior as well some crotch behavior as well and then when she was when the ushers came and they came to boot her there is a pregnant woman behind her who complain bout the raping she refuse to stop and that point the ushers came and got her and she said duo do who i am and then she apologized for a he her uncouth behavior chordate up to a recent split from mason her husband of eighteen years she says there is no perfect blue print for goth a publican difficult divorce which over the past yumonts had made for me a difficult challenging personal time in my entire family give tried to handle with strength and grace i simply fell short of my values on son up ism ism sorry no no n i there is there may not be a perfect blue print for going through a publican medical divorce it'd pretty sure that first on the list of things you do not do on the blue print is give people hardships in the isles a needle tusewhile they grab your breast in you tape pretty shirt's that now the reason i say this is not because i deeply care about lore buyer's sex life i really do not but the point is that as another one of these republicans who is supposedly standing up for family values i just non why do not republicans seemed to understand that when they present candidate wo engage in this sort of behavior it undercuts their position with the america public and i don hypocrisy charge i thing that pocks charge is stupid i think you can hold valleys that you yourself failed to meet i thing it happens pretty much all the taunt however running candidates and championing candidates who consistently do this in swing districts sober one her last race bylaw two hundred votes i do not know that that is a recipe for success this who say the re publican party they are the stupid party there is no question and hat that stupidity is extending over into this government shut down talk meanwhile the republicans are having internal fight now over a spending cot that would theoretically o very a government shut down according to bloomers loudspeaker commit earthy overtime week and pro posed to deal to temporarily vertigo government shut down with demands including in eight percent spending cot for domestic agencies and resumption of borer wall construction he presented that plans for publican law makers in a conference call on sundae evening after negotiators representing keep factors within the house t go be settled on those demands but it seems their munch republicans who are not ta who are not going to go along with the plants the plan here was we present ta plan for an eight percent government an big percent cot in spending and building som border wall in the middle of emigration crises in that wrong foots then ma cats because that is not an ask for forty per cent cut or seventy per cent cut it is a pretty reasonable ask jobitan eventually comes to the table he makes a go three per cent cut he refuses on the border and then we yell at him about how he does not care bout the boarder which is fairly decent politics instead and an politico right has an entire article about how this isn't going to a veto government shut down because bison will not give them any the organ will bison does not give them anything and and mac party's able to pass something then the ones moves to big another democratic senate to do something grope leaders told their members on a private call sundae night they hope to bring that plan to the floor on thursday according to multiple people listening the bill which would punt the next funding deadline toctober thirty first was drafted in the last few days by polish an of hard liners in the house from canvas and more generous members in the main street caucus the deal includes those across the board cuts to domestic spending exerting defense an veteran spending as well as disaster aid and would pave the way for republicans to pass a standalone fuller defense spending bill mhatwat would now happen on wednesday but a bunch of republicans have now said that here not on to go along with it because i can you have a collective action probenside the publican party if you are the person who shows the crowd that you are the purist this apparently means the win points this is one o the promise weakening parties the the strength that the prom with a strong party is the the party can crampon moderate policy on people who do not want it the pom with a weak party is that it has no capacity to hold together its members sufficient to prevent humiliations walking directly into walls s apparently the freedom canvas the mainstay cock is work this thing out and then apparently a bunch of people come outstay know that of course includes magnates whose entire agent in life apparently is to bring down cemocrarthes speakership mat rosandale of montane is opposing sos marry tailor green ye lie crane of arizona also their objections from a bunch of others presumably some of these people will have some goody's negotiated for them with that head now the fact that whenever whenever chaos is projected and an a and well a man fine whenever cars is projected to no apparent end because the democrats run the senate an triton is the president and they have a bit of a say in what ex aptly and up becoming law here republicans about this be consorted in the issues that you attack focus for a moment in time otherwise democrats are on to have something to run on and that is not what you want meanwhile donate trump did a mainstream media interview over the weaken i it did not go amazing for him his his recent interviews of popping going particularly while this one was with a christen weaker the most newsworthy thing that he said in this interview was he made a comment suggesting that heartbeat bills to protect the lives of the inboard in states are terrible which it is not only not pro life it is an awful thing to say it is one thing to say the tactically speaking as president of the united states ism going to tried to reach as much consensus as possible and gradually move the line back on abortion to accustom the america people to protecting life because if we move too far too fast then the snapback is going tore dramatic as we satin canvas that is it that is a pragmatic question andtht to case you can make that is not what trump says what trump actually says about a portion in this interview is morally egregious he s has that hard be bills do protect babies in the womb pas we five week sax those are terrible that is the thing he says e a general ban landed on your ask if you were reelactit would you sign it at often o men a complete ban i ban it fifteen wealth people people or starting to think of fifteen week sat seems to be a number the people are talking about right down you find at i would i would shutdown with both sides and i negotiate something and will end i with piece in that issue for the first time in fifty two years ism not going a would or i would not i mean to sink is pul is willy desire a five week and six went ben support that you n that tetwhathy less a terrible thing in a terrible mistake a terrible thing an a terrible mistake it is her in the state he is in talking federally in the state i that that is not a proline physician by any stretching imagination now ideas the trump supporters n ta say look you pointed three just to the supreme court they overturn row but the real question is is nounal trucking to make this a priority in his next term but in his last from ism with you what is gin to do in his next term and this should provide some folder for the distance seem to work with when it comes to for example sates i woe which are very very pro life mean the question is whether re publicans really care about policy at this point or whether they is can trust trump to do whatever hi'sgoing to do that is rally the running question of this campaign now meanwhile donate trump was asked about his efforts to overturn the twenty the results of the twenty twenty election by christian walker one the questions i keep asking peoples if they think that this race is run on this is that is pumpkin o win that race it is gin me difficult is gin make it harder for him could he wen that is sure because robin is a terrible president could he win maybe will he win if this is the chief issue that he is can be discussing and he loves discussing it is obviously would animals him i den no is it smart politics the most sing your lawyers in your own administration and on your campaign told you that after you would lost rule than sixty legal challenges that it was ember why did you adjure then and define to listen to a new outside because i did not respect them oud hirylayers her but that does opinion i you're i you never met these people you get a recommendation they turn out to be rooms a they turn out to be not good in many cases it didn't respect om there numerous books that were written or how the election was just to be clear weumistening to your lawyer's advice the reenlisting moron in ta i was listening to different people and when i ended it all up the election was rid there a book you lot a i shots that in fact molly hamming way rod a great boil were you coin a shot ultima listen molly hemmingwan n was highly respected and great she wrote it up book of the best selling book called rig were you calling the shotgun mister creation ultimately as to whether or not i believed it was rig was sure i it was my decision now he ism the reason she is asking him that is because that is the entirety of the ego case against him is that he was calling the shots ray now i thing the recon case is species i think the are serious problems in the legal interpretation annual's is putting fortune all the rest downhill true the this part of the danger here judges in the middle of bunch legal cases and he is being at about legal matters on national television i then tramples asked what he was doing during the capital riot now again this is legally relevant only in sofa belly do not things medically relevant but it is dude legal relevant in far as its part of jack smiths canary sixth case againstrump here is trump on what he was during during the capital riot the sheila she's we so we better ye did the a tan we to to i the sat we be better an ti we wen back to the what us just si you understand i spoke a materein i space combe how you watch the fell an o when you in the dining room watching ton e the the you it'll tell a people caterer an a pro wet just we under stand however what did you his let you hates in under tack that lemon just ta in a moment t can ye see the statements i made in the of the lost an just at did of the dovecotes absolutely we how hand that day or police so great we love our police love every body go hall ow we is see a we yo e ait for la to the a we n o en an do no three hours act wen ta tree an we put out before that o we is this is this going to be what what people want o hereabout in the twenty twenty four election and robin's a terrible president he is presiding over a terrible economy he is presiding over form policy disaster of for form policy disaster apparently a hundred and three traces ships were spotted around titan to day ism it is this what an be talking about s real question it'll gat time for some things i an than some things that i hate things that i it to day apparently according it to the daily wires manapristojocamo it seems that stepped very himself from behind bars may now be directing supporters to tank the rotten tomatoes audience review score of daily wire host o candid ownstoku her es convicting a murder avian is nephew break day or convicted of murdering photographer tries to how back back in two thousand and seven and of course they are featured in the brad new series from cantus convicting a murder which were butts making a

bad review this garbegin vitriol is not thou we need our community step up and let cannons now that stepped very is innocent the casebook post issued by the groups administrator on fidaynight then

nineties is now dropped all the way down to at last check in the sixties yah this out things are going in out the i do not while i this because it shows that stepped very if there is something that stepped very does not it is pretty obvious what it is here and that is that that canvas his documentary really puts the li to all of the allegations that he is wrongfully convicted e car her documentary really blows the lid off that particular story in the fact that stepped very abjures to be directing from behind barman efforts to take down the film tells you what you need to know about the value of the film a time for a quick thing that i hate apparently our f thirty five south fighter is stealth that time it is nowmissing why he just gone according to end my news a s fighter's tell fighter just stealth abilities appear to be working too well with authorities forced to ask the public for help finding an f thirty five the en missing somewhere over south caroling when the pilot

transponder is not apparently working worth noting that is a the f thirty five cost airplane the acquisition coss ray now or or somewhere between eighty and a hundred and fifty six million dollars who on that is not that is not ideal guys ye or our milaeverything's going well in the military which is we mark silly is still the had of the joincheves he is doing such a stellar drop he was asked over the week and about the military going wok meaning where you get flying ego be the keep plus minis divide by sin flags why is it that you guys or for example putting out ads talking about the value of individualism in the military is though that is what the military is all about why is it wiseguys doing get my training and margmilly is invent have never heard of this wok what is this woke that you speak of is the et military to wok not not at all am ism not en sure what that were truly means but i would ta it that the military i see is a military that is succeptsly strong it is powerful it is ready fact a readiness rates the way we mayor readiness's chatter now than they been in years that is som is it is the militia it is it is he does not now woke me aegis things are going amazing then he said that it is their obligation to start politics which is heard because silly keeps injecting himself into politics by talking about white rage and such you thought about resigning you did not i thought at the time it was a consideration of me but several people cancelled me in and they reminded me that that an officer commission officer resigning is the consummate political act and that it is our obligation o stay out of politics and if i were to reside then that would be great mistake in would be putting the uniform even more into politics i get the there is very little that can put margmilly's uniform more into politics quick reminder he did get a presidential accommodation from donate trump as who is leaving office on canary nineteenth already folks coming up again jump into

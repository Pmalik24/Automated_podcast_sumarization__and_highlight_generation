welcome to the superman ladpodcas discuss science sciencepace t s i manner superman and am professor of cardiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day is an ask me anything episode or a m a this is part of our premium subscriber channel our premium subscriber channel was started in order to provide support for this standard superman labpodcast which comes out every money and is available at zero cost to everybody on all standard feats you to applespodify and elsewhere we also started the premium channel as a way degenerate support for exciting research being done at stamford and elsewhere research on human beings that leads to important discoveries that assist mental health physical health and performance i am also please to inform you that for every dollar the superman lab premium channel generates for research studies the tiny foundation has agreed to match that amount now we are able to double the total amount of funding given to studies of mental health physical health and human performance if you to subscribe to the superman labpodcast premium channel please go to superman labor come slash premium it is ten dollars a month to subscribe or you can pay one hundred dollars all at once to get an entire twelvemonth subscription for a year we also have a lifetime subscription model that is a one time payment and again you can find that option at superman labor come slash premium for those of you that are already subscribers to the premium channel please go to superman labor come slash premium and download the premium subscription feed and for those of you that are not superman labpodcast premium subscribers you can still here the first twenty minutes of to day is episode and determine whether not becoming a premium subscriber is for you without further ado let us get to answering your questions the first question asks is it possible to get a cold or to get sick from deliberate cold exposure i suppose a related question is should you even do deliberate cold exposure if you have a sniffle a cold or a flue i get that question all the time as well s all answer both of those questions and i will also touch on some of the mine enhancing effects of deliberate cold exposure but just to make sure that we answer the specific question asked here right off the bat is it possible to get a cold or to get sick from deliberate cold exposure well assuming that you are not doing the deliberate cold exposure for more than say five or six minutes at one stretch probably not directly from the deliberate cold exposure i mention that because most people are doing anywhere from about a minute to three minute sometimes five or six minutes and maybe for those of you they're really pushing it ten minutes of deliberate cold exposure and most often after doing that deliberate cold exposure people are either getting clothed or their getting into a sauna or there taking a hot shower and then getting clothed and heading off into their day or off to sleep depending on what time of day or night you happen to do your deliberate cold exposure we can safely say that if you warm up after a relatively brief meaning one minute to let us extend out to ten minutes ten minute deliberate cold exposure although i really want cautioned people to not do ten minute deliberate cold exposure right off the bat if you are somebody who is not accustomed to it do not jump right up to that a long exposure to cold water start with shorter exposures but if you are doing that one to ten minute deliberate cold exposure and they're getting warm afterwards and heading about your day i cannot see how the deliberate cold exposure itself would enhance your susceptibility to getting sick that said we know from an enormous number of studies that have looked at cold virus transmission and other forms of viral and bacterial transmission that the environment that you happen to be in does impact your susceptibility to colds and other types of viruses and to bacterial infections in the following way there's been controlled studies in which people go into laboratories whose laboratories have rooms which they can very tightly control e humidity somesemcily the water content in the air as well as the temperature in the room and if you look at the total mass of those data we can say a couple of specific things and can bullet point fashion first off cold dry air does seem to increase our susceptibility to viral and bacterial infections because whether not your mouth breather or nosebreather and by the way i suggest everyone be a nosebreather unless your exercising hard enough that you have to breath through your mouth for your talking or something of that sort but if you are a nosebrather or mouth breather or both viruses and bacteria enter through your nose and mouth sometimes through your eyes but your nose and mouth are gong to be the insides of entry and your main barriers to viral and bacterial infections in fact one of the ways you are constantly fighting off bacterial an viral infections that your exposed to all the time is by way of those viruses and factory getting trapped in the mucus lining of your nose or your mouth most notably in the back of your throat if you spend time in cold dry environments there is a tendency for that mucosa lining to be thinner there is a tendency for that mucosa lining to not be as robust in general when i say robust what i mean is that if your mouth breathing for instance in a cold dry environment ism thinking i from the time i spent in a cartridge massachusetts in winter at the tea station f your ism just imaging myself cause it darn cold back there you breathing through your mouth or having got for run and your mouth is not covered or even if you are deliberately nasal breathing you are doing out your nasal passages and making them more susceptible to infections does that necessarily mean that every time you go out in cold dry air that you are going to get an infection now of course it does not but to relate this back to the question we have before there are a lot of data pointing to the fact that more humid warm environments are going to make your mucosa lining and the general upper respiratory area more i do not wat say immune cause i do not want to conflate that word with the other meaning of immune it is going to make it more robust against bacterial and viral infections ay if you get into a cold shower or a cold plunge or a cold ocean or a cold lake and then you get out in you are out there now shivering and shaking trying to booster metabolism whatever it is that you are doing it for and it is cold dry air and especially if your mouth breathing in that cold dry air yes i could see how that might lead to a higher probability of getting a cold or other type of infection but there is nothing specific about the deliberate cold exposure itself that can induce a cold or other type of infection assuming that the water is clean right where not time out bacterial infections of cuts on the skin et camera ore talking about cold and other forms of being sick namely upper respiratory infections now with that said bi often get asked whether not for people who already have a little sniffle their feeling ill run down or perhaps a lot run down should they do deliberate cold exposure and what is a little tricky to give a one sizes fits all answer but i think we can safely say that if you are feeling mama's if you are feeling you have to rest you are tired you are not feeling good because of a cold or because of a flue or because of a bacterial infection ay ism not saying just feeling not good ism saying feeling not good due to a cold or other form of virus or bacterial infection then i would say stay out of deliberate cold exposure do not use it now why would i say that given the still talk about in a few minutes showing that regular deliberate cold exposure if done correctly can in fact increase immune system markers and perhaps even o make you much more robust to combating different types of infection through the release of a drennoline will talk about what all that looks in a moment interns of protocols in some of the science but to just be very clear and very direct if you are sick stay out of deliberate cold exposure there i would instead recommend warmer hot baths warmer hot showers the sand et camera but i also would caution that if you are getting intusanas that are too hot you knowsanas they're hot that it is stressful for you and again the lot of people use deliberate heat exposure because of the stresses induces there doing i some heat induce for instance heat shock propenes and different ways of increasing heartwrahte that is a different sort of thing that is hard stressful in order to generate an adaptation i do not recommend doing that in fact i do not recommend doing deliberate cold exposure exercise or deliberate heat exposure if you are feeling really not well now if you are feeling just a little bit not while you are feeling a little bit run down little bit of sniffle we will bit of malaise well then it is kind of an edge case where we could say are i it just tick a hot shower and go to sleep that is probably the best advice i the good old fashioned advice but if you are determined to do your deliberate cold exposure anyway then i would say definitely get warm or take a hot shower afterwards hot bath or a hot sand but not too it that it is stressful of course and keep in mind that one of the variables that is been measured quite a lot in laboratory studies of deliberate cold exposure is the increase in a mine system markers it'll provide a few links to some of these studies ism although nowadays there are many many of them but it is very clear that deliberate cold exposure kin increase the release and the production of different immune molecules in immune cells one slightly older study but none the less a good study that has relevant here is entitled a mine system of cold exposed and cold adapted humans i keep in mind that the study is a little bit extreme and there are reasons for that i guess to make a long story short oftentimes in order to coteqsea an effect in a study scientists will use conditions that are pretty extreme compared to control group oftentimes you will see a dose response to but it's a little but tricker to do with a human studies of deliberate cold exposure it can be done but not too common but here they used a pretty what i recall extreme stimulus it was exposing people to fourteen degree celsieus water that is fifty seven point to degrees farenheit which is not that cold it is as o cool i was a very cool water but not whet you might consider cold depending on how well you tolerate cold and that will vary of course but they had people exposed to that for an hour which the pretty long time you most people as i mention are using colder temperatures of deliberate cold exposure even high thirdease low protease maybe upper forties for anywhere from one to ten minutes depending on how conditioned they are and again do not just jump into ten minutes of deliberate cold exposure please om et thirty five degrees or forty degrees or even forty five degrees if you are not familiar with deliberate cold expose you have to ease into these sorts of things over time and if you are interested in protocols for deliberate cold exposure we have a zero cost news letter at he human raped rock calm go to the menyugo news letter and you can find that we have done several episodes on deliberate cold exposure in any event this study an man system of cold exposing cold adapted humans as i mention had people in fourteen degree cellulous water for one hour and easily what thy found is that one exposure to cold did not change immune system function in any kind of significant way however what they found was if people did deliberate cold exposure repeatedly over a period of about six weeks and by repeatedly i mean three times per week what they found were trees and again trees are not statistically significant but trees towards increases in plasma concentrations of things i six interlunar six or total numbers of tea emphasizes and tea helper cells and t suppress or cells and activated tea and be emphasize these are all immune cells and immune molecules that roughly correspond to an increase in immune system function if you to learn more about the immune system i did episode on a mine system function an again you can fine that at subhuman labedout come an it spells out the basic cell types of what is called the innate and the adapt of immune system this study which we will link to in the shownote captions is but one study of several other studies showing that deliberate cold exposure can increase immune system markers especially when deliberate cold exposure is done repeatedly over time this case three times a week over a period of six weeks but again i want elite these are not highly significant effects these are trees in the direction of increased numbers of immune cells anemone markers now what is impossible to know is how those trees translate to actual resistance to specific concentrations of say cold virus or flue virus or any other virus or bacteria that would be great but that is a very difficult study to do especially in the contacts of deliberate cold exposure as well now we can all be scientists about this and say what is it about deliberate cold exposure that would increase immune system function and there we can confidently say the molecules epinefran and foreman earn which are released in both brain and body in response to cold water exposure as well as things deliberate hyperventilation the release of norupan ran and find ran into the brain nobody is known to have a number of different effects relate to the immune system it can be pro immune at least in the short term and in the long term meaning if nor adrenalin and adrenaline again those are just different names for ninepin ran an en earn ism sorry those the same thing but that is why use them interchangeably that you do not get confused if you see nor adrenaline or norepineran as the same thing you hear pin ran or adrenaline same thing deliberate cold exposure or deliberate hyper ventilation will increase those molecules norupin ran an pin earn and their increase is pro immune cancriger the activation of immune cells anemone molecules that can make you more resistant to certain forms of infection however if norupan ran an find earn are elevated chronically and especially if they are elevated late in the day repeatedly over many many days that can cause reductions in the number and efficiency of immune cells in combating infections getting cold in this context of whether not you can get sick from it should really be considered more as what happens when you spike your adrenalin an norepineferan and there is one other study that we can look to which is now really a famous study publishing proceeds o the national academy of sciences looking at called whimhoff breathing but really that just translates to cyclicly hyperventilation this is inhaling through he nose calling through the mouth repeatedly twenty five times or if you do that is you feel quite warm as to do with some things relate to vasodilation as as to do with release of nor up an earn an up and fen we know that pattern of deliberate hi proventilation much deliberate cold exposure deploys or releases nor adrenalin and a adrenaline into your brain and body and we know from this study entitle voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system and a tentation of the native mine response in humans showed really nicely i think that if people are injected with cold rat a bacteria tsishaly end they did this through endotoxin injections people got really sick they get feel the ad the flue they vomit diarrhoea get a fever et camera however if they did the sorts of breathing that i talked about just a moment ago prior to that they were able to ward off a lot of the symptoms associate with the endotoxin infection and you its i oke wile their r mine system just fired up and they were able to fight it off but it is trickier than that actually what happened was the release of epanefran and nor pan ran from cyclicly proventilation which is really what really is cyclic yperovenilition also call which breathing also costume breathing et camera that actually had a suppressive action on certain arms of the immune system in a way that allowed people to avoid symptomatology such as ever nausea et camera and we would imagine the same thing would occur with deliberate cold exposure done prior to bacterial infection or viral exposure if you are sensing that ism saying two things at once i am ism saying deliberate cold exposure and syclicipreventilation can both cause deployment of molecules such as pin efferent and more up an effect that lead to enhanced o mine system function if done repeatedly ism also saying that increasing your pin efferent an eperatan affray too much can suppress your immune system in the study the pianist study that mention a moment ago that suppression of the man response was actually one of the reasons people avoid symptomolgy but they were still injected with into toxins they just were not fighting off the endotoxin with fever remember fever's in adaptation to fight infection is designed essentially to heat up the infection and kill it what are we to take away from this here are what i think or the key take always one if you are feeling good to great do your deliberate cold exposure and perhaps do not worry much about using your body's natural metabolism and thermogenic abilities to heat back up afterwards but i do not suggest any one ever allow themselves to say really cold after deliberate cold exposure for more than ten fifteen meets or may be half an hour right get bundled back up or put on clothes if it is a nice hot sunny day get out in the sun and warm up get temperatures and conditions will vary for different people different locations et camera if you are not feeling greatly feeling a little run down and you really want to do your deliberate cold exposure do it but then warm up really well afterwards maybe en drink some in a hot tea or other fluid afterwards as well and if you are not feeling good your feeling always your feeling run down despite what you read about deliberate cold exposure or cyclic preventilation allowing for the deployment of immune molecules are increasing the number of immuncilles that you are making avoid anything that is stressful or challenging whether notes a cold challenge a heat challenge or an exercise challenge when you are feeling run down because under those conditions what you really want to do is slow your circulation down probably find to take walker something provide you are not doubled over in bed and you vomiting i things that you'd a little bit of movement probably good to circulate your blood but in general the advice that you get to rest when you are sick and not push yourself that is really good advice because you want all of your bodies resources to be devoted to getting over that infection and if you are interested in sickness and sickness behavior and the sorts of behaviors that can combat infection check out the episode i did on the immune system we will link to it in the show note captions because it talks about how when we have a viral or bacterial infection a whole set of brain circuits get activated that that encourage us to be more in the female position to move last to be eyes down to coypu know slump down that is not a coincidence that is because of the activation of these called sickness circuits that are really designed to help you heal yourself i both apologize end one of the could say sorry not sorry do not apologize for the somewhat nuance answer here because a lot of information out there says oh cold boosyurimiun system and yet that is true under certain conditions it can also to pleat yourimiune system and limit your ability to fight off infections under other conditions and perhaps the last thing to say about this is that i am a big believer in using nasal breathing whenever you do not have to breath through your mouth if you are exercising hard by all means great through your mouth if you do marshal parents and it requires that you break throughout mouth go head and do that but if you are doings says own too cardie we level cardie or you just walking along it is very clear based on a growing amount of day ta the being a nasal breather is better than being a mouth breather and there a number different reasons for that we have talked about on the podcast and elsewhere but one of the additional reasons is a inside of entry for infections is through the mouth keep that mouth shut unless you need to talk thank you rejoining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the superman labpodcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to superman labdodcom slash premium just to remind you why we launch the superman labpodcast premium channel truly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard superman podcast channel which of course will still be continued to be released every money in full length we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard suberin labpodcast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which h we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all changes superman labpodcast an other media channels the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that lose kinds of answers in the first place now in especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way the they're going to amplify whatever fun come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the humeral premium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the a m as you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well there will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the a m as and various transcripts and protocols of superman labpodcast epic side's not found elsewhere and again you will be supporting research for mental health physical health and performance you can sign up for the premium channel by going to superman labia calm slash premium again that superman labia calm slash premium and as always thank you for your interest in science

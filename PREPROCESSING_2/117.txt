burning man gets it by biblical flooding and we examine the cultural fall out the poles get uglier for jobidon and upon muscles up against the anti defimationly i mentor of this is the enchguro so the benchpirishresponserba press we pin protect your alpine privacy to day expressly pianticom lashes it is rare to see actual biblical level evens taking place in normal everyday life but that is exactly apparently what is happening over at burning man now have ignored burning man successfully for several decades of this point because frankly it siren couch a weirdos but in the desert being weird with each other i and that is pretty much what it is apparently for those who have not been following burning man was found it back in nineteen eighty six is according to the richest taco when a small group of friends gathered to burn a nine football statue on the beach in san francisco as bought imagine no weird people each year hormone people attended the on fire and then they actually moved it over to the neat desert and to now it is held in black rock city a temporary community erected by the thousands f attendees who construct the gatherings infrastructure news it using nothing but their own tools and equipment nothing apparent is sold that burning man is one of the her communistic properties of it instead they they sell i coffee and water and everything else they barter or gift first of all you have to ask why their selling the cold your water the answer s because you cannot provide supply unless there is actual monetary demand it turns out capitalism is great at getting things from place a to place be for an affordable price and communism sucks at pretty much everything for many at tender known as burners the events is about providing a space for counter cultural expression as were going to examine however one of the weird elements of the united states the the counter culture is no longer a counter culture it is just the culture in the counter culture in the nineteen sixties the weirdos from the nineteen eighties whore gathering on beaches and building giant burning men and all the rest of us those people we all used to consider strange now if you say that they are weirdos ho are participating in weird agonistic behavior you are considered strange your considered part of the problem you're in tolerant the counter culture is no longer the counter culture it is in fact just the culture which is why for example you see many rich and famous people now going to burning man it used to be that if you are rich famous person you took yourself seriously enough that did not show up in the middle of the desert with nothing but a hammer and then expect to basically just go t the orgy coma all day it used to be that the serious people in our culture were actual serious people in our culture they go way back to the age of the tycoons when you are looking at john rockofeller and you are looking at banderilla these were people we are at least pretty serious about their own lives but the reality is the counter culture has now become the culture and the way that you win cultural case is by participating in a agonistic set of values that actually is in complete contradistinction to the actual values you live out is a point that that charges hurray mad in his great book coming apart which is that all of the neck billionaires who show up at burning man and then proclaim hat they have allegiance to the sorts of principles actually in their own lives reject these sorts of principles its just everybody else who picks up the principles and hen it becomes the culture in which they win bandit is really really bad it is true whether you are talking about her agonistic versions of communist am the your seeing at burning man or whether you are talking bout single motherhood which is practice by nearly no one in the sickbay area but given the moral green light by every one in the tack o bay area and there is something weird about the fact that these weird hippies burning crap on the peace suddenly turned into billionaire driving storage in toads participates in building a garbage city in themiddle of nowhereand then having sex with random which is effectively what burning man is according to the richest do come in recent years many long time burns have resented how the festivals growing popularity has changed the experience they say on read it posts about the new class of burner consisting f s celebrities internal influences tbuillioners melon musk and market zuckerberg it is true by the way that again unlike in the past when everyone who is poor aspired to be rich and what that meant is that if you re poor year spared to all to imitate the life stales of the rich and famous which mean that if you go back to the the photos of the great depression people are standing in line for they're tickets for their food and they are dressed in suits now you have the richest people in er society wore tempting to dress homeless people to prove to have everybody else while learning billings of dollars that they actually despise the billings of dollars the earning a culture that hates itself cannot long survive by the way what you see in terms of the actual staffs from burning man is that in two thousand six fourteen percent of surveyed burners listed their personal income as a hundred thousand dollars or more by twenty sixteen that number had almost doubled to twenty eight per cent the survey or added a three hundred thousand dollar plus personal income category and that now represented three point four per cents of ale the people who are showing up at burning meant and by the way they are cheating it used to be that if you showed up a burning man basically shut up a muntraply would an a hammer and now if you are a rich person you show up at a turn key camp according to washable these offer luxury amenities cleaning staff and sheets while reportedly rocking a havoc on the environment by charter flights to get there the entire thing was supposed to be this hippy gathering were you bring what you have and you give what you was and you receive from others wore generous and now it is turned into a bunch of rich people who want to pretend that this is what they are where actively just paying people to set up basically clamping in the desert which is amazing it is totally amazing in two thousand nineteen burning man c yo marrying good wrote show was stunned by the growing commodification an exploitation of blackcock city and burning man call r sone one hand you can take capitalism allays winds than no matter what everything and up commodify because human beings are driven toward doing less work and being able to compensate people for the work that they are doing they capitalism always what the other way to you this is that again you have entire elevate strata of our society that hates itself and the it is constantly seeking to signal to everybody else how much it hates itself by doing things going to burning man there not seeking to exemplify the behavior that everybody els should engage in and if they do they believe that behavior should apparently be this hippies garbage and we should all basically just laugh and and giggle along with them as they go to the the pleasure dome that has been set up in full sodomingamara style according to burning man coo marring girls stead whether it is commercial e photo should product placements or histogram post thanking friends for a useful item a tenders including fashion motels and social media influences are wearing and tagging brands in their play photos this means they are using black rock city to increase their popularity to appeal to customers an to someone stuff black rock city requires significant in vestments to time energy and resourcefulness she said pard what makes burning man unique and powerful that every one has to work to be there i i do love again the facts that all of these rich famous people are showing up and doing histogram photos for pop eyes right de g ti blood to sender into burning man and twanineteen on a pop eyes branded plain and came out with two plastic bagsfilld with dozens of chickens ice its and then he remarked in social media vendees your move som celebrities ore different ma these bealaccusns run who famously drank the ashes of psychologist and leste advocate tithe leery when

what good did do it apparently and i i i get to i get to say that because the left does this all the time right the the left acts as though in a hurricane hit is flora is because of the great send that we have all committed in driving cars and running our air conditioners i also get to make a joke about how ism if a bunch of morons decide that they are going to jet set into the desert in the middle of nowhere where its a hundred and fifteen degrees to screw each other and then there is a giant rain storm biblical style that floods them and no one bothered to bring enough wood to build an ark sorry i get to joke about you guides your own fault o gay here are the principles that that is what kind of happen here are the principles of burning man they are written in two thousand four bi confounder very garvey this is a religion it is a religion and just goes to show you that in an ear out where actual religion to lines traditional judo christian religion lines other forms of religion supplant it whether that is political polarization and following a the great leader or whether is this sort of agonistic hippy crap that your seeing over at burning man radical inclusion is one of the principles any one may be part of burning man we welcome in respect the stranger no are requisites exists for participation in our communities first of all not true have you show up in your bible thumped i guarantee you aren't can be welcome over a burning man where they have a giant dome where no one has showed but there all havensects with one another that is an actual i keep mentoring mentioning this ogive this obviously is the most famous part of burning man is the orgy dome which according to coma polite is is visited by five thousand people every year re just show up with a bunch of random and a and the you screw them and this is the this is the height of human experience apparently radical inclusion apparently we not really tolerate anybody who has you know base line moral standards in a traditional way a gifting burning man is devoted to acts of gift given the value of a gift is unconditional gifting does not contemplate a return or in exchange for something of equal value first of all again backs the radical inclusion point if you just include everybody who is a leech another are living off gifts with no expectation of any sort of return it is not going to work because again the stuff does not existed scale the actual real rule o burning man i would assume is that if somebody gives you something you give them something in return which is what we used to call trade i w use to call that thing capitalism but instead o in ta pretend that when i give you something and you give me something and the real reason were doing it is because of course avid us take something from you and a and i never give you anything known will every give something to me again or can ta pretend that that is communism now de commodification in order to preserve the spirit of gifting our community seeks to create social environments that are unmediated by commercial sponsorships transactions or advertising oops well that did not work it turns out that people saw a giant group people there and a and it is now can it it is old fashion cool burning men ism on a group chat with munch of folks who are kind of talk end of millennial age and there ye i remember when this use to be the cool thing and nuts bunch people who are forty to years old ore showing up the average age burning man has been rising and recent years use to be the thing for due ass twenty one youroles to do and you nice the thing for a people trying to recapture the feeling of being a due asked twenty one youarale but there actually forty two divorced and have aged and that that is what burning man has become radical self reliance burning man encourages the individual to discover exercise and rely on their inner resources well we saw ha that went ill get it that momentarily how we they relight on their inner resources to be stuck in the mud for days at a time complaining came they were to located a few miles away for a freeway radical self expression radical self expression rises from unique gifts of the individual no one other than the individual or collaborating group can determine its content it is offered is a gift to others in this spirit tho giver should respect the rights and liberties of the recipient why is not that is not that nice radical self expression out what i is the proviso there the proviso there is that your radical self expression makes no demands on others it makes no demands on others well ye except for the fact that radical self expression as a for value system require the acceptance approval and tolerance of others clearly is their limits to radical self expression communal effort our community values creative to operation and collaboration we strive to produce promoted protect social that works public spaces works of art and methods of communication that support such interaction have you see all the amazing works of art the come out a burning man in i man other than the cuties we value civil society the civic responsibility community members who organize events should a some responsibility for public welfare and endeavor to communicate civic responsibilities to participants they also must assume responsibility for conducting events an importance of local state and federal laws oh there is legal liability that attached also leaving no rats that turns out this one they just do not do the see our community respects the environment we are committed to leaving no physical trace of our activities wherever we gather we clean up after ourselves and endeavor whenever possible to leave such places in a better state than when we found them which of course is wildly untrue it turns out that burning man has had a bad history of the past for years of just leaving garbage strew along the highways as people corner out of there as fast as possible this of core the no shock go back to the occupy wall street days ad all the socialist lattes we camping out in the parks in network city bandit was just a wilderness of criminality drugabuse and trash andthenyou went to the tea party right allthese people who supposedly hate the environment everybody the tea party picked up after themselves no one hat occupy picked up after themselves because again it turns out that only respect ford the communal values that you actually share would require you to do this thing and any community founds at on radical self expression an want get a lot of free loaders and people who free ride participation these the final to principles right not ten commandments colic thou shall not kill tho shall not can nap tho shall not commit sexual sins that shall i can in adultery are none of those things a got those none of that none of that matters right that the things that actually matter here our things participation our community is committed to a radically participatory ethic we believe that transformed of change whether in the individual or in society can occur only through the medium of deeply personal participation we achieve being through down every one s in voted to work every one is invited to play and finally immediately immediate experience is in many ways the most important touchstone value in our culture which of course is something that has been completely doneaway with because if you look a burning man is just t munch of series is an endless series of series for ever stamping on the human face for ever son just a second will at we will talk about what god wrought cause it turns out om it did not end well this year is the fire festival its that momentarily first as you ay know i may big man of our friends over at genuses have known about genuses for literally years my back in twenty thirteen when i was doing a local morning show in low s angels genuses and advertise r on that show and then i stop doing that show and my family continued to use genuses products because they are just that good fella from rockford says i have both age went back me spots and the stuffs actually fading both of them this serum is worth every penny hello rases about the famostark spot correct or from genusellsto must have after months of record heat and humidity sun spots brownspots dis coloration even red in place patches they all disappear in front of your very eyes it is really useful down herein flora we got really ho son this summer genuses products they can really really help is why my mob my wife i use them as well there is the genuses amazing guarantee you will see result sundae one rear moniyback to got nothing to lose take advantage genuses most popular package which now includes the darkspock corrector plus the class i genuses bags in puffing his treatment and immediate effects all about seven person off so con tried by skin carrion the world yourself completely is free it is simple but you genuses dock come slash chipper start looking years even decades younger to morrow say good but to dark and liver spots this bags and puffiness under the eyes cross to genuseldock come slashepeary got nothing to lose its great product go to genuses do cam slash spire g and you see yell dot come slash chipper okay once again you have an ethos that is based on radical individualism and in which people are not expected to do anything for anybody else but at the same time your expected to do everything for everybody else the contrast the ten commandments of burning man with the actual ten commandments things respect thy father and mother remember the sabbath and keep it holy do not commit murder do not commit adultery do not commit idolatry do not commit dislike one of these set of rules has built a civilization that is last day and been successful for literally thousands of years the other set of rules lasted a heavy rain storm maybe the maybe the story of now's ark is that maybe the rain won all that heavy here is the rat t here is theoretical heretical view to day the railway not all that heavy is just the society was not all that durable maybe that is really what we are finding out right now here is what happened over at burning man according to the a p in unusual latesummer storm turned a week long count er culture fest into a sloppy mass with tens of thousands of party for stuck in foot deep mud with no working toilets in the northern of vat a desert some burning man reveller say sundae their spirits remain in broken unfortunately their toilets do remain broken and there just sitting there worse in there in their own poop croon each other sound sounds lie the most the height of human experience somebody did die but apparently that that is happened before there is a guy a few years ago who burned himself to death to he threw himself on to the burning man or something an in any case it was not because of the bad weather organizers closed the festival to vehicles after one death was reported offs officials provided no details the fatality the gut and drown r anything the annual gathering in the black rock desert about a hundred and ten miles north of ran attracts nearly eighty thous in artist musicians an act this for its of wilderness camping and anon god performances disruptions are part of the festivals recent history organizers had to temporarily closes entrance s in twenty eighteen do to dust storms the event was twice cancelled altogether during the pandemic i love this more than half an inch of rain fell of the festal sight on fridge disrupting this years we weight half an inch half it weight not half a foot maenadic half a meter half an inch this much rain fell this much right here and do woops everything velapart more than half inch of rain possibly closer to one inch feel this wee can in parts of north western ovate that includes the area where the burning man festival was being held road closers came just be are large would not effigy was supposed soave been burned on sturdy night the easily is the story of elite hratalogi series lo khakis take your genet would not sacrifice and see if it will burn sacrifice god will you touch it no rain sun ten good times president mobile and told reporters in delftware he is aware of the situation at burning man the white house is in touch with local officials gan thing i making fun of here is that the people who are most interested in this it is become a blitzing glamor festival this the part that is truly fascinating an make union a hippies in the desert that is easy picking but when those hippies involve chemist famous people in our society and these most famous people ane are society are suggesting that there is something to this value system that is worth noting that is something worth noting that a a value system that that things that orgy domes and not showering and building crap in the desert that you just then leave there that this is somehow a form of higher living and in the absence of god paganism rules it is not that there is no god its that many gods rule and those gods typically involve self worship which is really where where things currently stand good news dipso was there again i do not know if he had his pops plan in tell apparently not chis rock was also there and a they escaped they escaped from black rock lines as a fan a from chis rock and i a ride out of the burnt after walking six miles through the mud all chis could think about was an effing cold grew well that is that is some heavy stuff there the other part of this that is hilarious is that obviously was not biblical flooding obviously thank god tens thousands people did not die and yet every person who is there this is why say the idolatry is actually just idolatry of thyself everybody there is treating this as though they escaped the beaches at normally or something i this what they are treating it it is it is truly an amazing amazing thing for example kneel cat yell who you will remember as a supposedly serious legal analyst see a put up a picture of himself talking about the incredibly herring journey out of the burning man festival apparently people said that they could walk about five miles from the festival sight to the nearest town of airlock were shuttle busses would take them torero first of all can i should point out that five miles is not a lot of territory it is a flat desert take a little water and five miles that the winding my goodness he said quote it was an incredibly heroin six moulthike at midnight through heavy and slippery mud but i got safely out of burning man never been before i now is fantastic with brilliant art and fabulous music except for the ending ah a the these are most serious people that guy was the acting solicitor general under barockabama that the acting slicers that the guy who they have on amisenbuse everyday talking about the legal threats to donate trump and how the rule of law must be upheld was tat burning man whining about his to walk five miles in mud because he put himself there because they have forged you dome or something how old is nail patrol by the way ism need a nil catch it is fifty three years old a to put a politely growl the far gopduede wow o say will get to more on this insanity and just one second because i find this endlessly fascinating on n about you but toff it is my show we gets see firs when you by a house or in apartment you really she look at the way that the light

the have emerged from burning man are truly horrifying people standing in mud people are worriedabout trench foot because hiyhave to walk around in the mud over there again in wen point out the people who have attended include not only you on us but eff basis and tinsmith this is the part that is totally crazy to me we need a better class velvet we do you wonder why people do not trust helmet you wonder we there is a giant cultural gap between say the left coast and the east coast and everybody in mill country people still go to church look at the stuff the you more on went out inthemiddle of the desert to worship to worship your pagan selves an then got stuck in the mud rough ride for you really really truly if full bat but this is the point the cultural arbiters a not on the side of these called culture they're on the side of the counter culture and this is the important point burning man's values or it is pseudo values represent the actual prevailing mind set for many of the powerful in our society wool yo will try to boil down the trump phenomenon to well the side really tariffs or dona trump you want to build a wall on the border or donate trump it is really about subsidies to industrial towns in oho that is not what dona trump its about what donate trump itsabou is about a cultural system that used to be called the is rational culture of the united states he is not personally represent of that but that is what the trump movement represents and those people have been dispossessed of the video christian architecture that use to undergird the united stats o america and heave been dispossessed by a bunch of pagan m or on who believe that the actual value system is radical self expression in individualism now this does unite some of the great capitalist of our era because there are many of the great capitalist are yo it used to be that every one sort of understood particular the great capitalists that undergird in capitalist was not judo christian value system actually understood this fairly well atomsmith that his theory of moral sentiments came before his wealth of nations but the the great early tycoons these were people who went to church on a regular basis these were people who actually who actually were were interested in what happened around them a who took there there responsibilities as human beings seriously ai mention johnny rockfeller but but johnny rock fellow's a great example this at guy who went to a church and he sat in the pus next the people who were a fraction of his wealth what used to unify the country was a belief system that the lets held in common with the common man it was the same belief system over all the it was the radicals who are proclaiming the decreed of of radical self expression but now's not the radicals notice the most powerful people in the society who have basically decided the reason thy became powerful is because they followed their star but that is not really true again if you look tat the people who are most successful in our society they did not followed their star to the tune of i will ignore basic values educating myself or living a actually responsible likest out in the main a marks ockerbrig's a married guy with multiplies and that is true for most of the people who are actually high burners in america society they're actually more likely to be married with kids than peoplewho are not high burners in america society but they prommelegate the values of the low an when say the low i mean they hippies that commodore burning giant nine foot statues and that says something and the kick back to that is a munch people who are angry at the fact that they have other value system supplanted and insulted and derided by people whose main focus seems to just be tearing things down i mean burning man is actually an excellent metaphor you build a man and ten you burn him that is it that you build radical individualism represented by giant nine football idol and then you burn it because what does humanity matter if all humanity is ta piece of meet wandering through the universe with hedonistic impulses it is only when human beings are connected to a higher value system when here connected with the divine value system of some sort that they become worth more than a block a wood that you burn weren't orgy dome i dis connects human beings from at tells this it dis connect them from a from a a purpose a higher purpose and when you wend up with is burning man i live in the moment immediacy of experience radical individual self expression and then half an inch mud an your don't you are you are done you are host non that there is something to be said you it is amazing that to the way the organizers here decided to tell people to handle this thing is ism to get themselves wood blocks and poor buckets a gringo we an and i come the first time at mash maultseva attended burning man the annual ephemeral city that attracts thousands of free spirited revellers in the evaded desert she over pact i prepare for may be three month you recalled i read a the packingless all the redithreads all what is hapchaps preparing for burning man but this were when heavy rain trains forme therefore thanuinto a muddy mess that forced to tender to shelter and place and can serve precious re sources mountsavel was not is prepared she became one of about seventy thousand people stuck at the event when black rock desert received over two months worth of rain in just twenty four hours the storms from the deserts and into sloppy slippery clay the made it impossible for drivers to exit or enter several lance is one of the events for principles with organizers emphasizing the participants are ultimately responsible for their own health and safety that meant that dome they had to wear trash bags on their feet and meant also that they were told to i to bring poop buckets in case the rain made the portapodies in operable the website recommended a five galling utility bucket with a lid and garbage bagginess this said a great civilization to you sounds a great civilization to me here is festival attend avid date describing the absolute carnage in the desert what is been most difficult a a fact of this leather and anything crap there is ta the most difficult but back ta you upon a mount look to this the problem a is ta the conks up to wok tom one we shows up to this valet lot then other than e are and there tallish an gold gentian ta awkward copy they folkway no thing to this community they do not add anything to this city you've tho t e people that are needles it leading the trash you creating a crisis from which burning man in not or vive that is they sad story i cannot i cannot believe the sadness well you mean that a a city that is built on free loading actually has free loaders to arrive one other note here no children of burning ten it turns out that we aren't that we are now civilization that is completely focuses on the adults and the reason the there not is a burning man aside from the fact that its radically an appropriate and apparently fearsome risk is the fact that if you live immediately in the women your not building for the future that is all point burning that is not building for the future and there they are times in olericulture where you take off in you focus in on just the moment read that is thistran agriculture but when you build an entire value system around that around whatever happens to morrow is not my business around why buildings for generational after all it is all femora build in the desert it'll be gone to morrow unless that is connected with a higher value system it means nothing it means nothing it actually is nihilistic we celebrate a holiday nudism that is coming up in in the very near future called scoot insist you basically do kind of burning man what you do is you build a hut outside your housing yothular suppose to live in it for seven or eight days the purpose of it is to remind you that you are at the mercy of god where you are supposed to actually you will build the hut such that you can see the stars an such open to the rain the he the whole purpose of it is to remind you that you are a physical creature but that there is something more spiritual to you right that it is not that actually that is not upmost represent the untidy of human experience it is one of the best holidays because the idea is the when you decorate all the physical surrounding around you that is not the essential you but what is the essential you its unit with god an the essential you is the divine you that is the part the matters just connect that and all you went up with his bunch of morons rolling around in the mud and then beg mad at each other one t after pupenabucket not quite the same thing can just one second here get the test polls on jobidon there is a reason that donate trump continues to lead the republican primary is not just because he is a

is truly stacked right now trump of course way the hell out in front one of the reasons for that is the main argument against trump has been a electability argument that is the main argument because republican voters the they really trump they a lot of what he did they are willing to overlook or may be embrace a lot of the for bulls and the crazy tweets in all that kennistuff certainly the is lot of warmth inside the republican party for trump but the only country argument be abut also he he lost it bison and twenty twenty and will probably lose again the problem is when the poles show that jo bison is absolutely weak that makes trump look a lot more durable inside the republican primaries suits well i mean i get both teethe things i one at once the guy who really on a personal level and also he can probably be bison which is what the re publican poles are showing right now inside the republican primaries now i have my doubts because i think the lot of the poles that we are seize wright now are over estimating for example minority support for donate trump under estimating that support for jobidon having a lot of democrats to wright now are saying thatched are wavering on bidder than o come home in the same way that a lot republicans who say they waver about trump are onto come home however it is jobidon's weakness that is leading to this impasse if voters overwhelmingly thing bison is two oles to run for reelection and give him lo marks for handling the economy according to latest waster journal pole the negative views of bison's age performance publicplain what only thirty nine per cent to voters hold of favorable view of jobidon in a supper question forty two per cent said they approve of how he is handling job well below the fifty seven per cent who disapprove and right now in a potential rematch or trumfersas bison rematch each of them has forty six per cent head ahead the journal survey points to a large set of challenges that bison faces in persuading voters he deserves reelection it also fines lot a weakness is in trump voters in the survey rated trump is less honest and likable than bison a majority viewed at trumps actions after his twenty twenty election loss as in legal effort to stop congressfrom declaring bison the proper winner but if you look at the disapprove numbers for jobidon on a wide ride misuse they are absorb devastating when it comes to in elation the disapproval numbers are well over sixty per cent say on securing the border when it comes to dealing with china just over thirty per cent o voters a prove nearly sixty per cent disapprove when it comes to creating jobs even there he is split e forty six forty six and right now in terms of handling of the warned crane he is registering in at a well over fifty percent disapproval furthermore seventy three per cent of voters say they think trump a biding is too old to seek a second term that is only forty seven per cent of voters who say the same of donate trump even two birds of democrats say that jobidon is too old to run again there is more in this pole that again bolsters trump and hurts bison by an eleven point margin more voters see trump rather than bison as having the record of accomplishments as president some forty per cents ait biding he a good record is president fifty one per cents say that trump had a god record as president by n eight point margin more voters said trump has a vision for the future by ten points more describe trump is mentally up for the presidency forty six per cent said that was true of trump only thirty six per cent said that of bison now what is amazing about that is that those numbers are really awful for jobidon truly truly garbage for jobidon you thing that if jobidon had numbers that low his republican opponent would be alike at fifty per cent fifty two per cent the problem is the dona trumps negatives are also superadd basically the america public thanks the dona trump committed criminal acts the ism not sing everyone ism saying that a plurality of the america public believes dona trump did e legal or at least morally bad things in the aftermath of last time's election and they'll ain't him personally but also they think that he is more competent than bison and they his record now that provides an opening to trump if he runs on his record but if the entire campaign is going to be about what he did after the election last time and his criminal case is that is going to be kind of a problem going ford into the election is what tony fobresio says he is a he pulls for super back that supports trumps is if this races about personality and temperament bison has an advantage if the races about policies in per romance trump has the advantage let me remind you right out that virtually all races and up being about per romance in temperament betas for about policies and per romance trump would of one in twenty twenty without a doubt again these are really bad numbers for kidnap it is those bad numbers for bison that are the are really strengthening dona trump inside the republican primaries was the electability argument basically goes away democrats cannot believe the join is pulling this low they cannot believe it because they live in an echo chamber whereverybody loves jobidon here is gorge stuff acropolis former lackey for hiellerto canton being quite shocked it is kind of shocking in away then the despite all of the baggage and dona trump carious he is tide which joined right now i ma to t when i look that that racon call the well street vernal a said all this could am up an look the people is and the biggest challenge we faces this democrats us say we because ism a democrat is said young votes young black coat tanovotis the not ready to combat to the pony there not even look in that the the call met sexton that is been sentinel about the economy about come change about student dead rely its again even democrats are stunned by his unpopular but it is not all that running jobidin is not a epithetic figure as we been pointing out for months on this program join is it good at his job ow i love the fact that jobidin trying to steer in to his age at this point but simultaneously denying that he is lazy which at this point in his life he is he is spent the last month on a cation well behind h was burning down my what is he do for living other than sit on the beach and then say words badly into a microphone than run away from the pass yesterday he was asked why he is in rohublif be juicy i certainly was not on vacation well then what the he young a hoof beach you go the for business ya case my my favorite part of this is also e does not just say it is hard to hear him but he says om he is not i vacation he is going to republic each because the other ha he he doesn't have have any other place to go it if his house were to burn down and ill hin our something i has it he is just that well what it what a victim he is meanwhile he flop to philadelphia to do a rally by a rally we mean once again he escape dot that you cans it after him an ever every every day with jobiton just feels an appointment in to morrow at this point any case jobidinam he at this rally was saying have been doing this longer than any one well yo we noticed by this i hope you mean corruption cause that is true soon sao that we o no ma sea i guess why e less what i cargo now can a cobias quit wisdom hah hanging confidence to i guess why i when i continue to do ell i mean one thing that does not come along with age is speaking english clearly that is a lot of mashed potatoes and outright there is e as o longing an age wheres me as solid stuffed tore from the present of the united states when my favorite things he says on the campantrouseway says people call me middle class job no one has ever called he middle class job literally no one that is never happened not once there is no on who is that go over there our on about that is middle class job i known call the idle class job cause he has not been middle class since he was ah hold that is why middle class job was making forty for thousand six hundred dollars per year when he first entered the senate at the age of thirty in inflation money that is three hundred twenty six thousand dollars a year middle class job i ass here we go folks all by top a topic ops ops i fortis middle class jo i guess they that that was a when e what that blast how not a compliments guess what that is why dot me do not sufficient a o is to class i me o work like cow o no wat you family has to work like comppaplement jobidne is a corrupt poll he is been a corrupt politician he is entire life he is not remotely middle class that do dons month million dollar properties he is not middle class that is absurd and he still also by the way whole at i owning whin the country looks down on the middle class just who is looking in the idle the only people look dow n themiddle class our people borakobama and jobidon in the more on to at burning man those of the only people there the people look i middle class mare as they are those of those rubes live in the life style remember is barakobama who is declaring that people to to republican because they're bitter clingers ore clinging to god and seen a pubic because they were losing their jobs its people jobidon look down on middle class jobidon is there to enrich his corrupt union bodies which has been true since literally he was elected to the senate he is been in the union's pocket since the day he entered the senate in delftware again ben shreckenger its in his book about the bisons that there is a very solid basis to believe that join one his first senate race basically at the bast of unions that that maybe illegally picketed a newspaper rent a sailor going out about him from his opposition in any case one my faverithings bout jobidon is that he actuates being promiddle class with being prove the heads of major labor unions which not the same thing it turns out that forcibly removing a piece of people's pay check and giving in to a bunch of union bosses then to lace corrupt politicians joins that can enrich their their funds is pretty amazing stuff this is a presumably why the acting a labor secretary ran out jury sue she is out their saying that jobidon he loves the middle class cause he loves labor that is it that he loves the unions your i notice the unions represent fewer an fewer members the middle class this a i noticed can he well what the administrations roll is in these negotiations to the ex that there is one at all yes think ye much semen is president is the most pro worker pro union president that we have had and that means economic policies that sent tor working people that a good for workers he has created at tight labor market in which workers and unions have more power to demand change in demand what is right for workers demand their fresher athebargin table amazing stuff again middle class jo in the pocket of the unions that is really went all bout and the only argument for jobidon at this point is that he is not trump burn sent is just said that out loud he is silly joins old the is bat at this job but at least he is not rump rite i have the republican party betting on at least he is not bison if the democratic party betting on at least he is not trump and only one party can be right here is burning making that case were looking in an president tod moment in a murk an history a goal trump is not only o the pathological lie as not only help wage and insurrection if you to of prevent president bind from thinking walks not only is the hang america democracy moving against the murk and democracy i think it this moment bog o we have got to ring the regressor community the jungle to ta yen want rigonof fight for regress of the jungle but we cannot have to for yeas a tot trumping t e infuse again that is all they care about and what you have is as jemgarity an natural you says a frozen battle fields republicans think that any one can be bison democrat's believe anyone can be t trump anterigan end up with trump bison in all likelihood right now meanwhile the medicine attempting to do their best to ensure that onto mantis and ever one else in the republican party remained secondary to non trump there doing in some cases verge lines rollingstone magazinewhich is not famous for it som for its honesty they wrote up a report suggesting that bunch of neonates marching in flora by bunch i mean fifteen marching and florid a representative of governor to stasis political supports according to rollingstones miss leading report that had some of the marchers individually express their distaste for dona from saying they prefer government flora governor rondo mantis and due and i and supposedly they said we are all the mantis supporters only one problem which is out which is not true which is not true at all here is the actual video that rolling sone was lying about the sing auto cantus right the thing sarcastically rollingstone left that part outs they can make it look as though all the notes in flora support to cantus which is weird things ins all the orthodox jaws in flora support to cantus up there is that that is all that is all going really well meanwhile over the week end jobidon stop by florid very briefly in the after m auto of of a hurricane that that ashy did not do it ferments manta damage thank god and the big controversy over the week and in florid was is not rondo mantis getting together with jobidon and the answer's here is no reason for him to get together with jobidon cordon was just going to stand there in saber about climate change what exactly is the purpose there is no actual fundamental obligation for a governor of a state of either party i do not any of these optic have talk the three years having install stupid but the cantus actually has a job to do he istle governor f the state jobidon is coming around to stand around look at things and wanderer round aimlessly bump into walls and talk about climate change a governor sanction on fridge there ware no plans for him to meet with jobidon contradict and comments that bid made earlier in the day indicating that they would the media immediately took this is a great insult to the honor of jobidon i will say this to his credit bison was asked about meting to mantis and he did not actually take the opportunity to bistro cantus rare moment of a rare moment of of not garbage behavior from our crew president colitis this e eyes e end e s es team shoo we es destruct s we we wick e finish former got we sh o to to t o of ai was i ja of oo an sure o again rare moment of a of shocking decency there from the current or resident of reunited states prison be see however was not going to be deterred by by bygones words instead they jump that this is horrible how could he not meet with with job o my god people open here re of i do not re beg on the ground for for sandy fercansanday web a and you think back to the meeting that chis christy that had then i germy governor had with a president a baba right an the embrace i and see folk sat that is the reason why a than present abbagat reenactment a is this you think one of the reasons why the mantis is china notes to meet with the president a to day an making at for to politics hwan is not i do not think that the bend going to her going to be the presidentitin your presidential duty when he accident or baba is president was in fact the reason that he was reelected ala i think that governor the mantis i team an by then he has to tams ride as a than in the governors office an a at e team on his campaign i think that the team of the campaign is a likely negatively influencing with the the decisions at the team in the governors office a make i i ya the major not can to let that one you o get meanwhile you on musk is at now at war withe panties defamation leagues let us be clear about the the defamation lag it is a progressive interest group that proclaims that it is speaking in the name of jewfish causes that is that is untrue it is just a progressive interest group that is all and sometimes they cross streams with actual not terrific ideas and a lot of time there targeting people on the ass of spurious nonsense or ignoring people on the basis of other spurious nonsense because again there are progressive interest drop when you on musk is now in a in a battle with the adieu and tom he is in a battle with them because he saying that you got are basically trying to sure acts formerly knownist twitter by having advertised remove the revenue he is right about that a lot of these progressive interest groups are very much interested in removing advertising revenue from sources where they cannot control the speech he posted on as saying the aria has been quote trying to kill this platform by falsely accusing it and me of being antiseptic if this continues we will have no choice but to filed defamation suit against ironically the anti defamation league if they lose the defamation suitwilyle insist they drop the anti part of their name since obviously now is that really going to happen it is i it is almost impossible to when a defamation suit against public figure it is it is really really really rough because you have to show actual malice which is a nearly impossible standard with that said is the adieu constantly speaking up on behalf of the right causes absorb nomen they made excuses for some of the worlds worst antisemite in congress long as there democrats big again it is a progressive interest group they posted a report suggesting that axis now filled with horrible hate is a way for them to work together with groups that we have discussed on the program before warm in order to reduce advertising to platforms acts basically able by l eft going standards of speech or watchers advertising dollars disappear that is what plan musk is a is sounding off about and he happens to be correct about all of that and it is really really ugly which is why its very important that if you are an advertiser and you are looking at platform it advertise on you probably should be looking at freer speech platforms twitter because otherwise twittered slash acts is at is going to revert back to type ins can the same kind of crap that face book has done or you up has done in censoring material of a time for quick thing i and then a quick thing that i hate things that i to day if you wish to understand what exactly is going on in china fantastic new book out by person named yashanghuang a this book is titled the rise and fall of the east how exams autocracy stability and technology brought china success and why they might lead to its decline the the basic premise of the book is that first centuries millennia almost baked in to the chines cake has been this system of test taking that basically chose single standards of merit in order to elevate people and this is led to top down authoritarian rule in china been incredibly durable lot more durable than it would a been in see russia and it is why you can have gunman paying whose being as authoritarian as he wants to be and still maintain control of the country that theocrat what while white who is not never fragment why does china never come apart why does it seem as though its continues to be durable even wins economic numbers go down it also has some lessons to teach the united states about how economics ought to work and also about the sort of standards that we use intrmsof economic growths o one of the points made in the rise in all of the east is that basically all of the test base systems for elevating people inside the c c p are rooted in growth of g t p if you are regional leader in china and you drug t p in your area you've very likely to be looked out for topmost in the centralized government what the problem is that g t p is a is a standard at is largely w reliance in china on government borrowing spending which is why you see china now in serious trouble its barred and spent way too much moneys why you have giant empty cities in some o these places because if rope public official hen you wish to rise the chines comments party what better way to do it than borrow bunch o money build bunch to empty cities and claim that you just increased g t p dramatically it is a really fascinating book a gangly check et out the rise and fall of the east by yashnghjang for interested in the actual situation going on with china and the durability of the chines regime even if they are experiencing economic failure up a time for a quick thing that i hate s as a piece by avid gibbon whose director of the center on religion and culture at from university and he is ripping in to america conservative catholic for being at odds with pope francs hes saying that dome the loudest voices in america catholicity are duo backward looking moralists can disconnected from the roots of the church catholic tradition and history says franchises about moving forward changing to live the gospel message in the midst of current realities pope's words were both surprisingly frank and frankly on surprising giving the persistence of right anger directed at his modernizing approach this apisord could be read as part of a long saga of tensions between come and best church since the nations founding popes have regarded the america experiments in democracy with suspicion separation of church and state is dangerous to sols in society he e should periodic class at americanism in modernist friends the election of pope francs in twenty thirteen flip rescript however suddenly the vatic began pushing america to be more flexible more pastoral more inclusive last tribally rigid come is now the engine of reform a historic reversal france is a world leader in combat and climate change he insistently to cries economic injustice in the treatment of migrants while putting new emphasis on the universal rights to heltkar housing and decent jobs indeed in portugal francs criticize the fixation on sins below the wastewhile if you exploited workers if you liter cheated it did not matter meanwhile says this colonist much of america church leadership remains focus on a pelvic theology here is the thing it turns out that a the america catholic poor critical of francs are rights there is certain unchanging principles in catholicity and francs has not changed that right chant france is not actually changed the churches position on same sucks marriage he is not changed the church's position on divorce he is not changed to the church's position on contraception its just that he keeps making overtures toward those who would in order to make time on climate change and social redistribution's in essence he is liberation theologists is now occupying the office of the papacy and america catholic more conservative catholic all over the world know this which is why he more than any other pope has created a schism inside the catholic church the that is that is franchises fault

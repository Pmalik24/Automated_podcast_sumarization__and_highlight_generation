welcome to the supermen laposcience science act i m inderhubermen and om a professor of neurology and theology at stamford school of medicine to day i have the pleasure of introducing doctor robot supolsk doctor supolski is a professor of biology and narrow surgery at stamford university his laboratory has worked on a large variety of topics including stress hormones including testosterone and estrogen and how the different members of a given species interact according to factors hormones fiery within primate troops and how things stress reproduction and competition impact behavior one of the things that makes doctor sypolski's work unique is that it combines elements from primatology including field studies with human behavior in essence trying to unveil how humans as old world primates our controlled by different elements of our biology as well as our psychology doctor supolski is also a prolific author of popular books such as wieners do not get users the trouble with testosterone and behave the biology of a humans at our best an worst during the course of our discussion today robot also revealed to me that he is close to completing a new book entitled determined the science of life without free will and indeed we discuss the science of life without freewill during this episode we also discuss stress and how best to control street and how stress controls us at both conscious and subconscious levels we talk about testosterone and estrogen and hormone replacement therapy and how those impact are mind are psychology and our interactions with others as with any discussion with doctor supolski we learn about scientific mechanisms that make us who we are and to day we also discuss tools and how we can leverage those scientific mechanisms in order to be better versions of our selves i should mention that unlike most guest interviews on the superman lad podcast this one had to be carried out remotely due to various constraints you may hear the occasional audio artifact please excuse that we felt that the value of a conversation with doctor supolski was well worth those minor minor glitches and indeed the information that he delivers us is tremendously valuable interesting and in many cases actionable as well before we begin it'd to emphasize hat this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there eaten i started taking athletic greens and t reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen and claim a special offer the will give you fie free travel packs plus a year supply of sidemen d three k too there are ton of stand now showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k to is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstokcam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the i free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar give talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do cam slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do cam slash superman and now without further ado my conversation with doctor robot supolski great will thank you much sober for joining us to day have been looking forward to this for a very long time a appreciate what clukto beer there an enormous range of topics that we could drill in to but just to start off i want a return to a topic that as near endear to your hart which is stress and not of the questions that i get most commonly is what is the difference between short and long term stress in terms of there benefits and their drawbacks and the reason i say benefits is that voice stress and the stress response c keep us alive but stress of course can also sharpen our mental acuity in things of that sort how should we conceptualize stress and how shall we conceptualize stress in the short term and in the long term well basically servo two grafts that one he draw the first one is jess all sorts of beneficial affects of stress short term and then once we get unto the chronic it is just down hill from there short term because it saves you from the creditor short term because your getting presentation and you think more clearly or a your focus is better all hurts an aspects of that and what then wants i being argument is how long does it take to go from short termed along term and that somewhat arbiter e but the sorts of chronic stresses that most people deal with are just undeniably in the chronic range having spent the last twenty years daily traffic fans for bus bad sir some such thing the other curve that sort of perpendicular to this is dealing with the fact that sometime stresses a great thing unlike our goal is not to cure people of stress in because it is the right kind we love it we we pay good money to be stress that way what a scary move or will foster o it what you want o seeing is writes the right amount stress it is what we call stimulation and the basic curve there is hurts an optimal level of stimulation and too little and function goes down with what we call cordon and too much function goes down with what w we call stress and the time is what all the same for in terms of the benefits of stress in the short term one thing that is really striking to me is how that physiologically the stress response look much the excitement response to a positive event and we conspeculate that the that the fundamental difference between short try stress and short term excitement is some demodulator dopamine or something that but is there anything else that we know about the biology that reveals to us what what rely creates this thing we call valance that an experience can be terrible or feel awful or it can feel wonderful exhilarating depending on this somewhat subjective feature we call since what do we know what valance is or where it resides on a really mechanical level if you areacircumstant that is requiring that your heart races and your your breathing as fast in your using your muscles and some such thing a your g to be having roughly the same brain activation profile whether this is for something wonderful or something terrible with the one exception being that if the emigdula is part of the activation this is something that is count to be counting adverse a whether that the circumstance an adverse circumstance recruiting the emigdula into it and how much it is mogul being involved oases you towards interring it is even more awful the emigdula in some ways this kind of the check points to whether r talking about excitement or terror let us use the emigdula as a transition point to another topic that you've spent many years working on and thinking about which is testosterone an other stexteroid hormone i heard you say once before that a among all the brain areas that bind testosterone that you were testostrom can parka create a facts that the emigdula is among the the a the most chockablock full of these parking spot these receptors i realize there's a lot here but how shall we think about the role of testosterone in the emigdula given that the engagement of the emigdula is fundamental in this transition point between a exhilarating positive response and a a an a negative straswal response or maybe just broadly how shall we think about testosterone and its effects on the brain and partner to the transition from whether this is stressed that is evoking fear or evoking aggression turns of that continue also use the emigdulas in the center of all for points on this axis a basically am almost everybody out there has he completely wrong ideas to what tistostero does which is testostro makes your aggressive because male of virtually every species out there have more testosterone and more aggressive than seasonal motors have tistostern surging at the time a year there punching it out over territory and and you take testosterone auto the picture you castrate any mama out there including us and levels of the egression will totem an the easy thing sentence to include to conclude that testosterum causes aggression and the reality is testostrom does no such thing does not cause aggression and you can see this o behatrlin in the emigdula what does testosterone too it lowers the threshold for the sort of things that wouldnormally provoke you into the o that it happens more easily it make systems that are already turned on turn on louder rather than turning on progressive music or some such thing was that look behavior you take five man monkeys putting together they form abdominous hierarchy a number one is great number five is miserable number three is writing between not take number three and shoot the my up with tons of testosterone and hes go to be involved and more fights ah distorter uniformly for causes aggression but you look closely and there is a pattern to t is number three now challenging numbers two and one for their place in the her absolutely not he is brown nosing them exactly as much as he used to what is going on o sees just a miserable terror to for number four and five and in that case what testostrns doing is amplifying the are existing patterns of the gran amplifying to social learning thus wordy gone into it now on cart of the more reductive level stoat as that translateinto the mictola does testosterone make a ma to lidenerons have action potentials does a cause those morons to suddenly speak about fear and digression spontaneously absolutely not what they do is if the imictola is already being stimulated it increases the bred of neral firing what worth it it shortens after hypopolersations the theme there exactly is it is not creating aggressions just using the volume of whatever egressions or my there and once you factor that in no it is impossible to say anything about what testosterone does outside the contact of what testosterone related behaviors how they get treated in up in your stand in terms of a status in their relationship between individuals either non human primates or human ah can we say that testosterone and levels of testosterone r i should take can we say that relative levels of testosterone between individuals is correlated to status within the diarchy om y yes butter the way the wines of being totally uninteresting am ye go back and are whatever number decades and chronology tests and the retros totally reliable find since in there once the eye a dog and hear that soil we dogs at the hubrmanlapodcaf jingling of i are welcome they are absolutely welcome am and there be two true isms which is higher levels of astostron credit higher levels of a egression induces another animals harass of testostran predict higher levels of sexual activity was testostran using or and the correlations there an when you look closely we got cause an effects of sexual behavior raises testosral levels aggression raises testostran levels your levels beforehand or barely predictive o what is could o happen for stoscra than a cause am when you look at that though and terms i making sens of individual differences they do not matter a whole lot a you can liked an entire career on the social circumstances that produce three and a half preset more testostro than the circulation and expect to see all sos of interesting implications and that is not really the case i somewhat of a yes or no modulator of much more subtle social stop that already there very interesting now i think that am there is a the xylotomous conceptions about human biology but testosterone seems to be one area were at least from what i can find on the internal ah there is a its that the pike of misunderstanding am maybe just ask a few more questions about testostro an sexual behavior because there is an interesting story there about castration verses non castration and the causality again am but before am you address that i just when a highlight something hat you said i think it vital which is that behaviors such as aggressive behaviors in sexual behaviors can actually increase testostronite did i hear that correctly and the reverse is sort of true but not but not in a causal way that is at right the opposite direction the causality ye ye yes if i were to increase somebody is testosterone by thirty percent male or female does not matter that their sexual behavior may or may not change sensually her effect at all am your grain is not that sensitive to fluctuations and testosctral levels am in terms of things aggression raising testosterone great footnotes a if you have the right type of willing to die in the trenches devotion sort of thing watching your favorite teen place for will raise your testostral levels as you sit there with a petatorships in your arm chair it is not the physicality of aggression its the h psychological framing of it ye testosterone is not causing that and a greatly to appreciate that is okas at altos testosterone sexual behavior correlations and you do the definitive antecran intervention which is you do e a subtractions that o remove the testes an is a it before levels of sexual behavior goes down good we have just shown that testosterone the someone of cause critically they go down but not down to zero whether you are a rat or a monkey or a human whatever and what predicts how much residual sexual behave is there how much sexual behavior there was before castration what that telling you is by then that is behavior that is been carried by social learning and contacts rather by hormone exact singing with aggression drops after castration does not go to zero the more crier history of it the more i is keeps costing along on its own even without testate very interesting i is can we say that there is an exception in terms of the early organizing effects of hormones for instance of a developing animal is deprived of u testosterone estrogen or a aromatized testosterone intasterogen there is a whole story there's but i then i could imagine that the circuits of the brain that are responsible for initiating sexual behavior in the first place might not emerge and therefore not be set sensitive to testosterone later in life is that right ye exactly and an a great way of seeing that is this totally nutty biological fact o which is the second to forth diseur ratio an hands ya totally obscure thing the ratio once the other in some way reflects levels of testoster an andershin exposure during feudal life i cannot remember which we goes in en scum need a thousand people in your safe sous to beetle see anything what you see it in other primates it is already there and feudal old sombre and all of that that is a readout of subtle differences and prenatal exposure and that wants something a predictor of a whole ranges suttlesuf an the dull behavior ye at the feudal and when your still building everything testosterone in the amount of that is making a huge difference by the time you are in adult is jests you somewhat of an old on signal ye i can have a confession which is that i was a master's tuna pertly and marked breed loves am arena a i am am an author on that paper although ism deep within the author line and a you you got the description of it exactly right that it is the demo the index finger to the ring finger ratio is more similar in a females and then it is and males and males the index finger tens to be shorter and for people out there listen this who are now am freaking out or measuring that that there is the proper way to measure this which is a it bawling it does not work all the time unless at the extremes and there is some interesting stories there it actually as been replicated a no fewer than five times m mark remove tells me am but yes and term a interns these early organizing effects am those are very a seem very robot on most studies these later effects are sort of activation of nerd circuits by hormones i absolutely fascinated by this and if we i do have a couple other a question which is a we normally associate testosterone with males but of course females make testosterone as well a from the adrenals and imprisonable elsewhere to am guessing if we looked pard enough we rarely find that there were other sources of androgen m in females it can we say that the that these general contours of effects on on aggression am but also pertain to females and om and i suppose i should ask in particular about female female aggression which does exist in many species female male do aggression as well as maternal aggression which is a robust aspect of our evolution of course that the mother will can angry mother animal of any kind protecting her young is truly dangerous in the best sense of the of the word and that i es in cost orturision period after birth aggression is all about estrogen pesto thin female aggression the rest of the time has testosterone as nature player at much lower level on the average on the average orwesessy a busts the same instars in females the lower levels tistostenor are essential for its technical levels of the egression sexual behavior none the less there not causing not senssmlitren different same exacting you can it walker trust the importance antigens in females just as readily as i males in line with that how should we conceptualize testosterone i a i realize there is not a single sentence or ah that can capture ai a hormone and all its effects because hormones have many different slow and fast effects on the brain on other glands on their own on the very lands that produce them but as have heard you talk about testosterone to day and over the years i start to get the impression that as the most misunderstood molecule in human health an the universe it it has it it is clearly doing something very powerful its its shifting the way that certain nail circuits work adjusting the gain on the emigdulas you described and and certainly other things as well is there any am truism about testosterone and its relationship to effort or its relationship to am resilient and ain a way that maybe will help me and other people for think about how to think about testosterone a am i three secrets that firestone is i think it s a fair summary to think that when it comes to motive ate strong behaviors what testosterone does is make you more of whatever you already are in that dome such larazlabido aggressive new spontaneous aggression react of the egression things of that sort it is popping the volume of thins ateralready strongly there om second way to think about it is we here is heres my favorite finding about teststron omen this thistles and wonderful work by a god john wings field who is one of the best behavior and chronologists out there and about twenty years ago he formulated dhotis call the challenge hypothesis of testosterone action what does testosterone do testosterone is what you secrete when your status is being challenged and it makes more likely that you will do the behaviors needed too volant our status goes o that totally born my straightforward if you rebaugoon if somebody is challenging your high rank the appropriate response in your pard is going to be aggression arms we have just got in through the back to or tistostrom an aggression again but then you get to humans and humans have lot o different ways of achieving or maintaining status and all you need to do is god some fancy private schools annual auction and you will see all these half drunk alpha male competing to see who can give the most money away as a show of conspicyues dunno property that they have and in a setting that i bell i have not been able to take your examples of those times and fortunallybut that shows the lipide of it if you have a species that hands outstays in the very different sort of way tistostrons would above that also focus to that generates a totally buddy prediction a take people in a circumstance my playing an economic game where you get status by being trustworthy and being generous in your inter actions with the game if you give people testostrom does that make the more generous in this absolutely the case totally cool finding om showing you unuobasecaly if you took a whole bunch of lutist monks and shot him up with testostrom they would get all competitive with each other is to who could yo the most random acts of kindness and if we have a cesietal problem with two much aggression the first culpa to look at is not tistosterom the first to look at is that we hand out much damn elevated status for aggression in many circumstances i i find that finding to be fantastic thirsting about settle chief testosternoca subtler behavior effects you give to stouter to people and they become more confident they become more self confident well that is good people pay to take all sorts of on seismical self help courses that will ghost yourself often and that is a good thing unless testosterone makes you more confident that is inaccurate and you are more likely to barrel into wrong decisions what shown in economic gain lay is that storm by making more confident makes you less cooperative because who use to cooperate besom top of this all on my own a testosterone makes people cocky and impulsive and that may be great in one setting but if in the others your absolutely sure your army is that over in the other country n three days shew least our world for one you get a big surprisout of it testosterone altering risk abuse beforehand promptly play the big roll in that kind of is calculation superinteresting i always think about testosterone and dopamine being close cousins in the brain not just because of their relationship a through the petuitarian hypothalamus that of course but also because of dopamines salient roll in creating this bias towards ex perception when a somebody takes a drop wit that increases dopamine or their chacma block full of dopamine they tend an with high on highlight ten cassis an really generalizing t but they tend to focus on outward rolls in a things beyond the the boundaries of their skin and testosterone seems to do a bit of the same it tends to put us into a similar mode of perceiving the outside world in ways a that we are asking questions how do i relate to this other of my species how do i relate to these goals is there anything that om we can do to better conceptualize the relationship between testosterone and dopamine and motivation or would that just take us down the the alleyways of of nerd pathways and and the hypothalamus which was fine too well i think it is got lots to do with so of this major revisions at dopamine every one since the pharaohs ta brought up in totedopomens a pension and reward turns out it sent it is that anticipation of reward and it is about generating the motivation the gold direcbehaviour needed to go get that reward and before it your using elevate dopamine your tire life to motivate you to do whatever go to get you entry into heaven after like find of no its it is doing that sort thing sit is really about the motivation and what testosterone does even in individuals wo are not aggressive and why t stostro replacement is often a very helpful thing for aging males is increases energy an increases a sense of theretess presence of ha heartless it increases motivation that is a whole aspect which thentakes into is your motivation to get up and go you'll hand out lots of sup in a suit kitchen for holes people or is it to get up and go vertically cleans o village a it is how much to do with what your make up whats before the tistostrion got on board it is activating and an energetic sens testosterone within minutes increases glucose of take into capital muscle you just more awake and alert than all that and that has a lot to do with what done of and as one might predict then gettinjest the right levels of of testosterone i infused into your bloodstream feels great glabrate the will lever press to get infused into the range that oftemis teen release o titis your absolute like their their deeply intentions now such beautiful biology there and i love the way encapsulate that their relationship i i one ask about estrogen om en we do not hear as about estrogen as often and it is always interesting to me now doing on some public facing education that testosterone is this very controversial molecule just to say it is almost controversial but estrogen a does not seem to hold the same a controversial weight and yet estrogen has a very powerful effects on both the animal brain and on the human brain of males and females om men a do not want their estrogen to go too low terrible things happen they will lose count function libido can drop a it men need estrogen as well but perhaps a may we we can put the some filter on estrogen as we did on testosterone are there any general fees of estrogen that are that people shul be aware of or to you think that are generally misunderstood is it really all about feelings and empathy and making us more sensitive i i i sense not now an its once again very contextetendent and if estrogen after giving birth is playing a central roll and you wanting to shred tho face of somebody getting too close to your your widens kind of thing we know it is notes worm fuzzy yo inpatheconstu estrogen no in loss of ways can be surmised by if you had a choice in the matter between having a lot of estrogen your bloodstream we not go for having a lot of estrogen it unit enhances cognition exactly you said it stimulates aura genesis in the hyppicapas it increases glue cops and oxygen delivery it protects you from dementia it decreases in lavatory oxidate of damage to blood vessels which is by its good for protecting from cardevast elergicies in contract the asosteron which is making every one of one things worse am this brings up this mind feel of the quest which is what about post menaposl estrogen and all sorts at lab studies with nonhuman primal suggested that you keep estrogen levels high after a monkeys equivalent of menopause and you are to keep brain healthful lot better decreasing the risk of dementia stroke every such thing estrogens great anti ox and all of that in the ninth u thing when helium forgetting her name but when they were the first female head of the i h a burned at hi a set up this massive prospective human study to was go to be the biggest one of all times looking at the pluses among uses of postmanaposil estrogen and tens of thousands of women at this sincere and they had to cut the shot study sure because what they were seeing was estrogen was not only doing the normal bad stuff that you expect in terms of some decalcification to but it was increasing the risk of party f astoergicies and shwas increasing the risk of strocans increasing risk of dementia and this ground to a halt and everybody they stop the study an fronpagenes an everybody pant ta point and nobody could make sense of it who had been spending the last twenty year studying the exacts and thing thin primates unseen all the protective effects and the explanation turned out to be land those things were favor expected consequences none menopause and women at last different lengths of time that may be a factor riscetical what let us not start getting our study subjects more estrogen until their totally pase menopause and when you have got that lag time in between you shift all sorts of estrogen receptor patterns and that is we all the bad effects come from while the the monkey studies had involve just maintaining ovulatory levels into postmanaposi period and you do that and yet great effects estrogen is one of the greatest predictors of protection from a time or disease all but it needs to be physiological just keep going what continuing with your body has been doing for long time verses let the whole thing shut down suttlewan li try to fire up the cold stoves at the bottom of the baseman con thing and get that going there you get utterly different out comes and tat cost aloha germane consequences from people sudan decided at estragon this in fact your logically endangering crewman easily while that is fascinating and i never thought that these a story harmony receptors could by not binding estrogen have being devoid of estrogen binding i should say a could then set off a opposite by chemical cascades fascinating i gets the raises the question about testosteral replacement too whether not a people should a talk to their doctor before a too long a men and women talk to your physicians before too long a to avoid these a whatever is happening in these periods where there is not sufficient testosterone and or estrogen since i could am cause longer tern problems even when therapies are are introduced to to emotional misery slash complications a your tuna understand you look at women with the history wither without human palselestrician replacement were it is done right and you seen twenty years later or estrogen's predictor the decresresof business than you gone are ringed to the the unpacking prospective type studies how much estrogen at which times estrogen is just a is a each all turn for a munch of carbon's estrone estradiol actor how much of each one of them natural or synthetic to try to figure all of that out and second complication is is often hard say anything about what stricken does outside the contacts of what progesterone to and often it is not the absolute levels of either it is the ratio of theta this is such a more complicated andtcronsystem than testosterone and because you have degenerate dramatic cyclicly that i know man hi lethal the segrhas to dream of it is much much more complicated system thus ad lot complicated to understand let alone i figure up look the ideal benefits a of us now can i do not know what to make of the literature on a dropping rates of testosterone and divan endrin disruptor what i was at berley when iron haze published his date on these frogs that were drinking water from various locations throughout the united states noxious in californium and seem very severe endigran disruption of through blockader and of aldermen receptors and all sorts of issues and you hear this all the time now that sperm counts a dropping that they are a these endercran disruptor that there is birth control in the water in the drinking water it all sounds starts to sound a little crazy and yet om have also been fooled before by a i guess a a good example would be there is a lot of crazy stuff in the world on line about all the terrible stuff in highly process fruits and yet you have got very respectable people under chronologists that you see used robot rustic saying hates a lot of these hidden sugars and the emulsifiers there causing real problem have have become more open minded about the question om and are we suffering from drops in sperm counts and tostostron end estrogen and fertility as a consequence of indican disruptor in the in the environments and food or because of social reasons a s there anything that we can hang our hat on real data that your confident and ora just a mess om no the phenomenon is secure to be quite real a crossectional studies populations or i still understand why of this is one of the first things at hasouded decreasing tactical size an crocodiles go figure why that was on first contributions o this i think the phenomenons absolutely real and what your then left with this suclassin challenges which is this correlate with something broad environmental tons which on how much when camera and the other one always being well a dropping is not dropping enough to make a difference how bigger an effect et is those are the jury i still outs now it is an area that i know there is a lot of interest in and om you have got groups of people who will not touch a recent at a store because of the b pas that are on the inks of the and then who cut a people who do not care about those things at it is a fascinating read i i hope that more biology will be done a there soon it'd to briefly return to distress om you described a study i once about two rats om one running on a wheel voluntarily one whose easily stuck in a running wheel and is forced to run any time rat number one runs in one case the rat is voluntarily exercising and in the other case the the rat is being forced to go to be class to speak but really and seen diversion effects on biology and it'd to just touch into this and use i this kind of a case study for stress mitigation in general ism rather obsessed in our colleague avid a speak associate cheirpsycatriate stamford is obsessed with a this question of how humans can start to mitigate their own stress what what do you think about stressimitigation and and what should we do at individuals and as family s an as a culture to trying encourage people to mitigate their stress but in ways that are not going a turn it into rat number to were we are being forced to mitigate our own stress and therefore becomes more stressful and what you see is rat number one gets all the benefits of that service rat number to gets all the downsides of severe stress with the same exact muscle expenditure and movements going on perfectly yoked great example that it is the interpretation on your head and isn't kept up with that literature but all bet you rat number two as having a whole lot more activity in its eidola that is a rat number block o case a stress mitigation ism anything i should say here i should preface with ism reasonably good a telling people what is could o happen if they do not manage their stress but ism terrible at actually managing stress or advising had a manage tot o much better with the badges aspect of the ism but what you see is by now just a class of literature half a century old sort of showing what are the building blocks of stress not who you step outside and you can gored by an elephant and can you row from your experyand sand what does not cult makes you stronger not you could have a stress response but you are in the realm of the gray on of ambit yours social interactions that sort of thing some people have mass of stress responses others not at all and between enjoy it what a tho building blocks of what make psychological stresstress and the first one is exactly what was brought up by that running study do you have a sense of control a sense of control makes stresses lesstressful and the running wheel shows that or studies where you you liberal where you college freshmen volunteer haven train that my press in the lever you are less likely to get a shock and to day you are at the lever they are working away and unbeknownst to you the lever has been turned off and it has no effect an shock frequency but because you think you have some control you have less of a stress response if you are rat in doing this day in and to out you are less likely to get an old sense a control related to that is a sense of predictability rat get shocked human get shock to whatever and the scenario lither is the shocks come now and then were the shocks come now and then and ten seconds before a little warning light comes on man yet the warning light the shocks are a distressful you got predictability because if your not getting warning lights any second you could be a half second away from the next shock you get a warning light and that if there is not one you have got at least ten second with relaxation it is coming you can prepare you're coping responses and best of all afterward when you are finely safe when you can recover from it and that is enormously protectprotective others outlet for frustration and en you take a rat who getting shock than if it could run on a running weld that is protective thing f it is do involuntarily if you have got a rat and e can gnaw on a bar of wood a stressed is less stressful a unfortunately if you have a rat or primate or human and their street the ability to progressively dump on somebody smaller and weaker also reduces the stress response and displacement aggression expel can the fact that displacement aggression reduce a stress a counts for a huge percent of earths unhappiness all those variables get social support as well that is a good one interpreting circumstances as being good news rathe than that hurts you have got that very simple sort of take on recipe of go out and get as much control and a much predictability and as many outreason as much soccer support as possible and you could do just fine and you go out and do that and that is a recipe for total disaster because it is much much more subtle than that one great example o case of your getting shocks you one a warning beforehand get a little warning listen second before eat shock it is wonderfully protective get a warning shop get a warning light one second before the shock does not do anything there is not enough time for you to get the psychological benefits of the anticipation now instead get the little warning coming on two minutes before each shock and its get to make things worse because you are other to be sitting there reveling and certain of your sense of predict ability and it sunken mix you are to be sitting there for two minutes saying damn here it comes predictive information only works in a narrow day similarly control do you not to have a sense of control in the face of stress and the answer is only if it is a mile to moderate stressed because what is happening then your sense of control is completely independent of the reality of way a control or not but in the face of mile to moderate stresses a sense of control gets interpreted as wall look how much worse things could have been thank god i have control of on top of this masteryfate in contrast if it is a major stressed all that a ye arbitrary sense o control does is make you think o l god look how much better it could have been i could have prevented t and we all the intuitively we do that in h face of peoples worse stressor nobody could have stopped the car the way the kid suddenly jumped out it would not have matter if you had gotten them to the doctor a month ago instead of now it would not have made me you did not actually have any control and what you see is you absolutely ant a the hugeness of control over mile to moderate stressor and specially once that result in a good outcome hurray for me and in the face of horrible stressor what you want to do is self deception than truth an beauty do not necessarily go hand and hand at that point and that is why stressmanagement techniques control and predictability why'd being far worse than neutral if your preaching that to somebody homeless ere somebody with terminal can i were somebody whose refuge he tell a neuralgic middle class person that they have the psychological told to turn hell into heaven and there is some truth to that do the same thing to somebody whose going through a real hell and that is just privilege heartlessness to do that because that does not work we no outlets if your outlets or damaging that is not a good way to mitigate stress social support if you are confusing mere acquaintances for real social support you'd have the rug pulled out from under you at some point if you are mistaking social support for being going and bitching and moaning and demanding supporting the from everyone around you rather than beading some of that reciprocally that is like a work very well i there do it is not simple it is not for nothing that lots of us are really lousy it being good friends and things some that and why it takes a lot of work is li do in right because you you do it wrong and it may temporarily seen a great thing but when it turns out to be completely misplaced fat your could be feeling worse than before you started interesting these days there is a lot of interest in using physical practices to mitigate strastiar trying to get out of the ruminating and a to some then take control of of nerd circuits in the brain by using exercise and using breathing and i hypnosis and and not and of course hypnosis has a mental component as well what are your thoughts on street mitigation from the standpoint of of to we do not want to be rat number two we want to select something for ourselves we have to take take the initiative for ourselves being forced into exercise thing is not it could actually have negative helphifaci perhaps we need to pick something that we we need to take control of it am in terms of supporting other people you touched on that a bit a what is the best way to support other people is it to talk about the stressful thing i may not not asking to play psychologist here but a i find divergent date on this we can spin ourselves up into a lather by ruminating on something in language seems to me a at it is a wonderful tool but it is also a fairly to am deprive tool because it does not really get into the core of our physiology something breathing would what your thoughts on more i for lack of a better way to put it more head center cognitive approaches distress mitigation verses kind of a going at the core physiology cold showers a now or even a thing to some extent just to get people stress aclimateit voluntary taking cold showers now om that make some sens physiologically are conditioning for when the ream stresses come ten sure to what you bring up ow transidental meditation mindful ness exorcise prayer sort of reflecting on gratitude all that sort of thing collectively they work on the average they work an terns of that can lower heart had in cluster levels and have a sort good out comes om but the come promises one's exactly the cannot the comes out of the running you will study is it does not matter how many of your friends swear by the stressmanagement technique if doing it makes you on a scream your head off after ten seconds that is not the ones to to work for yo you read the fine print in the testimonials what is got to be something works for you another one is this stress management i techniques that work you cannot save for the weekend you cannot say hem for when your stuck on hold on the phone with yous for two minutes it is got to be something were you stop what your doing and do iterversually daily or every other day and spend twenty thirty minutes doing it an what you see coming out of that is this eighty twenty rule from economics a eighty twenty eighty per cent of the complaints in storm from twenty per cent the customer since i that what you see is if your entire life consists of every single thing on your shoulders that you cannot say no to twenty for seven if you have stop that and finally aid my world being is important enough that ism finally a to say notice some of the stuff that i can minutes you and ism going to do it every day for twenty minutes whatever stress manger technique yo then do in those twenty minutes short of who knows what you are already eighty per cent of the way there simply by h thing decided your well being is important enough that you are go depot every single day and have the disparity and thus exactly sinfinding to find people with comic depression untreated that you barely calling an getting in appointment to cede mental house professional people start feeling better already because it is evidence that you have can activated and you matter nous to do this and you can conceive that this could actually have good out come rather holiest in something meditated or reflective every day or and it hardly matters which one you doing and what comes but of that is thus another warning which is do not trust anybody who says it is in scientifically prevent that they're grand distrustnanishment works better than the other ones just watch yo fallen that point women i think one of the corals of of my lab and avid eagles label i know you have worked with avid and published papers with avid as well is to really try and find out what are the various entry points to this thing that we call the autonomic nervous system and the stress system and these systems that when gone unchecked really can take us down a dark path and the idea that there are many entry points is really the one that keeps of what the data keep telling us over and over again there is no magic breathing tool or exercise it is i any variety of those or one of those and again we come back to this idea that it is the one that you select in the one that you make space for and it is the one that a you hopefully enjoy that is going to work best and terms of physiology and no not behinds for those people who rescue around you right right absolutely and you not that brings me to this question of i find it amazing that how we perceive an event and whether not we chose to be in that event or not can have such incredible you different effects on circuitry of the brain and circuitry of the body and biology of cells and in some ways it boggles my mind how can a decision made presumably with the prefrontal quarter although other parts of the brain as well how can that change essentially the polarity of a response in the body and i mean that you have talk before about type personalities and that we do not have to go in all the detail there of forsake of time but it is interesting that the effects of epithelial cells i mean literally of the size of of the portals for blood i are in opposite direction depending on whether or not somebody wants to be in a situation is a highly motivated person maybeyou could just give us the top contour of that because i i think it really illustrates this principle beautifully and then maybe if you would you could just speculate on how the brain right have this switch to turn one experience from terrible to beneficial what order from beneficial to terrible it is really fascinating well and all you need to do is to night before you are going to sleep in your lying in bed and your lichen grows in your hearts beating nice and slow you start thinking about the fact that that hart is not going to be forever and imagine your toes getting cold afterward and imagine the flow of blood coming to a halt and all of you clothing and if you r you are got be doing something with your physiology at that point the ninety nine percent mama's out there only other running frantically and you are you be turning on your synthetic response wit thought with emotions with memory in the measure of that is just how much the quarter and the limbic system sends projections down to all the autonomic regulators in the brain a you can think autonomic regular trainer on into action in ways that only other animals can do with extremes of environ to circumstances in given that and the autonomic rule mean the other big challenge understanding it is gigantic individual differences and the you we talk about the automat amount of stress the counts of stimulation and in general that stress that not too severe and does not go on for too long is over all in a benevolent saying and under those conditions we love being stressed by something unexpected and at control in predict to bin who really interesting clot turn and the moving our latching that is great but you get the individual differences that somehow has to accommodate the fact that for some people the perfect stimulatory amount of stress is getting up early for an audition bird watching walk next sundae morning and for somebody else signing up to be a mercenary in even and tremendous individual differences that swam any simple prescriptions you had the they prefrontal quartets the thinking machinery that we all harbor its such a double eye sword a and a whats a remarkable to me is how the very as of the brain the hypothalamus and the ligula they're sort of switches i mean the they there's contacts in their gain control you talked about the gave corody testosterone et camera but they are really switches i mana you stimulate venture me you hypothalamus you get the right neurons and animal will than kill even an object that sitting next to it you tickle some other arms little thing mate with that same object i made ethereally while the i think there are probably rules to forefront a quarter also but it sounds the the contact plural from which prefrontal quarter can draw from i is nobly infinite am that we could probably learn to perceive threat in anything whether notes another group or whether not it is a seethe or whether not it is a somebody is version of the shape of the earth very as another i man it it is you can plug in anything to this system and give it enough data and i think it is oud you could drive a for response or a overshot that overstep or a mixed horribly ambivalent one that does changing by the millisecond when to merry contradictory now it is absolutely case an the prefrontal quarter i i more than once have regretted having wasted thirty years of my life studying the hipicap insured oinstudyig the prefrontal quarter it is much more interest in what it does and it is all this convectional stuff it is all the ways and which it is not o cate a lie in this setting but it is a great thing in another it is not we to kill unless you do it to them and than you get a metal it is not all this social context the moral relativity and situational ether stuff that is the prefrontal quarter that is got a master that and that wines a meaning that is place in your grain more than anywhere where you say your perception of things a can powerfully influence the reality of what is coming into you great example just harking back to testosterone oke exercise bosom testoster levels does exercise and success do it more than exercise and failure a literature back and the ladies or s o looking at outcomes a marathons to testosterone rise more in the people who win in the losers resting match is things of that is for with a simple prediction and the answer round the beingugencyis simple answer o k you win the marathon that is not necessarily an increase of predictory increased testosterone what is that about and then you find you the winner testosteram decreases and you find out the guy who claim in seventy third is having a mass of testosterone increase wo what is that about whats that about is far more human safety the find the guy who won the race has a decline at testosterone because he came in three minutes later than he really really was expecting and everybody now's a to be writing it up about how he is over the hill and the guy who came in seventy third is having boost testosterone because he was assuming he would be dead from a hard attack by e third mile instead he managed to finish it is this interpretive stuff going on and there and that is what prefrontal quarters about amazing and i braise this question of cognitive flexibility get can a can we tell ourselves that something is good for us even if we are not enjoying it and an we can we wriggle around these corners of of choosing the the exercise are doing that the i personally am not a big fan of of am long bout to meditation but have benefit tremendously from things dedicated breathing and short rounds o meditation am can i tell myself that it is good for me and wriggle around the corner and get my physiology work in the way i want do we have connive flexibility can i be that am third place runner and tell myself well at least ism i came in i wanted to wind badly that was my primary goal but another goal was to beat my previous time and i did do that and i mean it is t what to what extent can we toggle this relationship between the prefrontal quartan these other more primitive systems and an enormous amount am yo for example being low and a hierarchy a is generally that for health an every mammal out there including us but we do something special which is we can be part of multiple hierarchies at the same time and while you may be low ranking in one of them you be extremely highjacking in another you are have the crappies cop in your corporation but you're the captain of the them it of the sophbalts ton this here for the company and you better bet that somebody whose can o find all sorts of ways to decide that mind to five months to fridges just stupid paying the bills and when really matters is n of the precaution we can you are poor but your the deacon of your church your and we can play all psychological gas wot that one of the most consistent reliable once that we do and needs use the front of quarter crazy is somebody does something rotten and you need to attribute it and the answer is that i something rotten because there rotten always have been always will be this constitutional explanation you do something rotten to somebody and haw to yo explained it afterward a situational one i was tired i was stress thanthis sort of setting i is understood this a we are best it excusing our selves an tad things because we have access you are inner lives and we thought refutal vortexes that are greats coming up with us situational explanation rather than he may be unjust a selfish rote's human we needs change and that is all prefrontal qartexand we do that every time we do not let somebody your merge in the lane in front of us even though you curse somebody just the same thing to you an endlessly your i love it your statement about the fact that we can select multiple pierces to participate in am to me seems a particularly important one nowadays with social media being prevalent i know you are not particularly active on social media though a you might be unpleasantly or i do not know unpleasantly surprised to find out that there is there is a lot of positive discussion about you in your work as you do not never need to be on there will just continue a to discuss outwork but the but what is interesting about social media i found is that the context is very very broad i mean one could argue that who one selects to follow in which news articles your reading at camera can create of kind of a funding of information that itself can be dangerous more verification of crazy ideas or or even just less exposure to new ideas am but there is also this idea that social media is an incredibly broad contact as you scroll through a feed it is no longer being in your with great class room or your office or your faculty meeting you are being exposed to thousands if not millions of context this meal that soccer game this person's body this person's intellect ah you tore is another example it is a a it is a vast vast landscape and it is the context is is completely mishmash whereas ism assuming we evolved i think we did evolve under contacts that were much more constrained we interacted with a limited number of individuals and in limited number of different domains seasons tend to be constrain us all in a of course then we got phones and televisions in the started to expand but now more than ever our brain our prefrontal quarter and our sense of where we exist in these multiple hierarchies has such a wicked out into infinity how do you think this might be interacting with some of these more a primitive systems and another aspects of our of our biology well i think what you get is in some ways the punch line of what is most human at humans which is over and over you see exact same burn the same commons the same kinas the same detectors the same everything were built ut in the exact same s of as oblast of the species act there and then going used in a completely normal way and alenterms of being able to abstracts u on the ocean time in dramatic is soda you are a low ranking wagon and you conceal badly because you just cult habit and your bout to stand high ranking to boots you often takes it away from you and you feel carry in stressful in your unhappy we arguing the exact same things with a brain and bodies one were in losing a sense of self esteem but we can do it i watching a move character on screen in feeling an adequate compared to how wonderful or attractive they are we can do it by somebody driving past us in n expense of car and we do not even see their face and you can feel belittle by your own social economic status am you can watch the life styles of the rich and famous or read about what enosis up to and for some reason topside your in your life as less fulfilling because you can fly into pace for eleven minutes and you can feel miserable about yourself and ways that no other organism can simply because we can have our meaning full social networks include the party you reading about on face book that you were not invited to because it is taking place in see poor you do not know any of this people but none the less somehow that could be a means for you to feel less content with whom you have turned out to be do you take steps in your own life to actively restrict the contact in which you think and live and am and contemplate a in in order to can hance your creative life your intellectual life a i are those are those steps that you actively take am well i very actively do not know how to make use of anything with social media i i guess that counts as my having thus actively chose not to learn how i that is the case certain for the last year and a half lots of people i give gone through stretches where i can managed ti tertian force more for i on looking at the news and ha was wonderfully freeing i think in the larger sense though i no in addition to me being a nurabiologist i sou spendecates any part of each year studying wild moons out an a national hargonese africa an it'd spend three months a year without electricity without fun calls with you are going twelve hours a day without saying a word to somebody and when i finally would it would be somebody pneumatic pastoralist my in a different language ye i did ninety perpend of my insightful thinking about anything in the laboratory during those three months each year a not one in the can t not wen inundated with stuff i think there is a prove shifting than towards trying to create a narrowing of contact a i that pop and i i what i see i have a niece yous fourteen years old and ahead our friends are very good at putting their phones away they say we are not an a have our phones for this interaction especially after and i realize we still somewhat in this a an in clear were were headed but at twenty twenty was restrictive and she was separated from her friends now it is let us really focus on being together and not bring in all these other elements from our phones and i ha that brings of me great hope for that that generation may be they will a ornis may they will run off and study baboons we need more a field thirteen a along the lines of choice a i to shiftier slightly and talk about free will about our ability to make choices at all well my personal noway out and left feel inflammatory stance is i do not think we have a shred of free will om despite yo ninety five percent of philosophers and i think probably the majority of n your scientist saying that we have free will n least some circumstances i do not think resenting it all om and the reason for this is you do something you behave you make a choice whatever and to understand why you did that were of that intention come from am part of it was due to the sensory environment you were in the previous minute some of it is from the hormone levels in your bloodstream that morning some of it is from whether you had a wonderful or stressful last three months in what would indeuroplastisity happen part of it is what hormone levels you were exposed to is a feeds part of it is what culture your ancestors came up with and thus how you were parented when you were kid all of those her in there and you can understand were behaviors coming from without incorporating all of us and at that point not only are there all of these relevant factors but there ultimately all one factor if your talking about what evolution has to due to your behavior by definition your also talking about genetics if your talking bout what your genes have to do he behavior by definition your talking about how your brain was constructed or what prolines are coded for if your talking about your yo disorder now your talking about the sense of efficacy you were getting five year they are all intertwined and when you look at all those influence is basically the challenge is show me neuron that just cause that behavior or show me in or operands that just cause that behavior and show me that nothing about what they just did was influenced by anything from the sensory environment once second ago to the evolution your species and there no space an the to fit in a free will concept that wines of being you in your brain but not of your brain you simply no legal room for it there i can appreciate that our behaviors in our choices are the consequence of a long line of dominos that fell prior to that behavior but is it possible that i can intervene in the domino a fact to speak tom in other words can my recognition of the fact that genes have heritability there is an epigene that others a hormonal contacts there is a historical contact can the knowledge of that give me some small small shard of freewill meaning does it allow me to say a of i accept that my choices are ore somewhat predetermined and yet knowing that gives me some additional layer of control is is there any philosophical or biological a universe in which that works tat om all of that can produce the wonderfully posits beef that change can happen even throughout a change in worser circumstances most unlikely people and change can happen things can change a do not be fatalist i do not decide because we are mechanistic biological machines that nothing can change can happenbut where people go off the rails is translating that into we can change ourselves you do not we cannot is there is free however we can be changed by circumstance and the point of it is you look at can a cleric a sea slug that has learned to retract its gill and response to a shock on its talk you can do conditioning poglorian conditioning on it and it is learned its behavior has been changed by its environment and you hear news about something terrifically depressing going on an you refuges and in wherever and as a result you feel a little tit more helpless an e less it a sense of efficacy in the world and both of your behaviors have been changed coerce gas but the remarkable thing is it is the exact same neurobiology the signal transduction pathways that were happening in that sea snail in corporate the exact same kinase is in radiates and phossitases that we do when your having mammalian fear condition or when your learn it is can served it is the exact same thing it is simply playing out an obviously a much much fancier woman and because you have learned that change is possible despite understanding mechanistically that we cannot change ourselves volitionally but because you understand changes possible you have just changed the ability of your brain to respond to optimistic stimuli and you have changed the ability of your brain to now send you in the direction of being exposed to more information that will seem cheerful rather than depressing o my god that is amazing what nelson mandala and martin your king than all these folks did while under the most adverse of circumstances they were able to maybe i can also maybe i can go read more about people them to get even more day to points of changed in your chemistry that your responses are different now and your tilted a little but more in that direction of feeling you can make a difference instead of its old am hopeless enormous change can happen with the last thing that can come out of a view of we are nothing more or less tin the some of our biology ans interaction with environment is to throw up your hands and say and thus it is no use trying to change anything we can acknowledge that change is extremely hard to impossible that circumstances can change and yet that striving to be better human beings is still a worth while endeavor to have that correct absolutely because simply the knowledge either from experience or making it to the end of the right near biology class has taught you that change can happen within a frame work of a mechanistic near biology you ware now more open to being made optimistic by the good news in the world around you you are more likely to be inspired by this or that you are more resist an to getting discouraged by bad news simply cause you now understand it is possible yet somebody who spent much of his career working on the hippocampus i have to assume that you are a believer in neral plasticity that nerve circuits can change in response to experience and that some of the same called lowdown mechanisms of prefrontal quarters that we were talking about before can play a role there that the decision to try and change and the pursuit of knowledge and the pursuit of experience can chape our circuitry and therefore make us different machine to speak ye and not only can say prenatal harmonic loser change the way your brain is bin constructed but learning that prenatal harmony exposure can change the construction your bring will change your brain right now and how you think about where your intentions came from what maybe that had something to do with it the knowledge of the knowledge is an effector in of itself that such an important and powerful statement not to hear i think that many people think that if a tool it is does not involve a pill or a a or a protocol i that it is useless and certainly there are pills and protocols that are very useful in a variety of contact for a variety of of things but the idea that knowledge itself where as you put it knowledge of knowledge is itself a tool i think is a very important concept for people to imbed in their minds and listen i ism grateful for this discussion and for you raising these topics i think that people i many people know your work on testosterone on stress and we have covered some of thou to day the work on free will and this idea that we are hopeless am or that we are in total control i give i think ism realizing and listening to you that it is an n other neither is true and that the solution resides in understanding more about free will and alack of it i and and also nerd plasticity am your working on a book about free will am are you willing to tell us a little bit about that book and where you are in that process and what we can look forward to ya it is go on really slow am title is determined am a science of life without free will an essentially the first half of the book is trying to convince a reader kaif not that there is no free will whatsoever but at least there is a lot less than is morelassumed an am going through all the standard arguments for free will and why that does not make sense with twenty first century science am and that has led to leading reading a lot of very frustrating philosophers who basically a willing to admit that stuff is made out of dams and molecules and tree o physical reality to the world they are not just relying on magic but that they believe in free will for magical reasons and where does not except case the first half of the book is to hopefully convinced people tat there is much lust free will lease think and then second half is this gigantic juncture built iron the fact that haven't thought there is any free will since i was sling an adolescent m and dislike thinking that way i still have absolutely no idea how your suppose to function without belief how are you scooter go about every day life if anything you feel entitled to is not true if any angers and hatreds you feel our unjustified if there is no such thing is appropriate in or blame were punishment or praise a reward none of it makes any sense and somebody even compliments you in your hair cut and you have been condition to say o thanks as if you have something to how ere we supposed to function with that come and the second half is wrestling with that and what the punch lined there is is its good be credibly hard and if you think it is goo to be her to subtract a notion of free will at of making sense of serial murders its could be a thousand times harder of making sense of when somebody says good job to you and is it is the exact same in reality of sort of our interpretations it is gold be incredibly hard but none the less when you look at the history of how we have subtracted the notion of agency at of all sorts of realms of blame starting with thinking that which is caused hailstorms five hundred years ago to the notion that psychodynamically screwed up mothers cause ketsofhrania we have done it we have done it endless number of times we been able subtract out a sense of volition in understanding how the world works around us and we do not have murderers running among on the street and society has not collapsed into a puddle and in fact it is a more humane society the good news is it is possible because we have done it repeatedly in the past but it is going to be hard as hell and it is hardest held to try to write about that coherent la om disgoverents o it is goal slowly well i speak of for many many people when i say that we are really excited for the book when it is done and we will patiently wait a but with great excitement for the book determined you said as the title correct yo determine the science of life without free will seems at you cannot publish your book these days without a up titles o that is as its fantastic well very side to read the book am very grateful to you for this conversation to day i learn upon am every time you speak i learn and for me it really been a pleasure and a delight to interact with you to day and over that the previous i years am i should say as as cotton i thank you again robot for a everything that you do and all the hard hard work in thinking that you put into your work because it is clear that you put a lot of hard work in thinking and we all benefit as a consequence thanks s thanks sir having last thank you for joining me for my conversation with doctor robot supolski if your enjoying this podcast and learning from it please subscribe to our tube channel in addition you can leave us comments and suggestions for future episodes and guests in the comment section on you two please also subscribe on apple and on modify and on apple you have the opportunity to leave us up to a five star review end a comment in addition please check out the sponsors that we mentioned at the beginning of this podcast that is a terrific way to support us and for those of you that are interested in supporting research on stress on sleep and had a better access sleep and combat stress you can do that by supporting the research being done on those topics in my laboratory you can go to superman lab dot stamford dot e d you and there you will see a tab entitled support research in the superman lab that is for work at the superman lab at stamford not the superman lab podcast and there is a make a donation tab where you can make a tax deductible donation and as mentioned the beginning of to day's episode we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they make single ingredient formulations that are the absolute highest quality and ship international if you go to livemomentous to calm slash superman you will find many of the supplements that have been discussed on various episodes of the superman lab podcast and you will find various protocols related to those supplements and if you are not already following the superman lab on integral please check out superman lab on instergram and on twitter on both those channels i post information about scents and science related tools anywhere from one to five minutes some of that information overlaps with the podcast but a lot of it is unique and different from the information on this podcast and last bat not least thank you for your interest in science

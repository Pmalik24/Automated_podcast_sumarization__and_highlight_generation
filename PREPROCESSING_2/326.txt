welcome to the hubermanlatconcas science science ta to s life recently the hubermalabhosted a live event at the meridian theater in pronto on trio the event consisted of lecture entitle the brainbody contract followed by a question an answer session we wanted to make sure that the question and answer session was available to everybody regardless of who could attend in person i also want to make sure to thank the sponsors at that event which were e g one and eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity one of the key things to getting a great nights sleep is to make sure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct and that is because in order to fall in stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees with eight sleep you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment in the beginning middle and end of your night it has a number of other features tracking the amount of rapid i moment an slow wave sleep that you get things are essential to really dining in the perfect night sleep for you have ben sleeping on an eightsleep mattress cover for well over two years now and it has greatly improved my sleep by fall asleep far more quickly i wake up far less often in themiddle of the night and i wake up feeling far more refreshed than i ever did prior to using in eight sleep mattress cover if you to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dock calm slash supermen to save one hundred fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep kelly ships to the u sea canada u k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep dock calm slash supermen g one is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking g one since two thousand and twelve me delighted that they sponsored the live event the reason i started taking g one and the reason i still drink g one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it provides insurance that i get the proper amounts of those vitamins minerals robotics and fiber to insure optimal mental health physical health and performance if you would to try g one you can go to drink g one doc calm slash superman to claim a special offer they are giving away five free travel pay plus a year supply of demand three k two again that is drink a g one dock calm slash superman to claim that special offer and now without further ado the question in answer session from our live event at the meridian theater in pronto ontario o k ism what motive ate me to do the gest series with pal contioceseo first of all for those was that do not know pal counties a psychiatric is a stamford and hazard trained psychiatric and i wanted to do the series with pal for several reasons and we initiated that series a first of all i he is incredibly talented as a cognition and yet ism despite having written an excellent book about drama i felt that two things were true for sure one is that most people will not get the opportunity to work with pal sadly is teatime limited and second that his expertise is incredibly vast not just restricted to drama dramas if understood can be transmuted into de sources of knowledge that other people can benefit from it indeed ism what i found in pal as i got to know him is that he has just profound insight into the unconscious mind and people had long asked me you round in and around the pockets what about the subconscious what about the unconscious and i was of the mind that the supercomputer of the human brain is the forebrain the thinking planning contact setting piece ripe evener forehead other lot's the reason that we are not the house cats the house cats of the house cats and that reason were the curators of the planet but pal said on inn non the unconscious mind is the supercomputer of the mind we that sounds great but how do we understand the unconscious mind and he has a really biological and psychological an psychiatric understanding of the unconscious and in that series he talks about these called cupboards that we can look into in order to better understand our unconscious unconscious mind in order to allow unconscious mind to teach us things about ourselves that are useful and their three main places where our unconscious teaches us useful things that allow us to be more conscious of the way that our brain is working in useful ways a the first is in these liminal states between waking and sleep it really does seem to be the case that when surprise surprise we are completely still and we are emerging from or we are dropping into states of reduced autonomic arousal but our level of thought if you will is still active enough that we are aware maybe even lucid dreams and also in dreams our unconscious mind uses as i think young android pretty well understood symbols to teach us things but everything's flipped and there genders flip the put just cause he route having a conflict with somebody in your life who a a man does not mean that that person shows up as a man that could hope as an animals a species are flipped the symbols become mishmashes but pal made it very clear that all this can be parsed if you do a certain kind of introspective work and i thought that would mean a lot of talk therapy that people would or how we can get people to learn how to d talk there be by themselves we want to keep things as much independent of cost and things that and the practices he started talking about or incredibly simple things mirror work the some of the psychologies in the room will be familiar with this i thought mirror work what is that he said literally people trying to actor it there unconscious it notice excuse me access they are unconscious in sleep by a practice of staring into the mirror for some period of time while awake in reflecting on self and aspirations in the idea of the body is a container all the sot stuff even for a kid from northern californium and really will new a but here it is scripted by pal into a formal structure that one can use to parse your own mental health and enhance mental health that was the reason for for doing the series and especially the the episode on relationships not just romantic relationships i found has not come out yet incredibly interesting because he talked about how in his clinical experience all virtually all the stuff that people pay attention to in relational stuff is are they enorsisis are they obsessive is this person a musician verses whether or not ism an account ant would are we compatible that none of that stuff predicts anything as well as the balance of these three drives the aggressive drive the pleasure drive in the called generative drive and i found it to be fascinating and ism excited for that episode the other episodes come out but basilycause pal's brilliant and he makes the o what i consider pretty obscure and a opaque very clear and concrete in their bunch of work sheets again all available as your cost and none of them requiring that you do therapy with anybody if if you choose not to this is all the kind of work one could do on one's self and the lasting it'll say about this is that d i should have said this first is at the primary motivation was we did a series of doctor any galloping on physical fitness why is not there a series on mental fitness i what is that why do we talk much about mental health when we are and it is usually a conversation about mental illness what people should have tools and practices that are zero cost i believe to be able to interestpact in a structured way and enhance their mental health the independent of their level of income i think pal was the god to do it and will do more of that with other people as well because no single episode about any topic or series can exhaustible cover at any topic of a lord notes we we will try o k next question what are the recommended photo calls in best practices to unhandsome emotional resealing tome develop effective response during highly figuring situation your ask in the wrong guy ye i mean i do not snap i do not snap i was a wild tea readout but i do not snap ism not the aggressor but i do have a snap but and it is been pushed ut before and have to say when that happens it is really kind of a scary thing not to me right it has been many years but i think any one who is who is hid that threshold where you just you try not to say something you say it anyway that that is usually hollow it shows up for people i think we hear the statements be responsive not reactive id that is why i became a biologist was self that makes no sense to me in that moment how are you responsive not reactive to me only what are the tools clearly as you go up that continuum of autonomic arousal it becomes much harder to do whatever that means right that hence the the tools for reducing streets in real time i i think the one that we have not emphasized much on the podcast and by the way thanks to some great theropyan that was not voluntary i id was a able to i was a wild kid a wild wild kid i hung on wild kids and i things were pretty different then and we we worked it out no but i think nowadays it is wonderful because i think people are more conscious of the need to understand their nervous system their own psychology that was not as salmon back then in fact i hid the fact that i had to defray for a long time thinking lied you wens getting i crazy they did call me crazy you i think thinks are really changed i think the last twenty years have brought about a profound shift in the way that we think about our own species and what what a e useful tools and practices and i think that one of the things that is abundantly clear is that that threshold for a stress response really is different for different people different indifferent situations but that it is something that can be am practiced and elevated and in terms of not getting near that trigger point out through the types of practices i talked about earlobe getting more comfortable with a adrenalin circulating your system is what it is really about frankly but it of course at all starts with a good nights sleep or edit in to make you far less reactive but of course when you are strait that is often when you are not getting good sleep i think that ultimately that our ability to as more emotional resilience and effective responses during triggering situations is really the consequence of practices of taking good care outside of those situations and then of course inevitably there will be situations where people get trigger and it is actually interesting to see the way that people behave on line and the fact that many people in fact and science as well have literally lost their jobs for having not ben able to control their thus it is have we are in an odd time where there is that the the distancing of doing things on line i supposed to person where people somehow engaging saying things and doing things that they would not in person but i think that ultimately it is the consequence of goods self care and this gets actually back to some of the things that are covered in the county series we here about self care as we think that means messages which are great by the way and we think that is about exercise and that is wonderful but much of self care is about really making sure that our nervous system is in the state that we need to be in in order to go about our day and i think this is why morning routines and practices are vital i think at those set the stage for the emotional resilient the set the stage for avoiding getting trigger to speak i do not think there is a lot that one can do in real time except perhaps physiological size sorry to give you a sort of empty answer ism not a pessimist on this frumbut it is i think that ultimately it is saying what would if you have to scale the side of a building to get in you locked yourself out and whacking you to prepare for that we can buy a ladder but if you do not have a ladder what cut what you probably should do is be physically fit enough to you no climb up a railing or something that know how to pick a lock or something that i think ultimately that it is the consequence of stuff that is done away from those triggering situations that question pleas would you describe the brain activity of somebody when there is suddenly inspired and hadn't foster inspiration you life well i talk to little bit about this but i i will say that that the best way to foster inspiration is in the words of the great love strummed they actually call it summers law no joke no in put no output i think one of the things that have observed over and over again is that as much as we need to dedicate ourselves to our craft to our family's to our friends that ultimately our best ideas come from desperate experiences when we are not seeking a particular kind of i put to get ideas now maybe this practice of being completely still while being alert fosters a lot of i i think the way i understand is more of a guttering up of a stored information in the unconscious i think rick would talk about it or pal con to would talk about is guttering up from the unconscious because when we are focused on the outside world were taking incensory information exteroceptor as post o interception and of course that external himfrom censorinfro nation that knowing put no output is that those of the raw materials that our nervous system uses to construct ideas about anything my belief and this is a practice i do every week as i make sure that at least once a week i either walk or hike or run without any headphones and ism trying to get into states of worthlessness states where ism not digesting podcast the ism not reading a book were ism not listening to a lecture were ism not in conversation and essentially trying to turn off the the linguistic narrative i we are a story telling species we tend to take all all our internal and external experience and construct things around language but languages not spoken language is not the language of the nervous system the language of the nervous system still remains to be identified it is something else for people that think and feels it will certainly corporate that spoken language of course is important and we have some coarse structures to spoken language recover this podcast episode with my friend at exchange but ultimately the the way to come up with new ideas inspiration is going to be to collect the raw materials of experience and then give ourselves these periods may be even just five ten minutes you to lay around half the day doing nothing still what awake and give that those raw materials the opportunity to to marinate and combine in whatever ways that are unique to you and then to guise or up i what inspiration looks in the brain we do not really know ism there is awe there some studies about awe but that is different i the the word that better comes to mind is delight awe tent in my mind is something that we we witness that from overwhelms our attention what delight is when it somehow links up with our own internal narrative i have something to do with what is happening ism not just here to wit n is it you'll firework show really impressive fire were show us all but there is nothing to do about it it does not relate to anything about you really you are purely a spectator we are as delight as when you see something and it is somehow links to something in your emotional r personal history or how you are wire that now there is something to do about it that is inspiration and we do not understand a where that exists in the brain or what that looks but i think we all recognize that feeling when it happens and it is o wonderful o we next question please how can canadians fight the seasonal depression winters er too long ere o key well will this gives me an opportunity to share with you what i think is one of the coolest things about our species knows i say that about many things em we have talked about circadian rhythms right sunrises sunsets and we get that information transmitted into our nervous system by looking at the sunrise by the ay you do not have to watch the sun cross the horizon it seems to be low solar angle low in the sky once it is overhead it is a different signal is a low solar angle that is what it is about it is not necessarily about seeing the sun cross the horizon by the way some one m the other day on my team said we will not you get cataracts if you look at the son low solar angle sunlight it is very unlikely to cause cataract's to she be to strip attend to thirty minutes that solar your the sun overhead is when it is quite bright yes indeed some people are going to be at rest for cataracts o opthemoljust in the audience can attack me for that one but it was our chair abothemology it istandfor that sat it s common a trust o we that is circadian twenty for hour rhythms but there is also the circanual rhythms if you are at a fairly northern location on the planet night servery long days get short in winter what happens then well melatonin the hormone of darkness right is essentially obliterated by light by sunlight what is happening when days are you twelve hours long you have very little megaton in the duration of the megaton an signal is very short then as you proceed into the fall days are getting shorter nights are getting longer the duration of the melatonin signal is getting longer and longer then is course in winter is lot more darkness meet ton an signals are very long daylight signals are very short because the days are short because it one well that is obvious thank goodness but what that means is incredible what that means is that you have a hormone melatonin that secreted from your pineal gland which de cart called the seat of the soul cause is only one of them in the brain o noway came up at that one but the panel secrete smelatonean and it and you suppress megaton an secretion with sunlight viewing there is a couple of synapsis on between the eye and the pinelbudy gets there up through the back basely serial gangly what is wild therefore is that the location of the earth around the sun and the tilt of the earth is translated into a curl and then a hormonal signal in your brain which to me is amazing that literally means the that the position of the earth around the sun and it is tilt are translated into a physiological signal that is working unconsciously to tell your brain and body what time of year it is but it does not care what time a year it is it cares about where you are in this orbit about the sun if you think about when days are say eight hours long in the fall verses eight hours long in the spring what is different what is different is how long the signal was the day befog or the seasonable depression we now know is the consequence of the monotone and signal getting longer not an absolute duration of the megaton and signal in other words in the spring when a day is eight hours long but yesterday the day was seven hours and forty minutes long your brain has a memory of how much monotone and was released the day before much more then that particular day it is a slow integrating clock this is very roundabout way for me to teach you about the megaton and seasonarym cycle and answer the question directly by saying if you want to offset seasonal depression what you want to do is extending amount of bright light that you are getting in the morning slightly as days get shorter but it is the extension of the bright light exposure and if you cannot do that with sunlight piers no sunlight cause you live in torn not to rondeau what you want to do is find some artificial source that you can look at in the morning before you leave your home and i have not talked much about this on the podcast because our listeners are extended around the globe and not just in northern locations but what this essential means is getting maybe two to three minutes of bright light exposure as your heading from fall until winter nightlight from an artificial source you do not need to purchase a called sad lamp one of these very expensive seasonable effect depression a lamps you can what i did was i purchased cause ism very sensitive to seasonal changes and light even though i do not live very far north as you can get a nine hundred lucks a drawing tablet these are quite inexpensive they are not zero cosmic quite inexpensive and just put that on your desk or on your wherever you make your coffee in the morning ninety minutes after you wake up the sort thing and just get five or minutes before you leave the house and then as you extending to the winter you wouldnognot to be neurotic about increasing the duration every day you could actually the way the inches slow integrating clocks a work you guy actual even just hold it a little bit closer each day do not burn your eyeballs out a littlest closer each sdablut essential if you just dose yourself with a little bit more bright light early in the day as you extend into winter that will essentially trick the the melatonin system into thinking that you are going from eight hours into ten hours of light as oppose to eight hours into six hours of light very simple and if you cannot get one of these nine hundred lucks tablets or something elf a website then you could do this with any bright incandescent ball should work i again just be careful not to put it directly against your eyeball next question please how do increased in oral plastic well visit this is an opportunity to talk about something i should have said earlier which is that ultimately whether or not you are triggering neural plasticity through elevated focus or whether not you are taking hydro syllicive an your business not mine and we can talk about psychedelics if you want just criminalized and californium are soon to be decriminalize all be her enthusiastic ye had the one thing have do have been pretty a vocal about my belief that the date are really interesting to say the least about not microdosing by the way there there is not a lot of evidence that microdosing is useful ism not saying it is not but they are not about of clinical trials showing that but the two macrocosm with with effective therapeutic support trials are very encouraging not just for major depression but also fore very seeing disorders alcohol i use ticeorder which is by the way that the term that people are starting to shift to as supposed to alcoholism or alcoholics now aldol justice order which is not to be politically corretural just you understand what they are talking about when they are talking aboalcol justice order ah whether not solicited whether not to d m a whether not it is frustration be ought about by your inability to play an instrument and the in determination to to do it is in the end it is all about deployment of the neuromodulators demodulators being some commination of dopamine ceratonan a a seat of cosine or apinefron again usually in commination what is very clear is that the ceroplastic of effects of em d ma the ceroplastic effects of sell site are brought about by huge increases in keratose this is also can help us understand why for some years and to some extent till now it was thought that the assessarise the select of ceratoid septic inhibitors would be good treatments for depression i think some people by the way have experienced tremendous relief from the accessories we do not want to demonize them all at the same time it is very clear that depression is not simply low levels of ceratoneent that is also not true hence why there is effective in some people into depressence propriren that increase dopamine an epineferon and and not teratogen the point here is that these neuromodulators as they are called allow for what they allow from modulation of synapses which effectively allows for negro plasticity mean ultimately whether not it is through talk there be condoling breathing a you no hydosylicid ban eddy ma or the commination which i think is called a hippy slip never done i together i confessed never done him together but have do it with a inclination by the way in legal s the circumstances and not a lot a not not often that is it is very clear that it is opening windows for plasticity now it is intriguing if we're going to just talk about psychedelics for a second is why a drug empyema which increases doom which by the way empyema is merlin doxy met hem fermi tolling anybody tell you it is om linger it is math it is math but it is met with a lot of seratonean thrown in their too but it is met and it is clear that for the treatment of pities it holds promise it is not absolutely safe i especially re people party at conditions and you if yore going to go down that path you want an need a a skilled guide and this is the i think the laws are really going to have to am pay careful attention to what who and what is a skill to guide look a and when it comes to suasion the serotonin increase is what effectually causes broader inactivity in the brain what is interesting is tat both of those drugs increase plates mainly through increases in keratose abut working on divert different receptors say different types and outputs of plates what is interesting to me is that because ism a strong believer that children should not be doing psychedelics nor shall we be giving children psychedelics is that the the increases in inactivity in the brain that are the consequence of playing a musical instrument or ideally an instrument with others as a child mimic a lot of the broader scaleconactivity to call call resting network inactivity that occurs when people take psychedelic as adults in other words and i cannot emphasize this enough and again i failed at music miserably it'll tell you story about that i a second but s getting kits to play an instrument is it is very clear improves their ability to learn all sorts of things for their entire life is just important i do not really know what to do about this are who to shout at or talk to about keeping the arts active and in schools as an physical education but the idea that we would just train kids in math as just frightening because if you want them to be truly good at math and science you also have them play instruments by the way when is a kid play the violin my parents made me was not the instrument a our playing we have only one picture another taught me the spoke method is was o learn b ear and there is one picture and all the other kids have their bows up and my bow is down and ism standing here on the stage and my fly is down and i and that and literally the neighbors dog hold and i quit after that concern i was aromatized be they show me the picture my sister tease me relentlessly norplasticity figure out your choice way to increase a nermogulator certonein ore have been afferinasee to coin ut do not mean i honestly would not encourage pharmacologic were psychedelic approaches as your primary entry point i really do not i think that there is a place for that and certain circumstances but that would not be the primary entry point next question please what type of movement protocalled you recommend for somebody is working from home sitting behind the computer from eight a m to five p m oh o get will couple things i mean i can make all sorts of recommendations get up early and young move and if you can take brakes and walk this sort of thing but but let us it let us assume that all of that is is kind of understood that there certain forms of exercise that we should all be doing three i think now it is are clear based on the beautiful work of peter ta whose brothers in the audience by the way to night yet ye he's got a younger brother you've got a younger brother coypu lair peter a tea was your older brother imagine be pretty cool the i sort of adopt people as sibling they do not know it but i do bi just assume peter was my older brother returns out he has a younger brother already and peter's essentially a hammered home the truth which is that we should all be getting somewhere we ton a hundred fifty o two hundred minutes of called on too cardie were are walking a lot and we are moving about where we can just barely hold a conversation i knows people in to seem to walk a lot that is great and then threedays a week or resistance training and the bunch of other mobility things that we should all do stoat we do not fall in breaker hips rosettes where another bone cause its another way that people really limit their help seen an lie spent and on and forth but two things that can make being at a desk which i loathe even hough i to learn i hate sitting still a you can do the standing best thing i do that by stacking boxes the other thing that was interesting did any one see the study out of the universe texts who was in housetop this last year about the silliest push up did they would see this this as pretty interesting the silliest this in wider flat muscle below the gastrocnemius of the calf is a really unique muscle in the human body it is one percent of the total human musculature but it has an ability wat we will soon be for obvious reasons to a dramatically shift fuel utilization in the body but they did in the study was they had people who were sitting for you three or four hours a day just simply raise their heel seems almost silly real they call the holiest push up when i called at that on line i literally got a back by the jimbrows telling me that is a seeded calf rays o we intend we o we no wonder they this upper since thing gets coded don't ye all get really aggressive they lift their heel and they put their pushing their tow down and some people thing of it is balancing the knee but it is really about pushing the tow down and lifting the heels they just simply had these sedentary people do this heel rays and what they saw was that there was a dramatic highly statistically significant increase in blood glucose utilization and reduction in in both insolent levels during that activity and around the clock really interesting what they were doing was mimicking some aspect of walking now is it as good as walking no but if you are stuck behind a working from home sitting behind the computer from eight a m to five p m get what they found was that people getting into this unconscious pattern of lifting their heel over and over and shifting back and forth mimicked a lot of the effects of walking it is not a replacement for exercise but the shifts in glucose and insolent it'll put an utilization sleeves me utilization an output respectively ah we are we are very impressive and this a group down the very of use a yours of texts and stop is starting to incorporate this into people who have limited mobility ah and it does not seem other limb movements can do this there is something special about the silliest it was designed in misquotes am to be a muscle that is used repeatedly over you know extended hours of time and has this unique pathway of full utilization is it going to curobesity no but if your stuck behind a desk that would be something useful i have this little fidget thing i was too lazy to build one but a i found one on line for couple box we are you just when you stand at your dusk have just you can a kick it back and forth i will not seedless it canquell then you just can kick them back and forth and some people tread mill at the desk i cannot do that i cannot do that many things but i also m still working on this one i cannot cannot quite do that a next question please my morning meditation consists o coquet and then i think we are about out of time but the yes o my morning a meditation is not really a meditation it is a perceptual exercise and that perceptional exercise is has a weird name cause i gave it a weird name i then i did not intend to sound mystical big do not want credit for it but i call it peacetime bridging but it is not that what it really is is that the to me one of the most interesting things about the nervous system is our ability to orient indifferent time domains is gets a little bit abstract but we know from states of high stress that we start fine slicing time we know this right the world becomes a slow motion video because frame rate has increased we has a visual vision real scientist i can tell you at in my laboratory we were doing studies with virtual reality where we can crank up people's level stress by giving them certain visual stimuli and then there ability to parse information is clearly increasing in the time domain there find slicing much in the same way that when you look at a slow motion radio somebody docking a basketball or something that sorts because the frame rate went up when we are in high alertness states or frame rate increases when we are very relaxed our frame a decreases for your rid running in your lying there look at the sky your frame rate is probably slower than if your hyper focussed on omiganis am like you sit li imagine a dreadful situation where somebody sends you after message let us make it positive somebody is have not a child in your family and you is it healthy ye roman danio k dammit seconds feel minutes minutes feel ours because your fine slicing time and the mombabyour fine o karate a happy story end great when we are very relaxed we tend to been time more broadly now it is also true that your visual system and your perception of time or inextricably linked such that if you close your eyes and your focussed on your internal state you are fine slicing time and the second hand if you will is more or less the the metronome rather is your breathing or and your heart rate from combined when you open your eyes and you look at something in your immediate environment when you move from called interception to extra reception you start yo your perception of time shifts fairly dramatically and you now perceive time according to believe or not the speed of images moving in your environment relative to you and then as you look out further on to say the horizon you extend the time domain even more if you then imagine yourself in the whole globe you extend your time domain even more my morning meditation if you will to morrow a perceptional exercise is to step through these different time domains to close my eyes and focus on my internal stay open my eyes and focus on something close by look at further look a bit further think about to myself on at on the globe the whole world moving to you really extending your space domain and then the time domain expands with it oukown this it comes up when you see these little means of any time you are worried just remember you are a little dot on a little blue dot spending in the universe the this kind of thing but you do not think that way when you are stress you are thinking ism the blue dot you are the problem whatever i want that you your not thinking this perceptual exercises away of training the nervous system my nervous system to shift deliberately between these different time domains and for me it is been very useful for improving task switching something that as you probably have notice ism not very good at i go into the trench i do not leave the trench very easily ah that is been very useful and if you are interested in this in more detail there is a wonderful book called a the secret pulse of time and there is a pinchcock move this discussed in that book which the move is about seventy five minutes long and during the course of that move the background actually includes rising and setting of the sun and a bunch of different speeds of movement and interplay between the characters and you are perception at the end of the move is that a much much longer period of time occurred because of s unconsciously your brain was paying attention to these circadian signals and these other signals in absolutely fasting m in pinchcock not o you citchcockfohim but now i after seeing that as i while that is genius he captured this peacetime thing what you see out the window is in one time domain in the room is a different time woman i will not tell you ho killed who but it is very very interesting and the point being that when your visual system is up close folksong on things up close or internally you are your fine slicing when you folk somethings further away you are more broadly focussing and on and forth that is a morning meditation i do it only perceptional exercise henry takes about a minute or and the other thing is that on the monitors they are flashing now that was your last question i i wanted to say a couple of things before we go first of all thanks to all of you who i stood out the night and for the long duration i realize this stuff is nutty detailed and a lot of other things you could be doing with your evening in your time and ism very a grateful that ah it will him together to night for this what i to think was a discussion and i also just want to thank every one for o your interest in the podcast a it is a labor of love ism highly dependent on my team for doing all of it i do not do it alone by any stretch but as much as it might seem it is me talking to all of you it really is about all of you that is the reason i do it and ism ever grateful and it'd certainly be remiss if i did not say thank you for your interest in science

congress offers a government shut down at the very last minute representative hemal women pulls a fire alarm to delay the vote and representative mandates threatens even mccarthy's speakership ism bencher this is the benchvirosho the benshvir show doctor baexpressvpien protect your line privacy today express vepiandicoms lash men treaty it looked as though there was going to be a government shut down over the weekend it was averted at the very lass minute mainly because even monarchy decided the who is on to move forward with what we call a clean continuing resolution ticks about forty five days into the future takes us into nonmember tit s dis not include funding for the crane war the senate then quickly pass that and then it was signed by president badness happen bout three hours before a shut down was set to take effect the democrats obviously did not want to have some sort of deep abiding fight over you crane funding in the continuing resolution they did not want to go tote america people and say the reason for having the government shut down right now is because we meed billion dollars for for the crane war again the sentiments against the america funding of the crane war is growing and growing mainly because the united states has never presented a plan for any sort of offramp if you actually want the america people to back plan you have to have a plan but the by demonstration has no plan democrats in one to have the dobby publicly now the reason that this deal ended up getting done in the way the got don is because there was a wing oh the republican party that actually scuttled a significantly better do just a couple of weeks ago it looked as though the republicans were going to pass a house resolution that would provided for continuing funding for the government that would have amounted to an eight per cent cut in discretionary spending over the course of the next next number of months and not only would including eat per cent cut to would also include bore security measures and for some reason that no one can discern mandates and company on the right wing of the republican caucus decided that they were going to not vote for that they wanted more they wanted no spending whatsoever they will not going to explain exactly what it was that they did want or what they thought could pass the senate instead they were just going to stand there and shout no at even my earthy and a lot of people i won't understand war shouting at him what what do you think he can do hes a democratic senate and a democratic president he already one one government shut down to bate with hoiden because jobidon a fool came out and suggested that we was not on a negotiate whatsoever overspending another he ended up caving and earthy got some funding cuts around the edges when the same thing was going to happen here my earthy was going to pass a bit that including eight per cent discretionary funding cut and for security measures these then get to go to the senate and democrats were going to be forced to argue that they would rather the entire government shut down than that these cuts be allowed or that bore security be allowed again wrong footing democrats is what you have to do to win future house elections instead the right wing of the caucus again all it takes is a couple of votes for the republicans to lose their majority on any vote because the only have two hundred and twenty one votes in the actual house of representatives of the united states they can only if fore to lose about four votes and still pass a piece of legislation by majority vote and that got scuttled and instead a worst real got ton and then that worsted is being used is we will see in second by magnates to suggest that even my earthy ought to be ousted from the speakership as basically a catch twenty two the gates was setting up for mac earthy he was not going to pass a better version of the bill for some unspecified reason because my earthy was a sell out and then when worse version of the bill gets pass than its because mac earthy is a sell out in any case according tote waster turn the house voted three thirty five to ninety one for the measure exceeding the two thirds majority needed to clear the bill which was considered under special procedures requiring a super majority o votes all but one democrat voted in favor of the measure while nearly half of republicans voted against it several hours later the sent voted eighty eighty eight to nine to pass the legislation and then jobidons signed the measure this prices break through up ended expectations congress was two divided s pass anything in time to keep the government from partially shutting down at twelve one am on sundae house democrats initially were suspicious of the proposal and stalled for tin as well talk born just the second on of the procedures for stalling for time involved actively pulling a fire alarm in order to create some sort of emergency protocol response to delay the vote on the senate side anger over the move to pull u can a led to a nerve racking dinner time at delay the measure include sixteen billion dollars in disasterelief it o its assistance for u crane it excludes word security measures sought by republicans and a renews the expiring fooling churn program through nonmember seventeenth and reauthorizes the federal aviation administration through the end of remember reive for its own part is in u crane there down playing a lack of u crane aid in the new spending bill you crane's ambassador to the united states corona sarcoma sarcoma marcorova she said there are fun the government will work there is no threat to the supply of previously proved weapons and equipment say there is time that therefore re sources more importantly there is by partizan an by camera by cameral support for u crane and that may well be troupe they you might be able to pass some sort of stand alone u crane aid provision but that not can be true for very long in the out congress an motherworts they are better be an exit plan as we say before jobidon for his part he came out and he praised the congress for avoiding the shut om of then blasted extreme house republicans for a manufacture crisis pat our statements and quote to night by parson majorities in the house and sendal voted to keep the government open preventing a necessary crisis that would've inflicted needless pain on millions of hard working america this pillion sure that active o new troops will continue to get paid travellers will be spared air port delays millions of women and children will continued bad acts to vital nutrition assistance and much more this good news for the america people but i want to be clear we never should have been i this position in the first place just a few months ago speaker mac earthy and i reached butcher agreement to avoid e precisely this type of manufactured crisis for weeks extreme house republicans tried to walk away from that deal by de landing drastic out to the would've ben devastating for millions of america they failed now the reason they fail by thewy is not pease of democrats the reason that they failed is because maceightes and company decided that they were going to fight back against that particular provision for again for for a reason that no one can discern it is not conservative to walk away from bigger spending cuts simply out of personal ever apparently at cave my earthy biding continued wile the speaker the overwhelming majority of congress have been steadfast in their support for your crane there is no new funding in this agreement to continue that support we cannot under any circumstances allow america support for your can to be interrupted i fully expect the speaker will keep this commandment to the people of your crandmnts cure passage of the support needed tell crane at this critical moments o he is throwing it back on mac earthy and saying that we definitely need more aid i you that t battle that is going to be a pretty significant as to how much more did mac carry is willing to pass or how much eight republicans are willing to put forward by and then followed up with that he said i hope the mac carry is now had a personal revelation with regard to the extremism of his own causes or at least that is what began is trying to say his face hold isn't work any more we yes mad one ago car still find you i is experience to speaker as been on o a personal revolution mot be petition i anyway tan an honest to god youashi clip in your frame's going to expire right an form of your eyes my god he looks terrible the y did the this duty is going to serve until a twenty twenty eight is not it is not and you frail everybody knows going into the next election cycle that bite is nokonous ragout those four years right we all know this that b he is on be a year and a half antsy to step down o coal harisgan me the president because there is no way this con continue it cannot continue this way again i knows is off topic from the continuing resolution but you cannot watch e clip of this man and assume that he is still going to be living five years from now that is that that is not a wish that is just a reality maybe he wilbuty's you basically losing it right now and that is that is not good news for theamerican people an just one second we will get to the

a without the crane funding and they were past because they want end the scene funding in the continual resolution another want a continue to poor money into you crane instep were landed the tried a bunch of tactics to to delay the vote trying to come up with some other sort of solution without having to vote for it i mum jeffreys basically tried to fillabustor the thing but hemal woman the more which congress men from new york and and there is no other way to put he is a moral i been because either he is a more in because he thinks what he was going to do was going to work or he is a morons he does not o ho fire alarms work let me explain as this vote was about to take place he apparently pulled a fire alarm in a capital office building on sturdy we do not my lay what apparently a security great video was distributed to offers they could fined the person who pulled the evil alarm see if you can spot wroth says y that is that is jail madman standing directly behind a time that says emergency exit only he a instead of walking through the tunnels or tunnels that connects at the various office buildings on on the hell instead of walking through the tunnels he he walks over to a fire alarm and he pulls the fire alarm represent i hemal woman pile the fire alarm in cannon this morning an count control by republicans on the committee it is an investigation is why he pulled it is under way there was om there is a resolution that is now circulating to expel woman from the house over the incident i the the idea of pulling the fire alarm errs to delay a vote is insane today at twelve or five p ma firearm as activated on the second floor of the cannon office building a capital police bones person said the building was evacuated while u s c p officers check the building the building was reopened after was determinedthere is not a thread investigation into what happened and why continues democrats were trying to delay starting the vote they been given very little notice about the not many complained republicans were trying devote before democrats a time to read the bill ho keep jeffreys delivered a fifty two minutes speech in attempt to have everybody sort of come up with some strategy to thwart at my earthy ultimately the both began a two and a half hours after it was schedule to start democrats over charmingly than voted in favor of the bill because they would been essentially out played by my earthy on the craned and they're getting pretty much everything all tat they wanted in this particular build though big question is why is email woman puling fireman and the answer is she is obviously attempting to delay the workings of congress now ism old enough to remember when attempting to delay the workings of congress in the official duties that they were attempting to to effectuate was considered a criminal violation punishable with years in prison if you attempt to stop the business of congress that is an actual criminal charge and if you're a congress person who pulls a fire alarm in an attempt you stop the business of congress or to lay the business of congress it is similarly criminal small bowman for his part he am he apparently is suggesting that he does not know how fire alarms work which is weird since we all nthehofhir have you've pulled the fire alarm thinking it is going to open a door is that a thing you have everyone no because you can read and because you have a functioning brain you have two choice your german woman either your two stupid to under stand what a fire alarm does or you are trying to delay voting congress which criminals either a criminally stupid or just criminal one of the two and that those are theory two choices there is no third choice you the you are a moron who does not understand that you all a fire alarm the firearm is going to go off or you are actively attempting to stop a vote in congress from taking place which is a violation of law here is his statement quote i want to personally clear of confusion surrounding to invents to day as i was rushing to make a vote i came to a word that is usually open for votes but to day would not open ism embarrass o i that i activated the firearm mistaking thinking you would open the door i regret the sin sincerely apologies for any confusion this cause to be very clear this was not me in any way trying to lay the not twas the exact opposite have trying urgently to get to a vote which i ultimately did an join my collegia by partisan efforts keep our government open also met after the vote with the sergeant an arms an the capital police at their requests an explain what it happen mi hope is no one will are more of this than what it was ism working hard every day including to day to do my job to do a well and deliver

according to bright part represent of hemal woman ripped down two signs warning a second for a door in the cannon house office building was for emergency use only before pulling the fire alarm and running out through a different door on into front floor bright our new has learned exclusively multiple force is familiar with the investigation into bowman pulling the fire alarm in the house which trigger to full skylark horsemen and emergency services response leaving to the full evacuation the building told ripe our news exclusively that bowman ripped two signs down and threw them on the ground first the source of familiar with the investigation provided bright barneys the photographs of thecae of the alleged crime later after the emergency door had been restored after the bow after the damage bowman did to it here is what the door and the sign look right afterward you can see first of all even in the phodingsy if there is the giant signals is emergency acted only even in the photo of bowman that time is right there emergency acted only tow on about you but i can read and i expect my congressmen to be able to read a i know these are really really big these are hard things to do expecting a congress person be able to read the language of english emergency exit only typically means you can only exit in an emergency i knows is i know listen i know congress is filled with absolute abject rejects from the community of people with gentian function i understand this you wait now if you look at our congress we have john fedderman and pennsylvania who does not have a functioning brain if you we have lorn sober whose fondling people during beadle juice have maul bowman who is pulling emergency my we are not sending our bast i got o be honest it you i we have a lot of bolts who are occupying the heats in congress but this is pretty next level the fire alarm that was pulled i knows enough to describe a fire alarm to you because it looks a fire alarm but it has a i lordosis fire push in pull down in the forces of the double does of glass windows they are clearly two giant red signs on the dor they boat my emergency act only push until alarm sounds three seconds door will unlock in thirty seconds my favorite part about this whole story is the media tempting to cover for for bowman mat burning who is a a self describe socialist he a he tweatit out bowman was trying to walk from the cannon building to the capital building vote unusually the cannonecit he went to would not open and have this confusing sign on it he thought it was saying you had to press the alarm to get out this all make sent what am mi missing ah the part wore its has emergency exit only that is the park that you are missing there are this is ridiculous if any republican claimed that they pull the fire alarm and than they did by accident not thinking was can open a door hat is less gan when is last ism you pull they fire alarm thinking you would open the door firearms are all about us in society every time you go to your kit school every time you go to an auditorium every time you go to a post office there firearms everywhere and one of the things that no one i know or we ever heard of is ever done pup thy fire alarm to actually open a door again his poke person says congressmen bowman's not realize who trigger a building alarm as who's rushing to make an urgent vote the congress men regrets any confusion what do you think happens when you pullifit some as they siybifore they are only she choices either he is a more on who does not a ho how english works or he is attempting to delay the vote to see for her part and another more on again we are we are only sending people with cues below seventy as members of congressthis apparently is the new rule here is a as defending gimbal bomanstonts there is a pulling the firearm he says it was an accident he thought pulling the alarm would open a door a based on the fact that the doors to his right there were locked and there was a sign that he said he was i think some one said it was confusing it'll be honest the does not really make sens to me his explanation have you talk to him wwhutwhart's going on i mean w tan i think if you actually think think from the notes of the fine i think there is there is something to be fad about the government about to get down there is a to clock that's going down e kit that are normally open and thatbiltan were suddenly clothed thrill the fire a thou i i what i am here to fay is that how is administration and let capital police and hamal woman are an active and thing for fully participating a fainter with in e fenderstine not only shes stud beshetins your stupid i just id's incredible in credible stuff meanwhile come my earthy when off on woman he says list i noticed again that when you try to delay the workings of congress then you go to jail for ever if you are a if you're republican who backstrum and if you are a congress person who does this sort of thing and then we all pretend that you do not to how to read the language of english i think eff should look at this but this is serious when you thank how other people are treated when they wanted to come in an change the course what was happening in this building and to did he deny he did it when it is on tape and ism going to have a discussion om but the democratic leader about it but this should not go without punishment y om yow then an an there is talk is to what that punishment will be will he be fully expelled from the house very doubtful well he be stripped of committed assignments almost certainly because again this sort of activity not sure how of be appropriate from any congress present president trump then of course t jump into the fray as well he prawns hames me will congressmen small woman be prosecuted in i prison for very dangerously plying in settingoff the main firearm system in order to stop a congressional vote that was going on in de his egregious act is cover on take a horrible display of nervine criminality it was very dangerous obstruction of an official proceeding the same is used against our has six prisoners actually his act may have been worse he must suffer there same fate when will his trial begin no again not not not wrong i mean the fact is that that hemal woman participating in attempting to stop the workings of congress if you think it serious on one side whits good for the goose is good for the under or it should be and just sandals get you stupidity on the other side of the allies machetes seems to believe that running directly headlong into a wall over and over is genius congressional stratigull gets that momentarily first the benshgrosho is supported by grand canyon university in affordable private christian

the fifteen rounds of voting and gates was the lead hold out in the ism not con vote for mac artsy caucus now what was weird about that whole situations i expanded time as there is no one to back gamut beaning there is no other option o mac artsy at a hundred nine your publicans would already pledge to mac earthy at twenty twenty five would not most of them were oke with going with mac earthy as long as they got a few confessions that include people representing shipway of texts anaganshiproy is a conservative with a plan macgateseems to be due without a plan very often and tom and we en the fifteen votes mac cartoons winning the speakership and since then mandates because he recognize zolitakes is peeling off five votes in order to basically thwart mac earthy being able to do anything with a pure republican house majority he is been attempting to bring mac earthy down isn't know if that is a personal animus thing i do not know whether he things that this is going to just simply elevate him in t in the minds of the america public i don't know what it is but according to the walls goral mac party's most vocal political antagonism represent mandates has repeatedly the retain to try to austomhi speaker if the carbon your publican sceduwal vote on the continue resolution shortly after the house vote gates shouted mister speaker to get theattention of represent of see woman was chasing the proceedings woman did not acknowledge gates and trout and gable the session to a close total capitulations had represent of bob good republican of virgin whose indicating could be open to supporting an afford to ausemac earthy speaker his failed to do anything that he has promise to do now again the provides the you have not made actual demands the that he is capable of achieving if you actually wish to pry confessions at a we mac artsy as i say representiveshiproy has done that repeatedly but if your version of mac earthy needs to go is he is not governing is small government conservatives o he has to go i urge you to look at the constituency of the senate of the united states which his democrat thanks to the personal intervention of donate trump in the georgia sent races and the presidency which is run by trobidin because dona trump lost to him those would be the places to look if you are thinking about how far can you cut the government successfully and the answers not particularly vars since you do not run the senate and also a run the presidency and also i seem not to remembermacgates being particularly vocal about cutting spending when dona true was the president and the republicans controlled the senate i remember him a tempting to shot down the government over spending protocol when it was an entirely republican congress and republican president of the united states w o blew out the bug to the two seventrollian dollars i remember that at all do you maybe ham just forgetful or maybe this i just politics have tried for eight months mac earthy then told or port i tried yesterday with the most conservative stop cap funding you could find i could not get two hundred eighteen re publicans and that is correct he tried to getting eight per cent budget cut ion the discretionary side and gates in company voted against it mut here is mac earthy yesterday blasting the republicans who held out is you held out in s i had to cut a worse teal thank you for that that would secure our border cut waste spending yes i did but i had some members in our own conference that would not vote for that if you have members in your conference there will not let you vote for appropriation bills does not want an omnibus and will not vote for a scop stop gap measure the only answer is to shut down and not pay our troops i do not want to be a part of that tam i want to be a part of a conservative group that wants to get things done it we mandates clearly to one n there is certain things to mandates is one that elect this is certainly not one of them and his personal grudge match against my earthy seems to be one of the dumbest things going on in congress and again congress is filled with dumb things these days gate says he is down in a file y motion to vacate the speakership and again all it requires basically is peal off give republicans and my earthy has to go to another speakership battle again what confessions is to get a pratomc he will not say what is he want for c earthy he will not say who is his back up to my earthy who is he going to put in the speakership position to take over from my earthy he will not say and neither will any one else sleeves collide does not want it him jordan does not want it in fact one of the worst positions in america politic to speaker of the house and i got be apathy my earthy far his handled it pretty well considering the slim majority that he actually has and a democratic send and h democratic president but here is mandate things going a file motion to vacate the chair are you going to make a motion to vacate speaker my earthy made an agreement with house conservatives in canary and since then he is ben in brain repeated material breach of that agreement this agreement that he made with democrats to really blow pass a lot of the spending hard rails we would set up is a lass straw n then overnight i learned that cave my earthy had a secret deal with democrats on you crane as he was bating republicans to vote for a continuing resolution without you crane money saying that we were going t jam the senate on you crane he then turns around and makes a secret deal now i know you and i probably have different views on you as involved a you crane but however you think about that question it should be subject to open review analysis and not some backroom deal i not a cate to morrow i do intend to file a motion o vacate against speaker my earthy this week i think we need to as rip off the bandage i think we need to move on with new leadership he what is that leadership he will not say he is asked who be the speaker if if you get rid my earthy who takes over for him an mates s room if you somehow succeed after multiple transit who would be the speaker i we have a lot it look we have a lot of counts of people on our conference obviously it is it is a it is an awkward discussion while our number two steel scoleesas in treatment for blood cancer sots ism not on to pass somebody over because they are getting a medical treatment i want tod i want to see how steel scores comes out of that steevescleys is not going to be de guy he already does not want to be the guy he his said that repeatedly gate says this is in personal by the way this all based one principle which i find hard to believe considering tit he voted with down on from is position in one hundred dentin congress one hundred percent of the tine literal my one hundred present which includes presumably all of done from big but your blow out an a hers mandates talking about how this is in personal about maccarthy well it matter of fact just coup la weeks ago government cart the appointed me to the national defense conference committee on the and e eh and we spoke about some of our a line to defense priorities this is not personal some people make policy disagreements personal because their own policy failures are personally embarrassing to them i hold no personal animus to any with any of my republican colleagues bother including my re publican colleguere about to have on next who hat's a pretty nurse words for me but at the end of the day this is about spending this is about the deal heaven made in canary again it it really is not it really is not ye then gates says since the nineteen nineties to toll about it it is bee about that it is it is been really about that here since the mid nineties this government has been ruled by continuing resolution or omnibus bill that is why we are thirty three shilling in debt my plan to go on to single subjects spending bills but actually allow us to put that downward pressure and bi's acknowledge that in divided government you have to work with sense democrats you have to work with the white house but i do not thing you should work with them ought a continuing resolution or an omnibus bill you should make those senate democrats have to take up our defense bill to give troops rays take up our homeland security bill to make changes at the border take up our veterans bill and if they did those things peopleoldhave to vote on specific programs rather than just sing a well i voted for the government finding bill and sure there some stuff of the department of education i do not but i had to be there for the vessel when is not it'd love all that stuff too it is also not going to happen and the reason is not going to happen he is because every time one of those bills gets brought up democrats rejected and my earthy does not have a durable enough majwarty in the house to actually get the stuff done in the firstly now to be fair to machetes when it comes to spending mandates has voted against pretty much every butcher bill that is ever been presented to him as congress person radiates is voting record when it comes to spending its significantly better than his verbal record when it comes spending he seems be come very vocal the minutes down from is not an office when it came to spending hell down from was an office he voted frankly how i would vote on my these mut your bills now but he did not talk lot about it because that would put him at direct to odd with president truck get he is don wrong on the spending but this is part of the great li of of howconsider politics works these days he gad a get what you can get the notion he can always get the moon is silly i know that there is a whole group of people out there who believe that if you just shout loud enough the magically things manifest that is not how this works when ted cruise decided to shut down the government over obomac her in the vain hope that brocchamon would repeal bomber who never going to happen hots never going had when machetes he is doing this routine in the vain hope that he is gin to get republicans to cut touch about fifty per sent democrats in the senate and join all go along with it that obviously not going to happen kepmac earthy for his part he says he do not bring it on you not you on a do this thing again let us do it mandates he says he is going too take a motion to day hate he is can try to out to you a speaker ut the house that is nothing new he is tried to do that from the moment i ran for office but all this time he says he is going to keep going he may not that that before the fifteenth ballet but it took fifteen for japan my earth u says he is coming for you can you survive yes all survive you know this is personal with mat mad voted against the most conservative ability to a protect our border secure a border he is more interested and securing levy interviews than doing something he wanted to pushes into a shut down even threatening his on district with all the military people there who would not be paid only because he wants to take this motion best bring it on lets get over with it and less start governing again my card is not wrong about this one the big promise here is he gan mate's not the only member of congress and the republican party their bunch of congress members were in purple districts you want them to lose their seems packages patently does not care because here is the thing machetes can vote against these duckbills s much he wants hes not losing his ladies a very red district but if you are for example represented mac wallet from no york o seventeen you run easily lose your seat which means the house majority is gone and when the house majority is gone what exactly the check on democrats in whatever the held that they want here is ma long or talking about this if they vote with radiates an gates only needs to have a handful of of republicans and any can remove i a speaker captain my earthy what what our message to democrats about whether not to go along with that but ultimately democrats a into make a decision a for themselves i think it is destructive to the country i to a put forth this motion a a cate we have a lot of work to do the america people elected a house republican charity to serve as a check an balance on the biting a panda and the administrations reckless spending the only way to do that is to complete our appropriations work he is not wrong about this because again id the easy tactical decide for people who i very ready areas is always take the hard line and then there is the overall job of eve my earthy to make sure that he retains his majority and does most conservative thing he can and don't online my earthy walks on water and the my earthly makes mistakes i think that he is done things that i would not do sometimes do i think than what vacates tater makes any sense it is because o radiates that the original better bill that the republicans were going to pass gotsgundled meanwhile the twenty twenty four presidential race is being up gets that momentarily first we got a wonderful lady works over here name flabby flabby does ma make up every morning she is a delight we love flabby also where all little scared if flabby flabby is the kind of person who if you cross her might

right now also back in march my good friend launch the highly successful jerseys chocolate bars hilariously labeled he him and she her only one of which has not which you you know obviously the campaign was a huge et tit told out i matter of days he will kept trying to or them we grow our inventory we also sold those out while now just in time for holoween we are proud to announce the all micro egression size chocolate bars because the truth is even sweeter one share fight back against the whole corporations who think where wolves can be mummies the t enemy's chocolate dot tom or your chocolate to day o can meanwhile the twenty twenty four race continues to be fascinating in a wide variety of waits on the democrat side of the isle robin continues to be incredibly weak listen tire campaign pitch is not can be the economic she because america hate is he colonic plans cannot be emigration mere can take is emigration plans cannot be crime pelicans don't that carnally be foreign policy since america don't that all that much it is going to be you guess it dumocersis like m in any this is jobidon's entire campaignpitch he is i got every time i see him it does not matter each individual clip on the show he looks markedly older between the eclipse the aging process he is aging that dude at the end of india a ones and the last crusade like he drank the wrong cup he pros to here is a here is jobidon talking about democracy dying that is why think the i a them c increase the foe i a fundamentals here that the democracy literary democracy his stake and and is pin adermin t institutional structures to protect it and i think the the a grin real trouble ism well that that again is only going to value if dona trump number one is the hominy number two if he makes that the centrioles of his campaign now both of those things could very well happen in fact i tars they can eighty per cent shot that both of those things happen that trump is de hominy and that asthenomeny the centerpiece of his campaign his trump because trump cannot avoid talking about trump however there is now another confound our f can junior is now talking about running is an independent which of course he is because why would not he he is not can o get the time of day in the democratic primaries they're not going to allow him to run in in a broad majority of democratic primaries he is not going to actively be on the ballet in many of these places and ta and now apparently he is going to drop his bid to challenge widen for the democratic presidential nomination and instadmounts a third party campaign for the presidency this is according to a report from mediate a cam a penny campaigninsider says body feels the dean he is changing the rules to exclude his candidates when intone an run is the only way to go how much in the not will he draw this is an open question his currently polling about fifteen per cent in the national surveys there is no actual good pole that shows trump biding ended as a three person race however what the poles do show is the republicans view kenned more warmly than democrats to there is a pole from quinipiac university for example it choose the republicans kenned forty eight to eighteen eighteen per sent in favorable forty eight per cent favorable meanwhile for democrats the quinibiac pole shows fourteen per cent favorable fifty seven per cent unfavorable the either can be a lot of republican voters who actually shift a way from the republican to get and vote for kenned is a third party option or more democrats likely to do now you can make the case either way i actually think that he is public likely in the end to draw more democrat votes why because many of the same people who kenned in the republican party really dona trump there not it is not the untie trump republican to a of a junior there is virtually no cross over in that comalaheris special than diagram and that even diagram does not include a nonmetal the people who hate dona trump love are f a junior very very small group inside the republican party however the group of people that really do not hoiden in the democratic party and the people who a of junior and the democratic party that actually is a pretty sizable groups o is can draw more from republicans more from democrats my guys is in the end he will draw more from democrats than enough to put doll trump over the top theoretically it could be this is why's he much fear on democratic sided the isle over a no labels run or corneal west or something they are afraid that cornball west might drop just enough of the black vote to hurt jobidon what about a five candidate race in which you have a no label's candidate say a mansion and you have a a corneal west candidacy which is specifically targeting the black community in som woke wives and then you have an a of a junior candidacy which is basically the burning sanders not what what what then well all of this could chip away at jobidons lead that is presume all one f the reasons why republicans are petty posited about our of a junior they think that maybe he is on a thwart mobiles reflect efforts that as sort of a fascinating dynamic to throw into the middle of the campaign meanwhile on the republican side of the isle the two main stream candidates who or opposing trump because all whether candidates on the stage are there for bleeping giggles basically the vacromasuamias have said before is running for a senate in oho or his running for a position an from cabinet or he is running for podcast timscot is there no one knows why dug burghal no one knows why cries triste because he hates life might pens because he wants to short is legacy but the only other two candidates there who are are serious candidates are nickel half and rondisantis both of them had interesting weak ends over the weak end rondo mantis when on boars so and he actually did what e shouldhave done three months ago it is an interview where he was actually able to p us back against left his tropes you will have a few vital moments he is ask by pillar you on the last elections i c you back to munch candidates who deny that you will bide one last election why did you do that and here is a tenancy's excellent answer but you campaigns for for election deniers in twenty twenty to this i do not forgive well look wot the godfather harry lake who said bodies ileginment president trumped now she is attacking me maybe i did make a mistake there cause a she is out their saying shes see you in to say that we mandated vacs and florid we did the opposite we protected people even from private mandate sos that may have been trump lost the election ad that y why did you campaign for people because i wanted to see republicans win he races at i gest him that er not at on you breaker issue for you that son demoted o you a be let us go back to twenty sixteen u your friends in hollywood were cutting had telling the electoral college to to vote against trunk in in the electro college because it was stolen they said rush stole the election for years they said that do not act this is e ne thing in modern history of the converse and he is right about that and by e he is getting applause from pillar's crowd which is a typically more to the left crowd that that's good moment for him also mar he is been clear at this a set to bill's credit and i know bill and friendly with bill i him he he said to an hosannas you did handle call hi better than are much anybody you keep wanted to get back to that and i do not blame it cause you are right we are on the sand page there and i think it is it is infare what they did to you because you did handle it better you did handle better you were right you were let us target the people protect the people who are most honorable and everybody else can go on with their lives a little better you open schools sooner and a lot of the stuff that is common the information we have after now we have had a few years to look at it you were more right and they will not give the credit that wit the o your you hit from memo they are setting us up if this a happened again they would repeat the same play book all over again and if we do not have accountabilyuts what is can happen it'll bring a countability it never happened to our country again pagan this is the stuff that de tend to show don mongo maybe it is solar me dis not his sad basis is a is starting to you actually i think turn it on a little bit yin the late stages the campaign he did screeching californium which went directly a trump we he should have all long he spin a the aliform i help he can mention and he said listen down from i a chop i turning for to red and its true i just wish that he had done some of the other stuff turn other sates blue one of my residents wit her earlier saying that he turn florid red i will say is a road rag and made the point there is no limit to what you can do when you do not care who gets the credit ah i just wish if he was the one that turn florid had that he would not of torn georgia eery going up old be get that not in good for a at a he is exactly right about this in the case that that disnansis should men making all long is donate trump one election in twenty sixteen and he as done nothing but lose since then he is lost georgia senate rases he is lost a presidential lection to jobiton a guys what winning is winning and losing his losing and his lossowat his sit his anis seems to at least be finding som sea legs in this campaign even though we are now in the later stages of the campaign meanwhile nick hale is also syringe get some traction first fall houmous be of great benefit if if the race would par down to these threes but pear down to the three could get him actual dato be can interesting right now the are too many other candidates drawing four five two per cent for sticking around and sucking up money in attention for no apparent reason over the we khan doll trump decided that he was going to go after nickel hale by calling her a bird brain ant he an't he has these nicknames for may have never bee a fan of this of this stuff in i get first fall to very very limited group of nicknames is now he has tons of them their not super creative in fact that they are non creative that he is now calling jobidin crooked job after crooked killer a now should best of average n to can a she is we a job and bagger the jo an a given jo tricked jo i i i ski well now his calling nick hale bird brain quote ago or i will never go for bird brain nickel hale no loyalty plenty of lies look at this loyalty nothing drives me crazier then the absolute stupidity of a man who is unbelievably disloyal to extraordinary numbers of people including by the way senior six protestors wart in jail because of him not pay their legal bills he is not intervene anyway those are his biggest fans and dona trump suggesting loyalty when he has crapped on pretty much everybody who is ever work for him as his great test makes me a little a little annoyed a little annoy just because it is ridiculous look ate you you to say then nick hale shouldn't runtish the bag hands shore don't say that nick hale has no business running to show in your administration in your running and and the fact is that if show willingtissr of y an that administration and thought is god administrationwhat she do in there o ka i get but loyalty loyalty dona trump done truck calling on people for loyalty is just beyond i do not understand in encase he treats ago or i will never go for big bring nickel half no loyalty plenty of lies he says for word mean nothing she even came to more lava with her family anyway hale does not have the talent or temperaments to do the job y and he is going to made with you an ambassadors there's that an every cabinet level status ism well then his campaign sent and this is typical of the way that the trump campaign works in other words amusing but incredibly ridiculous an an purple he is sent e bird cage to nick whale's door in to join iota it says from true campaigns to bird cage wit me birds because he called for bird brain at nickel halers first of all if we are to in the test puracuse nick verses trump i just got tell yo i do not think trump winds that i re e do not may down from has the lot of flattering ideas about his own intelligence he is great at a great many things and a pure acutes as that two score two standard deviations above the america average i dun know encase he his campaign sends her a birdcage because this is the way that we campaign an america ales fifth great school children there been true since twenty fifteen and it really is i gan an points of annoyance ass i know some people find this endlessly entertaining i know and i know that the find an endlessly entertaining when doll trumpet's candidates since a wheel chair to jobidon's front door and it'll be really funny and all age too an an't got when many ettisionall out in anyway he send that to nickel half and and the way the true campaign works is that that nick hale then treats that out is the afferadaof campaigning this is the message waiting for me outside my hotel room yashmak pretty pathetic try again hash you just made my case for me and tum and then the all the replies are all the replies from the trump crowd are this is just smaller this is this is fake it is not real it is not true it good it did not happen this way what is this nonsense it is all look get there is only one problem wit that there's any one problem it that trumps campaign literally sent the picture to mark cahoots to tied out it wen from as with every true narrative it wen from she definitely did not do that too a merit how dare you you are making that too he did do it an who as a job pretty funny ha ha that'get guy's pick one she is it pic going the gestating is strong an i gat that it is all prank store bull grab and toll memory an all the rest of this but i get a certain position and shouldn't from congress to the presidency should never e grow up a little bit but stay little i grow the grow the up a little bit come on y ism norm much time out trump and tongue out biding who aspic a child ism talking about lorn bullet at beetle juice ism talking about mandates challenging cave earthy on the basis of what scuttling a a better dead for conservatives ism talking about hamal busman pulling the fire alarm or to we town instar grahams of herself putting her face in ice water while she jabbersabout democratic socialism why is our class of politicos a group of five year old i do not understand i do not what maybe i do in the and i guess is the bothers fault my iris today run strong my kid's got me up at five forty five in the morning and annoyed me and they are less annoying then our political class gay an other news dial fine stein died over the week end a dial finestein was of course incredibly elderly a she she died at the at a ripe old age having served in congress for several years longer than then she was fully mentions she is at ninety years old i and him she was given the the traditional send off of the media which was pathological worship of her record the the trumped her a centrist which is very heard since she had basically one hundred per cent voting record with job have i struggle to see what exactly about her record with centers in anyway she as a she as a far left liberal person she is in my book good fit in terms of politics she did one good thing and that t was this amazing clip of dial fine sign it is it still on my favoridepolitical clipsibale time a bunch of environments was children arrive at her office to tried her about her environmental record anti and she is your children get out i i a you i o yes on ta greening i oh ye it'll tell you what we have our own green i a won you turn it you well it o a re turned round an year margin can do in at the water ten the people who in a be living wit be repeople i people an o no each interesting about this run is been doing i er year i know what ism doing you come in here and you say it has to be my way or the highway i do not respond to that i got ana elected i just ran i was elected by almost a million o cocaine and i know what ism doing wreck the children join yes of it at is at that is bed as houseman i ism yet for farewell to dial find sign on that score again best wishes to her family to serve thoron everything politically but she did dedicate three deli deckles of her to serving the united states and nancy blows she says she left on her own terms again that is that that is a weird way to say that she should have left the sennet several years ago when she was no longer mentally functional which is obviously true the it is her hers nancy plumy is yesterday you a company senator dial fine stone on her final journey home to san forget us go aboard the miletorypline it must have been a difficult journey what was going through your mind during the flight well i was with her daughter and we wit the dial it is obviously official it is political and it is very personal this is the a woman who she left on her own terms o saw you he answer lorica but she did that any number of cons when colleagues a others try to when lie her standing on an issue can i were not always on the same place from the spectrum of politics but we all cared about or country again when nancy blushes is stuff tad star tobominalle bit the filial when when we all cared about a contrinantic ploy is as far left as its possible to be her behavior an office has been egregious on multiplications be again went wen somebody passed away and the done lot public service than they deserve some respect for that now on the next controversy which is gavenueson to gavenueson has to fill her seat this means that dis the second sentence did he his head fill the first one was come all a hers when she was for no reason at all except that she is lack woman appointed by president of the united states by tropine i anta she's then replaced by ale media who know one h never heard of and now after nine instil has died governor gavenusom was getting pressure to fill that is eat with a black woman because obviously if comely arris was replaced by a latino man this means that the next seat has to be replaced by a black woman this is how we do staffing in democratic administrations now there is a problem he does not barber let o barber lee who is the prominent black a congress person running board the seat she obviously wanted to baseleachd the inherit the seat and gavenusom did not want to intervene in that because he has had ham ship running for that office nancy blows want t atamshif in that office their bunch rather can't tor running instead he is decided to choose off the board he is long off the board and selecting a person named lafonza butler to the seat now who the hell is lafonto butler lafonsa butler is a leste in democratic strategist and adviser to coal hers is twenty twenty presidential campaign in which she was wildly successful by the way comely hers was she must havebeen such an amazing campaign adviser the comely hers had to drop out before californium who such good campaignadviser she is at the only black woman serving in the a senate according to the a p and the first openly ell g b t cut persons represent californium in the chamber she leads smile's list all she does is abortion he is also from er labor leader with es a twenty fifteen saw man her wild left when credentials are well in order she is a lesbian black woman who leads in organization devoted to abortion and is a former labor leader with essay she also happens to notify from californium s there is that in her biography on the emileslest webs sad sat she is from mainland shows a residents in mainland she is from mainland congratulations to mainland on getting a third senator i suppose the wasn't gavenusom did this obviously he he checks the box that says black woman he so does not indorse barber lees who doesn't have to piss off adamship in his crowd clever pick by gavenusam who definitely is not running in twenty twenty four guise he is definitely not running or hoping that join will simply keel over and open things up a again clever political move by by gavenusom but demonstrative once again of the fact at the way to get ahead inside the democratic parties have some pretty excellent interjectional credentials o hate time for some things that i and then some things that i hate things that i to day i have to say that it is musing to watch democrats effaround and find out when it comes to emigration catchy local governor of new york the states being inundated with legal emigrants for being ship from the southern board because turns out old people boss on board with to go to new york she's well what might be a solution be t restrict migration oh you do not say caff here ego it can be done this cane done in a by prison way comprehensive emigration form that spevelys wonders people can commit well we want them to have a limit on who can come across the border it is too open right now how people coming from all over the world are finding their way through simply that may meet asylum and the majority of them seen banding up an the strength of new york and that is a real problem for new york city one hundred and twenty five thousand silly arrived in invintals and we are being tact that we are always proud of the fact that new york has the that of liberty in our honor harbor we we are my of the most diverse places on earth because of our welcoming nature and a it is at our canada welcome imocrads but there has to be some limits than plays and congress has to put more controls at the border and not in this huge threat shut own threat talk but eliminating positions for border patrol while we action to doubler quadruple those numbers get back to work and do er jobs yet there is great irony to all the democrats were claiming what won its and thestatch of liberty look at the snatch of liberty what does it say well it is in new york and apparently gigs carried that is exciting news the york times has an entire peace today titled why we cannot why cannot we stop unauthorized migration because it works apparently it is amazing according to the network times responding t the sense of crisis in new york and round the nation the apartment of homeland security recently announced to d grant temporary protected status to about four hundred seven to thousand men is garlands allowing them eighteen months to live in work in the united states this measure may help new york because many of the migrants there have travelled to the state from men is walkup but as the or dams point it out on the upper west side new york now also shelters migrant from all over the globe including ecuador eastern rope in west africa the by administrations decision on temporary protected status is it best a partial and fleeting solution the variations and policy between administrations have had almost no effect on the number of migrants trying to enter the united states through the southern border why exactly is this happening where because says the near times to everybody is very mobile also our labor markets re quit low cost labor an america consumers benefit from the low cost labor which by he way if the near times though about this for two seconds they might think hay may be the unions that were constantly backing are actually a problem for the cost of labor in the united states legal emigration to day is close to impossible for most people lot of people are trying to get through through the southern border and that is why ay well number one that does not answer why exactly we should not shut the border on a moral level but also it does raise the question if what you are saying is that the reasoning legal emigration is manitories because we need lower labor costs maybe should stop asking in stationary public policy the jacks up labor cost from union policy to monitorial physical policy to welfare programs that allow for low pay in the private sect but the nurse then subsidized by the tax payer maybe be maybe those things no nothing butler e i guess the trust can have to deal wat the fall up aurdigas the rest of the show continues at right nary

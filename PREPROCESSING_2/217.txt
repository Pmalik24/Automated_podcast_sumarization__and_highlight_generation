a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped into days episode of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our website this america life dot o work i can before the president got coronifiris which is sending everything now and to some new and unforeseen reality there we certain things aby the election that is settled into predictable rhythms right the president would talk about rioters in the streets on order jo bison would talk about domitrom's character in waist on his job when i came to the actual process of voting and the man on ballads ha going to be used by record numbers of people this year the talking points lined up this the president said the man ballast were going to be a disaster jo bison said they were a perfectly good way to vote the expert said the evident backed a biding then the president would again insist that the are disaster by would again say no the experts would again back him up he president again would call them a disaster around and round and around and circle the never ended a very tedious circle but we can remove ourselves from that circle right fatal perspective good evening to of coat for a few weeks now one of our producers ben callous has been caring around people who actually handle these ballast liberty is an calling reality if yodle touch them with their hands they stack them in stacks then o yet the person you hearing this is a windy smith she is the person who is responsible for running the election and dealing with man in ballast in all that in a small town in my home state is a is consist she is in narcosis which is way up north and i called windy because i was wondering how this bizarre year was going for clerks her u i i had seen windy in a newspaper story she had tattoos on both arms and the teacher that said we i should only one hour be happy in said that she wrote ontercycles and i just kind of thought i went a tuck to her when i originally reached out to her she was busy sending out absence ballast the people who'd requested them you all mind a bi work and pock at the came time to you no no i actually imagine that you have a lot to do right now i can an a fining in

week have taught to when a couple times now actually i and mosh times she has work to the entire time that wee been talking you can hear her kea board and her printer going in the background the whole time i got a parkin you at a it a a my happen pe all re a be i have have not open an on an in the man today windy told me in all her years as clerk this is definitely the most work shes ever had to do for elections an one of the reasons for that is that the legislature in the governor keep fighting over how everything should run there are also lot suits in wisconsin there are all over the country about what the rules for the election should be and all the little changes to come out of that stuff can be a ton of extra work for windy and wisconsin at one point they changed the rule about how many days somebody has to be a resident in order to vote windy served scrambling to fix all that she is redoing all these envelopes and then they just change the rule back meaning that all of that scrambling in work was for nothing to think you went back o prop in your envelope all ta i e you law i i a a o o a as no ism just sorry i imagine you i just said an image of you buying pesto small at coco by the ki the t and compared to a normal year we how many more times work do you feel your doing this your ism watt it the full i job is this your only jo no my part time nob we what is your what do you do when you are not doing this i work for an insurance company ism to work cant pout putting over time man there but working here oh my a but to fine when do you when you sleep a case same yous got to changes see got tonslects or manage is got can dark of and they other big thing that is taking up a bunch more time is helping voters cause people will just fill things out wrong where they do not nowhere their ballet is i touch were the other day and she was telling me about this couple i got to try to locate their number their no bed am the ballet went on to flora the not there ya the ballad cat back and going out to try to find away to fathom oh well right to i get to i through about three hundred at application to try to find there if if they have a full number when he was trying to find them which it seems something she cold id does a lot she digs up numbers for people h finds people in face book o no man i know where they live i can probably drive over there when me don with work and they hay what day you want to do the clerks that have been talking to they all ken a talk this they have this down to earth sort of civic mindedness there is is other clerk mainland pordready she is in this town call homeland which is slightly bigger than becomes it is forty three hundred people and merely pud ready spent five years in you see where she works for congress men and than she work in the senate but she got sick of washing ton and she spent the last twenty years as the town clerk for homeland i want not the count i will not to an ran try somebody and be lazy i will do everything i can i try to find a to number for if i cannot bin at fid a of if i do not have tat o for them a latter a to re to what for were doing everything we and to mane sure the o come e one thing i b very rotating om it that the confurita teary theatre out there and people believe on my coo in your town clerk i am not going to throw your ballad away and you can track it here is no way i can throw your ballet away how you envy tori about combat pick come bath out of a forbid and they open the of if i om a on whoa open e lot we cutin ail a you cannot open up the ballet ten open the to you to to head a feel an ho lection they o and we have eighteen hundred in powder in wit con fat i not a to lit you would geoid take eighteen hundred clerk to do the wrong thank of to ate ta mi me ta you back but when people cone very i tat the ho o red mi no no wit not all the clerks that i talk to and this is in republican air is and democratic air is they all seem this was sort of driving i a little nuts people getting the idea that what they do is very loose goose and that people are just gin ta cheat the system to them that is just outlandish because they say that there is too much security built into everything scotia what well they keep track of every request for a ballet unless you cannot leave the house you have to submit your idea to get an absent ballet clerks put tracking in to on the ballast and then they keep track of them when they are sent out and then coming back and then when it comes back in it has to have a voter signature and a witness signature for verification u at the end of the whole election they will softer report back to the state what ballots ended up ware which ones went out and came back in which one went out never came back say somebody moves a and they ask for a ballot in a new location that is also something the state tracts and i just when i say it is cousin is pretty typical for how all the stuff works i very all these details exist in this universe that does not forgot in any way with the discussion that i see in the national media and the arguments that i heard during the presidential debate it canseemsgan a sad that that universe the national politics universe is lobbing grenades into these woman's universe ye no i mean have been at this for couple weeks and i have not found one clerk that is worried about fraud all of them are worried about the rule changes and the number of extra mail an ballast u i mean they think they can deal with that is just lot more work but the running into these conspiracy theories lot worry ye no ye ye no that is what i am hearing mainland she s windy she is a clerk part time and she also gardens two acres and she sells vegetables on the side of the highway o in i have a rot lie thin a i o e hope no i o a no to people o wit on u but t oman o er bin i stab a o of o car cop tat o e at people are got i o no it pretty mi a of i i o for t her entropy you the i the day

o siryou can to stand touch of these clerks as everything hits up in the next couple weeks i mean as long as the land or my calls there are many jobs this around the country some of them a part time these two women on the full time some a pay jobs lots of volunteer or people the some time stamen these are people who are throwing themselves into the details of some task that just needs to get done for a country to function and doing it in the normal decent civic minded way that you would imagine that you hope for and it is throwing to say a but we are a country blest with armies of people who are trying to contribute to the communities in all kinds of ways and to days program is about to grew people that people who are as best was we can tell trying to do could job for all of us the trying to protect the public but in this was too often their failing dobby be easy chico the samaritan life a mara glass stay with us o o a one clinical trial the people that a must stays pogrimmas about or doctors doctors have agreed to sit on powers to judge other doctors to discipline them or revoke their licenses when they behave away every state has these medical boards the grand medical licenses and there the ones responsible for taking them away we heard about all this from a wale professor at vanderbelt rebec all's words and twenty teen she strartof going to medical board hearings an tennessee where she lives it was refer for a book that chaplains to write about licensing boards and what she saw when she got there horrified her the mater is is comic proper when it comes to the tennessey board of medical examiners rebec is the one die hard fan in the stand at a townsoff ball game she knows all the board members by name she is interviewed most of them attended all their meetings in person or watch the live stream she even went to their affright retreat last year before you went to any medical board meetings how did you imagine they would be i thought they would be pretty boring but eh am i think i also thought it was going to be in some sort of grand state government building i think i had the our state capital in mine or something but it is just an office park we yes the describe what it actual lookalike it is a three or four story square office building ah probably bills in the seventies or eights am this is nashvill there is copious parking inland some like under mithlan to me all ma got look just undermiphlen it looked just under men the first meeting she went to and of g way appeared before the board to request a new medical license the board had taken his old lice in the way six months before when they learned that he would had sac with eleven of his patience he dundrugs wit at least one of them to he would also prescribed them and other people who were not his patience control substances codeine and annex this doctor was there to ask the medical board for a new licence all that stuff the sax the drugs had happened years before he been to rehab a sober now saw the error and his old ways and the board gave him a new license with some conditions attached but he could practice medicine again rebec could not believe it the just has to be some sins that are for be in the eyes of the board the board as or regulatory body her not or not your priest the not deciding weather not you have really your really sorry they are deciding whereto not you are a safe provider officially the board's mission is to protect the health safety and welfare of people in the state of tenners e board members and staff peep that mission all the time a mantra but since rebecca's been following the board shes seen a bunch of cases that of g i an weredoctors have done something really bad seemingly irredeemable and somehow they have managed to keep their medical licenses they are out there working his doctors in tenners right now this became the question of her research what was going wrong in the system why were these doctors allowed to keep work gave one case in particular became the focus of her attention because it seemed a perfect storm of regulatory failure that is what ism to tell you about to day it is about a doctor named michael lapaglia all start history back in twenty thirteen the patio was working as an e a doctor at the time and late one night police got a call about a domestic disturbance at his house when the police arrived they smelled weed and search the house they found a she let me just read from the police officers affidavit quote a search of the residents pursuit to the search warrant revealed forty five sort size main jars which contained marijuana hunger twenty seven glass pipes used to smoke marawana lock nineteen nine millimeter grow light with ballast timer degree scale and lever detailing names slash amounts also dis covered were approximately fifty two diazo am twenty two emphedamene and twenty four ox codon pills in addition thepolice found on a shelf in the eagle's office vile of sentinel moreen and prop before which is used for general anesthesia the eagle's girl friend told police that he had threatened to use that stuff to kill her in the petition she filled for a restraining order the next day she said quit michael told me that if i ever contacted the police for help or reported his drug us michael would use his powers as a physician to have me committed to psychiatric facility michael stated he would make sure my body would not be found michael stated that he would take my life away ism in fear for my life and my son's life lapaglea told police as grow friend was delusional he was arrested and charged with two drug felonies intend to distribute a controlled substance and intend to distribute marijuana he pled no contest and went to impatient r had he was addicted to value at the time he lost is job at the hospital the medical board put him on probation and he surrendered his d e a registration number which is the thing you have to have to prescribe controlled substances that is a big deal it is very hard to get a job once you have lost your d e a number no in wants a touch em not pro no employers can take him very few employers anyway with a record that privet insurance forget it hospital forget it am a few years later he files for bankruptcy ah because there is there is no way to earn money back at the same clip as you are as you physician but he got a job i did not addiction clinic a friend of his own it was called e h c express health care page would see patience a regular doctor work up a treatment plan in everything and then another doctor would write their prescriptions doctor lapaglea helped a friend of his doctor charges brooks get a job at express health care too doctor brooks was also on probation with the medical board he would had sex with a patient he says they were having an affair and at least once given her a controlled substance he says to calm her nerves because they were having an affair but unlike doctor lapaglia he did not lose his d e a number he could still prescribe doctor lapaglea left e high c and in early twenty eighteen he and doctor brooks started up a little side business he and doctor brooks kind of hatch this plan page on brooks realize a c will where's a do organ a sort o clinic call even b health care lapaglia an brooks but capable does not have t a number will use brook's lapagleas can do the work he is on write the prescriptions is his foe number on the prescription pad that they make out but its brooks is d a number and it is brooks is signature sometimes they were presides sometimes capable forged the signature on they seldom for three hundredollars cash to lapagleas home at least once in under dollars parkunat even b health care did not have an actual brick an mortar office capable would see people wherever it was convenient write prescriptions for controlled substances clonipan gallium in suborn when team game out about their operation it look they were selling prescriptions for cash drug dealers with seethes cops lapaglean brooks say that is not the case at all that they were legitimately treating people with a diction problems bike prescribing them controlled substances they something called medication as sis ted treatment big the way methadone is used to treat heroine addictions that what they said they were doing regardless it was still a legal the few months into the venture the feds busted them charge them with drug trafficking for writing prescriptions for controlled substances without the authority to do and fraud for using books his d e a number in the scam brooks play not kitty but doctor capable as signed play deal with federal prosecutors he still waiting to be sentence but he could be facing prison time that is the federal criminal court lapaglea still had to face the tenners medical board and when they found out about even b health or they we marble suspended the doctor's medical licences instill they could hold disciplinary hearings for them the case unfolded over three hearings for march to jury twenty nineteen the first one in march was the disciplinary hearing for capable as partner doctor brooks rebec was there she been going to medical board meetings for year at that point and i see this guy who am is do it something that actually even i think the physicians on the board find really offensive which is giving up control of your your pad and to hand it over the somebody else is really seen as are on nonethical am most doctors do not view their pad as as a moneymaker these medical board disciplinary hearings are technically administrative courts they run kind of the criminal and civil court systems but the question there addressing is more pointed it is whether a doctor should be allowed to continue to practise medical doctor lapaglia agreed to testify against doctor brooks in front of the medical boart de tin our on that odor i a trouser a or that your honor the as member as just ta set a stoney the guy asking the questions is drew coffmat he is the prosecuting attorney he works for the tennessee department of health doctor lapaglia is the one answering his question why you ere partner we doctor frog do you're not was he a war that you were siding his man wite yes what mi you think that he was wore because some times in it run on we him coitions and has to you we hassock take or action and we discuss it when you went the work er we doctor drug did you believe tax what you were doing was again the wall no doctor lepagley was yet i think we ply cot some corners i think mistakes were made an we discuss it in we knew that what we were doing was in the ideal o because we had very a resources he cut started bet we never imagined that we were breaking the on his general attitude was or air in judgment nadbegil has your opine change about whether you were bringing more yes what because tell prosecute have con is me eras i spoke with doctor lapaglia he did not want me to report our conversation and we did not talk for long before he got off the phone but he reiterated to me that he and doctor brooks did not think they were doing anything wrong when they worked in the diction cline the doctors there would hand prescriptions to receptionists and the receptionists would call them into a farmers it happened all the the he told me quit we did not see any difference between him giving me verbal authorization to call them in and verbal authorization to write the prescription they still do not see a difference and if someone had a problem with that the federal government had a problem with that they could have just told us to stop they did not have tor in dits and charge us with two felonies i reached out to doctor lapaglia several times after that initial call but he declined my request to talk further they were three board members hearing doctor brook's case that day and they were not stayed by this defense that they did not know they were doing anything wrong that they were just trying to help their drug sick patience in fact the board members suspect ted that even be welfare was not a legitimate business at all here is doctor charges hand dorm one of the board members questioning doctor lapaglia id de planet er we a ply for o receive a business did de planet ewer a play for or great es sure and articles men corporation with the secretary state ate envy has the planet ere full catheter i tats o a tow an thin were a this is in the business at all that was doctor lapaglia testifying at doctor brook's disciplinary hearing in front of the medical board once brook's case was adjudicated it was lasagne's turn for discipline he and his attorney had worked out to deal with drew coffee the department of hesitant it is called t a consent order it is basically the board's version of a plea deal it ad the next board mean in may coffin presented this deal to the board means the board had to decide wether to accepted the moron after coffin with of hi sun general carol and here is with ta deal was helically lapaglia could go back to practicing medicine in another most but he would be on probation for five years and he would have to be monster by a physician of diction grim and he would be band from prescribing control ssubsancens for two years it similar to what doctor brookscotton march but slightly less because lapaglia headadmitted deals and had testified against prints it is what they call it down not departure in t fromhinal system cooperating witnesses often get liter sentences it is supposed to give people in in entire to tell the truths but the board was not having it with the steel they looked at lasagna and saw guy whose medical license was already on probation when he used another doctor's prescription pad to write controlled substance descriptions here is doctor down had one of the board members r the this same share i ain we is had a i to es prescription our star in hi can for shut bee girly board e tar i i cannot be good contract i a a prom tonsure the board has twelve members appointed by the governor an three of them er not doctors they are called consumer members in this case a real state agent an academic adviser and a political fundraiser they were even more pissed than the doctors on the board this man does not need to be on the streets or in his off we prescriptions in set ton see i for on consol and yo chance with the response there protection senses senses of that my can for had we get to that point well we i enure the over you you de to day is

be back there ever is carry to me as a once i remember and for as i have young donors and ye know this man is not that to be at in the public i do not think the your to ti to out repisentestioner this we dons his too box o way from one of the major his schools in motor he can i agree with her this man dos not new to be on the streets wit the topaz the bill favor of de in the motion for the shorter o no look parley a i i the board rejected the plea deal it was unanimous now doctor lapaglis case will go to trial for the medical board version of a trial a contested case hearing were he has the possibility of getting a much heavier discipline they could suspend his lions for even longer for incense were even revoke it altogether i had tee following this case and y i wanted a full hearing i want the opportunity to see doctor laager testify and t for a talk too an i figured everything was lining out for them to finally throw the book at somebody rebec had been to several of these disciplinary hearings by that she would seen many doctors get away with which he considered to be light punishments but it seem the board was finally gin to put its foot down with lapaglia n thin to to us coming out what goes wrong when the boy gets a chance o fun y put its foot down that is a minute the cicada pula green when our program continues ts is s mare can li from or glass to days program trust me of a doctor w story about people thing to do civic minded things for the r own communities and in the case of medical boards sometimes failing to a popish that job the way the lots of us pul want them to when know we are in the middle of the activists story and we pick up where we left off the medical board in tenders has rejected dafter lasagne's due deal and too much after that at the next meeting the board holds a hearing for his case he said how the is hearing's work there basically many trials each case gets assigned to a panel of three board members la eagle's panel was made up of two doctors and a consumer member the sit at the front of the room facing everyone else and thermal a decide if the prosecutor has prove in his case and if how to discipline doctor lapagliaer they also an administrative lodged who acts as a refer more than anything else to than e ward will be con sister in the case a just i on a hell morse is michael lapaglia they hold doctor capable is hearing in the iris from a n which defies the interior decorator's vision age carpet age walls i front lights an doctor lapaglia is sitting at hi s table with his attorney facing the panel the prosecutor drew coffin he sitting at a table to the ragi rebecca's there too in the front to here was really weird it was heard from the first i he moment when they did opening statements the morning i may woman you for mayst ten myself earlier the prosecutor went first mister coffin and he said we lot bat tat good baton ugly this is a rare was wo basically agree with defense counsel on everything and in an unusual tier e not much does you when the parts about what there bat or whether they god beat for at was just kind of a half hated prosecution i mean not mason ad minster a furious little more casual than criminal charleson it was meant to be overserial now i think the we a of gin a so the data pallia believe that he was providing god treatment hell bat able have me let coffin is there to prosecute lasagna but it seems he is going pretty easy on him that twenty thirteen drug bust the one were the cops found valiant ox codon and fedameans marawana a gan a scale o lager parasitic agents and other sensitives coffin does not say the charge was possession with intend to deliver he just says lapaglear pled to some charges that r wite that is own personal use o control to how an the ma o the waw an the her next mong if i were prosecuting were i would probably us some stronger language capable is coming across as a guy who once struggle is the substance used disorder ut god help sobered outland then in the course of trying to help other people who suffer from dogadictions unwittingly bumbled his way into this next bit of trouble with doctor broke he tell capable is defense attorney also described him in his evening statement he may be don but he is a good don he is areas p he is respond he is done aline to help the come is every one in this trial was on doctor lapagli's side i asked drew coffin why he handled the case the way he did he said basically this case was not contentious by its very nature his job was to prove the doctor lapaglia had written prescriptions for controlled substances using another doctor's prescription pat his star witness doctor pallia who had admitted repeatedly that yes he had used doctor brook's pad to write prescriptions for controlled substances but also there is another reason why the prosecution was maybe a bit anemic in this case the department of health attorneys coffin and his colleagues were feeling frustrated when this whole thing started back in march and doctor boss's hearing doctor brooks lapagley's conspirator coffin had asked the board to revoke doctor boss's license but the board rejected that a said it was too harsh the prosecutors went easier on lapaglia in his plead and then the board rejected that said it went too easy on hi there was no consistency to their lodge coffin's paw said later at a board retreat where they discuss this case that they felt a little bit knock down by the whole thing at capable is hearing coffin just presented the straight facts in the case and told the panel what their actions wore for disciplining him did not suggest a punishment they did not know what the helthaboard wanted they did not try to guess and this brings us to the single basis problem rebec seas in the system the doctors who sit on these medical boards tit is a distinguished position to be on the tenners board o medical examiners they have to be appointed by the governor there is a fulltime staff that supports the board attorneys administrators medical consultancy and they sit in judgment of doctors but as far as judges go there amateurs most of them were doctors they have lots of training a medicine and very little training in administrative law the deciders in doctor lapagley's case the three board members on his panel were sultan call she is a consumer member doctor pills miller and of g want and doctor stepped load doctor blood was the newest member of the board he never done any of this before in fact this was his second day on the job i did at a a i he not i ratan no no be aboard e not bat all e run when they were organs put off into panels for the for the contest case hearings now did you have any sense of what that meant or what it would look a to what is you do id somebody tell you you go into this room with these people what abide ye bat you to wat be t ma no id no of yuan i i i get e very en been an e e or cowry of e an i bed new get e the for an e one man a i o me i had know i within in tend and when do a mean word to a yet at dot we yet but what a we look o be e a sort an to a jury and a pram e jury you o by e an why a jury bad doctor load told me he did have a brief orientation that morning but no special training no real prep for this basically he was just thrown in to it it doctor lasagne's hearing he kind of winged it what with his gut and he i identified with doctor lapaglia doctor blood is an addiction doctor he spent two years as tennessees opioid are and also lapaglia he is in recovery from apilediction an i yo you er we i a does e you e rider at o to a bat rail to ut look up get bet e one tin yo need e to after cant at he related to doctor lapaglia he would also made bad decisions while in this rows of a drugadiction although to be clear lapagley testified he was sober at the time he was writing the fraudulent prescriptions and had been for years i ad tat guided no a i ya i bed be yuan won did rater a you know all ben you people would be yuan you bad e n i not better an an no i e gig o it for load we parties tat all the rate things he said he was drawn to treating people with e diction to beans because that is what he was addicted to he said he took issue with the way addiction connects were treating nations with benzol addictions that they were not giving them enough tells to taper effectively they were giving possibly two these words of tens addaipin an then taken off over and what would happen after that would a not wat ages plain a versus it is never can happen what would at the going you relapse when i even i could see doctor load nodding along win doctor we away was talking about the problem of duel addiction between opiate and beans and the problem of relapse on senses i i could we dote load nodding along ut i heard for me on it give get you face you you do toxin tho the doctors do not know what your do an try to get him off and you get we take get i off at i the yous relax he exactly right at exactly right after the attorneys were don questioning doctor laopaglia the board member's got to turn the firstoal think self of o madly for coming day be in used here is doctor load e turning addition is on the jab from the foil press can an tat at our exwayr class correct but most of his questions he is testing lasagna trying to see if he really understands a diction medicine a can you ton me had you establish a badness is a sucituse disorder be i to discussion i thing abri history am my over medical history with nation and did you ever i in in a probably that the creature

bowmen your when you've treating a wo it as a pain the pendency what what is your woulds you go come ask tensisticle an and how you get there extremely slowly this goes on for several minutes longer doctor load only asks two questions about the even be scheme himself when they finally get to deliberations doctor load speaks first an the just member this committee tispoard an a sold hate my charge

us all one aspect of these medical board hearings that is very different from a criminal trial e he cause of transparency laws and tenessee the panel members have to deliberate in the open in front of doctor lasagna rebec says this is another reason the discipline can be lie it is really awkward fell look t raises some potential issues but gat one point while the panel members are considering requiring doctor lapaglia to get board certified in addiction medicine we pally at intorrotis up sister's them away from it do we want to require him to a man or and if he gain comply i real acutely ask now because i may change my mind or something else may happen and i do not for fill that requirement i never minds you get acclamation the administer judge hastaberate gan and tell them to quit talking to each other steer in the end here is with the panel decides for they are going to restore doctor capable as medical license which had been squarely suspended in canary when the board first found out about the elenbiski as punishment they give him five years probation make him report to the tenners e medical foundation it is a physicians substance o bescroup and they tell him to take a few professional courses they do not prohibit him from prescribing controlled substances he still does not have a d a number technically he cannot anyway but he could pe tuition the d a to get it back they do not restrict bat either it is actually a lighter discipline than what he would have gotten from the pleaagree then the one the board through out for being too easy on him ya it was a slop on the rest doctor we pager was all smiles afterwards i had chatter with him at the brakes and am he was sort of saying i ism just hoping again et my license back cannot and it the federal thing i got a deal with and for some reason they decided to insert this language of the end that says to give him a full a a payback to full license and when they read that out loud doctor legally a winked to me oh which really surprised me it just really surprised me it'd i was to that just happen w has you interpret his wink i think that he was sort of saying see ism getting what i wanted i guess i think i went even better than he expected it thing that might be why he wink to me i went oftorhim afterwards a talk to him and by the time i had shot with him a couple times and the says something ism just glad to have my life ins off of suspension i can make some money it was a real kind of honesty from the patient care just testimony that he had just promoted i reach out to doctor capable about this but he did not get bock to me here you have got a doctor who lost his d a number when he was caught with a legal press creation drugs and marijuana at his house and what looked very much a drug trafficking operation he is medical license was put on probation the then went out and broke the law again but using another doctors d e a number to prescribe controlled substances and now here he is back on probation with the medical board still with the medical license which means he can still work as a doctor in the years that the is been going to medical board meetings reactor has watched a bunch of doctors with a egregious histories keep practicing medicine doctors who have committed health care fraud doctors who prescribed controlled substances for people who are not their patients doctors who have see with patients one doctor prescribed large doses of o birds and other drugs even though the patients had no medical reason for taking them prosecutors asked the board to permanently revoke his license but he was only put on probation as far as i can tell tenners fairly typical as statistical study rank medical boards on a scale of how harsh to light their discipline was tenners was smack in the middle of course an talking about the worst cases the medical board see and the board does revoke some doctor's licences since twenty seventeen they have pecan thirteen licensees away and the even doctors have voluntarily surrendered them hat's a significant punishment as one board member explain to me a medical license is technically a property way and it is a big deal that take some on property from them but something does seem to be happening where medical boards which are set up to protect the public to protect the majority of us who never think to ask whether our doctors are safe and operating in our best interests sometimes the medical boards are letting dangerous doctors continue to practise medicine on the one hand i i feel on some level i understand this problem cause i spent l studying it have seen all the angles have seen how the personalities play out in the incentives in the emotions in everything but there is also a way which i just do not get it i do not understand the they will not just take the guises license what is the part of view that understands it i think that there is a i identification that is not as specific as oh that could be me that is still in play of just being a doctor this is a calling we went to similar e hour similar sun's a trainings we started out walking down the same path think there is some i identification at a kind of very high professional level like at startling the wagons we are doctors and then i think there is also and d the spray special not for doctors but here just con of softies there just e ynofve that everybody can be healed and can be made better and a sick and deserving of compassion i may notes what is let this really ironic an man sad to me is it is in some ways this whole problems created by that better part of human nature o the part that full of mercy rebec a solution to this whole thing well i think we nun to abolish licensing words to be perfectly ones instead of having doctors sit in judgment of other doctors and instead of having them do this as a favored to society every few months rebec says have full time em poles who job it is to regulate the industry who are trained to notice when there being affected by the emotional sway of the defend and but their feelings aside as much as possible a judge wood sector laid agrees with rebec in part he admits he did relied to lapaglia and it influenced how he thought about discipline to tow the fact an the a me down on the the bit i tit n not can ye has do e dot now the mot om an i we to me tat be bate without any body to me i that i and not is see that i about e la just based on the he used another doctors d i licente number to prescribed patience ye just just a do not blat bat a dot gorge you's and the doctor's be alive in a a you know jot dealing i we just the in back no no the get the during no prosecutor i just o that re down on the be a the now the bag can a room o remote at it is interesting and it man it i the well it not can't gain in the precision pal and in not think tenno i ism really trying to work on that at the board member it is very difficult i get there with a not er human being in run to you and to ye no when i want o that do the hammer a ye a it the human been right it much easier on a sheet o paper i because when ism sitting there i we got tit regaining it big i ye dot that look e satiated he look spy he dress professionally he got a wild that he have the motion around me of the ban o to want a give him a can to get that bat ye ut i but it is not fair to say that is the hull reason the case won edge the doctors look too kindly on a fellow doctor sitting before them because when considering what to do with lately is medical license and whether he should be a practicing doctor the board members never got a full erring of his past misdeeds as soon as the hearing was over doctor lapaglia did something that made doctor loads suspicious i did of and and that an no we cannoned out in he approach n i cannot remember yo be tact word tat wit bear li cat i us mi an it began what you one in your own me i pul like to have that i the cannot a than in

clearly demonstrates bag contact it is not be conduct related to the practice of medicine but that is not all he left out in when he ten while working his n we yard doctor regalia did something that a federal loopeal's court see quote shocks the conscience the police pot a young man named heels is booked to the yard this sis specter booked was hid in drugs on his body of his but to be gloat doctor lapaglia asked booked to consent to rectal exam blocker was naked except for a blanket and in handcuffs and leg chuckles he said no lepaglia says booked consent to to the exam but nobody else who was in the room heard this and there is no medical record of it lepaglia tried to examine him laker clenched his muscles lapeled had him sedated bluer was still able to clean his muscles down league had him medically paralyzed in debated him and did the rectal exam he found a rock of crack lepagla testified ta broker's trial that he would done rectal examines and two other people the police had brought in to him the year after that there was a force time vastly gully polls alleged he got the same treat i lepgli asked him to consent to rectal exam he said no lepglia threatened to sedate him and paralyze him he relented lepaglia did the rectal exam and found nothing we police charged cully with resisting rest the hospital charged in for the rectal exam but apparently nothing ever happened to doctor lepaglyam he was not criminally charge for the warranties no consent rectal searches he did not even lose his job with the hospital the search is were reported to the department of health be doctor capable was nottiscipline for them and in a cruel regular try irony because he was not t disciplined there is no public record of why the board did not discipline him doctor load actually found out about the rectal searches from rebec they had coffee a few weeks after doctor lepagli's hearing i may nit bringing up about at a cave that for might e you cabin manage o the position o power that

probation with the board once before for charges related to his personal drug us that he been treated for pilidiction and had stayed sober all these years and that he and doctor books got cat selling press captions using doctor brook's d ya number which use a way tidier story than the one i just told you but coffin did not talk about the rectal searches of doctor lpaglieas hearing because of the rules of evidence he told me it would have been ad missile same for the details about the twenty fourteen drug charges which by the way after lapaglia play no contest he was put into something called judicial diversion it is a kind of probation and eventually the case was dismissed but more importantly coffin said this was not a hearing about everything lapaglia had ever done just this one crime the fraudulent prescriptions doctor load did not learn about the rest of it until it was too late whet no looking any mother me but what you don what bed a get you at what o o ha doctor i on good you e bat given of tat yet but t id about a ho tat have got to the we a body ye e need in a real world ye nook we an e to argue but dud could not in the word you a betcha you can her to e bare armed er doctor load says he asks a lot more questions now during these cases how to keep this from happening how make sure the board gets a full picture of a doctor's career and passed misdeeds but fore they decide how to discipline them rebec points to us simple an practical solution separate the disciplinary hearing into two parts have one hearing where the board hears evidence and decides of a doctors guilty of the charges and another hearing where the doctor is disdain and at that point they can learn other information about a defendant's past both good and thathat is how criminal tutor once the jury his determined a person's guilt the judge is the one who does the lenten saying and gets to hear more about the defend this solution rebec points out as the benefit of being readily available to the bort it is already equal under tennessey law last september the medical board members in staff had an offside retreat rebec was there she recorded it for her notes for her book unlicensed boards and one of the things they discussed was doctor lapaglea's case what had gone wrong doctor load was still upset about it doctor lapaglia is a practicing doctor in tennessea it now he does house calls for fifty dollars cash and load explain what he sees as the real problem with that kind of outcome with this half way discipline they gave lapaglia they have made it he cannot get a job at a hospital are a medical planet but he canned still see nations doctor load said quote he can only work in a cash base practise and the most vulnerable pennesseans are the ones at risk and that is not some because the very population that i work personally with on a daily basis i just put somebody back out there and ism struggling with that the to as is one of the prices tor of programmed rebec

welcome to the supermen lacunas a science science space to life i manner supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthomalgy at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor maya schancarr doctor maya schancarr is a connive scientist who did her undergraduate training at male university her p h d thesis at oxford as a road scholar and a postdoctoral fellowship also in connive science at stamford university doctor schancarr also served as a senior adviser to the white house and she found and served as the chair of the white house behavioral science t doctor schancarr is also the host of her own podcast entitled a slight change of plans and indeed doctor shancarr herself is no stranger to having to make major changes to one's life plans as you will learn to day prior to all those incredible accomplishments that doctor chancery has achieved she was a student at the dullard conservatory of music preparing her life to be come a professional concert violinist but as you will also soon learn she then experienced a career devastating injury forcing herself to have to frame everything about her life plans and her own identity and that is really what we talk about to day we talk about identity doctors doctor schancarr's prior and current identities but of course your identity we pose a number of questions gear toward getting you to ask who am i really do my goals a line with who i am and what i want doctor chancery shares with us the research on identity goals motivation and plans as well as many practical tools to answer those key questions that guide us down either the correct or incorrect trajectories in life she shares with us for instance how to assess on paper goals of the sort that you would see on a c v which school which job which salary which spots et camera et camera and how to relate those to the deeper feelings that relate to one's ability to contain newly pursue a given goal knowing that it is the right goal for us we also talk about the science of feelings what they can and cannot tell us and when they should or shan't serve as a compass for guiding our every day and longer term decisions by the end of to day's episode you will realize that doctor schancarr is essentially handing you a science supported road map for how to determine an access your identity and goals and how one influences the other that is how your identity influences your goals and how your goals influences your identity in becoming the person that you want to be before we begin it'd to emphasize of this podcast is separate from my teaching research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is make new venison maw new venison is the most neutrino dense and delicious red meat available have spoken before on this podcast in solo episodes end with guess about the need to get approximately one gram of high quality protein per pound of body weight each day for optimal nutrition they're many different ways that one can do that but a key thing is to make sure that you are not doing that by investing excessive calories we new venison has the highest density of quality protein per carry and it achieves that in delicious things ground meats tension stakes jerky and bonebroth i particularly the ground venison i make those into venison burgers probably five times a week or more i also the jerky for its convenience specially when ism travelling are a especially busy with work and know that ism getting an extremely nutrient dense high quality source of proline if you would to try we new venison you can go to make new venison dock cam slash superman and get twenty per cent off your first order again that is make new venison dock cam slash superman to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to a by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well end enough everything in life goes much better and when we are not sleeping well or long enough things in life get worse we know that from data we all know that from our own experience one of the essential things to getting a great night sleep is that the temperature of your sleeping environment needs to be such that your door body temperature drops by about one to three degrees in order to fall and stay deeply asleep and then increase by one to three degrees in order to wake up feeling refreshed in the morning with eight sleep smart mattress covers you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment that it is ideally match to your temperature needs i started sleeping on in eight sleep mattress cover a few years ago and it is completely transform the quality of the sleep that i get much that i actually loathe travelling because i do not have my right sleep mattress cover when i travel if you to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dock calm slash supermen and you will save up to a hundred n fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u a canada u c select countries in the e and australia again that is eight sleep dock calm slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor my schancar welcome happier here an faster what is grate e here have a lot of questions about identity about goals and motivation and about change in general but it'd to start off with identity and to divided into two segments the first is how we form an identity and you know we will get into your story n i hope bit or more of detail but when we are younger we ten t ask questions about ourselves but also about the world around us we want a learn what our parents do for a living ah what the workers on the street are doing that for et camera how much of our early identity do you think is formed by observation of what we are doing verses observation and labels of the people that are around us an closest yet it is a great question i think a lot of it is based on what we see around us and what we see a is deemed successful and and society privileges and there is a concept called identity for closure were actually when you are young right it is not just that you are observing what your parents are doing or what you are pure group is doing they impose their own structures on you and what that can do is it can really limit your mind set in terms of what it is that you want to achieve in what it is tat your capable of achieving and often times when people experience identity for closure they have to take a lot of active steps to overcome whatever bialies or limitations they experienced as a young person um given what they were projected to do or believe right ism identity can be about what you do can also be about what you believe in the world right and a lot of those believe systems are also passed on you inherit lift systems from the people that surround you when you are young and if there is one thing that have learned it is that we we tend to put a huge premium on what it is that we do we tended to fine ourselves by what we do and you can see this in the questions we ask young children what do you want o vie when you grow up right we never say who do you want to be when you grow up what find a person do want to be when you grow up we say what do you want to be and the consequence of that kind of mind set is that we end of anchoring our identities very firmly to what it is that we do and i certainly you no take you were alluding to my personal story right i started playing the violin when i was a little kid six years old became absolutely obsessed and for the large part of my childhood i was first and foremost a violinist i mean if had met you if f you hey drew ism a violinist and then the second up would be ism my that is how tethered my identity was to to being a violinist and then fast forward to what ism atenatur on one these huge dreams of of going pro and and becoming you no yet just a hopefully a professional violins for the rest of my life and then i tear attended in my hand my dreams and overnight and suddenly there is this profound loss of identity because what i had not realized is that in losing the violin sure i was losing the ability to play the instrument but i was actually losing a huge cart of who i was and that was destabilizing and disorienting for me because when you define yourself by the what then as soon as the what goes away you are oh ma gosh who the am i right what do i do what what value do i bring to the world and what i experienced at the time is known in a count of science as identity paralysis ah maybe you felt this way during various transitions in your life but basically who you are in what you are about is suddenly called into question and you end to feeling really stuck right you you do not see you do not have the courage to imagine what a future could look and i certainly fell pray to identity paralysis and it took me a long time to connive figure out what my path would look moving forward but i learn to really valuable lesson from that very formative experience i have the change about how it is that i should defend myself and for what it is worth i i do not think our desire is humans to have identities is going anywhere we are not you'll to dispose of identities and we should not because our self identities bring us much meaning and purpose in our lives right you are a podcast ism a podcast you are a scientists ism a scientist these things are actually really helpful and motivating we do not want to do away with identities altogether but what we can be more particular about is what we anchor are identities too and i have learned in my adult life to anchor my identity to why i do the things i do rather than what i do and i found this to be a much more durable reliable relationship to make this concrete messing aby the violin writ a sure i loved playing i loved how music sounded ai love the way the violin felt am but when i stripped away all the superficial features of the violin what i really really loved and was drawn to as a young child am was the emotional connection that i could form through my music that might have been with my orchestra mates my chamber musician friend a playing a solo and and performing in front of an audience and in ideally we all feel something new that we have not felt before ism use kind of and intoxicating feeling when your little to have the ability to inspire new feelings in people right and i was drawn to human connection and when i realized that human connection was at the heart of what it is that drives me as a person right what lights me give every single day is a desire to connect with others to understand other people to understand their psychology to understand how their mind's work then when the violin was taken away from me even intros the narrative i tell myself about my life i could still find that same core underlying feature elsewhere and i had been evil to right i found it a as an academic as a cogent of scientist who studies the science of connection and in emotion a i seen it i see ne connection play out in the in the work that i did in public policy when i was at the white house obviously with my podcast a slight change of plans you are forming these intimate connections of people every day and even though it feels in my life have done such desperate things right there actually is a powerful through line a that connects all of them and that is my desire to connect emotionally and what i would reconnhen to people who are listening especially if in therein the throws of change in their feeling the stabilized by that threat to identity that loss of identity is to try to figure out what there through nets it what are the underlying features of the things that you used to do that you absolutely like and can you find the expression in that elsewhere i love that and i have many questions a the first one relates back to childhood identities and how we often can project on to children what they are likely to become a i see that is mostly benevolent you a you observe a child playing with trucks in the sand box and and we say oh there can become a contractor am we tend to project a rolls that are fairly high out the within occupation hierarchy i an we was for any parents yo you wish for the the best possible life for your kits am but i coffee that the perils of doing that if then it starts to think wile that is what ism bound to become because i it is restrictive i also fascinated by the fact that when we are adolescence and teens there is a tendency to ask questions about identity who am i i do not know many forty year old that is who am i at tuna at one's core one's essence and we might change careers change relationships change geographies all sorts of things but there must be something going on in the brain in those adolescent and teen years that forces this question of self of o know who am i and than agora ane notorious for trying on different uniforms different friend groups different behaviors as a way to sort that out sometimes in ways that support them inn sometimes always that act as pitfalls m some curious about a what is known about how we develop our own identity from the inside out as well as from the outside and shadow it is i that that is really interesting insulted a man very curious about and man we know from narasience research that there are significant changes that the brain undergoes during puberty and the periods of adolescence and and the primary change that we see is a desire for independence and one reason why we see tea natures raffling with this question of who i am is that they are actually breaking from these structures that they grew up around right the imposed structures right the identity foreclosure that they might have experience and our starting to figure out for the first time are wanting to ask the question for the first time who do i want to be what do i want to do outside of the systems that have grown nothing and i think this is one of the primary reasons why we find that during than ah years a this this sort of question is asked more commonly a i think that one challenge that a we can began face cause you youyou said this one word that really call my attention which was what is my essence and one of the things i studied as a calgnuof scientist is the psychology of what is called essentialism our underlying belief that there are essential qualities to people that are immutable n there is lots of studies with young children dulls showing that we really believe that people do have these essences right and um clear what that even means from inn metaphysical sense i do not know what that would even mean a but i think the the challenge in believing that we have essences is that it leads us to believe that there are these truly immutable states about ourselves that are that we are incapable of changing and i think this can give rise to feelings of shame for examples what is shame shame is not the feeling oh i did something that shame is the feeling i am that right it is not that i lost at something i failed at something it is that ism a loser ism a failure and the problem when we try to figure out the essence peace is that it does not give you the kind of valuable way of thinking that actually there might not be something that defining about you that you are incapable of changing as humans maybe all we are cole actions a behaviors and thoughts right and there is nothing more to it than that and i find that way of thinking of it more freeing when it comes to who we are because i think it allows for i think it a lows us to cultivate more over growth minds sat i think it prevents us from engaging in these very harmful self narratives that a lot of people tend to have about themselves i mean probably a lot of people is not in here podcast our self critical have a very self critical person we we listen to this begs a gone to improve en on the stand of your show as i want to be better and i want to improve that that also is often accompanied my a lot of self beating and questioning himself right and am ye i think have just tried to have a slightly more capricious understanding of a who i am and also recognizing that there might not really be these essential features that are the are aneedafle i don't if you resinate with this notion the assent the desire to feel that we have essences ye i i use the word essence without thinking ism too carefully about exactly what i meant but w i what i a what i trying to say when i said essence is as a child a i did certain things and enjoyed some of them did not enjoy others and i really disliked others a a very famous nor scientist who at calpac may maracas mister people literally refer to m as the great marcs mister once said and ice tolly subscribe to the fact that nor circuits in the brain i basically divide our sensory experience along the dimensions of yum much and me there is not a lot of in between yer because the circuits ultimately have to drive either forward movement toward more yet appetitive behaviors as inner speak or aversive a leaning out i do not want that or just kind of a a a neutral response a coma can me ya seems to be the the trinary a response and there is this component of childhood i think where we are forging naturally using our senses do experiencing yum each sand me and hearing young yucks and me from our parents that is good that is bad that is whatevernce neutral but at some point i certainly have had the experience and have observed others i think having the experience of feeling something that is on a different dimension entirely which is the notion of delight which is that it it forbids your body with a sense of much yum that it gives you energy to do much more of it in a way that that is am almost on a different plan and ism not trying to be in o spiritual or metaphysical about it but it feels distinctly different and i do not know what it represents but i think that is that am that piece that perhaps even as a scientist i do not relief mean to assign a nerd circuit to do you think what your describing in part is the feeling of awe when you talk about delight do you think part of it is is a feeling of awe he the first time i went to new york city is a six year old kid i remember thinking in i still feel every time i i cannot believe this place success it is a it is a human tropical reef everywhere you look there's life that was that was awe and delight although i saw somethings this was new york in the seventies and there as landings time square in the sanity her it if anyone seem that show the deuces i fence it look that it was especially as a young kid was can aversive ya was not always add at but the delight of for me was in learning in certain animals in certain things for you as the violin and and i want to make sure that i and awe by the way i mean it can be averse the right add men it necessarily i think in the western world we think of unifying experiences as having a positive emotional vigilance but they can also have a negative emotional valence on the two criteria for a satisfying in a inspiring experience an in ha lot of this work comes from door partner arnoarically ya is an one there should be some element of perceived vastness ah this is all rough this is all reference dependence as all take on your own frame of mind i on that there is this pensive mystery and wonder at just how vast either the physical apparatuses wright time squares massive you no set of buildings and it kind of overwhelms your senses because of all the life and sounds that are hitting a your visual system in your auditory system u there is also conceptual vastness we can feel a when we feel the delight of a new scientific discovery right or in my case for the first time reading a book about how the mine works i just remember marveling at this organ and just being completely in ale of how it works and then the second criteria for an a inspiring experience wat i which i think might have been met as well when you were in when when you were i new york is what is called a need for accommodation it is just a fancy way of saying that we have a certain mental model of the world an typically in the presence of all we need to a simulate this new information with our existing model cause it challenges it in some way and it makes us it actually leads us to have more open minds because we have to we realize went a second m have this existing vision what the world is and now in experiencing this new thing and i need a kind of make it work and integrate it with my existing understanding the world and that is the mine blowing part of it right u but i absolutely i mean i remember my childhood experience kind of mirroring your experience in new york was i was i was twelve years old and move eleven years old i was at a summer music camp it was late at night i had my dismal with is how he listened to things back in the day o i had a side an there it was the baton violent concerto by pansophy mute and i was i was i was young drew i still do not know how to use words to describe how it is that i felt something that was pow powerful and transcendent but i remember listening to the first movement of this violent cancherito and it consumed me i mean i felt chills up and down my spine my heart would race along with the melody it felt other worldly right and i think that was kind out you're getting up before we its its this altered state of mind and i what i the language i use since to code that experiences that it was an wins firing experience letting both things happened right i i wasulse i was in i was impressed by the vastness of the experience that also s sent me through time in this interesting way back to like the lifetime of say token writes to the vastness can exists along a temporal horizon and then the need for accommodation which was you now i didn't studied cognac science at this points i m ever thinking i cannot believe a collection of musical notes arranged just can make me feel this way and that if you were to twin it just lightly just take the e flat move it down then thistreavd little it emotional residence completely gone from the passage and there is just something simple and magical about that realization and mi resinate with with this kind of delight an awe experience that you described ye ism glad you you describe it that way you know o thesis not a discussion about my experience but for me i realize now that new york was awe inspiring ism prior to that the only thing similar was discovering animal specialization something ism still fastening by the sensory systems of animals and how they experienced the world and how human's experienced the world and then ultimately it was well the i went it scape working in that whole landscape and then eventually into e our science y the difference between the new york experience of awe and i do think that is what it was and biology animals and eventually burro science is that your experience with music and realizing that the movement of a note could change something fundamentally when it came to learning about biology and our science i felt not just awe but a sense of delight in that i felt there was a place for me there and what i am out of what you just at at i really really resinated in terms of this moving of a note because it took something from a passive experience i believe of that is this incredible thing over there new york city a but i did not see myself having any kind of verb state within it that would change it or alter it how it is or for me whereas with music for your i think narrow sins when i realize that you could do experiments you could actually do some sort of manipulation and through that hopefully unveil something fundamental about how the brain works i thought there is a place for me here and i think there is something about the a the experience of something just just from a raw sensory perspective music or animals or burro sins in the examples were using here then realizing that there is a verb state of self that i could enact something within it that could give me more of that whereas i think when as young kid new york city i i just dint feel anyway that i could plug into it except in a passive way as it is the difference between a kid who this would not have been made who sees a game of soccer football or baseball or watches the glyptic in got that is amazing and the kid that says i most ago do that in fact i could do that and i could may the do that even better or even half as well and the delights i think is in the possibility of of engagement of i and and fascinated friend of mine who is a aromatherapist he is not he is not a narrow skin to see a i says h your nouns are just very slow verbs but verbs are far more exciting because they create this anticipatory activity anyway i to i loved before you move on from that i love the you said to it ais your helping me realize something really important about it how i saw my role as the violentesk and in idiot you now i never get a modify the notes on the page because i as can manatee faithful to whit fatovan wrote this is what made you a great magician in me a it by the way i was a failed violin then's hold me out of it because the neighbors dogs howl i was in ski i was was terrible at it that they early made me stop long us just just to protect the namer that is a adorable and we will talk about the since an quintic may be later when i father great voice for you i i but what ism realizing is that there was that element of defining self through the pursuit of the instrument and i saw a place for myself exactly you did where i thought i decide how this phrase unfolds i decide how much ferbrado i use i decide exactly what the angling of my you is and the cadence in the paying and the emotion that i bring to the experience and when you see it place for yourself and that takes an all inspiring experience and then grant and actually there is a translation process where you become something bigger than what you thought you could be ashes interesting you mention this enter because i i been chatting recently with the guy named regional drain bets and he spent nine years in prison ah and he is now a internationally renowned scholar ah he committed a carjacking when he was fifteen years old and than went to in adult prison for nine years and as a fifteen rest as he just turned sixteen by the time he got his sentence ye i was totally wild and he he actually talks about the fact that there was his underground library in the prison system and he did not know what he could be in the prison what identity he could take on when every one seemed to be defined by what crime they had committed right felt his imagination was limited to to it in talk about identity paralysis right and mean you are denied all your basic freedoms in this environment writes you really do not even have the ability to imagine what more he could be one day he gets a book i called the black poets and in in the book he read a poem by strike night who'd also spent time in prison ad written this inure table stirring poem about the criminal justice system and i he goes by dawn but whet dawn shared with me is he said i was in i was awe inspired by what i was reading but the most important thing that happened in reading that book and understanding the author's history is that it gave me something to be i saw a place for myself in this world and he be he wrote i mean he was prolific he broke a thousand poems in the year after he stumbled upon this book and he ended up winning the mic rather genius a word he went to ye loschala mushes just crushed it ever since i i think he somewhat upon a really important point which is ah there is an fascinating science of awe and all the benefits it can conferred to our well being but it can also serve as an entry point to helping to define our identities in new places and i just love that i think that it is a wonderful way to think about it now would not we see ourselves i entering the sheer of experience that i this coins evoking ah i i think it something about it converts to this delight tell though have to acknowledge that language is insufficient to describe a lot of what were referring to writ was it the i the even the most reductions language of biology i cannot grab the ism higher order emotions an complexity not yet anyway we just do not have at i language for it ism it'd to talk more about the violin i not just cause i failed miserably at the violin but i should have figured out for the early on i was not going to be a musician i still have absolutely nobility to read music i can memorize lyrics her easily but and i love music a moon of classical music i as well as other forms of music but zero musical told you on the other hand i got quite good at violin i it was interesting for me to learn that the violin was a bit of a rebellious choice for you given your your family history and you an i do not share this time fairly unusual a fact that both of our fathers a theoretical physics did you feel pressure to be a scientist or something else in being a musician am was that initially looked at as you know rout to poverty or error a bad choice or were your parents a bit more cautious oh oh a that that is crap may me make that a supplement to your other studies and pursuits yes o ism the youngest of four kids and canister typically my three older siblings for total mathwisis they we taking the essay too win they were her when they were very young they were talented n but i think one antagonist to some of those cultural forces as that my mam when she had grown up in india have felt very stifled by her environment as a young woman who was very capable and very smart and she mad cured in physics om she was mostly kept to the spaces of domestic tore occasional singing lessons om but mostly her job was dear homework and then help with cooking it in cleaning and what not and when she moved to this country with my dad in the nineteen seventies am she was actually very excited she was twenty one years old by the ways o once very short she would met my dad twenty days friar did they getting married as an arrange meeting and on my dad is a doing a his stock at harbored in physics at the society of fellows and my mom disjoins him after a winter break ah in the door of an veterans came an how was your break and this y i went snowboarding and i went whatever tttaho and my was li i got married and o this new couple arrives and my my was lonely in this country an mean this was before you could text or parents over seas or us what is at group so she could only handwritten letters to her family back home and herd her goal was what ism going to trade a little army around me in the form of children she had four kids and she was absolutely intend on a posing us to as many extra circular activities as she could i too older brothers and have an older sister especially her girls she said you can do whatever you want am you lit lay the land when you are young but when you find something that your passionate about i really want to give you the opportunity to explore it i think i really benefited from the fact that she had been denied that kind of exposure and the ability to pursue who her dreams artistic or otherwise and she was really hell tan on making sure ah that we kids were all to i think they were i mean y older three siblings played musical instruments clarinet trumpet flute i think they were surprised by my affinity for it because when i was six my mam brought down my grandmother's violin from the attics and my grandmother had played india classical music that is work she were you sitting cross it on the floor in your violins facing the ground it is a very different style of music am that as a parting gift my grandmother given it to my mam and said he bring this with you to the us she open the instrument that day and i just instantly fell in love with it and am i asked very quickly for a quarters size violin of my own and while my parents had to much me to do all sorts of things they really never had to push me to practice which felt extraordinary the time o at clearly the violin is something that my has intrinsic motivation for because how is it that were not asking her you after practice all the time a similar to you actually drew i never to this day have a really hard time reading music i never i was a terrible sight reader i i could not if you put a piece of music in front of me i would not be able to tell you probably what it would sound to day i learned entirely by ear i started with the suzuki method which as as entirely by ear and than am i had in extremely very kind also but very inexperienced teacher i was his first student ah my mama went back stage at a symphony concert in you haven which is where i grew up and just asked the concert master hay will you teach my daughter and he is sure never taught any one before r if i it'll give the to go and we just made things up along the way i mean he would play stuff and i would mini get and i would let my emotions and my whatever innate musicality guide me and i eventually i may think what that did actually for why interesting from a skill building perspective my technique absolutely suffered in the long term from not having a more structure at approach but i was able to fall in love with this endeavor much more quickly than other kids who had drill sergeants that were forcing that to practise their scales every day and practise a us and not stuff is boring right when your little kids on a bang your head against the wall when you are put it against that when there is much many barriers to act the enjoying the fun parts to direct you playing the pieces the one kind of fun a side about my musical jerry as i got to jump straight to the fun stuff and i think that help me cultivate a much more natural love f the instrument as many of have been taking g one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsor in the podcast g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundation of nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of fitments and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but often times i simply cannot get enough servings but with a g one ism sure to get enough fitments and minerals and the robotics that i need and it also contains a daptigence to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take a g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste right for all these reasons whenever ism asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a one if you would to try a one go to drink g one dockcalm slash supermen to claim a special offer from now until august twelve twenty twenty three a g one is giving away ten free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k to again if you go to drink a g one doccalm slash supermen you can claim the special offer of ten free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k to the intrinsic motivation part is key have talked a few times before on the podcast about this i think now famous study that was done at on being nursery scull at stamford where they observed what kits did during free time and then they rewarded them or did not reward them and then they later remove the rewards and the essential take away is that a receiving rewards for something that a child was initially intrinsically motive aid to do under mine some of that intrinsic motivation i have to wonder whether not the fact that your parents neither encourage nor discourage your violin playing might have allowed you to fully express in and lean into your intrinsic motivation i suppose to a for instance in my case there is a we are distantly related not closely but there is a great violinist by the name of bronaslaw superman who has a street named after him in israel if there is a famous or oman inside playing violin together and i was told about that early on and when i failed to play well after a couple of practices i was convinced that there was noway was can a live up to it and i quit t t hi a hi its hi lanes that real moves that i and belike on ally at turns out i abut exactly and i think that there is actually more opportunity in in kids leaning in to it and adults probably leaning into the sensory experience of what they are doing and not putting that up against some bench mark and i worry about that to day much with social media and with video games were in avidin game ere on social media you can see something being done at the very highest level often by a some one quite young it were early in their career to the point were can be love overwhelming and i think in then we start measuring ourselves against metrics that are not about hat the experience that said your parents whatever they did worked out well enough that you became very profession right you succeeded in getting into dullard which is at least for my understanding is the most competitive u music preparatory is that how you refer to it that one can possibly go to and at that point had your identity merged with the behavior and were you still enjoying yourself up into the point we had this injury they will also talk about ye i was still enjoying myself around the time when when i condition for dullard in particular because of exactly what you said which was everything was kind of beating my expectations and my parents expectations off until this point right which is that we did not really have any and it all just felt i sing on the cake well our kids found something that they really love u this is great wright it hi get sometimes take you years decades to figure out what it is that you love what your passion about and i think we go through this rental process often in our lives right have had to have moments in life on what do i again what do i love again it sets to also t one time experience i but there was there was kind of there is a thrilling aspect to my musical life when i was young which is again everything kind of felt lis bones ones one story love sharing is about how i even got into dullard in the first place my parents my was a theoretical physics physics as he mention my mam help's immigrants get green cars to studying this country neither of them had exposure to the classical music sphere wright the the opposite of tiger parents even if they wanted to be tiger parents they would not know how to deli parents in this domain because they lacked the connections ah and the wherewith all to figure out what it would mean to to to go pro and and to access the best teachers are whatever my mam who's a very fearless person by nature she knew that at some point my passion for the violin with surpassing her ability to connect me with the right resources and one week an we were in new york inspiring new york and i had my violin with me cause i had another addition and we we just walking by juliarc the building and my mam was just eager for me to see it from the outside because it is just really cool as a kid rights all your musical idols went to this place i just wanted to see and imagine what it would have been for pearl in to go in and out a marry to go in and out as glioma wright is exciting and as for passing the entrance my mam looks at me and says hey why do not we just go in as what are you talking about i she is chi just go in much what is the worst thing that can happen and ism am security guards and a lot of other terrible things madam right that i had a useful enthusiasm that propelled me into the building that day she strikes up a conversation with a fellow student an german finds out that she is studying with a top teacher at dullard i as a we can get an introduction within an hour i conditioning for this teacher on the spot rite no idea that this was god hate i ya he tells me a he has what overdue as a you did enthusiasm about my playing does not this ism great but see something you told me later my personality my enthusiasm got the personality card coming out of that music addition great and what he did as he said look ism with you i do not think that you are ready you would not get into dullard if you ought edition to day however i take residence at a summer music program in colorado if you come there for five weeks we can do in intense boot camp where i try to skill you of and get you to learn your first scale in your first a had which you will meed to pass the dullard addition and also make helpfully get you to read music a little bit better than you can write now and i went to that summer camp and i worked my but off i mean you are also in this incredibly intensive environment were every one your age is there an they are all practising their age equivalents it a inch i felt very inspired by that and i ended of getting into dullard in the fall and it was such a wonderful reminder that when opportunities are not served on a silver platter for you you just had to have this kind of imagine give courage and what my mam had that day it to figure out a path from to y a dada point the she really just created a plate for me and said o we you are prepared for this thing for gingko get you in front of this teacher and that is a lesson i use time and time again when i felt there was something cool i could be doing the opportunity did not exist am sofar example when i was in the white house the the job that i wanted which was ah to be a practitioner of the several science did not exist and i sent colly tells and i pitch them on the idea of creating a new physician for a behevreal science adviser and then i said hey by the way if you create this physician could you also consider hiring me to play that job one know i had no public policy experience and have been an academic ah for the tired of my dust life and you now they said yes and it is it is just it it was such an energizing lesson to learn as a young kid which is you can do the cold call oftentimes there is few consequences you will just get rejected an that is truly the worst thing that can happen but it is one thing to be told that as another thing to have lived the experience out in to see how amazing ah the aftermath can be and that is the that is what i got to experiences young kid amazing and am let us all express some thanks to your mom for barking n e door ah and to you because you also had the agency to to do the addition on the spot i think a lot of kids an adults would have thought you ism not ready not going to do this but it it takes it am certain gumption to just do it right an and also to integrate the feed back and then ism cures about this camp ya i went to a feu camps of different types ism crashed a yew camps such a different story turns to if you show up you n get by for a few days before they realize i in ani ani that this a whole other says story the i wat om but ism curious your your among very driven i maybe even obsessive kids ye ism were they nice to one another am do you recall the kid that was the best can me rally that there you go his incredible oh my g remember these n ton prodigy i i bristle when people say oh mut my was a young violin prodigy and no i was not and there is no false humility and my saying that i just actually saw what prodigies were and i was not one of them i mean truly just talk about a inspiring and how is it that music comes effortlessly to rather i feel she i feel she was born with a violin in her hands and that is how it felt whenever i watched her play and it is a double ledge sort on the one hand you drive your deriving inspiration from the incredible talent you see around you on the other hand you feel demoralized often because you're running up against whatever out limitations exists when it comes here natural talent and your work ethic at the end of the day i was never the hardest working violinist my mam insisted that we were well round a kids i played soccer all through elementary school i audition for the school play a really rosy i did art classes it was just really important o know both my parents i think that we had just relatively normal lives and i was studding alongside kids who had literally left half their families behind in their home country had moved with one parent to a studio apartment in manhattan or in colorado for this camp and were devoting their entire lives to this pursuit and i felt am i was i was just super envious kid i was always looking around being i suck in their great right we talked about having a self critical personality i i a lot going a lot of kids feel that way y were i thing at that age and the sometimes extends into adulthood we have this tendency to turn the fun bent marks of where we are ye and and sometimes that is not you no turns into a hierarchical things of mans very la stealage but turn a figure out where you are the landscape with things is sundgence a fundamental the tea name experience him on universe shrinks too right you are no longer getting access to what the average kid violin sounds ism we're in the fleet of the fleet and it is intimidating and i often felt i felt what happened is especially when i became the tea nature such two things happened when i became a tea nature the first is that my violin life just started to speed for it a it is to german inviting me to be his private my find student consider the best violinists in the world it was us n incredible experience i felt overwhelmed even by the opportunity it'd also stumbled upon empty we and was to even wanted to classical music brine spheres is doing rich coolers thanks t t i li was my version of tea name rebellion was coming home from school and what i shouldhave been practising watching emteety a but the other thing that happened is y went through the natural than age process which as i became very self conscious am i became more insecure i was trying to figure out who i was who i am and i think that was the period of my life my my high school years when i was the least happy as a holiness i described to you earlier that incredibly awe inspiring experience of listening to i the atom an violent concerto and it feeling other worldly and feeling i could see a world beyond my own personal wants and needs and desires read it really made me feel small against the backdrop of this magnificent world and i liked that feeling of smallness and when i was in my than age years were all in this highly narcissistic state of mind were consumed with ourselves and how we feel and i just i just felt i gave some of my worst performances when i was a tea nature and i often found to your point about am youknow these pressure cooker environments my best performances were actually just to the public my worst performances were when i was in my little studio having to play for my piers that just sound all the joy out for me because i was yes just really tough on myself and i i lost that was a period of time where i lost touch with what it is that i loved about music and on of course there is an been flow i had magical experiences plying the violent when i was high schooled but i just thinking you were to do the average of joy free twelve and then post twelve the average joy was much higher i a forty came into water the others there is many things to extraplay from that i i really feel that when we get into a mode of trying to hitmilestones that are extrinsic that it really can under mine art are love of ya of what we are doing but that if we keep going and we can frame what those external rewards are an in part by just realizing that they are transient compared to the the delight that we can experience what i mean is that i do not think of delight as something that the wells up an often and and then dissipates i think of it is something that changes our nervous system in a way that gives us access to new abilities i really do i made being a facts o number it stamford it yen you look o were left you look here violence i literally in the building i man have got noble prize went or belong me the people by a mcarthuroword winner's all place everyone you turn and these people do other things to you no a a also d one athletes andtheyve got five kids and all their kids seem to be doing great an who are these people and it becomes very important in that environment to to just shrink your spores what is one foot in front of the anus keep going an not pay attention but it is hard to do not by way of comparison cause actually get excited about being immersed in a group of feverous doing well i do think being among all these other incredibly talented and driven although you you carefully said and importantly said rather that you did not see yourself as talented it is very clearly of a ton of grit and and hard work clearly went into it i think that were talent can be bit misleading we want to o underscore the fact we've worked incredibly hard but i think that it is a tough thing i it is hard for us to develop much an isolation and it is also hard for us to a mistake connected to the source ye i learnt were exact and that is a word that i stole from a a former guest on this podcast an and a good friend of mine his the great rick rebel one of the most successful music ye i sir rockrose o tatitebale he is at out the source there's many different trails we could go down here just one thing briefly is i i u again completely miserable a at music but i once saw you suck roman in the in the report with his family i was with my father who is a huge classical mutant and we watched him and he said watch and who turns out he was getting on to airplane he sat in first class next to his i presume stratebery smiling his violin got a first class he got a first class he in his family sat across from i in my dad said his violin is important that i gets its own first class he i could not believe it vas n in any event i think just one thing to your tour point one reflection have had it and this kind it goes back to this question of identity right which is when you are in these very competitive environments and gat ism sure a lot of people listening are in very competitive environments you feel that much can be taken away from you a just in terms of mental we'll being because you are always looking at the world through a comparative lens wrist your yer bench marking yourself as you say this bench margin where do i fall on the continual of mediocre de grate i do not know and yesterday i i did it had a terrible performance that us can sent me back et center et camera i have found that when have anchored when i anchor myself to it you know what rick rebel referred to is the source and identify the characteristics o music or other pursuits that really energizes me it feels i actually isolated from a lot of the extra anal noise and i bring a lot more clarity and focus to the work that i do everyday there is two things that i think to find me as a person a at least right now wright i allow for that variability a one is that ism a deeply curious person and the second is that i really relish getting better at things i love seeing progress internally and in my violin life a no one could take those two things away from me in my current life am as a count of scientists as a podcast you just cannot take those from me no one can take those that joy from me and it feels protective in a really important way which is for example i mean i i worse i mean just you i mean i see the labor of love that you put into the huvouran lappocast it is extraordinary i pop i put much time an energy and thoughtfulness and love into making a slight change of plans but at the end of a day when you put the episode out into the world you just do not get to control what the reaction is right your favorite episode might not be every one ease's favorite episode and that is just something you have to deal with right but what i found is that if i really relish the process of making the episode writ fed that curiosity and i got better as an interviewer i got better as a thinker i got more clarity on a topic that i was curious about i mean just it gives me a foundation that feels really sturdy you knowhow i mean just the a well those things are intrinsic to you and the they are a i gust now were excusing o nomenclature but they are not well we call domain specific the curiosity that the desire for progress through effort and through a focus a those are music a they are not music irrelevant but their music independent am and in that actually brings me to a very important component of your work and and your life work which is a this notion of recreating and reminding identity in new endeavors i if i understand urn erectly and hopefully you will embellish on this am you had the unfortunate perhaps unfortunate i a experience of playing the violin and then injuring your finger very badly to the point where it was at least for your music career career ending absently and that happened when you were hold i was fifteen given how much of your identity and an energy was a put in to violin that that must have been devastating and yet you have obviously a i unless they recreated yourself because i the idea that this essence within you a has many opportunities informs and i it as an example for everybody having some essence of many things that could give them delight am and that it is something about the feelings associated with a given choice of occupation or hobby your behavior or perhaps relationship might relationships and sometimes by decision death or otherwise yank and people are devastated their identities are completely at least in their minds obliterated and then people have this amazing ability a recreate themselves and new circumstances f you could take us back to the time when your fifteen you have this injury what was your initial mind set in the days and weeks after that e and then if you would could you link that up to some of the what i see as incredibly important work that you have done helping people understand not just who they are but had identify the components who they are that are that are truly indomitable that they that just cannot go away ye your drive for curiosity and hard for a human connection yet am yet in in the days in weeks and months and year after i i felt terrible it was awful because am i do not i think in my case all say yo just when muricate is really busily and energetic t just kind of move forward and you do not always think about how identity finding the thing you are doing is you just do it and it is it was really interesting i think in losing the violin that is actually when it became salient to me how much the instrument had meant to me and and had to find who i was and i i felt a dampening of some of my more organic traits i was less curious for a long time could at in interrupt you on artist i apologized but at the same time and ism not upoogick as there something that you said in a prior discussion that just keeps ringing in my mind which is at your body and your nervous system actually grew up around the violin eat take that to me with just i i will never forget that statement i won't also thank you for it because that to me is perhaps the most profound way to describe a an experience of identity is that your your nervous system in your body is not going up with something or along side it but that much a a relationship o of a human kind human human kind that your body is actually developing around this object it absolutely developed around the ergonomics of playing the violin to this day my right shoulder is slightly elevated to my late relative to my left because all the hours i spent doing this it makes strength training really annoying be i always have the slight on balance and i have a light scoliosis and my fine as well also from this poster and i yet feels intimate in a way it is well that the shape of my body right my architecture was defined by this instrument and it it is left in unsent it is a it is left tits indelible it has i its love is imprint on me that will never go away and ism i think that a lot of us feel this this disorientation rights it is might not e that you lost the ability to do something you love it could be that you lost some one that you love right it could be that you you lost your mojo never there is many types of loss and many kinds of grief we all experience as human beings and i think in all those cases again it really feels the rug has been pulled out from under you because this thing that gave you much meeting and much purpose and much energy in life no longer exists and i think for for a while yet i felt kind of lost at see and i assumed it'll never find anything that ism as passionate about and i the what my dad did for me at that time young theoretical physicists he is an academic and he said i think you should just read a lot s read a bunch of stuff and i was o we i mean ism sos to be in china this summer touring with my class mates i am at home in connetigate my parents a perusing their bookshelves slightly lest cool summer situation that you knot lot of time on my hands as i was not i was not in shanghai us i started pruning the bookshelf and then i came across this pop science book called the language instinct by stepped pinker and a that was a turning point for me i mean i was i was headed to college may be later that yer ah i opened up this book and it detailed are marvelous ability to comprehend and produced language and up until this point in my life id completely taken language abilities for granted just something that i did an it just kind of learned it along the way and when pinker pulled the curtain back an revealed how sophisticated and complex the cognatand machinery is that is operating the behind the scenes that gives rise to language my mind was truly blown i was wow i i never thought of at it something be with three year o as not we sit down wat them were this is a german this is a passport whatever they do not they just learn because they have these kind of lights which is in their brain that are actuated on and off depending to what languages are learning and it was fascinating to learn about language development about new linguistics om about syntax and synaptic and and i i just remember thinking languages fascinating cognition is fascinating and ism also now wondering about all these other systems that are in place right this is what is involved in language what's involved in om you are the complex nathoquations are dads do right what is involved in i what what is the mental processing behind and you discovery or an insider and a moment or falling in love or falling out of love and e it just it just lit up my imagination an very similar to you and your i love that we have this connection you say when you learned about nauru biology in narrow science you you saw that there was a place for yourself in there and i remember reading this book and because it was a pop science book and i love pop science books a sand is now even if they do not fully do justice to the science they can take some one who is never had any exposure to the subject matter and it is it is thrilling to learn about the thing right i would never have gotten the same experience that i opened up an introduction to cognac of science text book it would not have had the same infect on the shout out possie s everywhere thank you for saying and an on here it'll just thank you because i think that many of my colleagues in academic science as stamford and elsewhere feel that way but i think many do not they think of it is quote dumping down of things but it'll tell you rarely if ever dos somebody just wandering to a universe class rooming here a lecture on maiden i maybe f your mam was a helms you i word your males everywhere a right and what but i think it is i actually it'll it'll go step further and ill i a do this that you do not have to and tat these are not your words the are m and i think that there is actually it a pretty intense arrogance to the idea within the a established scientific community that pop science books while they might not be exhaustive provided their accurate and there making attempt to educate and draw people in from all sectors ye a amen to that i just cannot here a counter argument in my head or elsewhere where that is not one of the best things that a people can do a regardless of a people's motivations for picking hem up in the first place i in they brought a lot of people into the the curiosity and delight that is science or music or you know i think that we the morse a positive benevolent safe sensory experiences that we can expose young people to the greater probably that were going to flesh out those professions with the greatest number of diverse minds or gan have the best ideas i means really i i think that there is a ton of foresight in what what you are describing that the picking up a book is now what your also now i mighty in it coming in cognac science and e did you postal at stand for am your scientist a presume because you went into the bookshelf and picked up that book hundred percent an i i think it was it was also role move for me because my dad dislike being in a very very technical feel spent a large part of his career actually working on the translation of complex subjects an trying to convey them to general audiences an i loved witnessinness cause if i you can figure out a way to communicate about theoretical physiphysics to a general audience i mean wile that is a masterful mercy my firemen richer for yaverigear find men exactly no one that really knows what limen did for his noble prize work except physics that most people yes what what was finders no well when the i do not at o o o o laws does any bout birds and tastinome and now it is less interesting than quant mechanics wealth and i and at one of the reasons that i love you remenlad that i i just love the work you do is that you are taking a concepts that might have been inaccessible to the average person and your making science accessible and i feel much gratitude to every scientist out there every researcher out there who thinks that it is worth their time to be a practitioner of of their work am because ultimately and you think about how many lives you're changing through the show by trying to break down some of these more complicated things into am into concepts to people can understand a relate to and actually act on and a it all surmised me know an part of my job when i was in when i was in the aroma administration was translating insights from behavioral science from cogmentof science into interventions that my government agents e colleagues had implement in the department of veteran's affairs in the in a department of defense department of education and that same translation process is part of that effort to and i i think it is really really hard to do well i respect it much i respect pop science writers who do a good jobs much am and ya i think it is a wonderful service they do not have to spend their time writing these books they could just publish more research paper is that it which is the currency that academic institutions care about and i see it is just a public good what they are doing n i do too and get thank at you because you are doing it swell and we are all better off foritthank you i to take a quickbreak and acknowledge our sponsor

is inside tracker dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off i wanted am go back to this injury to summer at home to discovery of something new t was it at that point that you realized ah the feeling of excitement that ism getting from learning about nerlinguistix and related topics is somehow similar to the excitement that i was feeling about the violin or maybe even superseded that excitement a mean at what point did were you able to make the pivot with confidence that yon this this is the neutrajectory can and an important component of that that i to understand is you also had to cut ties with the past something that is very hard to do i man i go up with a number of kits who became very successful teen athletes really and some of them once they sense to keep up or at an injury or something their identity stayed attached to the past in a way that did not allow them to move forward fortunately many of them ism did find new identities in business or in other endeavors i some became quite successful but have i is seem very often that when people achieve early success and then they hit a cliff that it is very hard for them to part with that former identity thirds one of the perils of early success ye an i would not say that it supercediv the excitement that i had at the violin i would say the quality the excitement felt very different and that is actually important to convey cause i think when some one loses the ability to have a passion their seeking exactly the same sensory experience exactly the same high that they experienced the first time around and i think that is a really high bar and sometimes it is he more of an apples and orange's typed situation with the violin there was a really deep sensory aspect to the experience i mean i i felt things right you are playing and then your feeling things emotionally and it it all felt superviceral and that was where the passion emerge from it was just just very visceral feeling of this is beautiful and awesome and i love it with the count of science stuff mi my intellectual brain was delighted and just a different expression of passion right i i think the big pressure task was not if i held myself to the barb do i love this as much as the violin there is no way that i would have been confident enough to pursue anything at that point instead i i really think the question i ask myself at that time which was a service to me and in my more compromised psychology was am i curious enough about this thing to ask more questions about it do i want to learn more and i found naturally three days later i went to the a library and i got another book on the credit a science of language and then i got a book on the science of decision making i was there was curiosity and honestly that was all i needed that was the little seed long that i needed to see if it could go somewhere more am i took at as a very strong signal i care to learn more about this and i do not care to learn about everything right and am i remember perusing the coarse book a of my of my undergrad institution and they had a count of science major which was awesome because not all schools had one at the time is a very new major as interdisciplinary you approach questions of the mind from multiple perspective on from the perspective of narrow science linguistics philosophy psychology am computer science am an anthropology write senor just a butcher to friend disciplines and but that was when i thaw o i can at least see if i can get into this major never as he selected man a selective as freaked out of course and had superimpostors interim is have not going to get in to the program of it thankfully i got in and i think that is yah that is where i was able to connect this little seedling of curiosity to am to the actual pursuit of the thing right and and that is a really important translation because there can often be a mismatch you are really passionate about something but you she hate the process right like you hate the actual work that is involved and getting better at it an i was lucky in my undergrad because i thought my way my mom style barging into classes that really would only accepting seniors our urgeniors that i was give refresh lowly freshmen accept me a and i was able to run experiments on adulsan i was actually able to see what it would de to be a researcher to ask novel questions and to get the delight that that you feel right when you are in a lad and your actually testing out new hypotheses and it was really important that i saw that i not only was excited but that i could actually enjoy parts of the process of getting better i love your description of curiosity because it makes me think that in some way has something o do with a deep motivation and desire to figure out what is an extra what is around the corner without an emotional attachment to the outcome the curiosity is really just trine to figure out what is there i suppose to hoping that something specific is there and sometimes even the surprises or more exciting than our predictions am ti think the duo was an sally from worthy parked i think this is debated by thing it was em oh i the cure for boredom is curios city there is no cure for curiosity o i within o you had not heard that i believe it was doing harder i sometimes misattribute to a agathetristy but thing is worthy parked and what i love about is that there is something about curiosity that when it is genuine it is self amplifying it is an upward spiral because it there is no endpoint diatom that is one of that that that the things that you learn early in sciences mu learn you just hypotheses you get answers and you get more questions an for hypotheses and you do that till you die bans i c and that can be a little but dark but when you think about it as a journey that at it is just much fun along the way if your just really interest in knowing what the answers are without getting to attach to the answers it just feels it to even as ism describing now that just can just fill fill you up and it provides more energy for the next round an the named round and that really came through in your description of of cone science i also find it interesting that you could not read sheet music at least not very well you were deeply i immersed in an endeavor violin playing that is not of verbal language and then you went into a field that is about in can initially your you were sparked an interest in a field through an understanding a verbal language and earlier you said that that the thing that bridge is the violin an this what came next as as a passion in pursuit was this desire for human connection at what point did you realize that and and here i just i do want o emphasize that et were talking out your story i hope i i can only imagine that people are trying to think about you what a that the intrinsic points of motivation for what they are doing and what they have done asking the sorts of questions that i i hope everyone is asking what what is it really that motive its me to love this and to see a place for myself in that i s those are ultimlating the questions that that e everyone should and can ask ye i am it took me a really long time its actually only been in the last few years that have discovered this ah i discovered this as a result of creating a slight change of plan i am my desire to create the show came from a very personal place which is that ism terrified of change even though have had these formative experiences would change ism a creature of habit am ism willing to change my habits for example i now take haven ninety minutes after i get up hows e worth for very well and to day i haveinevent delightful a well there should i toting i to think the people for themselves someflexibility if you had a run idea of when a pita sixty a idea the occasional you a within thirty men if ye if you have to but nobody's perfect now nor should my silence students i willy no thing they have it ism a creature of hair and i there is a couple reasons why we is humans am are scared of change and i think one of them which is incredibly relatable is that um changes filled with a lot of uncertainty and we hate uncertainty we will go to irrational links to avoid uncertainty one my favorite studies coming out of a count sciences is one involving electric shocks and what they found is that people are far more stressed when they are told they have a fifty per cent chance of getting an electric shock than when they are told they have a one hundred per cent chance of getting an electric shock we would rather be sure certain that a bad thing is going to happen than to have to deal with any feelings of uncertainty and ambiguity i i sat result i i lovely brought of their result it is still is bewildering to me now you think about it a hundred per cent trial to trial shock you mean just you have to take on the c bring it just just bring it on canimentality but if you did that for every trial n then half of the trials you do not get shock o ad get the the we know there is a noblemen release from the lack of punishment am the started the ideal strati is the same and yet somehow people are verse to the uncertainty we just we do not uncertainty even though again the uncertainty is what drives that dob mean first wrist and and yet we bristle certainly m at at that at that uncertainty and i i definitely and a please satisfy everyone we love the satin to even when the status go has been suboptimal drew i been fine with the status close part of it came from my desire to figure out swat how is it a slight change of plants right in marries science and story telling to help us figure out strategies for better managing change i wanted to figure out how are people coming to terms with uncertainty and one of the things that i realized am i learn from i a the guess when mi showing also the scientists where is this concept called cognitive closure and it is the need to arrive at clear definitive answers to thinks e it spicily opposite of this open ended curiosity that you just describe chichi's the count of closure you have a need to you you are not indifferent to words what the answers are you are not indifferent towards what the questions are you care about everything you care about micro managing every part of the curious process from pointati point the and there is a lot of research showing that when we reduce our need for cognitive closure right when we become a little bit more open to the unbidden right to mystery am more open to all in spring experiences we can experience huge loose in well being ah and we can become a lot more resilient in the face of change that is something that ism working on which is okay maybe i can reduce my need for for cognitive closure and the other thing am that i am starting to appreciate is one reason that we we kind of we get change wrong and we may be heart more than we should is that when we anticipate what a change will be in the future we tend to imagine how our present day sells will respond to that future change write must like a magic merits maya and present day going through this mirror comes to the other side two years for now she's the one who is overcoming the challenges of a diagnosis or some other life changed and what we forget is that the big changes in our lives can change us in pretty profound ways right and when we recognize and and we all fall prey to the solution is call the end of history illusion this is work by can gilbert and basely what it says is we fully acknowledge that we have changed considerably in the past you think back to your scape boar days right i think back to my high school days and i think o my gosh of course have changed i would be various solicit any interview i gave when i was when i was younger right what were the thoughts i was even thinking we will see it absolutely we were totally different ten years ago twenty years ago but when it comes to thinking about the future and projecting into the future we are absolutely convince that who we are right now in this moment is the person that is here to stay and that can lead us astray when it comes to thinking about how we will respond to change because we forget that there is actually a lot of wiggleroom around who we become and to your point i made i love the point you made about curiosity what that means is we want to be curious not just about the things we do we want to be curious about ourselves one huge lesson that have learned from the interviews that eve had on a slight change of plans is that i need to constantly be auditing myself through my change experience to figure out how i have changed because when we experience change it does not happen in a value it let us say i get a promotion or i enter into a relationship or i leave a relationship or some other again narrow slice of my life is altered we can think of that change is happening in era chou right as being confined to just the unique area of our life that that little that change existed but of course we are incredibly complex creatures our psychologies and credibly complex we live in these remarkably complex ego systems change in one area of our life will inevitably have spill over effects into all other parts of our lives in ways that are extremely hard to predict and we i think a lot of your listeners are familiar with the researching wore were really bad cognate forecasters or it we are bad i predicting what is going to make us happy what is going to make us sad how long we are going to be sad how long we are going be happy wat one of the reasons for that is that we forget that we are a dynamic entity that might change is well right that our preferences might change our choice sets might change we might change in these really profound ways that we nowt realize and am i think there is an inspiring message coming out of this which is one what were capable of right now really might not be what were capable of later am and what have found in my own experience is that when it comes to our isinterestin what it comes to our self perception because we have a first person perspective on who we are we tend to think that we have a very a comprehensive veridical understanding of who we are i look have a pretty good grasp of who i my i am and what ism capable of and what i value n and what my identity is but the reality is that that understanding is based on the random set of data points that have happened to collect over the course of y lifetime based on the random set of experiences and opportunities and failures and successes that have happen to have right and and if ism not mistaken am there is a salience to the negative experiences often for of reasons that make sense according to nervous systems that will not o keep us say et camera but french you remember the name of this child pronverylylysurely my sister still talks about i will not say her names because it we know that thee people are still around fortunately am the names of some of the the a girls in junior high school that particularly popular and perhaps not in la halinrhaps ain a a for are they stare they nice to be it s yo for nice than a there is a lot of web searching nowadays for what these people are up to now anyway a that not by any this is inhale a sister we occasionally touchhim to this as shes to ingrate fortunately am the others and there is a silence to the negative experiences but but i think what am hearing an i tolly agree with is that an we would to think that we have a complete or at least adequate self knowledge but that we likely do not and and what are some of the ways that we can get a better data on ourselves an ways that can help us is that through am the application of mentorship is it asking people for an honest assessment of us am with of of course the willingness to hear what they have to say am youwet what are some of the the i love zero cost behavioral but am what are some of the zero cops behavioral sources that the people have around them in order to asses what i think a really fundamental questions yes it is true there is too am information a symmetries let say that were trying to sal for rights a two areas were we might not have full knowledge of who we are for one of two reason one as that a we have an incomplete understanding of who we are to pace on the random set of experiences and the second is that going through this big change actually alters us in some way and pay if we are trying to all for the tin the second problems actually easier to salt for and that we often just don't even know to look inhere t stirring if big change to see how we have changed because we think oh all just pay attention to how ism performing at work is that was the new variable that was thrown into my life and we forget to evaluate other parts of our lives what impact has as how o my relationship what in partisans had on my over all well being right and my different do have a different set of preferences do i care about different things in the second category become very inquisitive about who you are over a longer time from and assume that it is not a static state when it comes to the first a bucket which is how do we develop a more complete and rich on rich er understanding myself ism i think it is actually about surrounding yourself with a diverse set of people people that you would not naturally gravitate towards i think the solves for a bunch of social ills which is that again we tend to live in our solos right and were really averse to talking o people who have different points of view but i will tell you at times have learned the most about myself have learned the most about my weaknesses and sometimes my strengths from talking with someone that i vehemently disagree with and it is a really hard thing to you it is very painful but in terms of and defying experiences go it is through those conversations that i almost see this mere reflected back on me right well ism much more aware of how ism coming across to that person cause they disagree with me about something or they are not somewhat i would normally fraternized with and i it is just bread more self awareness in me and i would encourage people to actually seek out connections in uncomfortable spaces because a that will allow you to fill in at least some of the gaps now some of the gaps will truly only be revealed to you because of life experiences ism thinking in my own life i i thought i grieved in a very particular kind of way and then during loved my husband and i experienced multiple pregnancy losses with our spirit i and i found myself grieving in a way that was completely foreign to me i do not think talking anyone would have revealed to me that was grieve in this very in this way we and usually i would reach out to people than i would want to stay connect and i became shut off and clothes off an i did not want to talk to any one for days after the losses i was disoriented there i learned oh actually i you can responded to diverse set of ways to gree right you do not have a sin gulag experience with grief but i might have only learned that from the actual experience of confronting it that said i do think there is a lot of value in trying to fill in gaps and knowledge or a self awareness through these more i ow quotidian conversations you have with people i love love love what you said about deliberately placing oneself into environments where we receive critical feed back from people that we view is quite desperate from us at peasant terms of our experience of them it isn't it was the great call dicer off another a incredibly accomplishing our scientist am happen to be call you on it it a stamford who is sechitrisand he said we think we know how other people feel but we really have no idea how other people feel unless we asked them in fact most is i'mwilliny and really know how we feel were not very good engaging our own emotion credit to quarrel for making that statement but with that said i think getting a sense of how other people see us and disagreement in particular am can be incredibly informative i just n ma say one other point on this which as i think getting fee back from others almost get to bad rat these days in society because it is you should only care about who you are inside who know yourself to be and in died we are social creatures and absolutely matters how i come off to others i i think at should be a hue i huge part of my self identity should be how i intact others and i i i think we should be shameless about integrating that into our understanding myself if i feel ism an excellent person inside and ism regularly wounding the people around me that matters that is relevant the how i see myself and i do worry sometimes at the current the current cultural climate that we are pushing ourselves much towards the space of life all that matters is authenticity in being yourself first felt sometimes yourself is not custom you might wont actually optimize change on biting about yourself to be better i think that is a good thing and then second you you it is a kat care what other people think usually their great barometer a thing that you might not be aware at in cent the enactor hating the its note alike be a lowliest for carrying what other people think to for a moment i agree of this is one of the reasons why say the end of every episode that i do read all the comments on you too you mig think i was raised in an culture an academic culture where feed back on lectures your student feed back was critical i mean it is important i believe to be a selective filter because when in the old days will say there was an opportunity to map the statements to the grade that the student received you can no longer do this you would often see that some there worse some of the worse i i feed back we ha a semen fire exactly and then you look at their grade and you say while oka this help us explain and yet it was also important t understand where that could have represented some failings on my part ye an a classroom is but one environment i think the online environment is where this gets tricky because of the way that we all differ in our capacity to receive critical feed back and sometimes that the harshness of one form of feed back sends people of feeling you know back on their heels ere feeling even ego or emotionally injured in ways that they shall feels the dramatic and i think that is part of the problem is that we do not really have a a away to gauge awe know in appropriate when we see it we know appropriate when we see it but all the stuffing between cause its on a continue really is is where it gets tricky i i certainly think integrating the possibility that somebody might be right what is it that they they say in certain forms of personal developments if somebody is coming at you with an argument about you the best state of mine you could have as you might be right because that lets you hold your ground a bit it is it still maintains boundary but you are not saying you are right and you are not saying you are wrong yet your her on your in i in a kind of a flat footed stance where you could move either way and i that this idea we they might be right and then you can say now why your yes but in any case i i just want to throw out both hands in in em and as many votes i can as one individual to say yes i totally agree more more direct feed back and disagreement is great he's wonderful and i think in science your used to people saying harsh things about your work until they eventual say day cannot polish yer or that i get up in the culture of save wording wore nothings good enough and then occasionally something is good and in the landscape of podcasting i think the common section is is a great way to i get fee back that why i continue to encourage fee back since you do us why i think i i try to just every endeavor that i pursue i try to approach with a lot of humility and i think if i were to describe you not at work right i i lead this team and i i think if you were to ask people what my defining trade is as a leader it a she not strong convictions it is actually a willingness to up date her opinions on things her verist systems her strategy based on in coming information i really really pride myself on having a flexible mind set about stuff and not being stubborn this is true in my marriage right my husband jimmy and i really pride ourselves in saying what they somewhat you just shared ism changing my mind you are right and ism wrong right and if you can actually start to value that if you could sard to see that is ta a virtuous quality i think historically right when we think about leadership we have thought about people who having are incredibly resolute in their convictions but that does not allow the space to again basion up day of date your minds that when you get new information or you realize that you erred in some way and turns the logic that you used or what have you and i bean extremely intentional in every sphere that i worked end to have this very open minded to be very open to critical fee back it does not mean that i take every piece of fee back a pay obviously i have some criteria use to decide whether it is meaningful fee back or is not meaning full back right but the locust of my pride is not in have it being writ or having the strong conviction it is actually in my willingness to have a a more dynamic state of mine regarding laws ofdishies maybe that maybe that is just what it means to be a scientists right like you have to be willing to update in the face of new information i am nodding for those are listening ism just nodding and thinking yes yes and and more yes because i think that we all need more of that as individuals and if we cannot get it from our work setting your group setting sometimes asking a friend can be extremely use a friend he happens to be a professor he universe backseat i will not embarrass him by why a disclosing where he is at but i recall as a a junior faculty member because he knows me well his we years behind me in our creator rectories but asking him for an honest assassin i asked for the most brutally honest assessment me that he could give and some of it strong some of it dong he was o a relating some ways in which i show up as a friend and a superpresent than i have is tench pretty interested all disappear for long prides of time in college they call be dark cause i show it parties i be then than i disaffect two weeks and sappy in my books say how to people just keep going a serve in and out of connection i have worked hard to to change that over the years it i think i have but who knows i in any event a a friend who knows us well that you insist on i do not give any compliments he know just give me the harsh stuff i that can be very useful it nevereminds me some research an by eaten cross if he looks that how we can tame our mental chatter and am if you do not have the friend available to you there is a really easy distancing technique that you an house when you are in the throes of our problem you are trying to actively rereframe something or maybe see where your blind spots are and that is by thinking about your problem from a third person perspective verses of first person perspective you play the role of some one who is giving advice to a friend in your head but that friend is actually you and it actually promote some degree of objectivity and emotional distance from again that tat fuzzy hazy set of feelings that you have around the emotion wat your train get rid of that peace that you can bring a slightly more sober recommendation of the situations o that can be really helpful and then om the other thing to do is i think when we are when we are facing challenge is we we are going through a hard time we do have an instinct to want to vent right in again in this air of nobility and what not we are told yes share everything that is on your mind it can actually be counter productive to vent and the reason for that is that when you are venting about a hard situation that your going through or something hat your frustrated about with yourself typically the person you have invited into the conversation they are a nice empathetic person they want to make you feel better and what what do they do they offer emotional balm in the situation oh my god that does sound terrible you were wronged ism sorry you went through that instead of playing the role of what youthen calls a cognitive adviser which is actively trying to challenge the narrative your telling about your situation actively trying to get you to question whether the way you are portraying the situation is accurate and actually trying to get you to frame aspects of the situation and when we think about venting when it comes again feeling in those blind spots about ourselves you you might want to tell your friend at the outset your you even said lay off the you are the nice stuff i just want to hear the hard stuff you want you want to tell your friend at the beginning look and having this challenge with my choline at work for the sky the gems gave me a really tough time and an what is going on i mean to have here here is the cereus of situation rather than trying to make me feel better about the situation i want you to actively find holes poke holes in the way that ism thinking about this thing s that i can try and find some refrain strategies to see the situation from a different vantage plain these are all called distancing tastings for t third person persons pest person and actually the some really interesting narrow science a research showing that when we you our problems than our ourselves from a third person perspective o your a activity in areas associated with hostility and a passion actually decrease ah instead i can be really helpful when it comes to resolving interpersonal conflict or trying to see where you might have been wrong i love these examples because especially the one were one doesn't on their own it truly does not require anything a son don't my interested anterior not evil you do not even have to go to the party and o everyone one i do not i got back then it would have been there were no self input a or smart sons rather but ye was a bit of ghosting ai was just i might my i can reset with small numbers of people that i close to but i i found at that time i need to to go into an isolated space to do what i need to do to reset myself em but i realize there certain forms of communication the still required why am alive ye i still get that i still gat this for my mother at once more look if if you do not reach out not only do i not know what is happening with you but i also do not know if your get something ism a grown man of course i not not and i and that i of course use the worst possible response at any son or child could give which s listen it is only happened me some one the police would contact you ore li now that the hospital connect which is not reassuring kids everywhere call you her or father and i know i knows collar at van an i n v still working on it it is a work in process hum venting it ism glad that you brought this up i think that there these buzz words now in authenticity i do think that there are certain forms of communication that that can be a injurious to people and yet i think having some internal buffers to to that all that in coming stuff i me is important and you cannot beyond line and i think everyone is pretty much analyzing these days am without having some policies for oneself and how you gan a deal with the stuff how am i going to be a selective filter i think knowing the ends of the continual this is clearly am benevolent kind discourse this is clearly bad amen a block this ore get ride it but then within that middle range having some rules and policies for haw to filter it a neither by time of day that you look at it or getting in put a but considering the it might be true it might not be true a what people are saying and you said you were talking that memory and how we tend to overweight negative a experiences and i didfind myself a si give the speech in of his posted and i i i was looking at the comments and i literally any time my brain coated a communist positive a just ripped right pastis was i was literally just searching for the negative stuff as as if it as if the posit his generic and the negative as is somehow genuine yes wen i had to make it a mental i to make a mental note hey it cate an marine in the the the messages that are saying that i really helped them in some way and they are really enjoy at the thing and the you would again for self critical people i think it takes an extra stop to remind yourself to also read the good stuff and to allow that stuff to count to well we did not episode on gratitude an one of the a big surprises that came to me in researching for that episode was at a the best evidence for gratitude having plosive effects on marry circuitry nor chemistry comes from when we receive gratitude i supposed to give gratitude this is what is often lost in ti discussing about gratitude all the more incentive to give gratitude and and to be aware of when it is coming your way and internalize it a there is a small category of people out there i think hopefully small that i a bask in positive a feed back that it amplifies their narcissism but it is clear that you are not ho one of the people us zero finest one risk o of that happening i want to talk little bit about goals as it relates to motivation u because you've done that you have done a lot of a important a work and and what i conciedereis organization of this what would otherwise be a pretty complex spaceman what is more important to most people than being motivated and focussed and excited hopefully on on endeavors that they enjoy and that inspire delight but tell us about what cannot just initiate but what can sustain motivation a because we talked about the opening system on this pod cast many times before but that is a pretty reductionist way to look at it and you have a different perspective that i have really benefited from learning a bit about yes when it comes to goals i mean it is fir some born to recognize that there's two parts of a goal a pase there is the way that we define the goal and then there is the way that we pursue the goal and i think we tend to overlook the first category how we define the goal because oftentimes our goal seen they should be obvious to us right i want to lose weight i want to avoid sleeping late that i get a good night sleep i want to build muscle mass right these are things such a seen they should just be intuitive right but what research in behavioral scene shows as that not all goal frames are made equal in fact really small weeks to the way that we frame our goals can have an outsized impact on whether or not were a successful at reaching theckoal on one such framing is whether you frame your goals and turns of an approach orientation or an avoidance orientation we talk about what this means n approach orientation would be i want to eat healthier fruits right avoidance would be i want to avoid unhealthy orcas in the contacts of say your social life approach would be i want to be in a relationship i want to enter a relationship avoidance would be i want to avoid feeling loneliness if i want o void feeling a isolated now the reason why these two frames are important to consider is that they can have a different impact on our motivational state and they can also have a different impact on the emotional response that we have to success in failure in these domains what we tend to find is that when you frame something in an approach orientation way am when you succeed that success is met with feelings of pride and accomplishment we find that it leads to aboostan motivation boosts endurance it burst boost perseverance eh when you frame something in terms of avoidance success is met with feelings of calm and relief can it a oh wife the forehead thank goodness i avoided that calamitous outcome or thank goodness i avoid doing that really bad thing back to neutral ye exactly and it is fine to frame goals and terms of avoidance and actually sometimes is just personality dependent some people are more driven by fear or they need a lot more urgency to drive them but it is important to know that the approach orientation is on average more motivated and you might want to think of refrain your goal in terms of approach verses avoided the other advantage to approach is that when you frame something is avoid right i want to avoid doing ex i want avoid doing why it is really hard a measure success right it is are you really tracking every time your tempted by the calmative cookie and you do not actually eat it that is really hard a measure right and we do better when we can measure success and failure right it is much easier to track the number of times you approach a salad right you approach something that is healthy and anyway it it is really interesting to see how they it this really subtle shift and we see this across this the the word an behavioral science can have such a being impact on on behavior and am on this framing thing all deserve one little anecdote from my time working in government we were trying a mod i ate veterans to sign up for a am employment and educational assistance programmed this is after their years of service and this is a really important benefit that the government offers for free because the transition from military to civilian life can be very fraud with a lot of a psychological and physical obstacle obstacles and i remember the department of veteran's affairs they had almost no money to to fun an marketing program around this they said my and team were got one eel the were get a send to theta and have at it of that is all we are working with and my teammates and i ended up changing just one word in this email message instead of telling that that they were eligible for the program we simply reminded them that they had earned it through their years of service and that one word change led to a nine per cent increase and access to the benefit and it is am it is base in a psychological a principle call the endow then effect which says tat we value things more when we own them or in this case have earned them also i share this example only to say that is such a small change right am but we we just know that again these small little weeks in the way that we talk to ourselves away that we frame our goals can have a really big infant on our behavior ism fascinated by that result a some people hearing it might think o in tin percent is that really that great but i went a one word change in e and the scale of the federal government wright onion f at ionization for potato a to a are you that he things a change quickly in big organizations a discussion for another time but eligible verses earned a again a come back to this possibility that there is something about words earned that invoke over state within us that makes us more action oriented similar to being able to see ourselves in some landscape that can evoke delight a a supposed to just seen the landscape that evokes delight or awe ism really hung up on this because i think one of the major challenges it seems for behavior a change is that most people do wait for the the stick as opposed to feeling into the curate do spear i mean ill you have to do as look at the enormous number of people who are struggling with health related issues for which there is now a lot of active debate is it genetically determined or it sir and setting all that aside it is just very clear that their number of behavioral things some light sleep exercise social connection nutrition u among among them that there is no pill for there is no injection for there is absolutely no replacement for getting people to change their behavior is hard yes telling people that their capable sometimes helps but does not seem sufficient what what are some more of these a verb states that people you think can internalize that give them access to the real sense of possibility and get them changing their behavior yet an behavior changes very hard i sometimes bristle at some of the hacks that i see on line the do not think this lot of evidence set supports that this work what ism sharing to day is at back by your really high quality research an one o my friends and a cantoris fella fishbolt as in a lot of this work at the university of chico on gold setting inmodivation a a couple of these things for people to consider and by the way i love the faces because ism pasts of golds right i love getting better at things at i i been using all of these insights an my own life it is truly a delight to get to share sidebar ism important wind are you you ma you lit else at you do not just research it you loves it is it is totally research for whatever they call it i a who sets the gold matters a lot of us work with coaches trainers mentors bosses that is great it is really really helpful for people in our lives to bring structure to our goals to push us along to motivate us but when other people are setting our goals setting our targets for us it undermines a really valuable source of motivation which is being in the driver seat we love steering in our lives we love feeling agency we love recruiting our own agency when it comes to achieving our goals and n no we tucked about how people will go to irrational lengths to avoid a feeling uncertainty people also go to a rational lengths to preserve their agency in control over a situation there is some really interesting research that is come out just in the last for years showing that humans prefer to use their judgment over an altar them that they know performs better than their judgment but did not involve them of andtheyre much more satisfied wit the outcomes what when it is them that is in the driver seat right and what this means i think in everyday contact is not to do away with trainers and coaches and what not every trainer an coach is listening do not hate me they your you are sticking around but what they cannot do as they can build some something of a choice set into your dated programming right let us say that at work you have a certain skill that you are trying to build as for set of options to these from own the targets more you will see a boost motivation let us say yare working out wit the trainer they are it is legal of into own some my targets right are begin to go heavy cart on dead lives are we to go at hart of squats whatever it is and build some agency into the experience because nothing supplants that kind of intrinsic drive an the feel in that you own the success or the failure that again i i think your earlier point silver really trying to do with some of these behavior insights is capitalize in our natural state as humans right what drives us and it turns out we really love being in control wealthy do not we monopolize on that when it comes to a our got forty rights or trying to figure out those areas the psychology that we can leverage fantastic the word agency is hokey here i think in it explains that earlier result the shock experiment people having agency over one hundred there response to one hundred percent of the time at least it is it is giving them some sense of control in mitigating it whereas when if when it is at random fifty fifty ye i or rather when it is random fifty per cent of the trials than even though the outcome is better on the whole it is it is perceived somehow as a reduction and agency there is something fundamental there for short when i started my laboratory in it there was in additional pressure to publish papers this as before getting tenure i used to ask students in stocks when the the paper would be ready and then finally i stopped asking an just said why do not you tell me when the dead line n as yes and not a single one failed or rather i should put it in the past light every single time they succeeded in beating there estimate i because they were in control of that in point it was am at times a challenging for me but they they sat a date and then if and also by the we they need to extend that date outward we did that was their choice i said they need more time e that the rule in science that i think applies a lot of places i always the phrase as fast as i carefully can because you don't want a rush aright be but that sense of agency i to think translated to u more a joy for them it certainly there was a lot of productivity from them d the and there might be listening to listen they can put in the comments whether not am telling the truth re there all i most offer professors now what a wrong i see have succeeded ut they always exceed the questions whether not i had anything to do with it my adviser is always said on the besting you can do as support your students in post option an just get at their way because the really good ones a yo cannot control them you are just you just trying on not screw things out for the give now there's not an intenticmination a curious about the difference between lone pursuits and group pursues cause i know you understand a lot about groups and i want to make sure that we talk about am groups think although that has such a negative connotation but the way that we tend to a an of a revert to the mean when it comes to i were thinking in our opinions and certainly are am explanations of whose right in was wrong when we are in a collection of minded people ye this could also be praised as one are the dangers of being among minded a and and then well relate that back to motivation but what are the dangers of being among minded people ye anmyou will in the contact of goals and motivation it can be very very helpful to be in the contacts of minded people and the reason for that is we often do not see failure up close when it comes to people pursuing their goals but if we are in the presence of people whose values we share who have a similar commitment to doing something and we see up close that they sometimes have those days where they fail or we have the vulnerability to show when we failed that connectable increase our resolve that the goals that we are trying to achieve are actually possible e i think the danger of being in the the minded faces is around how limits your your frame of mind right when it comes to the ideas that you have when it comes to the convictions you have around your points of view it can be very dangerous to only the in the in the echo chamber and again cause i want to give people strategies to challenge the way of thinking without them having the socialize for all the interests out the re lot o compassion i id interest tendencies i get it on one helpful thought experiment you can use when you feel may be our spending a little bat too much time around people who are just reenforcing whatever few points you have is to ask how your belief system in your your ideas and your opinions of things might have been different had you been born during a different time period and in a different family or cultural landscape and what happens when it comes to our view points is that they become tethered to our identities that we feel if we were to medicine a certain belief or value we would be jedisining ourselves and that feels way too threatening its way to destabilizing to engage in that but the minute you imagine what it would have been to to have been born in a different family with different religious belief system with a different value system all of a sudden you transport your same self right stillmaya into this new environment and you start to see how non precious some of your beliefs are right debut we do not have the sacred quality that you thought that they did and you might be more open to changing your mind more open and receptive to challenging your own points of view if you engage in that that pot experiment i recall you discussing a description of people watching a game of sport that involve that calls yea i controversial refer yuan arson after he calls yet you can share with us o ta about that results i when it really interesting especially the part where the experimenters can swap the identities of the teams in theory and then well they finally what people come to realizes that our perception of the outside world is strongly informed by the group that we see ourselves in and otto our own detriment absolutely at this is a study from the nineteen fifties and into your point we tend to think pay were human beings were really enlightened were making decisions and where ah engaging in judgments of things based on data an evidence and fact an surely my visual system would not lie to me whatever i perceive is going to be true an vertical vertical representation of the world and not true oka a lot of are belief and these are these are strong beliefs in men again the there what we believe to be fact about the world is in formed by our group membership in the study u loyal a fans of two opposing football teams watch these controversial a played right were the refer made a call and they were not quite certain if it was in or out let us say and depending on your loyalty to the team to whatever sports team right whichever side you were on you are much more likely to favor calls that were made on your teams in you in your tams favor an we you ask people coming out of a study this it is not ye i knew i was biased i knew that i was basing my judgment of these refer calls based on my affiliation an my love of if team as or team why you would not think that you think you were an arbiter of truth in the situation you are just recalling what your visual system saw and i think that shows how powerful these social forces are how powerful our group of filiations are because it can truly change the way that you sea stuff right of course it can then transform the way that you think of that stuff and that to me is a powerful reminder that when we are in disagreement with some one else and we just try to beard them with facts right and you are scientists right with your hearing someone say something in your a that is not that is not accurate that is not true your your instinct probables say but have you heard about the twenty seventeen study the pure vet journal article from pug that the does not right an but when you recognize that actually a large part of our belief system a emerges from the groups tat we identify with it i think there is there is an inspiring lesson that comes from that we should not be too disheartened by the fact that this is true but it helps around at our under standing why it is that people believe the things they do and as a result we have more resources at hand to try to understand how we can change their minds right one of the guides that i interview o my podcast a his name is dare dais he is a black days musician and a he was confronted by a member of the cumulus clan at one of his performances and it led talk about a slight change of plans i mean he just went on a totally different life path and ended a am convincing dozens of people to live white supremacy groups including the cycles clan and am when it when it comes to carrell and his approach will one he recruited people's agency he never implied to them oh ism trying to change their mind am he inspired he always says i did not convince them mix they convince themselves to change their mind he recruited their agency a but he also tried his absolute hardest to not question their fundamental and underlying humanity wright he tried to understand why are you parted this group this vile vitriolic group and some people would share will it is a family tradition thing my father was in the clan the grandfathers in the clan look none of this excuses being in a hate group the but it least gave carrell and understanding of some of the the factors that were pushing them towards the group that he might offer that sense of community that pensive belonging somewhere else maybe outside of a hate group right but if he thought that he was actually just fighting over facts over whether african america should be treated a equal to everyone else than he would have lost that that a argument because he was even fighting with the right currency write what was relevant a what was a this is my it was the first episode of a slight change of plans we ever released and continues to me my favorite because what was thrilling about this interview is that the strategies carrell used to convince people to change their minds again if these deeply entrenched horrific views were totally corroborated by the science of how he change people's minds he did not use a lot of really effective strategies just intuitively but he is just a master mind the serial scientist just by virtue of who he is am but he he showed genuine curiosity ah for why it is they believe what they did which is again extremely hardens i would not have had the equanimity to show genuine curiosity for why some one is in the cuclux's plan but he showed that curiosity he increased on the his question to statement ratio since really important to ask people a lot of questions and then and then he would ask people am a really important question which is well what in theory could change your mind like what evidence would i have to give you in order to change your mind about enquiry and the reason that i love asking that question is that it crease suppose that some one ought to be willing to change their mind in the face of new information this hearkens back to the conversation or having earlier about the importance of having a valuable say of mine of being willing to update in the face of new final now if the person i response says literally nothing will change my mind look it will then you notice not worth your time to have the disagreement with them but if they give you a little bit and say well maybe i would change my mind on vaccines if you were to tell me enquiry maybe i would change my minds on my mind on emigration reform if you were tell me this or that now you have an in right but you do need to get them into the state of mind where they think yet i guess in theory i could change my mind about this thing that i feel absolute resolute about have never worked in public policy am bat i feel very strongly that where i see failures and mass of public health policy or educational policy almost always there seems to be a failure of even interest in understanding what motivates the other sides position and this is where i just this actually gets me am frustrate to the point of motivated where it is people are saying you are wrong your wrong know this know that to the point of it is almost maddening and far more seldom a do we see people say o ka men a third person myself for i men t put myself on the other person shoes and say you why might they feel that way why would this person be listening to this individual as opposed to this public health at a individual and look without taking any stands on this cause is much bigger conversation than we want to have right now i could look at public health officials that just completely failed to understand the other sides position and vice verse and that to me just says it is a communication failure a and i it'll take this out of the a cove pandemic am discussion as it is normally had and say that one thing that we know for sure is that in the twenty twenty to really twenty twenty two but still twenty twenty three a landscape there were many mental health concern is wrist everybody i regardless of where people were on the vaccine to bate was de bate locked down debate regardless of any of that every one stress level was elevated e and there were very very few am top down from at the level of governments discussions about haw to maintain circadian rhythm and sleep health how to maintain health in general in that landscape and that for for me was just really shocking it was also one o the reasons why we launch the pod cast frankly as that i really feel that the tools were needed by everybody and should be zero cost to everybody but what was clear is there was much pointing of fingers and name calling and and violence even that no one was saying why would people feel this way why would people trust these sources as opposed to these sources and we can only conclude if we are good scientists that am the the the landscape was ineffective right was in effect and it continues a many if you go if you have the the desire to take a reduction in opening by going on twitter and following this back and forth a continues to day it is it is pretty ugly still none of it seems really evolutionary and there are few people out there when try to make it solution or intend but not really and i do not want o ammo going to the dark aspects here but but it does seem am this willingness to take a look at why others might feel the opposite of how we feel is a very rare quality and this gentleman dare what was island areal dais i think give seen a number things with him itself and an he is obey extraordinary but we call in that because people him were exceedingly rare what can we do to cultivate that kind of mind say because ism not pointing fingers here a anything we all have this default tendency to gather evidence the way that we gather evidence draw conclusions and then stand our ground and i think it is detrimental ta to everyone you are making me reflect on probably the greatest gift that being a cognac of scientist has given me in my life am obviously its pet my curiosity had been delight to study things and learn things for the greatest gift it is given me is empathy towards people it is the greatest driver a human empathy to learn how our mines work and i do not know if there is a substitute for that partly that is why i started a slight change of plans we have story episodes were you here from people carrell but i interview scientist from all over the world about their areas vex mortice and i genuinely believe that the more we learn about how the mine works the more we learn from my feel the cognac science but how we would make decisions how we develop our attitudes and beliefs about the world how we come to be the people that we are the more we can bridge these emptily gifts and it is been profound for me i mean i feel lucky to have been steeped in this literature for decades now my hope is to invite people into the conversation because the more you learn about why people are the way they are the more empathy you can extend and the more not even say you got it you need to extend an olive branch not saying that you need to compromise your own belief system but at least you see that there might be an entry point a reason to have a discussion with this person who believes things that are completely different from you and i we talked about gratitude bit in this conversation i feel immense gratitude that i have a posture of empathy as i move around in this world because i regain i have i have strong beliefs on things i care a lot i care about reducing human suffering and that i meed someone whom i think is pro policy that promotes human suffering and of course the literal human instinct dislike thew with you in your view point this is horrible this is intolerable but because i have this count of science had on it allows me to walk around with a slightly different view point and i really feel the am a better person as a result of that and i and have heard from listeners of a slight change of plans when they listen to these science episodes the there is the science of loneliness the science and empathy the science of meditation i try to bring this empathetic spend to to understanding again narrow science and psychology they have found that they are kinder to others and that is as hardly the best fee back that have ever received on the show is people are ism a nicer person to other people now especially the once i do not agree with am presume to themselves as well man i know a you have brought up the topic of empatheous away to prevent burn out right that ism in here not to strike ma job burn out or time out the burn out that is aren't any long term pursuit that is challenging raising heads o being in a family what is the great from dot quote you no think your enlightened go spend a week with your parent oil a no matter how like and you are liking i i i has always i remind myself of my fate and my parents but when you jujus o completely different what the i am shift to had also kind to ones self an n i think there is starting to be some good narrow science that the mechanistic level of of empathy am clearly it empathy is not the default state for most people it is something that we need to cultivate as a practice and tat we can cultivate is a practice along the lines of empathy but also returning to a topic that we open to day's discussion with we build these narratives about ourselves starting in adolescence may been earlier and through our tenders than we have various experiences but ism cures how we can continue to build narratives about ourselves and the role of narrative that the i statements the i am statement and whether or not you and we should all spend some time you'd doing that coming these days we on people exercise as we know it is good for us people get some are they know it is great for them am that people perhaps of a meditation practice or there be practice are journalling practice but how is it that we can continue to evolve our narratives about self in a way that promotes some are all of the things hat were been talking on to day yes empathy's really interesting because i think u we have lot of is conceptions about it and we have is conceptions about how empathetic we actually are i would argue people are more empathetic than they think and when we tell you i this comes from research by my my friend an nelson at stamford am there is three distinct types of empathy why people do not know about the first kind is emotional empathy and this is the one that feels very intuitive to us it is this visceral reaction i have we tell me that you have had a really hard time my eyes start to well of s i i can truly feel your pain and a i just feel what you feel the and tat typically is the is what people think of when they think of empathy period they overlook two other types of empathy the second type is called cognitive empathy this is the ability to accurately diagnoses what it is it's causing you distress in this moment and what it is that i could offer up to you to try to help ameliorate some of your suffering the third kind is called empathic concern or it is known as compassion as well which is the actual desire to help you desire to help another person and what is interesting about these three types of empathy is that they do not quarrelate with em people you can be really high in the emotional empathy scale right you can have tears streaming down your face as you hear about your friends divorce but you might be really bad at diagnosing what it is that is causing them distress you might be really bad at actually offering up am a solution to their problem or you might lack the will right if your sociopathy you might just not have the will to help some one right an am what is interesting is that i think in our society in this this relates back to identity and and the labels we give ourselves i think our society puts a huge premium on emotional empathy and we discount people who do not have that visceral response and we just immediately say oh they are not empathetic and this happens from the time that were really little by the way the kid whose crying on the playground comforting their friend rights we're while that that kids got a ton of empathic my older kid does not seem to rally care about people but they might excel in cognitive empathy they might excel when it comes to compass empathic concern one of the things i was talking about with yeumeal on a slight change of plans is maybe we ought to think about empathy languages in the same way we think about love languages people have different ways of expressing their empathy and we ought to value them equally and am that is been wonderful because i think even in the pass i would have had a really hard situation might go to one of my friends and they just seem a little it more stoic and ism you can give a shit why do you not care as much as i want you to care it turns out their fantastic at wanting to help me and understanding what is wrong with me and am i love the idea of giving a little more love to those second two buckets because i think it allow us to better recruit more empty from others and also to see ourselves differently to maybe for those people at there ho are a not a very empathetic person you might actually be more empathetic than you think i the second thing i wanted to share is about burn out wrights you talk a it about about burn out people who rate really high on the emotional empathy's scale tend to experience burn out at higher rate you can imagine health care workers first responders essentially what you are doing when you feel emotional empathy as you are your your carrying the burden of the other person's pains you can easily imagine how that can deplete you and i think the instinct that we have when we are empathetic is to say what ism just ben a shut myself off i have that experience in twenty twenty i was there is too much bad stuff happening around me i prefer to just not feel things thank you very much and i try to close myself off from natural emotional reactions i would have to things but what emails a research shows is that you do not actually have to if you cultivate cognitive empathy and empathic concern those can actually be protective against burn out you do not have to do away with empathy altogether you just have to shift gears and be more selected about the kind and empathy that you are investing in i love this research could get it just opens your mind up to this whole world of empathy that you might have thought of this mores the singular concept and allows there to be a little bit more graceface i love the idea that there different categories of empathy it will also a me with a response i ever pathetically one says i do not feel your really feeling what ism feeling in therefor you are not empathic to my experience i i i but where i rate on these scales is not important but this no chocogneivfe empathy i thing it is really important proudly one that most feel have not heard of i certainly have not heard of it but i to think that it really does sucksgist on that it is at least a you might have it in span i i do not know how n it'd a to ask the people close to me but but that it is at least as important as the emotional me at before we conclude there is something that i unfortunately pushed us past too quickly that i want to return to because i think it something that many people care about and live with each day which is this issue challenges with on going innovation and forget i for for now ism not that an o en a not ism nothing a a am for running a act to this because i realize that i i pulled us off to another topic but you have talked about the middle problem be y an it is and it is too important to to not return to was u tells about the middle problem an how we can overcome the middle grand and before it you that you mind if i give just a couple short strategies around goal setting i just on to mature round out that see and not only would i not mind i i it'd be deli it is not to makes sure again i yer share share the wisdom that is hell ay much in my personal life o ay and it'll try to be fast the earth it is take your t u but i you'll have these gulls to re try t i got to get them got the out running m the first is to make sure that you are we already talked about approach for verses avoiding gulls right we talked about how who secs the gal matters and how if it is you it is better right if you have some ownership over your targets the third thing is to make sure that your setting goals when you are in the same psychological and physiological state as the one you will be in when you are actually pursuing the goal m because we tend to have what are known as this is again violet fish box for we tent to have empty gaps between our present day selves in our future selves and that empty gap can lead us to be very compassionate to words four him on sundae washing t d my right and six a m my who i hope is going to be gat the him in a cut killing herself with a really high and messy intervals set or what not and if if it is four pram on sundae rolling out the best time for you to say om en to go to the him every day six a m if you actually are at the him at six a m and you are feeling viceroy the physiological pain the psychological pain of having gotten up really early to do the work out then it is reasonable for you to set that goal but it is kind of the opposite if they say do not go to super market hungry right actually this situation you want to be in exactly the same physiological and psychological sat you will be in when you are in goal pursuit it will make it much more likely that you set reasonable goals and you actually reach them the second thing ism that you mightwant to think about is don't now that you enter but i feel ism the goal purest by nature when i set a goal the minute i fall off even slightly the goal is gone for me key and ism ah i mess up let us start from the beginning lets start from scratch and you a new goal have already have already misstep and it isn't matter sight i feel unless i i i achieve perfection in achieving my goals i get very frustrate and i just fall off the wagon completely one thing that researchers have shown is that it is really helpful to build in what is called an emergency reserve into your goal setting early slack is another way of putting it let us say i have a goal i want o go to the him every single day this month it is really important and helpful to give yourself and you are not going soft on yourself i promise to give yourself for example three get a a jail free cards three days where for whatever reason it is o say that you did not go to the him you got sick you be of kids who got sick you are just not feeling motivated it does not really matter with the reason is you don't go t the him but the important thing is that you are still track to achieving your goal even if you miss those three days because you built them into the system an the final thing it'll say about am setting the goal is to try to capitalize on a phenomenon known as the fresh start effect this is work by my friend kat milkmen she is a professor at carton at the university of pennsylvania what she is found is that in our lives we have these big milestone moments where we break from the past and where entering a new future the this might be moving across the country it could be getting a new job it could be getting married it could be whatever they but it feels a big change and that is a wonderful moment to try to introduce a new set of patterns into your life in part because again am you have a break identity but too it is really easy to introduce new habits when a lot of your environmental circumstances are different i take a new job all the sun of a new out to work probably a good idea did not introduce a pastry stop every time i go to work is i no longer and passing by that vagary every morning am see one to capitalize on fresh starts of that kind there is also a more arbitrary rest starts that exists for all of us and this is in the torment the first day of the years of christy need's resolutions the first day of spring even the first day of the week can be very motivating because we all clean slits we a wipe away the past we embarking on a new future a that is that is clean a failure and stumbling and what not and that can be early powerful motivator i love these suggestions a because i do think that we a clean start there is something to that who knows why but i think it it is a a universal trait am and perhaps shortening the time domain over which we think about our gulls and success in failure could help i can just say you love the clean start is this afternoon because this morning was not you o did not go well yet d not i surrender the whole week to you vested on a money morning that is for idea ism sensing the perfectionistic you and i know that there is it is a continuum you some people i do not am unless a suffer from perfectionism was i think it is it is a great attribute in certain domains and can be challenging in others but a i love the idea of a having a little bit of grace am with one's gulls and also what you said earlier of making the carat compelling a not much focussing on just the stick a making the caret more compelling am much there what about the middle problem yes a cause i do think that people a do tend to go go hard out to a as it were an than people drop off ye yet all the self we talked about far as been around defending the goal and now we need to think about how we sustain our motivation to pursuit a gal and this can be superhero i it again behavior change is incredibly incredibly hard to sustain i the middle problem the middle problem first to the fact that we do not have stable amounts of motivation over the course of goal pursuit we tend to have a boost motivation at the beginning of the pursuit we all feel this miserly right have decided ism get do inerinfasting or ism going make sure i look at you know the sun every morning the first moment that i get ut or what whatever the goal is in that first day you are motivated to get it done right infant the first few days the first few weeks i and then you experience a a loose in motivation a higher amount of motivation towards the end of the goal ism we experience at the end of a goal what is known as the goal gradient effect we tend to experience monotonic increases in motivation the closer we are to the finish line we might even see in marathon runners right their go can i only have this remaining part to go i can expend all my energy now to try to get over the finish line there is a lull though in motivation in the middle of goal pursuit and that is something that we want to get ahead of we want a salve for now obviously we cannot eliminate middles mathematically impossible to eliminate middles what do we do will we do something that you already alluded to which is actually short in the time duration of our goals rather than setting an annual goal right let us say that it is the new year you are inspired to try to make twenty twenty three the best year ever but what the problem with that is when you set in annual goal now your middle is months long we're gan experience that de crease in motivation for a healthy trunk of the year which is not ideal if you set a weekly goal by contrast all of the sun your middles a lot shorter right all of a sudden your dealing with a few days maybe a day or to and you want to be mindful of of the duration a of the goal another thing that can help on keep motivation high is to do out when my friend kat milkman calls temptation bundling this is number one then the might go to strategy for having done every unpleasant activity in my life that have had to do oh folding laundry doing the dishes i should really working out you do i do not need as much motivation but sometimes i still see for high intensity days i do need the motivation to do tithe hard cardie to get on to get on on into working out in that way i what is temptation bundling you are pairing an unpleasant activity folding laundry doing dishes taking out the trash with an immediately rewarding enjoyable activity that can be listening to your favorite pod casts which are of course the hubormen lav in out like change of plans obviously ah it could be listening to your favorite pop music but the really article piece of the temptation bundling is that you have to forego the indulgence of enjoying that rewarding activity in all other spaces of your life for example am for me i feel a good pop song i have twenty five really good listens and then a kind of becomes old hat that just the excitement of the song wears wears off a bit there's been times were all be cooking with my husband and he is hay why do not we play ah you love case must rays while we play that alarm and ism novena no that is at alarm i can only listen to when ism lifting weights maintain the ouseyet to maintain the botel see right you do not allow yourself to get the joy and edification f the suborn lag when you are not taking a walk and getting exposure o that morning sunlight and it is such a simple strategy when yo think about it but i have found myself looking forward to really annoying tass that i have to get done because i know ism ditto get the enjoyment of something really fun that accompanies it e tactic is it important that the thing that one enjoys be done simultaneously ye f long lonely while watching the a fix thing or listening to a particular piece music yet you want them to coexists because then again you get that immediately most of the time the things that we lament doing have really positive long terms outcomes right if ism in the habit of keeping my house clean there is long her benefits of the habit of exercising or eating healthily there is longhorn benefits but i do not often feel the rewards in real time what you are trying to do is give yourself that rush of joy and excitement that accompanies the immediately rewarding activity that in your mind even just narrowly the two things are coexisting we it because it has such firm grounding in the erbialgy of reward and aversion and haw to overcome aversion there is deep nurse seen around less but have never heard it presented that way ye thank you for those incredibly clear actionable a tools fromodivation because many peoples struggle with the ye and i hear that all the time and i think you knot you talked about aversion and actual this is really important when we think about returning to our goals which is often the hard things to you do it on e money and you have that same got on a tuesday another on a weekday on thursday and by thursday your kind of on my got it was hard the first few days tor really want to go back and do that o do the same work out on the thursday what is really helpful here to avoid some of that aversion is to be mindful of the the way in which our minds process memory when we reflect back on how much we enjoyed or did not enjoy in experience we do not give equal wight to every moment each women does not get uniform weight instead we tend to ism give more weight to what is called the pique of the experience the experience that was most emotionally intense the part of the experience that was the most e emotionally intense and the end of the experience this is a this is worked one by a noble lariat cinnamon a dance connamenn and his elaborator i mustvirsky the pique end rule is what this is called we you put a lot of weight on again that really emotionally intense moment of the experience in the end now researches have studied this in the contexts of lots of unpleasant activities in some studies people are are force to plunge submerge their hands and ice cold water or they looked at colonosoties for example how unpleasant those are and ah what they found is that this is interesting i am airting at a littlefixa i just think that this field is cool o need levin out is in just at already it is encourage the say o at i having a moment it cognitive science a tot this is such coal restarts what these researchers that is clever if you a elongate the unpleasant experience b a couple minutes let us say the hands in freezing cold ice water or the colonoscovy but you make those last few minutes of the unpleasant experience slightly less unpleasant then the end of the experience would otherwise advent right had you just ended the colon's to be procedure as plan had you just taken a the hands writ out the outside bucket by for example increasing the temperature of the water by a degree or ease your imaginations whatever they ehuumay e calling us here we let there there there are mechanisms by which the pain can be less position everywhere know them but we at what we are we herblianda ubugises could do the metal work of figuring out with the alonandal urological a what they find is that people look back on the experience more favorably they've a more positive impression of the experience now again this is what miraculous about this finding the overall duration of the unpleasant experience has been extended there are more minutes of overall suffering right but the last few minutes are less bad tan they would have been otherwise and people are they view the experience more favorably in the case the colonies obits they were actually more likely to return for follow at visits for for their annual check ups a and what is this mean of daily life but what it can mean is let say you are literally killing yourself at the get oo cat you have the hardest work out that you have ever had tack on a few minutes to the end of the work out that our still unpleasant see your coding coding that as being part of the unpleasant working out experience but are little bit less intense and less painful then the work out and would have been otherwise you might be more likely to return and actually do that the handwork out can we also say of somebody really enjoy their training that the opposite would be effective as well that perhaps i they really want to push it hard at the end because that sis sensation that they particularly enjoy that that could serve prsunely the memory systems in the reward systems of the brains such that they are more likely to return to the work out absolute you raise a fantastic point which is when we talk about enjoyment in these contacts it is all subjected i is lo in to love the feeling and would a die because my heart is it a ratings son for ever yous that have just wire to love exercises right and on i love a hardsfrend training work out right and for me what enjoying went might look at the end is really really really intense right that might be what brings me back but in other domains absolutely not colonoskety's situation i do not want the to be an unpleasant experience and there are lots of other domains in life where he just tack on a few of the few minutes on to something that is really tedious are really hard or really painful it can make you more likely to commit to it later but it is an excellent point in all of these studies it you have to consider who the person is and what their natural psychology is liken for everyone listening you want a tailor these recommendations to who you are as a person there certain life demands that i find incredibly aversive ism going to use this approach for those ism also going to i use them in the contact of things i really enjoy because am if one has the opportunity i believe to further reenforce the things that bring stop why why would not we have treaty o fantastic recommendations i could ask you a thousand more question and m i hope is that you will come back that i gan ow yo those thousand plus more questions i have to say it is exceedingly rare that i talk to somebody either on the podcast or elsewhere frankly in my life that has such a incredibly why breadth of knowledge and yet has much depths of knowledge as well it is clear that your many experiences through music and cognac science podcasting and by the way we are going to am bridling your podcast and a show not caption that people can hear more from you and as they should and also your work in policy and you have put yourself in a lot of different domains and i think that itself is inspiring and am whether not by way of curiosity human connection awe both presume we it is both and many other things as well m i know i speak on behalf of many many people i just outrank you much for doing the work that you do for continuing along these pursuits ism excited to hear where it might evolve and future still i and frankly just for being you because it is clear that of your enthusiasm your curiosity and your generosity with useful information is is immense thank you ever much that is it is gracious and kind to you to say under and i these these conversations the one we just had meg the it is why i do the work it is much fun and interesting an you've giving me much feed for thought it really was a conversation not an interview and that such a gift and i just feel gratitude that i can share i you my body o work and and all the

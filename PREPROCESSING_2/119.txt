prosecutors are now investigating melon musk over a legally building a house with tesla sons you'll true pledges to rescue democrats if are elected and much mayoral freesias up again ism ventured o this is the bench barrio show the benchmark showsponserbakspressve plan at tug you them every single show by hen gonovi planet get etas pressie plan right out expressvepiandi come flesh men hell another day another law suit this time looking into melon must it appears that if you are an enemy of the prevailing regime they will come after you with all of the elements at their disposable you're if you're dona trump they will come after you with the federal government with various state in local governments they will come after you because you have become an enemy of the regime in dona trump said and he is not in correct that fort thirty forty years he was in the america public lie one of those famous people on earth there ware no prosecutions and then he leaves the presidency and boom within three years that there are four prosecutions all to be hitting within an election year an that leaves aside the civil suits that of all arisen in the last two years that does mistime a coincidence now can always attribute that to his behavior on gentry six are between nonmember and canary but the reality remains the domaltrum hes pretty wild and crazy character well before that when it comes to some of the supposed financial crimes that he is now being accused of those financial issues were well known for a very long time yet he never found himself in the dock he never found himself in front of the public this way will melon musk is in the same boat now a in last month there's been two in investigations by the federal government launched in to companies related to melon musk just last week the justice department sued space acts for discriminating against as leas and refugees an hiring claiming that space had to her more people who had claims asylum tpeoplewho claim refuge status in the united states despite the factual as melon musk claims spasms has national security contracts the means that they have very high standards for security and they we sort of damned if they did an damned if they did not if they started hiring people who are blaming asylum or refuge status end then it turns out on most people ore security risk they could lose their security clarence and presumably hundreds of millions o dollars and contracts and if it did not hire those people then the do j would so them and that is exactly what happened last week a cording to assistants to turning general prison clerk of the of civil rights division our in investigation found that spaces failed tho fairly consider or her as weasand refugees because of their citizenship status tan imposed what amounted to a ban on their hie regardless of their qualification and violation of federal law our in investigation also found that spaces recruiters and highlevel officials took actions that actively discouraged o silvas and refugees from seeking work opportunities at the company as weasand refugees have overcome many obstacles in their lives and on lawful employment discrimination based on their citizenship state should not be one of them this looks a put up jobs from the outset look a put up job directed at melon musk and now one week later we are learning that prosecutors are now investigating tesla for use of fun on a project described internally as a house for we melon musk according tote lost journal man rattan federal prosecutors are investigating teslas use of company fun on a secret project that had been described internally as a house for melon musk the us attorney's office for festoon why has sought information bout personal benefits paid to ask how much useless sense on the project which called for a spacious glass structure to be built in busting texts and what it was for the waster journal was the first report italy that tessleboard members had investigated whether company resources were miss used on the secret effort known internally as project forty two and wether muskrats personally involved the outcome of testes internal investigation cannot be learned the es c has also open a civil investigation into project forty two and is seeking similar information from the company according to one of those peoples well here that thing the sign why and es c investigations there still in their early station they might not lead to formal allegations of wrongdoing yet magically all the founts way into the newspaper why look at at all of it is on the frontage the holster journal to day tesla did not response request for comments on the story spokesman for the es c and manhattan es attorney's office to clinedto common employes were working on project forty two last year plans called for glass building to be erected near the automakers busting area head quarters and one point the building was invitation in the shape of a twisted hexagon other images showed an expand of glass box that appeared to include a resodunchal area the status of the project an whether glass was ever delivered tesla could not be learned federal prosecutors are you seeking information also about the driving range of teslas electric vehicles writers is reporting that tesla had inflated the projected distant its vehicles could travel on a single battery charge it just seems all of the re sources of the federal investigative authorities are being unleashed at upon musk now why is that just a few years go melon musk was everybody's darling melon musk had early mark zukerberg status melon musk was the most creative man in the world one often great innovators and then he bought twitter and hen it turns out that he has sort of rightist libertarian political leanings and this cannot be allowed melon musk stepped into the hornet's nest and the hornet's nest is now stinging him that is what it appears to nylon from the outside because again nothing for years with regard to melon musk and then magically the year before the election two separate investigations into upon masks companies won't is based won it tesla either you believe that on musk suddenly started being corrupt and terrible or you believe that the are people who actually would to we on us takin out or leas minimized in terms of his public abilities when when people on the right are worried about aware when they are woriedabout the militarization of law enforcement resources the d o j local attorney's offices against right wingers this is one of the reasons why in have set on the program publicly for years i overpay my taxes over pay my taxis specifically because i suspect that this is alwaysben the casein that it will always be the case that if there some one in power who does not you there is absolutely the possibility that they an upcoming after you the problem of course is that it is the exactly the sort of activity that destroys all faith in our institutions in f we do not have our institutions an common then we cannot have a functioning system here in the united states north's bleeding its way over not just from the private

make the switch my sulphone company oka when we talk about legal apparatuses being activated against particular sides of the political isle take a look and what is now being contemplated with regard to primary and general elections and dona trump according to the our times new hamsters first in the nation primary is quickly becoming the leading edge for an unproven legal theory that donate trump is disqualified from a during on the ballot under the fourteenth amendment to the us constitution a long cook presidential candidate has filed the lawsuit in state court seeking an injunction to keep trump off the ball a formal republican candidate for sent is urging the secretary of state to bring a case that could put the issue before the o supreme court on wednesday free speech for the people a liberal leaning group that unsuccessfully tried to strike house republicans from the ballot in twenty twenty two sent a letter to secretaries of state in new hampturas whiles florin to mexico oho in is cousin urging them to bar trump from the ballot under the fourteenth moment tho outfortar i playing a theory that has been getting traction among liberals and ant ha from conservatives that trumps actions on canary sixth twenty twenty one disqualify him under section three of the fourteenth amendment which pars people from holding office if they to an oath to support the constitution and then later quit engaged an insurrection or rebellion against the same well normally you would have have a conviction for something that say you sworn oath to a for power the confederate states of america right that might be good evidence that you should be barred from he ballot that is literally why the all was written that is why section the of the fourteenth amendment exists it does not exist to do a last secretaries of state to simply to car somebody an enemy of the republic and then bar him from the ballot according to the you times the theory as been getting momentum since prominent conservative law professors publish an article this month concluding trumpets constitutionally dis qualified from running for office well the left which is to appeal is oltoway to supreme court why because of the supreme court rules in from favor then they will disclaim that the supreme sort is stacked on behalf of dona trump under my sing the credibility of that institution and again this is now being considered by cultural secretaries of state not just in the primaries bun the general election as well according to national review a recent article publish in the pensylvania late of you from the federals societies willing bowed and michael stokes parson argues that trump has been disqualified from access to the presidential ballot re based on their reading of the fourteen the amendment the authors believe that their theory is self executing by which they manual selection officials do not need to see permission or special authority to bar true from the ballad indeed their oaths oblige them not to dona true mad the case that migtpense could unilaterally disqualified states certified state votes in the two thousand twenty election nous a specious theory this theory is that secretaries of state can simply decide without any reference point without any legal case without any actual conviction without any charges being filed theoretically that somebody has violated this element of the constitution and therefore can be barred constitutionally from appearing on the ballet this is pretty crazy stuff obviously n you art tug about undermining faith an elections this would do it you on constitutional crisis have to when a secretary of state insane arizona besides that dona trump cannot be on the ballet and then that goes to the supreme court and then thesrimcourt strikes that down that is a constitutional crisis because of that point you have a state acting within its own preview but violating basic precepts of constitutional order thing struck down by supreme court on which three members were appointed by the person who is at issue the left will claim that it is aware the rightwill claim that it is aware mean this is where we are headed it is really really ugly and s what we now have is a bazar situation in which the left claims that bemuses the right is clinquant insurrectionary they can use the law in extra legal ways that is what is effectively happening right here this is why the use of the laws gutter trump over a bunch of nonsense inlay manhattan is devastating to rule of law a politico today has the new york a g claiming that dona trump fraudulently in floated his noteworthy by as much as two point two billion dollars per year the new estimates came in filings from the york state attorning general's office which is suing trump some of his adult children and his business empire for falsifying his not worth in an effort to obtain at favorable terms from banks and insurance company that trial is said to be in on october second now one of the things that is pretty obvious here is that none of those company is are actually suing trump is a criminal prosecution that are a civil trial that is being brought to bear by the state on behalf in turns companies who are not suing him again aware being used to go after dona trump and what your getting here is a self perpetuating cycle where the left sense the right as inherently evil and dangerous an insurrectionist then we must use the legal abilities that are disposal to go after them we must use the located glue for plan musk that is a dangerous character that o might alow things on water that we do not an if those things are allowed on twitter then dona trump might win an election or decide might lose an election we better use whatever legal methods we caveat our disposal to go after buckeye dona trump superdangerous that means hate have to a pirates secretaries of state to do things theatre pretty illegal but they have sort of the petting of legality to them in order to accomplish what we waw and e we really really hate dona trips or one one things we have to do as we have to go after i on specious bullyrag charges in new york its it is it is morally mandated because the right is dangerous and reactionary and insurrectionist and the natural responds from the right is well case your doing extra legal things with the law which means they are acting illegally which justifies us in going outside the law to do things a mean every revolution starts of the claim that the power is that be are engaging extra legal activity under color of law it there is every revolution now ism not calling for that revolution i think that there is a a weapons down here but this is what we are quickly spiraling towards were quickly spiraling towards the belief on the part of the right that the left his milk torose the entire justice departments of the united states as well as the lot of local justice departments secretaries of states office an all the rest against the rights and therefore the right is justified in doing whatever it can to stop that and then the left looks at that they say what a you got down you doing all the stuff that is extra legal ell that justifies us in stopping you no matter what it takes with or without the law it is a self perpetuating cycle and the is something even worse about this which is that the positions reverse themselves depending on the circumstance ill get to that in just one second first everybody knows it let my helix sleep mattress is youknow that just launch their newest most high and collection he lick leet i got the didn't appreciate my helix sleep mattress e enough and i precept a lot until last night's last night mi daughter came down who not three fever which men is sleeping in her room you not i could not take with me my heck sleep mattress as its in my room sure that i was on the floor on a yoga mat sleeping next to my daughter to make sure that she was oka let me tell a not a great

of labor day helix is offering twenty five presents off all mattress ores and two free pillows frunalessers go to relic sleep dot comslesh men reuse cot helices partner twenty five it is the best offer yet he will not last long with heck's better sleep starts right now okay when i say the situations can reverses i mean that the natural dynamic right now is that the left because it is in control of the law is using the law is a weapon and the right because it is not in control of the law is bucking the law right that seems to be the generalized perception it's you feed on each other the right is bucking the loss lefts as we have to use the law another the rights as left is using the loss we have to buck the law such a complete cycle but here is the thing here is t w that it is not just a battle over institutional credibility at the left wants to say is the right they are not there not being extra legal because we are misusing the law they are being extra legal because they do not care about the law they are ben extra legal because the law does not matter to them at all the laws the institutions that they want tear down the institutions they are the ones are destructive forces in america life we are here standing for the institutions but we know that is not true because when the left is not in control of illegal body they attack the legal body with just as much alacrity as they weredefending it literally one second ago for example dona trump yesterday he was on with ably glen back and that you was ask about producing democrats is president and he said well yah i mean their prosecuting me here is what a town you said in in twenty sixteen a locker up and then when you became present you said we do not do that in america that is just not the right thing to do that is what they are doing do you regret not locking her up and if you are president again will you lock people up we i example i the a e e i e doing it at i always hat e e see oi the president e president and at tat the oft e the president and i never i i e hate i could have and en i e a on t e and wit him that is doing it ye i do not think you ta the think about much okay the entire left when insane tonal trump pledging to lock up his political opponents and he now be crazy if you wins the office ante he uses the goals who caponized the ja against his political opponents that is just terrible that is unthinkable and we would have to resort to extra legal means to stop all of that we would have to do someone in the street to man riots we would have to stop that thing because the tyrant would be taking over that he exactly do you think that the wright is arguing right now about hoiden and his mere and mericarlands deejay they're coning sweetheart deals with jordan son sweet ordeals that are sweethardish that he judge literally saw it blanched and was note not interested andtheyhad to go back to the drawing board meanwhile they are going after trump for every jot and tent including charges the do not even fit when it comes o the manor sixth case they're letting killer clittenoughsgot free but they are going after tonal trump and can foremen is good right now for the left but if don trump takes over lawnforcement immediately comes bad the ganja turns into a caponized evil law enforcement than must be bucks it every opportunity and then the positions reverse then it is the left this insurrectionist against the institutions and the right that is defending the institutions as as viable and durable and necessary you can see it to day an politico entire opinion piece from errand tang a law professor a you we dais and a former lawclerk to sonic to mayor was a belittle the supreme court is infected with the most damaging human bus he says the biggest rob it the partisanship diagnosis is that the sprimcourt has alwaysbeen part of the politics not about it most important love justice in our history john marshal is a federals party operative these historical periods o just that if partisanship alone were enough to torpedo public legitimacy the supreme court never would have rises woes prominent place in america society what really is different and dangerous about today's justice it is not partisanship the rather a coolant of trap then bell prizewenningpsychologist dance conman is called the most damaging of all human braces over confidence put simply to day's justice is possess a frightening degree of certainty they alone can answer society's most pressing probe with just the right lawyerly arguments or now you have the left than on argument tat the right always made for generations the argument the right made was who gave the supreme court the power to simply declare abortion on demand the law of the land who give hem the power to do that who give the supreme court the power to simply declare that game marriage was the law of the land an shrine in the america constitution who gave them the power to do that they men covered him that power now the left is making exactly the same arguments about the people we are on the prime court now now love claim that this was undermining legitimacy the supreme court that if you if you said roversuuated in illegitimate decision because it is if you said that base not on your dis respect for the court round your respect for the rule of law if you said that they claimed your basically an insurrectionist you are trying to overthrow the the legitimacy of thesuprime court and undermine it is credibility then the constituents y of the court shifts and the the positions entirely flip they entirely flip what is that mean it means that basically the only thing that matters is who controls the various institutions it is all just a power gave it all just ta pagan now this is really dangerous territory it is really dangerous territory because what it suggests its that if you lose an election ad if the only thing the matters it is who controls the government and that you automatically believe the institution is illegitimate the other party controls the government for example we do not have any institutions in common and it is only a question of how badly some one to oxgeteds good before thingstart to get really bloody and ugly and violent it is a serious probing happening by the way all cross the lest is not unique to the united states in western countries all over the world there is now a feeling that is arising that because the institutions have failed for because the institutions are caponized by your political opposition the you can do whatever you want and the dis tat by the wight that is not a right left thing because the left will do the same thing as the right if they are out of power when the right is out when the right is in power in brazil it is tyranny afoot and insurrection in the streets is the only thing can stop yeaterables narrow and when it is hula the solve in power and he is actively using the supreme court as his tool and and breaking the rule of law there then it is the rows thee the right to saying its an insurrection the we have to be in the straits an woe run of a choice once every election becomes a matter of tyranny versus liberty and there is no clear definition of these things things are about to get very very ugly the fight over institutions as it turns out is not over about institutional credibility no one respects the institutions right once the institution is only good if you are one in control of it it is not a god institution any more if the police are only good if your friends are in the police and f somebody do not know in the police the police are bad now then you do not respect the police qua police just respect your friends if you arerespect for the america government is reliant on it being staff by people will gree with you what that really means that the peoplewho disagree with you are dangerous and out of bounds that the institution becomes fundamentally illegitimate because it is staff by those people which means we soft have a prove with institutions in the united states never prom with each other now irn'ni should believe that america it large have prom with each other i think the fleets really of a prom with each other and i this there caponizing institutions against each other for fun and profit i thing you go every day america and most america they soft about the stuff this just one a go about their daily business be left alone raise their families go to church go to their work that is about it but they are people at the top the have a real interest ins it in in essentially saying that if they l if your side loses the country is irrevocably broken and there we will not be for example another election and by the way it is both the right left sangthes we going on the nestucions likhelyuhave the right saying that if join winds election the countries over and you've the left saying that if don trumplinds re election the country is over that is not a good place to be in a second own get into what this what this sort of means how we can how can we get out of this conundrum this sort puzzle we have printed for ourselves first went when you buy a house you look at the house you try to fix some things up bound and n paint job fix the doors whatever but there is something you nobly nothing about all that much an that is the stuff covering the windows an men that suss been the forever would but how light flows into a house is a huge thing natural light is one the reasons that we bought our house for example it also meant that we wanted to up grade the window coveringsand this we we had it on over to blindstory come blindstory come is the umber one on mine retailer of custom window coverings with over forty thousand five stare of virus you can measure an in sunlit yourself or have linstock come take care of it with local professionals there is do show room no retell markets no mater how many order installations just one low cost if

blindstory comes liberty sail it is their biggest salver to fifty per cent right now a blindstory comment check out on line do not forgets telling you herd about blindstory come from the kinship yerosho rules and restrictions may supply hays what is this mean what is the future of the united states look what first we have to fix the social fabric if we do not fix the social fabric the institutions are relevant institutions are usually only effective if they govern with lighthand when the social fabric fails institutions have to come in with a heavier hand and then they are not good at it another people get angry t each other and they blame the institutions for the actual failure of the social fabric generally institutions get tyranny grows as social fabric fails for to take an example the place for social fabric is the is the most durable the tightest is between you an the other members your family you generally do not need a third party barber a coming in and is indicating fights been you members infant you resent it if a third party armorer comes in an starts messing around in your families business why as the social fab rid is tight well if things start to fall apart that when you have to have or protective services show up or divorce lawyer show up and things are to get really ugly and the more there involve the uglier they get now that is true on a social level is well as we failed to get along with each other ore as we felt to respect each other as human beings we start calling in the big guys to come in in in force are opinion with the gun this is why as societies fail institutions have to get more and more tyrannical they do not really have i choice there two ways that societies go south with regard to societies an institution and their interrelationship one is the way that i just described the social fabric decays and then the institutions follow you haven't argument that that is effectively what is happen in the united states that since the nineteen sixties with the rise of a radical left that overthrow the social compact than instead of saying we required change with in that boundaries of the social compacts have the entire social compact is corrupt and evil and nasty and a guise for power we have to throw it out that it was no longer a fight between j f cay liberals and eonian can sedatives that now the fight was between revolutionaries thought the entire system as corrupt that er bermarcu's argument they t the basic idea that all institutions including freedom of speech where actually guises for power that once that corrupted are institutions and took a couple generations to do it once those confuse throughout our institutions then the failures of the social fabric were made manifest people stop going to church which was that social fabric builder people stopped believing one another and their arguments their arguments they started to think where actually just an excuse for you to do the thing you want do anyway ad when you would have a good faith argument there's no such thing as good faith argument any more it was basely just accusations once that stuff made its wake to the institutions of course the institutions fails that is one way that societies fail that institutions fail after societies there is one other way and it is possible this also happen in the united states and that is that institutions can cause social fabric to decay how do institutions cause social fabric to decay well what what happens the least in a society gain control of an institution and they decide it is time for world breaking change they have to centralize power that power is now going to be used in top down fashion in order to crowd out the social fabric because people need to change and the current social fabric that is created fraud people get rid o that social fabric create we circumstances and the people will flourish and flower anew that sort of the case that marks ism makes is that people are petty and nasty to one another but if we live in a marks is utopia people be assume all we have to do is changed the superstructure and suddenly the people themselves change institutions captured but elects start to try to cram down change on people at the top level and in doing they must break down the social fabric it is necessary because the social fabric are little platoons against that as hat been work describe them now n a good functioning society uses the social fabric and and the little platoons within the social fabric as the building blocks for a broader society a terrible society must in you utopian fashion destroy all those building blocks level the earth and then build with whatever is left and that is effectively what you can make argument happen with america institution particular in the sixties the growth of government effectively crowded out religion it effectively crowded out the social fabric it it crowded out all f the connections tat you have with your friends announce all been filled by the government and then the social fabric fails and then the call from the government is whale the social fabric failing we need more government and the government fails at that but t still crowd out the social fabric and out all all faith in institutions is lost whichever those arguments you accept one thing is for car true if what we have here is not a failure of institutions predominantly but a failure of the social fabric this can only be fixed at the local level through the rebuilding of the social fabric what that really means that w what we ought to be fighting for an it is funny because when you discuss this with rational members of the opposite political party many of them will agree i have this conversation open with anicasparian from the untuck for example and i got her to agree ins are broad strokes the what we really need to do wit the federal government is minimize it the when you hae a federal government that institutional is incredibly powerful and everybody's just fighting over the power in order to use it against their to political opponents this exasformates the collapse of the social fabric what you really need is local communities to be able to be local communities the what you cannot do is make the argument that the best form of america institution making is going to be done at the top level because it is not it is not by the way the founders understood this which is why they made the federal government really weak comparatively speaking the federal government was very very weak not just even even after the transformation from the articles of confederations the constitution that is a weak federal government and the truth is that it it is only weak top down structures that it have been able to preside over large populations one of the great lies about empires for example is that empires ten to be incredibly onerous that ten to be tragical the in your business all the time at the lowest level not durable ones they are if you'll get ta history of empires and the united states is an empire now ism not room judgment a international empire just by any stretch of the imagination a government that governs three hundred and forty million people over a the course of three thousand horizontal miles and another fifteen hundred vertical miles and in your talking about a land area in the united states that is continental in nature means enormous that would be by any stretch of the imagination an empire just domestically an empire i all the states of de countries theoretically and the united states would effectively be a domestic empire it is just o big aren't governing a tiny spates great brain or something and youenot governing homogenies spaces either the united states incredibly diverse ay the only way that that succeeds is if the top level is relatively light handed and every durable empire ever has actually had a relatively light hand of the top level the great lie about the roman empire for example is that the roman empire was unbelievably owners to people in the outskirts of the empire is not true the roman empire could be owners if youreabut against them they wore come in their crush you with an iron heel but if you are not rebelling against them they're actually relatively decentralized the great lie about the roman empire again as there is a highly centralized empire was not if you are living in the middle east for much of the time of the roman empire you are basically living under manage a local potent ate very often the roman were negotiating with you to appoint somebody who might be slightly friendlier to you and that is why the roman empire could last for hundreds of years if you look at at other less powerful empires for example the rostra vulgarian empire the onto vulgarian empire which start off to the hapsberg monarchy and was an empire that dominated in incredible amount of rope that the maestro monarchy which launchisin the sixteenth century and then last the the rostra vulgarian empire all the way up to world were one the reason that it was able to to govern this amount of territory with this divers o population is because it actually had a very very light hand it was it was actually more visible by its absence than by its presents they had can have unified military uniforms in uts kina it we the there a lot of people inside the rostra vulgarian empire arranging from news to museums to orthodox christian to calf legs to protestants and they are all living under the ostrangaran empire cs the onto vulgarian empire actually had a fairly o fairly decentralized approach to governments the same thing was true actually for a lot of the ottoman empire the room empire was conning lazy empire it why by the time it died at in in world were one just after world were one is called the sick old man c isn't even capable of governing its own territory now lot people see that as a flaw but the reality is that the only way that you can retain any sort of centralization at all in a very very large space is either oppressive tyranny at high levels which cannot be done for long is what the issue are learned or you can have to have relative the centralization the probe is the united states my now is noted the centralized empire the united states my now domestically is a very very centralized empire wen we are spending seven trillion dollars a year we are engaged at the federal level in everything from how much what you have n your toilets to which individuals should be put in jail that this is a very not centra and and to what that is doing is is exacerbating all of the social conflict that already royals under the surface it used to be the people in californium nearly care about what people in florid were doing an those people in fluoride really care about what people in new york were don can lam that on social media or we can playpen on the fact the virtually all policy making has now been elevated to the federal level and not only that a huge percent o tat policy making is made by unelected metric rats who are staffed through unofficial political patronage networks the only to pure that is to minimize that power the top level that people go back to doing exactly what they would to do in their own local communities that can only happen ironically if you have enough trust freer fellow america that you are willing to allow them to do that and if the answer to that is know it is hard to see how the country maintains that is why all the aware that were seeing right now is is incredibly dangerous me what we were a dangerous moment in the united states just system systemically speaking is a dangerous moment for the system of the united states is very few people have any baseline faith in the system itself which byway is again another irony because the fact is the system itself actually the cons two signal system as direct about t founders actually justified itself in twenty twenty fall the talk about how amebic was on the virga to being overthrown in twenty twenty by canaries six the rioters who was not even closes it was not even remotely clothes the system prove

enemies inside the republican party yesterday he posted some thirty one times on truth social dozens of videos a us wen higher with the camera and do pretty much none of them were about jobidin as a president he made one video i think the twelve of in to the twenty twenty four election and the rest of them were just attacking people on his own side which is not the way that you actually win an election as it turns out ism for example dona trump spent yest day fulminating once with social about the evils of bill bar on fox news why dos fox news constantly put on slow thinking in lethargic bill bar who did not have the courage or stamina to fight the radical left learnatics while he ways the attorney general of the united states and who even more portly refused to fight election fraud of which the was much he knew always going on just look at his past remarks unless fox news starts putting on the right people the readings will continue to a road it is his personal grievance after personal grievance o first of all calling bill bar in combat things coming slow thinking is a weird one considering that he went colombia in gorge washington in such o cay then but that not just that fox news s apparently very cruel and terrible i he he then went out for super murder who was once one of his supporters fox news and the wallstree journal fight me because murder is a goblins that is i report burdock is at loyalist yo do not know that and i am america first it is very simple i put america first et will always be that way get used to it the sanctimonious by the way is done he was a burdock pick just a we bush was a burdock pick out of that work out just killer little burdock tiller can crooked killer and that was another pick of burdock now we are about america first and some people do not that the wall street journal is totally lost its way can you fellows independent voters flying into the party hen feel it he fellows burden ladies who are now wishing their votes back from biding to its he don't trump because of these idiots oh and also he had om notes about losing georgia a gent wasn't you want o pick the say for nomen be it but ism just wanting out this will be the campaign you think this whistle a successful general watching campaign who cay i easily on the great state of gorge in twenty sixteen did a fantastic gob as president for gorge and the attire you have say receive ten million more votes than i got nation wide and twenty sixteen got by for the most votes and history for i sitting president but shockingly lost georgia all this despite winning near by albata and south caroling in record setting landlines why did georgia officials agree to sign that horrible one sided consenticry nobody to this day has figured that out does anybody really believe i lost georgia because i do not o gay now i assume that he is also saying that be cause if he does not claim that he that he on georgia than he also loses his legal case in georgia entire basis for legal case in gorge s that he knew he wast and then manipulated the system to try and essentially steal the state if he continues to claim that he absolutely believes it maybe does ma be abbot down's from has need capacity to make himself believe nearly anything or it the very leas odn'thimg to care very much about whether it is true or whether it is not o say far off he is establishing motive in legal case there but i just i keep asking because i want in answer from somebody how does this translation a general electro victory now again you can hope that hoiden just falls down on the job it is quite possible he good why not but if that is let you if you are playing a game where your best hopes that the other guy basically dies that is not the best move the could job possibly make and again he is folksong all of his i in the wrong places jobidon is busy being a terrible president how about that but roll organ get more i here horizon from going aft for the quonqua pretenders to the throne the debt on fosters had a hard time with the proverbial ratings in to televisionratings parents all about the ratings it was one of the lowest ever rated in terms of debates if not the lowest it showed that many of those participating are second tear they were second you people people christy and people at i cellmate at hutches and merely pretenders to the throne they just pretenders to the throw these aren't presidential people these are presidential talents yes the yes we wore yes this this will win arizona georgia pennsylvania michigan was cousin yep that that a there by the way speaking of a losing arizona ism old enough remember because i am a more than eight years old ism old enough remember a time when when when arizona was completely reader had a red governor and two red sensors now you may have thought that the centers were squishes that is true eff lake and john mica ware squishes there so better than carton son moon markedly well apparently the prison re publican party is a deciding that the them louis method electioneering is probably the best way to go now blame masters is going to run against carry lake is the new is the new idea for the get pe senate race against carton cinema great the best that arizona can come up with further senate race is going to be two of the three candidates who lost their last election cycles in arizona that is right the in last election cycle we had care loose for governors to catyhobs ay went to shag an we had blame masters lose his race two mar kelly who is extremely vulnerable and now the two of them are gin ta face off for the opportunity to run against carton cinema o goody goody gumdrops good that this seems this seems the sill go well by least we will feel good yelling at the wall probably and meanwhile speaking of things that that are quite terrible mite ma coal froze up again it was actually it is getting quite frightening at this point he is any one years all is the second time in the passion i that he from up for thirty solid seconds who speakings the media and a it is it is really hard a hereby was you i is you here was theater rain a repay n in fin faith a far o war o cade that is som that is awful to watch e lot of senators are a world about is personal health as they should be he he then held calls with allies including my sordid but john then conference church on brass and center john corban of texts of them are potential successors to my call is led to a spate of speculation over his health lot a talk about whether the are some sort of brain problem or whether this parkinsons that is one of these speculations that been put out because nobody seems particularly alarmed about this which means maybe hardly has a prior diagnosis ironically jobidon is out they are saying it'll get in touch with him i mean honestly the i wish that the media dedicated one tenth the amount of true worry they have about my call to hoiden but were told the jobidon is very and with it r leeway i just heard later coming now win is a friend i yo know not yo we not o know yo ow we that teas wo we and dish gets w we ms o go free en i no then on to o now we i a on none don't know not to now orcas some again the media basically suggested my call has to step down they think o taxi tough to keep running for president my coals at one that is eighty i thou down from he seventy eight at a certain point maybe we ought to get somebody who i is below retirement age to run for the presidency o cane meanwhile it turns out there are still people in this country who are a somewhat capable at their jobs ronasantis has been presiding or lord during hurricane ideal thank god hurricane ideal is seems to have done lest human damage then many of the prior hurricanes of its magnitude it is already passed on to georgia turning to a tropical storm i discants yesterday he was morning alters he said basically guys your yearn flora you try looting after hurricane and on do at your own parents there are reports of people trying to but i down in seen achy and have told all of our person help the state level i o you you protect people's property and and were not in a tolerate any losing in the after math of the natural disaster i made it just ridiculous that you would try to do something that on the heels of an almost category for hurricane hitting this community it'd also just reign potential lovers that people you never know whit you are walking into people of a right to defend their property i this part of florid you got a lot of advocates and proponents of the second amendment and have seen signs and different peoples yards in the past after these disasters and i would says property here you but we shoot this is the best around a mantis riwentman he is been governor this again why he would make a good president he is actually good at the actual job he was asked by report about dona trump in the fact the trump his spent effectively little brain power on then the hurricane in florid he was used tweeting a lot pay lot of truth socials whatever to tennis however gives the proper answer which is why you ask me about this ism busy being governor no my concern my con corn as protect an that people of a florid being ready to go and and we have done that and luck we dining florist you you just have to do this om this is something we put a lot of time an effort in to throughout the course of of each year knowing that that there is get a be time where your can have to activated a that up happens to be an excellent response to all of this mean while left of courses is using this as excuse to talk about climate change cause what is not in excuse about climate change mean honestly s you'll have one note titterscon a keeping it over never here was drobidon yesterday blaming that do because there is a hurricane no one can deny the climate crises any more which is weird since there are ben hurricanes for literally all documented history i leech governor i spoke wit no i is anything anything takes the a now i really mobilize that port indeed do not be anybody can deny the a of the climate case is any fortis took around start lo me tor lo moreintense rounds extreme he significant while i to significant dames i we never we be for not you the wine island ye non says they can another parts o the world by the way it is bad he said that one time is kitchen got set on fire not getting hidden again in that esamesac press conference his time i lamina and he mentioned again that his kitchen got set on fire one time he is just he is he is the best i can time for some things i in mhnsonethings that i hate things that i to a is i mentioned earlier the rare benshbiro show reference to the rostra vulgarian empire i if you are interested in learning about any of that sort of stuff i have the recommend job miccanawskys new book good by eastern rope an intimate history of a divided land it is it is really worth the reed excellent book a basically trace is the history of eastern rope l you so be called eastern rope from essentially the dark ages local damages up until modern times and and looks it at the fact that a lot of borders were sort o drawn post fact o changed a lot if he will get a map of rope in twelve hundred looks completely different thin the map of rope to day it is shifted it is moved a lot of times populations have shifted moved and and there is some valuable lessons to be learned in the history of eastern rope about how empires fall part about how nationalist rises about the costs of population transitions and all the rest of it i definitely work three job mac canawskiys good by eastern at rope ilk gate time for a couple of things that i hate already the californium turning general bone is now suing a school district over what he calls it outing policy what exactly is that policy while the policy is that if a child comes to you at school and expresses genera confusion rather than secretly transitioning them at school and calling them by a name of the opposite sax and allowing them to dress up as member of the opposite sexton closet ours post calmomadad this apparently is not allowed in californium here is i hers the story a turn general robbed as the policy recurring a school to deschoos tugengrad enemy with out their permission which students in danger by holding them to their own parents i refuse the stand by and allow canal valley or any district word of education to put our children at risk or infringe upon their rights specially not one of our most vulnerable a risk groups for the artist from their parents that is the baseline assumption the base let assumption is that course of parent a risks your trial the are b teacher from the america federation of teachers who is encouraging billy to can himself jane and get in that dress while i watch to i that that is that is a child that is a child being protected according to the state of californium s now school districts are going to be presumably sued if they disclosed to parents that their kids ore acting in actually or genera confused ways because the parents ore the enemy when i talked about leveling all of the little planes all the small social institutions that a should provide the basis for function in society this is what that looks when the state says that you as the parent are the threat it your child we is outsiders are not threats as we convince your trial to engage further in genera confusion that will rest their life we are the actual we are the saviors non in about threatening and violative

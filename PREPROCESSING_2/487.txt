welcome to the supermen lposcience science to i may index supermen and of a professor of neurology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an a in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast the reason i started taking athletic greens on treason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of date and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if we're getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar a talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do cam slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you wan a try element you can go to element element do come slash superman this month on the supermen lab podcast were ta king all about hormones these incredible chemicals that can impact our mood our behavior our feelings of optimism or pessimism the amazing thing about hormones is that hormones impact all those things but all those things how we feel and what we do and what we think also can impact our hormones and it is a really fascinating area of biology that impacts every single one of us every day both in wakefulness and in sleep and throughout the life span to day we are going to be talking about hormone optimization and we are mainly going to be focusing on estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives last episode of the superman lad podcast we talked about sexual development that is how the cromornes the gonads and hormones impact what we call sexual development leading all the way up to puberty to day we are mainly going to talk about processes that happen from purity onward although we might talk a little it about development as well today we are going to talk a lot about basic biology but we are going to heaven a lot of practical tools along the way for how to optimize these incredibly powerful things that we call hormones before we dive into our discussion about hormone optimization one raise what i think is a very important point that at least i had not heard of until recently which is the concept of saluted genesis many of us are familiar with the concept of pathogenesis the idea that there are all these scary diseases dementia and heart disease and stroke and all these things that await us if we do not take good care of ourselves and that might await us even if we do that is the pathogenic model salt a genesis is something i learned about from one of my semaphored medicine colleagues which is a different orientation toward health and well being where you are taking on particular behaviors you are taking on a particular stands towards nutrition and exercise supplementation et camera in order to promote well being above where you would be if you were not doing those behaviors of you think about there is two things salutagenesis and the pathogenic model are really two sides of the same coin but it'll just give an example of how this might affect you in a real way if you exercise because it feels good great but many people exercise or eat well for that matter in order to avoid heart disease or to avoid dementia to avoid om negative changes in body composition and while that is powerful and certainly is the case that exercise will help you move away from all those things the salute genesis model differs in that it involves a mindsettin an orientation towards doing those things in order to feel good in order to enhance your level of energy in order to improve endegrane function and metabolic function it is really part of the pathogenic model and yet salt a genesis is really more of a mind set toward why you would do these particular behaviors in really the most powerful minds that is going to be one where you are thinking about the pathogenic model doing things that you do not and up sick et camera and to move away from sickness as well as the salutagenic model were you are doing things in order to move towards health and well being we think of health and wellness nowadays ore the wellness community or well ness practices and in many ways that is the essence of the salutogenic model but i found it very interesting to know that within the field of allopathic medicine these two models exist but we do not here about the salutogenic model quite as often sought something to keep in mind especially because of some of the mind set effects that were discussed in previous episodes ism not going to going to these in detail again right now but if you might recall from the episode on food and mood we talked about from these incredible studies that were done by a decorums group at stamford and others showing that if you tell people that the behavior that they're about to do in this case it was people cleaning up hotel rooms as that was their job if you tell them that it is good for them than you see much greater positive help effects than if they are not aware of that information that it is good for them we should really be thinking about not just moving away from disease and negative things but also we certain things are good for us because it is well established now from really good scientific studies that keeping in mind the positive effects of things can really have an outsized effect on well being right down to the lever level of our physiology let us talk about hormonoptimization today we arguing to talk about hormonoptimization in reference to estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives now estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives are what we call sex steroids now the sex steroids immediately call to mind secs for obvious reasons and steroids meaning anabolic steroids but i just want to emphasize that estrogen and teststron are present in everybody it is their ratios that determine their effects today we are going to talk about how you can optimize the ratios depending on your particular life goes because the ratio of estrogen and testosterone in every individual has profound influent on feelings of well being feelings of optimism feelings of anxiety or lack of anxiety on reproduction on sexual behavior independent of reproduction they are profoundly powerful molecules and we all make these molecules to some degree or another but there are also important behavioral tools supplementation tools as well as prescription drugs that can impact the ratios of testosterone and estrogen in really powerful ways coranto cover all of that i want o emphasize that when you hear sex steroids or steroid hormones most people think about anabolic steroids and of course anabolic steroids or derivatives of testosterone or testosterone itself and they are heavily used and abused in the sports community as well as outside the sports community but there of course are many steroids that are not anabolic stories that are also abused in sports today we are not talking about drugs and sports but i think that it carry such a heavy weight when people hear the word steroids they think about anabolic steroids while to day's discussion will certainly be relevant to physical performance in fact work an a talk about how specific types of exercise particular patterns of cold exposure as well as particular patterns believe a not of breathing can impact steroid hormones both estrogen and testosterone the discussion is not really gear towards performance in hangmen in sport although we will do an entire episode perhapsyou even entire month related to performance and handymen in physical enterprises one of the first things to understand if you want o optimize your hormones is where they come from there are lot of different glands in the body that produce hormones there is the pine gland some hormones are made in the hypothalamus hormones are made by the gonads the ovaries or the testes you have got the thyroid gland there are bunch of different glands that make these different hormones but when we are talking about the steroid hormones estrogen and testosterone the major sources are ovaries for estrogen and the testes for testosterone although the adrenals can also make testosterone now there also some enzymes enzymes are things that can change chemical composition and the enzymes that were gan o talk about today are the eromatases mainly the aromatizes convert testosterone intestrogen in a male for instance that has very high testosterone some of that is going to be converted in estrogen by bromates and aromatizes made by body fact is also made in the testes themselves not a people do not realize this but the testes actually have the capacity to manufacture estrogen and aromatizes it'll be it at low levels but this turns out to be important for optimizing hormone levels in males at later points and will discuss that it is important to note that there is a huge range in terms of the levels of hormones testosterone in estrogen between individuals and it actually occurs within individuals across the lifespan ism not en out throughout specific numbers of expecograms for desaleader et camera to day because that is can o very a lot it is gin a depend on with not your measuring in decagrams or anagrams and that sort of thing if you want to examine your hormones you should do that in conjunction with a medical doctor idelian and er chronologists can help you sort out that information but the important thing to know is that prepubescent females make very little estrogen and when we talk about estrogen we mainly talk about extra dial which is the most active form of estrogen in both males and females prpubesand females very low levels of estrogen during puberty levels of estrogen a k strobile basically skyrocket and then across the life span estrogen is going a very depending on the stage of the menstrual cycle but as one heads into menopause which typically takes place nowadays somewhere between age forty five and sixty levels of estrogen are going to drop and then postmen apes levels of estrogen are very low as well testosterone will fluctuate across the lifespan testosterone can be relatively low prep prepuberty in males during purity it is on a say rocket and then that current numbers are that it drop off at about a rate of one present per year although we are going to talk about some data that show that there is actually tremendous variation testosterone levels usually lot of examples of men in their nineties they're nineties who still have testosterone levels that mimic pubertal levels which is remarkable and speaks to the huge variation an testosterone levels across individuals let us talk about other sources of these hormones and then it will make clear what avenues you might want to take in order to optimize these hormones the other glands and tissues in the body that make these hormones testostrn and estrogen as i mention briefly are the adrenals the adrenals idea top the kidneys and the release of the steroid harmony from the adrenals in particular testosterone and some of its related a derivatives are mainly activated by competition let us talk about competition because it turns it out that competition is a powerful influence one the sextrorid hormones and the steroid harmony powerfully influence competition most people do not realize this but most males of a given mammalian species never get to reproduce in fact they never even get to have sects at all and we do not often think about that but testosterone plays a powerful roll and determining which members of a given species will get to reproduce which ones of that species that will actually get access to females and here ism not talk about human specifically but it is well known in species elephant seals in species ant lured animals and rams for instance that the higher levels of testosterone correlate with access to females now one interpretation of this is that the females are detecting which males have high testosterone and selecting them they are more receptive to them were gan a talk about receptivity for mating in a moment but it is actually more that the males that have higher testosterone forage further and will fight harder for the females and this is really interesting because there is very good evidence now that testosterone can reduce anxiety promote novelty seeking and promote competitive interactions and before you leap too far with this in your mind and think about all these human behaviors just stay with because there is a little bit of biology here that makes it all make sense and it turns out to be pretty simple we have a brain region call the emigdula in satin that just means salmon but the imigula's most famous for its role in fear we hear a lot about fear and the emigdula but that the imigulas really involved in threat detection it sets are thresholds for anxiety and what we consider scary or too much testosterone secreted from the gonads and elsewhere in the body bind ts to the imigdula and changes the threshold for stress have said before on previous versions of this podcast and on other podcast that testosterone has this incredible effect of making effort feel good but what i was really referring to is the fact that testosterone lower stress and anxiety in particular in males of a given species now this is important because we often think of testosterone as creating whatever masculinization or its vitalization or all these these terms are thrown around but what is it really doing when it comes to make choice and competition what its doing is its reducing the threshold for anxiety and undoing it selects individuals of a given species to push further been willing to suffer more om although it also produces pain have they also suffer less in pursuit of reproduction and females now it is well known in humans that both males and females who have elevated levels of testosterone will engage in more novelty seeking and i do want a point out that even individuals without testes have testosterone and pikes in teststron have similar effects regardless of whether not some one has ovaries or testes testosterone increases generally lead to more foraging more novelty seeking increases in libido and increase in desire to mate it is the case that increases in testosterone promote competitive and forging type behaviors in in humans and in nonhuman camels but it is also true that competition itself can increase androgen such as testosterone and repeat that competitive environments themselves can increase testostro now somepeople have come to the conclusion that if you win your testosterone goes up and if you lose your testosterone goes down and twosome extent that is true but that is not a direct effect on the gonads that sushi mediated by the noromodulator dopamine we talked about dopamine in the episode on motivation in drive and dopamine in testosterone have a remarkable interplay in the body dopamine is actually released in the brain in ways that has the pituitary this gland that sits over the roof or your mouth release certain hormones that then go on to promote the release of more testosterone and indeed winning promotes more dopamine and later more testosterone however in the short term just competing increases testosterone independent on whether or not you win or lose the shortversion of this is that competition increases testostro and this may be in ancient mechanism whereby the androgen such as testostrn are feeding back to encourage more competitive type behaviors because every species whether not your time out reproduction we other resorcealication is involved in competition not every individual of a species gets access to the same number of mates or the same quality of mates and this is true in both directions for males and females and everything in between just one to emphasize once more in case i went through it too quickly that increases in testosterone in females are also going to lead to increase in reproductive behavior seeking out reproductive behavior they increase libido in fact there is a particular phase of the menstrual cycle were testosterone peaks just before ovulation that on average leads female humans to seek out secs more than they would otherwise during their cycle and this is all by self report but this is also while measuring things testosterone estrogen ratios and forth its really interesting that a single molecule regardless of chromosome or onto background is increasing seeking of mates a cross individuals increasing desire to compete or willingness to compete and lowering the threshold for stars and anxiety its important to point out that while increases in testosterone promote seeking of mates and reproduction in both males and females in females its actually increases in estrogen that promote receptivity to made testosterone is driving the seeking of sex and estrogen is promoting the actual act of sects from female called receptivity conceptual receptivity in males its interesting to point out the testosterone is promoting seeking of sex but its also estrogen in males that is important for libido if estrogen levels are brought too low then men will completely lose their libido this is often not tostoster overlooked in the discussion about testosterone therapy and performance in hanging drugs people think that hyper androgenized individuals making people to have very high levels of androgen will have very high levels of libido and they will provided estrogen is available in sufficient ratios to match that testosterone its not simply the case that high levels of testosterone produce a lot of sex mating behavior and low levels of estrogen are good across the word u actually need both in both males an females its just that in females the testosterone levels are always going to be lower than the estrogen levels and in males the estrogen levels are always can be lower than testosterone levels testosterone promotes sex seeking behavior and the real question then is the sex itself promote testosterone and the answer is somewhat complicated but the short version is yes and as you recall sex has multiple stages there's the physical act of secs there's the seeking of sex and then theirs orgasm an ejaculation now its important ti distinguish between these because whether or not sex itself increases testosterone depends on whether or not the male ejaculates and this is very important understand because on a previous episode i mention how dopamine increases with sexual activity remember opening in testosterone tend to increase linearity with one another but then after ejaculation there is a release of protect and in placed an actually sets the refractory period in males during which he cannot have sex again and the duration of the refractory period will very tremendously depending on how much and how long that protect an release occurs i also described in a previous episode how some people take item and be sex on not suggest anyone do this but take item and be six in order to reduce protect in levels and thereby reduced the duration of the refractory period but getting at this question about testosterone and sexual behavior it is important to distinguished between these different phases of reproduction or reproductive behaviors there are study showing that sexual behavior itself can increase testosterone there was a study pulpshion two that an eleven from estonia at all e s c a s a this is the stuff of texboxes is on robbed these are quality studies showing that men who observe sex i guess this would be observing pornography will have slight increases in testosterone during the observation these yulactuay were were willing to have blood draws taken while watching pornography they had increases in teststroe that were very modest of about ten per sent whereas when people participated in see they actually did this study where people had blood draws and they had real see with their partners and they had seventy per cent increases in testosterone there are increases in testosterone that are quite significant during the physical act of see and far less during observing see now the question that i often get in fact as one of the questions hit get most open in the comments on you do i do not know why that is is whether or not ejaculation a just testosterone levels and it turns out there two studies that i could find that were quality studies on posed that address this that sexton ejaculation itself does not reduce toststrone levels although it will increase prolactin levels for the reasons the described a moment ago however abstinence for sex without ejaculation for a weak or more will increase testosterone levels up to four hundred per sent the answer is actually complicated it is not straightforward what it means is that sex itself increases testosterone however abstinence also increases testosterone even further its a new wants answer and i hope this is satisfactory noon intended to those of you that have been asking me what is the relationship between sexton ejaculation in testosterone and dopamine it is nuwwants and you have to understand that new ants if you want understand how certain behaviors impact hormones and how hormones impact those behaviors as i mention before in females testosterone also primes the motivation to seek out see and sex itself also increases testosterone but it also increases prolactin in both men and women see increases prolactin post sex it is just the way that the system works its that testosterone and doom in increase in the seeking out and the behavior of sex and than after sex prolactin levels go up there is kind of a quiescence the whole nervous system is promoted towards calm and this may actually have something to do with perbonding and the encouragement of individuals to spend more time together to exchange different smells and hormones and may be even hormones where you talk about hormones in a moment a few years ago there was a lot of excitement about the hormone d h e a which is mainly made by the adrenals d c a has been promoted as kind of a catchall for increasing testosterone in estrogen in males and females and indeed d c a will increase both testosterone and estrogen this is something be mindful of if you are thinking about taking d a or your taking d h a already d c a will increase both testosterone and estrogen and the extent to which it increases one or the other will depend on whether not your starting off with more estrogen than testosterone or whether not you starting out for the more testosterone than estrogen and whether not you have a lot of oromatace for individuals tat have a lot of a comatose being made by the testes or a body fact if you take d c a there is a good chance that a fair portion of that as can be shuttled towards estrogen production and not towards testosterone production whereas in individuals that have low levels of testosterone to begin with high levels of estrogen there is a good chance that the d is going to promote mainly estrogen production least that is what i could find from the research studies that i examined the way to thing about d c a it is a kind of global a promoter of the steroid hormones and its specific effects are going toad a little bit on where you started when they are not you have overs or testes just as there are behaviors that can increase testosterone their behaviors that can decrease testosterone and one of the most well characterized ones inhuman is becoming apparent expecting fathers have in almost fifty per cent decrease in testosterone levels both free and bound testosterone as well their cortical levels a stresthormone drop by almost threefold which is incredible and their strobile levels doubt there estrogen levels double expecting fathers many people have known put on additional body a ever one always thought that it is because their eating in parallel with their pregnant wife but it turns out that these effects of reduce testosterone increase estradiol and reduce cortical can all be explained by n increase in prolactin not just in humans but in other species is well when the male and female that species are expecting young they lay down more body fat the assumption is that this is to prepare for long nights of no sleep which occurs in many species not just in humans that's really interesting that this hormone prolactin can start suppressing whole categories of hormone steroid hormones and can start increasing whole categories of other ones we here about the dad bod their lot of explanations for the daubed that extend well beyond this podcast episode but it is a well known phenomenon that testosterone is gun a drop prolactin can increase straddles can increase in males and females that are expecting children now how long that lass is very interesting actually has to do with how much contact and how much contact with the smells of the baby of the offspring the father happens to have how available or unavailable he is will actually impact his level of hormones now i am defile not promoting the idea that fathers or mothers take time away from their offspring in order to keep their testosterone levels higher to restore them not on i saying at all it is just interesting to point out that these evolutionary mechanisms pushes toward or basis toward particular categories of behaviors by influencing our hormones which then feed back and promote more of that particular behavior because as i mention before peaks and testosterone in males and females cause individuals to seek sex not promote parenting whereas reductions in testosterone increases in prolactin and decreases in corpus all move individuals of both sexes told parenting behavior and less toward reproductive behavior the other behavior that markedly reduces testosterone in both males and females and markedly reduces the desire for seeking sex and sex itself is illness and many of you might say well do when people feel sick they do not feel seeking out mates they do not feel having sex but have you ever wondered why that actually is what turns out that it can be explained by the release of what are called in inflammatory sidakinds sidakhinds are related to the immune system they travel in the siphon in the blood and they attack invader cells bacteria viruses and under conditions of illness we make a lot of different sidakinds some of them are anti in inflammatory but some of them are pro in inflammatory and the best known example of a pro inflammatory sideline is lie sex and it is known that lie six when injected into individuals will decrease the desire for sex and eventually will reduce levels of testosterone and estrogen independent of feeling lousy the reason why people do not want sex when they're sic is because levels of isle sex are increase now this is important because as we start to think about the different ways to modulate the sex stored hormones call optimize the hormones keeping levels of isle sex lo is going to be important for them to exert their effect now lie sex on just travel to the gonads and shut down the gonads it actually has ways to interact with some of the receptors that the steroid hormones estrogen into nostrum bind to and impact those receptors that the steroid hormones cannot have their effect in short and put simply in lavatory sidelines lie six are bad for sectored hormones and organ to talk about how to modulate isle sex in the direction that you would want and how to increase another side a kind called lie ten which is anti in lavatory in ways that can help promote or at least support the sectored hormones as we move forward were going to now start to consider what sorts of behavioral practices as well as other things can modulate the sectored hormones in the directions that you want them to go but before we do that and in order to stet the stage for that you should be asking yourself how is it or why is it at a mechanistic level that behaviors can modulate hormones at all if you think about it it is kind of strange that just the mere act of being apparent or parenting can change to stostrone level dramatically or estradiol levels dramatically what is it is it the sweat of the bad is it their saliva is it the sit of the baby is it holding the baby or is it all those things it turns out that many of those effects are because of smell or in some cases even possibly hormones now talk about hormones hormones again our chemical travels in the body impacts tissues themselves elves where in the body a sermon is a chemical that is released by one member of a species that goes and impacts members elsewhere but of the same species or even of other species now sermon effects are absolutely well established in lots of animal species but they are very controversial in humans to day ism going to talk about some of the well establish ones in animals have mention one or two of these before on previous podcast but have not mentioned several of them and ism going to talk about the evidence for fairmones an humans that are well established the main ones and animals that are discussed are called the reboots effect the within effect the bruciffect in the vandanburg effect named after the people that discovered them the reboot effect is when you house females of a given species together with no males they start displaying longer what are called extra cycles in many species they do not have menstrual cycle which are twenty eight days they have extra cycle which can be four days or some variant thereof it is an interesting phenomenon because what it means s that the presence of the male itself is changing the ovulation cycle now many people out there imagine mostly the people that are ovulating out there will say of course i notice ovulate differently or my cycle changes when ism in the presence of my partner or ism not but the sermon effect that mirrors this reboot effect in humans has still not really been identify nobody knows what the exact chemical is but none the less this is a strong effect in some animals the other one is the brush effect and this is a very dramatic effect whereby pregnant animal will abort or reabsorb her feds if the dad of those animals the the father that sired the litter or cause these are animals their litters is removed and a novel male is placed in her vicinity for about forty eight hours and what is interesting is the way that this happens is a faermone that comes from male urine activates the ganatatrope and releasing hormone system and causes a reintroduction of the estracycle and a spontaneous abortion of the plus now lot of people have taken the brush effect kind of to its extreme and asked whether not inhuman miscarriages are caused by detecting the hormones or odors of novel males meaning the non dad male and that still an open question nobody knows if that true or not one emphasized that the other one is the vandonberg effect and this is one i alluded to in a previous episode the podcast which is that puberty in females can be accelerated by placing a novel actually competent male in with a young female who has not undergone puberty there is also aversion of this which i have not described which is delay of puberty where you take juvenile female animals that have not undergone puberty and you put them with more mature females of the same species and that introduction of more females will cause a delay a significant delay in the one set of puberty these are all sermon effects and we know their sermon effects because there not conscious there also do not require actual contact with the other members of a given species these are all effects that can be mediated by the urine from a given species ore by the sweat of a given species and speaking of sweat the one farm effect that i very aware of from the published literature is a paper that was a publishing nineteen ninety eight by stern an my linstock which was getting at this question of synchronization of menstrual cycles now the whole idea of synchronization of menstrual cycles is pretty controversial for a long time peoples that o this is absolutely a well characterized phenomenon people living in dormitories their s of their menstrual cycles would synchronize people living in environments together with their menstrual cycles would synchronized and then some studies came out that kind of undercut those data and said no this actually does not happen and it was kind of controversial but there is a very clear effect that was described by stern my into what they did actually was they took females they charted their cycles and then they had other females were pads in their armpits and they collected sweat from those females and then they took the sweat from those pads in those females armpits and they introduce them to women who had never had contact with the people who had sweated they only had con tact with their sweat in fact they swabbed it underneath their nose but if that sounds gross they diluent in alcohol much that they cannot actually detect the odor of the sweat hit is actually very important because it is not the the smell it is the farm chemical itself and it turns out the farm chemical itself can modulate the menstrual cycle although it does not necessarily synchronize it with the sweater what it does is it changes the duration and the pattern of ovulation relatives as call follicular face long an short of this is that the sweat and almonds of females can modulate the menstrual cycle patterns of other adult females its just the question of whether not they synchronize and if you are kind of rolling your eyes down saying well of course they do and this is really retell this is how the science is done and the reason why people are skeptical about the presence of farm effects in humans is that there is no well identified farm organ we have an area of our nose that is responsible for smelling that is well establish its been observed in emoureyes many many times in cadavers many mantises in pretty much all individuals but the womeronasal organ which is the farm detecting organ has not really been found in humans there something all jacobsoms organ which is thought to be the the organ in the nose is artily on the top of the roof of the mouth and in the behind of back of the nose is forgot o wine tasters i never can pronounces what are they call sulkier sullenly whatever the people that are excellent at drinking when a detecting the essence is of wine that you have to go throuhall these tests in order to get certified as one of them somebody tell me a they are using probably a similar mechanism of mixing taste and smell and jacobus organ if it exists the womernazel equivalent in humans is thought to be a commination or smell and taste now it gets even weirder and cooler when you think about a given study that was done in humans where if you take hundreds of teashirts from boy friends keep them separate you take the those tea shirts you wash them many times separately and then you offer them to the girl friends the long time partners of those guys and what you willing is that the e the girl friend can pick out her boyfriends teashirt among hundreds of other teashirts not because it smells different but because something about it seems different it might smell different to her in some way that is kind of imperceptible even to her and the level of accuracy in detecting that tea shirt her partners teashirt is way above statistical significant thresholds much that you almost have to say there something about these effects that are real farmoneffects although people still argue that there no farm effects in humans that it is all through all faction i think these are interesting and important understand because it means that a lot things coming through our nose whether not famous or smells are impacting hormones and our ability to attach memories and kind of recognition of mates and other people including our children nocistormates and of course perfume manufactures have really picked up on the idea of fairmones and have entire laboratory set up to build chemical compounds in the perfumes that are designed to attract their mates this is a well established and well documented phenomenon and the last point it'll make about daimons is that this commination of taste and smell is such a real thing in the animal world that there something called the lemon response during the making season for different animals a you cannot sh even see this and horses but for animals that are seasonal maters they will do something call the lemon response will they rashly open their lips and their mouth and they expose their gums that they can capture fair fairmones that are floating in the wind and the environment rashly are looking for mates using their mouth and kind of sniffing around if you won't a dog an you watch the way that the dog will sniff around selecting where they want a urinate males and females there is often a there bringing molecules into their nose i know it sounds kind of grows sniffing ran but their a lot of famous in urine of animals a lot of famous a traveling in the wind again whether not this is happening humans i do not know but theanything about the perfume thing and here people are putting these sense on themselves that contain putative drones human daimons and walking around hoping that their sense are going to evoke a meat seeking behavior from other individuals of the same human species we are among the animals in this behavior independent of whether not you believe from effects exist let us get back to behaviors that can help optimize hormone levels one of the main behaviors that is been shown to be associated with poor levels of estrogen relative to age match controls for people with ovaries or lower levels of testosterone compared to age match controls for people with testes is apnea aphonia has everything to do with underbreathing and the build up of too much carbondioxide in the body there other effects of anna as well but if there is a consistent literature in this whole story about aging and reductions and hormones and general health and reductions and hormones it is aphonia i went deepinto the literature on advanced menopause or when men apostle symptoms are exacerbated and i went into the literature on andropaus or early on set andropaus levels of testaceous that are far lower than they should be for a given age and in every case you could find multiple papers that showed that aphonia or poor efficiency of breathing and build up of too much carbondoxide in the body was a problem mostly sleep aphonia although apnea in general was shown to be in issue negatively impacting hormones now the directionality of this effect is not entirely clear it could be that reductions in estrogen cause apnea and actually there some reason to believe that might be the case i found at least one paper showing that there are estrogen receptors on some of thee neurons that actually enervate the lungs and allow for the perception of how full or empty the lungs are in other words reductions in estrogen may adjust breathing by changing our sensitivity to our own lungs now how is true for males and females remember estrogen n both males and females but as well i found papers in which testosterone reductions where associated with apnea and testosterone receptors are also found on a lot of a sells in the called viscera including the lungs again the directionality the effect is in clear but what is really interesting is that there are very clear ways in which patterns of breathing especially patterns of breathing in sleep can modulate hormones in ways that are immediately actionable and can serve to optimize both estrogen and testosterone regardless of whether r not you've ovaries or testes what is apnea apnea is underbreathing or mainly cessation of breathing during sleep people are holding their breath ad then the they will suddenly wake up i should have talked about the physiological she on previous episodes of this podcast of this pattern of double in hales followed by exiles that one can do consciously to reduce stars and anxiety and of carbonioxide that pattern of breathing is actually what kicks in spontaneous sly any time we have an apnea episode in sleep although in many people of apnea they do not engage the physiological sigh people who are dramatically over weight also suffer a lot from apnea during sleep thaws i shall a lot of build up of carbondoxide in the body and that can lead to excess of sleepiness during the day inability to access the deeper phases of sleep and it is well established that going in to deep sleep and getting the proper patterns of slow wave sleep and remsleep are important for hormonoptimization i talked about how to modulate sleep and optimize sleep in the first month of the hubermanlapodcasts imply check out those episodes if you have sleep issues or you want of work on your sleep also check out jaywalkers terrific book while we sleep and that will help you find various protocols to hlpuoptimize your sleep but the issue of breathing itself can be adjusted in the daytime waking hours in ways that can powerfully impact both sleep reduce incidents of sleep apnea and apparently from some emerging literature can also help to optimize various hormones even just by breathing in particular ways while away here is how this works there is now a lot of literature showing that breathing through the nose not through the mouth is powerful for improving l ts of things first of all it improves cosmetic features of the dawn face this was first well established by my colleagues that stamped in book called jaws the story of a hidden epidemic this is by sandhi con and pall relic who are both a faculty at stamford has a forward by robot supulsky the great robot sufpulsky and it also has a heavy endorsement up front a by period diamond the author of a guns germs and steal the pullitsor winner a lot of heavy hitters on this book jaws it is not a book that a lot of people know about unfortunately but it really describes the benefits of nasal breathing and the terrible things that happen when people in particular children but it all also are heavy mouth breathers mouth breathers have changes in the cosmetics of their face and jaw that are really bad a in terms of a attractiveness and this was done in twin studies you can look in the book and seesomelis its really dramatic how being a mouth breather tends to make the chin drop back be behind the upper mandible there is a lengthening in the face a drooping of the eyes it can be quite dramatic or modes depending on how much mouth breathing now sometimes we have to breathed with our mouths but there's also a lot of data and studies to scribed in this book jaws that describe how not breathing in wakefulness and in sleep promotes all sorts of positive things related to not just cosmetics but also the improvement of gas exchange of carmodox at an oxygen in the body and as well it can modify levels of different narrow transmitters in nauromodulators in ways that positively can impact hormones believe it or not being a nasal breather and avoiding being a mouth breather can actually positively impact hormones and in particular the hormones testosterone and estrogen although the way that it does that is by making you a better sleeper which a lows you to produce more testosterone and the appropriate mounts of testosterone and estrogen but it does that in part through indirect mechanisms because deep sleep supports the goats the outreason and the testicles and the turnover of cells an the production of cells remember in in the very particular cells and the egfalicals themselves make estrogen and in the in the ten the testicle that the pertly cells and the logic cells are important for the formation of superman for testosterone respectively what does us all mean this means we have to be breathing properly it almost sounds kind of a in a a on a new age hat we have to breathe properly get your hormones right but no yet to breathe properly to get your breathing and sleep right that your sleep can actually be deep enough in your not entering apneas states and then that will support gonad function and i wouldn't be putting thesout as one of the main behavioral tools up front if it were not for the fact that the effects of apnea on these hormones are dramatic and terrible and the plosive effects of getting breathing right on these hormones testosterone and estrogen are dramatic and wonderful let us t k about a few of those studies briefly i can under score the value of proper breathing in order to optimize hormones i was able to find at least four qualities studies showing that when apnea is reduced in sleep or eliminated there are significant increases in testosterone and males and in proper estrogen to testosterone ratios and females and the way that it works is very interesting apparently it works by reductions in carryall now coatis all distress hormone that is released early in the day as we wake up and serves healthy rolls in protecting us against infection reducing inflammation et camera but you do not want quarters all to be too high and you certainly do not want to elevated too long throughout the day and night and we all know because now we have been told a lot in the last debate or that getting proper sleep is important or all these aspects of health getting proper sleep can a really offset all the reductions in testosterone and estrogen and reductions and fertility that a curve we don't get enough sleep but seldom is it discuss how sleep actually adjust things testosterone and estrogen and it does it by modifying cartisall the molecule colesterall can be converted into testosterone or estrogen but there is a competition wherewith to the colestrall will turn into cortesall and not testosterone or it will turn in to coatis all and not estrogen if stress levels or too high the simple version of this is getting your breathing right during the waking hours meaning primarily unless your working out really hard or the some other reason why your may be eating or speaking that you need be breathing through your mouth you should be an not breather there is really good evidence for that now and in sleep you also want to be nose breather because that is going to increase the amount of oxygen that your bring into your system in the amount of carbondoxide that you are off floating they're other pass of effects of it as well but you are basely reducing apnea breath holding in sleep leads to build up of carbondoxide and leads to increases in cortesall which then decrease testosterone and decrease estrogen in negative ways across all sexes oi the simple version of this is get your breathing right how do you do that how you get your breathing right well for some people that have severe sleep apnea they are going to need the seat machine this is a machine that as you put on your face an it helps you breathe properly in sleep many people however are trying to do this thing of taping their mouth shut now the sounds a little bit extreme and you certainly do not want to i do this in any way that is dangerous names pester talked about this in his book a breath the new science of a start that simply taping shut the mouth with some tape that a will allow you to open your mouth if you really need to during sleep can allow people to shift over from be mouth breathers and snores to to nose breathers in the daytime the best way to get good at nasal breathing is to dilate the nasal passages a alula wartime breathing through their nose and one way to do this is jo just breath throw g your nose more and one way to do that is that when you exercise in particular cartvascular exercise most of the time provided you are not in maximum effort you should be naval breathing now for a lot of people naval breathing during exercises hard at first but as you do it because the sicknesses have a capacity to dilate over time you will get better at it the iciness is o if you haven't ever held ta skull of for because my job as the nersintis have held a lot of skulls to e a lot of brains at a lot of skills a teachneranatomy and done that for goodness a i got knows how many species have done that for including human but what the sicknesses are there actually what you have got or got these little portals in the bone that run you ow up here and down here behind the and the nose and into the jaw if you ever had a cold in your sicknesses or stuffed up you feel you have congestion here and here and around your heres and in your cheeks in i your face and that is because the stresses are actually portals where the bones are are fused together an interdigitate this but there lined of course with mucus membranes and as you start to naval breathe more the nasal passages will tart to dilate more do not or not can a giant nostrils but what is can end of happenings you can have an easier time breathing through your nose just from waking my advice would be breathe through your nose while exercising unless you are n maximum effort pretty soon what you will find as you actually can create more output than you would if you are breathing through your mouth and of course there exceptions to this if your swimming follow that breath protocol for fighters in martial artists there is reason to do the kind of a entail breathing through the mouth the sh kind of thing in other reasons to do that sort of thing for particular sports but for most people who or on recreational athletes or exercisers learn to be a naval breather has passive cosmetic effects it reduces apnea it offloads more carbonoxide it increases long capacity it dilates the sicknesses and it prevents apnea in sleep unlessyou have severe apnea and you need the sea pap name becoming a naval breather can have all sorts of pause of effects by reducing coatis all reducing apnea and indirectly raising tostostron and estrogen in the proper ratios this might seem kind of foundational and indirect but when you go into the scientific literature it comes through as one of the most powerful things that you can do that is zero cost takes a we effort but at zero cost and it has all these plosive effects across the board both cosmetic and in sleep and hormonal et camera that is the first piece of behavioral advice the second piece of behavioral vice relates to the viewing of light and many of you have heard me talk about this before and ism not in a belabor the point that viewing bright light within the first hour of waking whether not from artificial light or ideally from sunlight has these powerful effects on sleep and wakefulness but we have to return to this if you want o understand how light can impact hormones because hormones light and dopamine have a very close in it relationship much that your light viewing behavior can actually have a direct effect on hormone levels and fertility it can have a direct effect on hormone levels and libido it can have a direct effect on hormone levels and your ability to heal quickly and ism not talking about shining light on particular injuries that may or may not have passive effects am if we can argue about that on a prion a subsequent episode it may but what ism tying about is viewing light with your eyes let us talk about that now because the scientific literature on this are robust and they extend back several decades and yet i think most people do not really understand how powerful this relationship is between light dopamine hormones and all the great things that the sectored hormones do when their available in your body in the proper ratios in order to understand the powerful effects that light can have on the sexterod hormones we need to understand seasonal breeding animals now humans are not seasonal breeders but if you understand the biology of how light impacts various nor transmitters and hormones you will set yourself up for a deep understanding of what you should do with your light viewing behavior several species of animals many species of animals in fact rabbits and fox and various mastoids ferrets and ermines change their pillage color across the seasons this might be kind of a do but fox in winter are off in whit or light gray and those same animals will be brown or darker colored in the summer time and spring months now the same animals breed in the spring and they shut down breeding they actually shut down ovulation they often shut down testosterone production in the wintermonths sos right now ism just correlating color of fur with tendency to breed tendency to breed as we know is going to be related to levels of steroid hormones estrogen into stostron now why would these two things be linked will it turns out that dopamine is the link between them dopamine has a precursor that precursor is tyrosine which come which is a monoacid comes from food and when dopamine levels are high as i mention before there is a tendency for more can addatrop and releasing hormone utilizing hormone physical stimulating hormone all the hormones that come from the hop with thalamic pituitary axis and stimulate estrogen and testosterone release from the very and testis dopamine easily increases all of that the precursor to dopamine is tyrosine but the precursor to a lot of the melanin producing elements of cells that give pigmentation including for the hair is tyrosine and tyrosinase and enjoy yes the same monoacid based pathway and many of the same enzyme that are devoted to dopamine and dopamine in creasing the sexstorid hormones are devoted to giving pigmentation to the hair an skin and this is why in the summer months when days are longer animals are breeding more and this is also why in the winter months when days are shorter animals are breeding less this is also why in humans many people not all feel an elevation and mood in the spring and summer months because of the amount of sunlight their getting is increased relative to the winter months a some of you may be saying i love the fall i love the winter sensitivity to light in these dooming systems has a strong genetic component you go to sum areas the world have relatives a who are scanninavian and in sum areas of skananavia people know that there is a kind of seasonable effect to disorder this kind of a seasonal depression and pe will get sadder and more quiescent in the winter there is actually less going out and therefore there is less a sexual behavior there is less of a partying and things of that sort but other people will say no during the winter months i feel great and i love the holidays around winter et camera s there is a lot of variation but in general the pathway is the following increased viewing of sunlight and it has to be to the eyes it is not to the skin increase viewing of sunlight increases dooming levels in the brain increase dooming levels in animals and humans increases the amount of these malanicites and the activity of these melon and producing cells which give pigmentation to the skin and hair and indirectly increase the amount of testosterone and estrogen and thereby reproductive behavior feelings o well being social interactions reductions anxiety et camera all of which should make sense based on what we talked about already in terms of the biology and the impact of these a steroid hormones on various aspects of the mind and body how does this translate to a protocol this translates to the protocol of if you want to optimize teststron an estrogen you need to get your light viewing behavior correct it is not just about optimizing your sleep which is also important it is about getting sufficient amount of light in your eyes you have sufficient levels of doom the simple protocols for that have reviewed before but it means getting anywhere from two to ten minutes of bright light exposure in your eyes early in the day it is not sufficient to do this with sunglasses unless you've to do that for safety reasons it is fine to where prescription lenses and contacts if you cannot get sunlight for whatever reason you want to use bright artificial light but that is absolutely critical for timing the quarters all release properly limiting quarters all release to the early part of the day getting increases in dooming that are going to promote the production of testastron and estrogen to healthy levels the other aspect of light view in behavior that is extremely important is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes in the middle f the night if your viewing bright light i the middle the night you are suppressing dopamine release if your suppressing do omen release you are suppressing testastron levels much that i would wager that a major effect of sleep deprivation on refusing testosterone and estrogen is not necessarily because of the lack of sleep per see it is because usually when people are not getting enough sleep they are getting too much light in their eyes in the mill the night as well a study on this has not been completed yet but there are two studies published in sell and neuron boselprestournals excellent journals showing that viewing bright light with the eyes in the middle of the circadian night has a detrimental effect on dopamine and therefore has a detrimental effect on things testosterone and estrogen you canny begin to talk about supplements and other ways to optimize testosterone distant effects on testosterone and estrogen and fertility and reproductive behavior et camera until you get your breathing right until you get things your light viewing behavior right bright light early in the day and throughout the day is great view as much bright light ideally sunlight as you can as much as you safely can you ovisidowanto burn your retinas or damage youretna never look at any light that bright its painful look at but getting a lot of light in your eyes is not just about adjusting your sleep wake rhythms it is also about optimizing your sectored hormones and avoiding bright light in mill the night is not just about not disrupting your sleep it is also about optimizing the sectored hormones and now that you understand a bit of how this centroid hormones work and how powerful they are for reducing anxiety in all these other effects this should be straightforward to do or hopefully it is inspired you to get your light viewing behavior and your breathing behavior correct in fact in thinking about tools for many people that are suffering from low levels of estrogen if they want higher levels or low levels of testasron they want higher levels just getting the breathing and light viewing behavior which will indirectly support sleep behavior can be a huge and positive effect on levels of sectored hormones i can already anticipate that in hearing this you might wonder whether not viewing light is going to for instance increase your testaostronal lot when in fact you want your estrogen increased try its going to increase your estrogen lot when you want your testosterone increased everything ism describing here is for people regardless of cromazomol or gonattle background ism trying to basically offer all this information in ones in one swoop but basically if your somebody who naturally has ovaries and has higher levels of estrogen than testastron then viewing bright light early in the day because of dopamine effects are is going to promote more estrogen and subtle increases in testosterone whereas if you're somebody who startsoff with more testosterone and lower estrogen somebody presumably who has testes or may be your supplementing with testastrn throughother sources for whatever reason bright light viewing is going to increase testosterone and estrogen in parallel but you are still get a maintain the ratio of testosterone estrogen in short you not have to worry that you can increase the wrong hormone this is all about optimizing the ratios of hormones that you already have case at we have talked about breathing we have talked about light let us talk about a third element that there seems to be some excitement about lately a for other reasons but that can actually have some pretty profound influences on hormone levels and that is heat and cold as always rather than just offer a tool ism going to tell you the underlying science as it relates to naturally occurring phenomenon because in understanding that and understanding the mechanism you are going to be in a far better position to understand the tools and mechanisms and how you might want a just them for your own life now you understand the relationship between light daylength dopamine and hormone levels and everyone should realize that temperature and daylength are linked and ism sure as hi say that yourebolly thinking on of course in summer when there is more sun light days are longer nights are shorter in general tends to be warmer out and in winter when nights are longer days are shorter it tends to be colder out and in the winter months ten positron and estrogen tend to be lower in many animals and in humans and in the summer months because of the roll of dopamine in promoting the extra hormones when days are longer and its warmer humans tend to make more estrogen and mesotron relative to the other months of the year now these effects can be somewhat weak and modulated as opposed to in season breathing animals where the really dramatic i but the point is that temperature and daylength and sunlight those are all intimately related because of the systems that we evolved in right before we had artificial light and artificial heating and artificial cooling are biology evolved under systems where temperature daylength and the hormones were correlated with one another nowadays there is a lot of interest in using cold as a way to stimulate testosterone this is mainly because in the in the sports community in particular in the body building common they are always seeking ways to maximize testosterone digger testosterone keep estrogen tits minimum require to still have libido and still have u skin elasticity but also walk around with seranrapskin than all this kind of extreme stuff that happens there has led to a recent movement where believe ore not i heard this and i i can believe i went an checked but though it did not buy them that on amazon you can actually find at people have their literally underwear that have ice packs are thing their ice pack underwater that people are making themselves cold at the level of the gonads in order to try an increase testosterone and legit sounds pretty crazy but believe it ore not that and things ice was and cold showers can have positive efface its on the sexstoroid hormones both testastron mainly and males and estrogen mainly in females and you might say weight i thought cold makes the reproductive axis kind of shut down a bit are reduces to stostron and estrogen but it turns out its not actually the cold that is having these effects in people things the ice bath cold showers cold water swims these a ice underwear whateverthey are can believe at these ash exist but om they do exist what happens is there is a rebound into dilation after cooling cooling causes vast constriction and then after the cooling there is a rebound azo dilation and there is more infusion of blood into the gonads there is also an effect that is neural elemi explain how this works because therefore only a few studies on this none of which looking at the frozen underwhelm but that have looked at cold exposure and levels of androgen and estrogens as convoy interesting yo eve to remember that the gonad the ovaries an the testis are heavily vascularized remember even at the level of the brain tenor h canatitropan releasing hormone comes from neurons that believe are not start off in your nose early in development migrate into the hypothalamus an not making that out they tarted off in your nose migrating the hypothalamus those neurons extend processes we call them acts on into the pituitary and release gean our h into the pituitary there is a lot of ascularzation within the pituitary now those hormones or gear ah can those can stimulate physical stimulating hormone utilizing hormone which then are released and travel into the bloodstream then those hormones reach the very or testes and they have to get into the overran testis and the way they do that is through the vascular system and people forget but the vascular system and how constricted or dilated vessels are is controlled by neurons right this is which we discusses during he discussion about stress in the stress episode but it is well known to euro scientists that the best way to shut down neurons is to cool them we thee a lot of examples of this in the scientific literature but most people are aware cause you are not digging around in the method section of these papers but when we want a shut down neurons we can do things inject drugs that will do that lidocaine real the stuff that makes you know an the dentist or you can use different inhibitors one of the best ways to do it experimentally is to just cool neurons when you make neurons cold because there is a temperature dependence of when neurons can be active when they cannot the neuron shut down the most plausible explanation for why cold exposure either through one to ten minute ice bath or cold shower or the ice underpants thing would increase testastron or increase estrogen is that your cooling the neurons that control azo constriction of so dilation and shutting n down the entry of blood or at least reducing it and hormones into the gonad and then when the gonad and the surrounding area heats up again you are getting a rebound hyperovaso dilation that delivers excessive levels of not excessive but increased levels of we in our age and other hormones and carriers and carrier prolines and forth that would then stimulate the gonad to release more testosterone or would stimulate the gonad to release more estrogen that is the most plausible explanation i can come up with there are no lot of studies looking at direct effects of temperature on the gonad and it is going to be a difficult study to carry out in any case because unless it were done in metro in a dish it is very hard to eliminate all the other things vast constriction vast dilation put simply we do not know whether or not cold and heat directly effect the protect the production of testotronand estrogen we only know that cold and heat can modulate those probably through indirect mechanisms controlling the amount of blood flow by way of shutting down or activating the neurons now there is a lot of lore around heating up the gonads too much actually a a whole set of of pseudo science a wed pages out there saying well if you want a girl you should conceive the child that this room temperature and if you want a boy you should conceive the child that this room temperature i i do not thing there is really any firm scientific evidence for that o for either one but there is some interesting literature about temperature dependence of production of hormones and i think that it probably relates to these mechanisms of vast dilation and curl control over vast dilation and of course excessively high heat is not good for the testees for sperm production or for sperm health sperm have all sorts of prolines in the cap things pentractons and other things that cause them to swim faster when there a express properly in in the right locations and heat actually alters the location and the function a lot of those prolines thar very heat sensitive and that is why excessive heat is truly not good for fertility which may be independent of heats rolls in promoting estrogen or testosterone o case now we have talked about breathing light and temperature we talked about parent hood we talked about competition and we talked about some farm effects now let us talk about particular forms of exercise and how they modulate the steroid harmony and then we are going to talk about various supplements both in reference to testosterone and in reference to estrogen now let us talk about how exercise in its various forms weight training endurance work weight training to failure or less intense weight training can impact to stostrone levels but i want remind you there were talk a out to stostrone both in males and females and based on what from earlier in the episode to stostrone can have numerous pass of effects in both males in females provided there an optimal range if you look on the web people say o testosterone is increased by weight training you onto big heavy compound movement squats and dead lifts and wins and things of that sort but what about the scientific studies what is the actual basis for this cause if you just take a step back and look at this from the perspective of science as you take a what is a squat a squat is loading up a bunch of a weights on a bar and then sitting down a centrally in standing up over and over again om what is a dead lift it is lifting heavy weights from the found why would that increase testosterone right this is what is often not discussed in the weight training or even the exercise science community what what would actually stimulate the release of testosterone from the adrenals and or testes and which one is it canals or testes a both and that is often not discussed but as a hero scientists is the kinds of things we think about as we think always that genes do not create behavior immune systems do not know when to be activated lungs do not know when to inhale or exile hearts do not know when to be except for the information that it gets from neurons the nervous system controls all of that and really the ants a has to be in the neral system that is related to these particular types a weight bearing exercises when you go into this literature it is kind of hard to find real mechanism you see a lot of effects you will hear things androgen receptor content meaning testosterone and its terivitous receptor content falling heavy resistance exercise and you find some examples that for instance om they do muscle byopseese they can actually see receptor increases looking at either high volume or low volume really intense exercise and you you can find a lot of that but not a lot of mechanism about how the nervous system would do this and the reason you want to know how it can do it is that you could potentially build better protocols or figure out exactly what about these movements is triggering increases in androgen receptors and testosterone what is interesting is when you start digging into the more mechanistic studies what you find is that heavy weight training this is weight training where the the sets are done with anywhere from it find one to eight rep ran it's translates differently in depending on rash of muscle yer type and forth but where busily people are working it anywhere from seventy per cent to ninety my per cent of their maximum or sometimes even going right down to their one repetition maximum really count you do not man effort what you find is that using the nervous system in a way in which the moving heavy load that i would translate to recruitment of high threshold motor units for you muscle physiologist and there is a rule in muscle physiology about the her neuron recruitment for moving muscles where you easily use the minimum number of motor units of neurons to active ate muscle as you possibly cans loads increase you have to recruit more or more neurons it is it you always here about recruiting muscle fibers but really its recruit no more neurons to recruit more muscle fires and what you find is that heavy wight training but not weight training to failure where completion of a repetition is in possible leads to the greatest increases in testosterone ism sure there a bunch of exercise jokes out there the divan a you not come at me with a bunch of things where ya but high volume and this and training to failure an that sure am if you are willing to wont of put things side by side adjust for am exogenous testosterone treatment hand a teethe rest which was done in these studies what you find in general is that weight training with heavy loads anywhere from one maximum to somewhere in the unosixty t repetition range in males or females increases testosterone significantly and it does it for about a day sometimes up to forty eight hours and the studies that i found which seem to hold the most rigor or weight based on where there published does supposed being publish in the journal never heard of it their publishing good quality exercise physiology journals for instance the paper by rest ratites are a t a m e s s at all am which was published in two thousand five which talks about modulations in androgen receptor content after having resistance exercise looks it going to failure not to failure the work of a stereo at all published in two thousand six differential effects of string training leading to failure or is not failure on hormone response strength and power gains there are lot of studies here and i will certainly put the links to these in the caption many of these actually include drunken french who runs toe easy training center who have had the the privilege of meeting and discussing some of this with before am as well as other authors of course but they all point to the fact that there is something about the engagement of the neurons that recruit high threshold motor units in model when moving heavy loads but not to failure that has to provide some sort of feed back signal either to the go and to produce more testosterone or is increasing the activity of receptors in the body now why do i say that well this is the puzzle right how is it that a particular movement just how is it the interacting with your child is increasing or decreasing testostro this is the kind of fundamental question at the mechanistic level and we answer the question for child rearing has probably something to do with smell and sermons although ism sure their other us as well but there is clearly a influence of hard work at the neural level and then at the muscular level for increasing testosterone and there is also clearly in effect of working too hard an presumably increasing quart is all too much although ism speculating there in terms of refusing testosterone and the reason were getting kitty gritty about this is because ultimately we would really to understand what are the optima protocols out there in the large are you hear move heavy objects to increase testosterone some of that will be converted to the more powerful androgen d shh t by five out products et camera but we really do not understand yet how these particular behaviors increase mesotron a whether not its doing that by modeling the receptors or its ogling testosterone release directly presume tostostron release directly and sensitivity of the receptors that is what most of the muscle physiologist studies that i was able to find point to but this basically boils down to a particular set of protocols where if you want to increase testosterone for whatever reason that weight training with heavy loads but not to failure seems to be the best supported at least scientifically supported solution to that now it may not raise your testosterone levels as high as you want but its devil taking things in the correct direction now many of you might be endurance athletes or also enjoy exercise besides heavy weight bearing exercise and there are several studies exploring whether or not insurance activity and increase or decrease androgen levels and whether not you combine endurance activity and weight training whether not that has any effect if you do the endurance activity first or second and the take away from all of this was that insurance activity if performed first leads to decreases in testosterone during the weight training section as compared to the same weight training session done first followed by endurance activity in other words if you on optimize testosterone levels it seems to be the case that weight training first and doing cardiotype endurance activity afterward is the right order of business now when these are done on separate days it does not seem to have an effect that it is they showed no statistical interaction but it seems that if you are going to do these in the same work out episode that its move heavy loads first then do cardiovascular exercise there is a littlest of data looking specifically how endurance exercise impacts toststrone and its derivatives and it is very clear that high intense interval training sprinting et camera which somewhat mimics the normal activity that occurs while moving heavy weight loads is going to increase testosterone there is ample evidence for that in the literature and that endurance exercise that extends beyond seventy five minutes is going to start to lead to reductions intostostron presume by increases in carts all but of course the intensity of the exercise is going to be important too in know no one ever i do not think any one really believes that fighting for the three hours is going reducer tostosron it whereas i think if one were to go out and run hard for three hours that you can imagine the reductions in testosterone by way of increases in quarts all and while this aria certainly needs more research it is pretty clear that limiting the endurance exercise to seventy five minutes or less not making it two intents is one way to keep coatis all from going through the roof but have talked on previous episodes and there a lot of others who have talked out there about hot clamp coatis all how to keep cortical more reduced this is also one of the reasons why you can imagine that various individuals either for competition or just for their own purposes are rely on testosterone there eugenist o stostrone not just for weight training but for endurance exercise this one o the reasons why everyone in a while professional psychologists ill get popped for performance in basin drugs mean they will get caught and it is notorious that their increasing red blood sells through epic an things that sort oftentimes their also taking testostr not because they want to be large or have massively hypertrophy muscles but because they because their injecting testosterone they do not have to worry about quarter all induce reductions in testosterone they can just clamp or keep their testosterone levels high not something ism recommending but ism just justifying the rational for whine endurance athlete would want to do that at all sonowlet switch over to talking about estrogen there are many people who are trying to optimize their estrogen levels and one of the places where this shows up a lot and i get a lot of questions about is menopause menopause i mention earlier is this fairly massive reduction in the amount of estrogen that ant is circulating in one's blood mainly because the very is now depleted of some estrogen production of its own the eggs are not being produced they've ben depleted et camera menopause is characterized by a variety of symptoms and it is multifaceted probably deserves an entire episode on its own but things hot flashes things mood swings things headaches in particular migraine headaches there can be a lot of brain fog it can be very very disruptive for people now use moments here by drew paws which is thought to be the kind of analogue to to menopause but menopause has certain characteristics that make it a very robes phenomenon for most women whereas for men andripaus is going to sometimes happens sometimes wont in fact without going into the details of the the graphs and the and the data it is very clear as i mention earlier that some men maintain levels of of circulating androgen that are quite high even as similar they were in puberty and their tenias and twenties well in to their sixty seventies and eighties if their optimizing a lot of other things and probably genetic plays a role as well whereas some males will not but within the female population or population of individuals that have ovaries there is a very stereotyped in characteristic reduction in estrogen levels as the number of eggs becomes to pleaded and that is what we think of as menopause what are the various things that one can do for menopause well one of the most common ones is that physicians will proscribe supplemental estrogen this is hormone therapy where somebody takes eithether or estrogen or they will take it there use a patch or a pellet some way to secret estradiol into the system and that has varying success depending on the individuals some people respond very well to it other p pole really have challenges with it and the a lot of side affects associate with it for some people not others in addition there is a concern always about supplementing estrogen when there is a breast cancer a background in the family or there is concern about breascancor for any reason because a lot of those cancers are estrogen dependent and that is why drugs tomoxophin and a nastrosall and drugs that block either a comatose or block and excuse me estrogen receptors directly were to were initially developed you see them a lot on the inner not again for the the sports folks who are trying to increase the stoserun reduce estrogen but remember those drugs were initially developed as ways to prevent estrogen binding to the estrogen receptor as cancer treatments don't be very clear and have said this man times we always put in the in the caption of each episode of course that ism not a position not eddy i do not prescribe anything of a professor and profess things ism here to translate the scientific nurture and point to what might be some useful avenues for exploration but this just for information purposes you should deftly talk to your doctor about anything hat ism toning about now or in any episode for that matter if you look at the literature on menopause outside of just standard estrogen therapy there are some very interesting compounds out there that have been used and that are supported by quality pure reviewed studies and again it'll were free once again to this amazing website examined to come where you can put in essentially any condition or any supplement and it point you to the human effect metrics not animal studies but human studies that have explored these things now there are huge variety of them heres but i will not go into all of them but some of the the pro estrogenic compounds the shown to be powerful in the contact of menopause as well as other conditions where estrogen is lower than one would include a description and some of the miscall get into this a moment of something black cohosh i think that is the correct pronunciation it is literally the word black and then c o h o s h and it is very interesting there are thirteen previewed studies that have reached prominence in the kind of commercial landscape where this substance black cohosh has been promoted as a way to increase estrogen turns out that the effects are consistent but are fairly miner fairly minor increases in estrogen does seem to be a real effect of it is significant over the placebo effect but there is also significant placebo effect om in some of these studies as help what is interesting when you look at these studies is that a many of them were carried out over a period of six plusmonts their double blind studies et camera and almost all of them led to modest increases in estrogen and modest decreases in menopause related s symptoms now a few additional details about these studies they were generally carried out on women age forty five to sixty four in some cases they a look specifically at women that were clinically ones i overweight although not always m the subject size pools are pretty big anywhere from fifty to eighty seven these are decent size hundred and thirty two subjects et camera these look to be quality studies and they basely point to the fact that black cosh can have a modest in a fact in improving mananas symptoms the other one is pants ginseng p an a at a ex ginseng has been shown to decree sumsymptoms associate with menopause mostly related to libido although the other effects were unreliable other things make which is known to increase dopamine actually had minor effects things the names here little hard to pronounce forgiving things a valerian ofisionalis has shown that there can be some improvement in the hot flash symptoms and some of the insomnia associate with that that might be worth a exploring again discuss with your doctor but these were both u in a hundred subject plus am age forty five to sixty four individuals double blind placebo controlled studies that showed significant but modest effects there was one substance in the alert of the of the a compounds that was looked at u that turns out to be particularly interesting and this one is also particularly difficult to pronounce and its a pruraria mirin lira pika woman spell this out for you its p u e r a r i a curari mirin mini pika m i r i f i c a and their four studies on this compound that show in every case it to be very potent in fact comparable to estrogen therapy esteem replacement therapy in reducing the symptoms of mananas this was pretty striking because when you go through these studies you look again that they seem to be u pretty well controlled as far as i could tell and they explored a pretty wide subject pool and it seems that every single one of these studies when looking side by side at a curari myrica which is also called nails really and to pronounce quad cur cow i guess that is at the name that they using in various countries that it was comparable to estrogen replacement therapy i mention this because a lot of people contact to me and said what about the insomnia in mananas what about the headaches in mananas now ism not suggesting you run out and me least are taking any of these compound please talk here doctor any hormone related compound is a serious consideration a because of the relationship to best cancers but just in general these compounds are estrogen into stosteron a exceedingly powerful interns of controlling our mental and physical am states and you want to approach them with caution but i thought that that one in particular was interesting and for which there quite a few pulled a documented pure reviewed studies in quality journals o castonow let us talk about the role of specific compounds some of which many of which can be taken in supplementation form or extracted from i nutrition in order to optimize sextoricd harmony and again i just want o emphasize that ism not suggesting anyone take anything or stop taking anything this is purely for informational purposes but some of the at on these is quite striking and impressive it is very clear that certain collections of nutrients are useful for promoting testosterone and esteem production in their proper ratios and those things are what i would call the sort of usual suspects item index which is important for many biological functions in clouding indican functions zinc magnesium et camera and if you want to look into this more deeply you an't understand exactly what the negative effects are of not having sufficient zinc magnesium and what those levels might actually be there is a paper that is available you go on pulled am i cannot pronounce this last name ism sari it is a it looks to me worzosic but it is w are we o s e k i hope but in butcher that to badly were lose at all twenty twenty in enderchronology and metabolism review this a recent paper in a good pure review journal it talks mainly about how the hypothalamic pituitary renal axis on the sex storied hormones are negatively impacted by deficiencies in magnesium deficiencies invieemand and deficiencies in zinc however that does not point to the levels that one should take in order to optimize it does not say take amount of minor amount of magnesium or amount of bi women for that information because it is context dependent an individual dependent a highly recommend you go to examine d to calm you can put in inch magnesium in viteemindeand they will give you ranges of dosages that are supported by specific studies again that information is completely free to you and it is very useful in figuring that out i personally have supplement of i zinc magnesium in vitamin d for years and but many other people do that well the question is always how much and that is why i a proponent of getting blood work done because that is how whether not your androgen levels as well as things bytomend levels et camera are a sufficiently high that take away from these studies looking at what deficiencies cause in terms of dephasists an testosterone and estrogen really point in the direction of make sure you are getting adequate zinc magnesium an d three unless you want these asteroid hormone levels to be reduced for whatever reason one of the things that is been shown time and time again to have very negative effects on sex storied harmony testosterone mainly men estrogen mainly in women is opioid there is as whole issue of course of the the opioid epidemic o its deserving of entire episode we are going to talk about a that with a experts indiction a and people that treat pain and forth but the opioid dramatically reduce levels of testosterone and estrogen and they do that mainly by disrupting the receptors on canatitropan releasing hormone neurons these neurons within the hypothalamus that communicate to the pituitary and in fact people that take large amounts of options or even take low levels of opioid for long periods of time will develop all sorts of endocrine sinderums that is been shown over and over again gonicomascior man bees development in males destruction to the very and females it is really a a quite terrible situation a excessive ovoids are very problematic for sector harmony i do not think a any one will have any trouble a finding any literature on that you can just going pulled you can put a opioid testosterone or opioid a estrogen a but the major effect is actually way up in the hypothalamus to shut down the production of generate the very hormone that stimulates testosterone and estrogen release now there is an entire industry devoted to supplements and various things that people can take to increase testosterone some of which have scientifictata to support them a some of which do not and some of which have anecdotal support and some of which do not this range is broadly i man things a the material offer antlers which is high an supposedly chief one which is in the growthhormon pathway a all the word to a actual of consumption of bulltesties there you can go on amazon right now i certainly do not suggest the ducking toucan actually by a ground up testis fro from a caws a and you can consume those and la that can be broken down in the got am certainly not a suggesting do that but just to point out this is a huge and vast literature and ashy dates back hundreds of years even though testosterone was not discovered what a that long ago as a specific hormone molecule and characterized and then resynthesize it has a huge industry because of the powerful effects that it has likewise with estrogen the development of the birth control pill was only made possible by understanding the structure of estrogen and estradiol and werenotocal about first control and how it works and its influence on serious other pathways in a future episode but there are these supplement compounds that are supported by the scientific literature in terms of their ability to adjust androgen things testosterone and dihydroteststrone one of the ones that has really good evidence for it is creatine it is very clear that something about creatine although the mechanism is not exactly clear either increases five algor a dictate or makes the testostro molecule more susceptible to certain and a enigmatic reactions that leads to increases in d h t d h t to hadrtestostrone as i mention the previous episode has is dramatic roll in creating a kind of masculinization of the brain prenatal it also a defines the primary sex characteristic of the growth of the minus et camera and beyond infant and early childhood and later in life it has powerful effects in creating balding in beard growth et camera and it has a much higher affinity for the androgen receptor than does testosterone creatine can increase t h t which means that if you take creatine and your very d h t susceptible than you might experience some heir loss hat has been heavily debate it does creatine casualness it is on o depend it is on depend on how much five of for duties you have and how prone to heirs you are on some people can take creatine without any problem in terms of hairless some people cannot they start losing the heir on to levels that at least for them a are not comfortable there are a few other things that can increase testosterone and it has to do with the way that testosterone exist in its free and its bound form testosterone the molecule is got a total testosterone that is usually what is measured this is the kind of levels of that are typically thrown around of anywhere from three hundred and nine hundred being the cold of natural range and then superphysiological getting up into twelve hundred sixteen hundred range but testosterone is not just roaming around free in the blood at least most of it is not most of it is bound to either sex hormone binding globular s h b g or to albumen they there needed as transporters to get testosterone in the cells that testosterone can have its effects on gene expression as well as other a pathways within themselves people talk about that the level of free testosterone is really what is important and tat you want to optimize free testostro that is a little bit of a tricky statement that is kind of a a it is it is true and yet it is not really a reflective of a thorough understanding of how these binding globulin's work remember these binding lobulants are not there to soak up all your testosterone just to make it hard for you to free up testosterone and a make gains in the go or whatever is where have increases in libido there there to actually transport testosterone to to specific tissues to shuttle them to specific tissues and to set the rate of bound and unbound testosterone that it is not all unbound at once and that it is a always interesting to look in the literature and see however in wants to free up their testosterone that can work but sextormon dining globular can bind up too much testostro to the point where its having negative effects on libido or on on muscle growth in fat loss in things that shortness is true in males and females or am it can be doing exactly what it supposed to do which is shuttling testosterone to the proper a tissues in organs where it has all these effects including the brain am the there are supplements in particular tonga all which is has this other name it some time called forgot a sometimes it is called an these a forgive me that are to pronounce but r e i coma a longifolia jack that always seem to have these names that kind of a that kind of a allude to androgenic features i do not know why longifolia gas i do not know i thing it is kind of obvious why am that some sort of androgenic am this has been shown in several studies and you can find these on examined to comer you can go to submit if you have looked tat these that it does seem to have some pro fertility pro free testosterone and subtle aphrodisiac effects it does also seem to be a slight anti estrogen am the reports to this o people take this anywhere from four hundred eight hundred milligrams to day gan ism not suggesting you do that but that is of what is out there and there is some decent scientific literature a to support the fact that it liberate some of the bound testosterone and allows more free testosterone to be available some of the reported quoting solid effects are things a excess of alertness and in soma if it is taken too late in the day and forth but i encourage you to explore that further if if that is am some if it increasing freetestostrone of something that you are interested in doing a examined to come includes a lot of other am things that can increase testosterone am one of the things that is been purported to free up testosterone in the blood are things nettles stinging nettles a although i should point out that the lecture points to stinging nettle also having some a fairly potent effects on the prostate n on on the liver and it might be a tricky molecule may be not an attractive one for for people to take we talked about creating we talked about tonga all it is clear that boron which is really interesting believe an i think boron comes from a thing these realize meteors that landed on earth that now the extract boron it is a one of these crazy stories that when you look at it you g how can that possibly be there is actually a that is out works that am boron there some scientific support for it freeing up more testosterone again freeing up testosterone may be exactly what you want i just do not think that we need should demonize these carrier prolines albumin es b g in fact albumin it is very important for testosterone to be able to make it into the brain to have some of the pro androgenic effects on the connive effects at testosterone because in both males and females testosterone can shift these am behaviors mate seeking am reductions in in a anxiety an forth to we talked about before only by making into the brain and there is this thing called the blood brain barrier a which is fascinating and deserving an entire episode all o and getting molecules across the blood brain barrier even if their sexstorid hormones which are lipophilic in camass through selmembrines requires carriers and those carriers often are born to or include albumin and it is not the goal it to free up all your testosterone but getting free testosterone into arrange that works for your particular goals in needs is can attractive one and that is why we are discussing these particular tools o the mounts of boron that people taken and you can find this again on submit or examine but people take a couple grams of it a day ism not aware of any sees of excitifects b always always always want t examine for the particular sideaffects and people with different backgrounds and conditions as we talked about for menopos an estrogen have to be careful because when you are starting to modulate hormones you are starting to modulate not just the tissues that thrive on binding of those hormones but remember am the reason why there much breast centare in there's reason why the much testicular cancer is that any tissue that undergoes rapid reproduction of particular cells there is a lot of reproduction of cells and shedding of outer in lining in the re production o cells and eggs in the very and in the testes there is the production of living and are tolly cells and there is thiscono ongoing production of sperm that is why those tissues are particularly vulnerable to the development of cancers and many of those cancers are androgen sensitive that is why one of the major treatments for prostate overgrowth or prostate cancer is to give anti androgenic drugs a it is not just a shut down all things a related to being a androgenized it is really about trying to prevent testosterone from encouraging growth of tumors i want it really emphasize the caution there a because it is easy when thinking about optimizing estrogen and testosterone to just think o more is better more is defile not better and its not just because they can aromatize are convert into other things it is because cancers or any tissue that has a lot of turn over of cells is going to thrive on androgen anything that promotes growth is going to thrive on estrogen remember brain tissue does not turn over that much there is not really much production of new neurons brain cancers happen but their kind of rare and when they do happen they ten to be gleam cells which have a lot of proliferation gleam cells can proliferate adulterous do not create more themselves they do not create more neurons in general except in a few places in the brain and body any tissue that recycles itself is prone to cancers and those tissues thrive on androgen and estrogens to create more tumor you have to be careful when any time your modulating hormones especially androgen and estrogens and in my scouring of the literature and looking at and what is out there and what people are talking about and i also mean in the scientific literature one of the things that am is new to me anyway probably not new to a a lot of the him rats out there but a or the people that spend a lot of time on you two videos talking about a androgen are these a forgive me for butchering the name again are these ectisteroids recti steroids a am molecules that come from things spinach believe it or not that have a lot of similarity to the collestral molecule the one that is being discussed a lot out there right now is something called turn strong am i wish i knew why was called turkisterone some one tell me why it is called turkisteron does i making do it turkeys am i know why it is called turkisterone a perhaps some newel will no in any case m these ectosteroids are similar enough to collateral remember colesterall is the precursor to testosterone quartisal and estrogen and it appears that some of these ectosteroids do have big availability or their metabolites are by available and this was something that for many years people talk about whether or not insect hormones or hormones from other species could actually be used by humans or whether not it would have any effect at all and it is pretty clear based on a study that i was able find there is a a paper that came out in twenty nineteen a the s a comparative study a in the arrives of toxicology this is binmen at all i s e n m n n at all that talks about the ectosteroids am and was given in conjunction with strengthtery strengthtraining or no strengthtraining this is a ten we intervention and their conclusion is that am these ectosteroids had a fairly significant above plesibo controls increases in muscleman strength my perched we effects all the sorts of things that one would expect with am increases in androgen a their conclusion of the study am is not my conclusion a although i may or may not agree with them o this is in about my opinions it is just i one o be clear these are their words not mine but they theirs they say that am in their words quote our result strongly suggest the inclusion of ectosteron in the list of pro exhibitive substances to their saying these things are powerful that they should be on the list of band substances which am might be a upsetting to some or am some of you might be thinking who cars the whole issue of augmenting a hormones in sport is of very interesting issue in fact if you just want a little anecdote about that i cannot reveal names here of course but what i learned recently was very surprising to me which is that many athletes in passports a taking testastron and they are able to do that legally am not just because it is available by prescription but they are allowed to do that under the rules of their sport in the fine print that no one including me had ever seen if they have had an injury if athletes are injured then it opens up the door for certain am forms of testastron augmentation am another a types of a augmentations that are not available to them if they are not injured which always makes me wonder now when i see them getting injured whether or not a that is an attempt to get some of the support because there's absolutely no question that estrogen in testosterone's modulate gene expression modulate strength modulate the way the brain works modulates our relationship to effort and anxiety et camera and while were tinge about supplementation the effects of supplementation i would say in some indie visuals can be quite dramatic but there always always always except in extreme cases going to be far subtler am souse me far more subtle am to use the the proper a english farmers subtle then would be for instance just in injecting testosterone or injecting estrogen et camera i think we should just be honest an out front about that thus far in terms of talking about optimizing hormones and in the discussion of supplementation i have not rally talked about things that actually effect the brain directly that increase the pituitary output and things that sort mainly been talking about things that free up testosterone er that increase estrogen at the level of the periphery but if you remember way back to the begin this episode hormones are made in different locations in the body and then there are hormones that promote the release in the production of of hormones from other tissues in the body and one of the main hormones for that is utilizing hormone utilizing hormone again comes from the pituitary circulates and either goes to the very to promote various aspects of of egmateration am as well as production of estrogen and to the testes to promote testosterone and sperm production and the prescription version of increasing utilizing hormone is something called h c g or human chronic ganatitropen which has been synthesized and is now available as a prescription drug it is taken various a context for increasing fertility both by males and by females it can increase am for all the reasons that now make sense it can increase sperm production it can produce a population frequency it can produce the number of eggs even that that are deployed and in a given ovulation although that is not always a good thing am basically is pro fertility protestostrone pro estrogen depending on your background and what is interesting is h c g was initially a synthesized am collection synthesized from pregnant woman's urine an believe it or not a before it was synthetically a made and solved s he prescription drug am there was actually a black market a for pregnant woman's urine where people would buy the urine i do not know ism messing that they probably just am consumed it which is weird but in any case am human cryonic annatropen is now available as a prescription drug and its one of the things that many people use to increase testosterone or estrogen to or increasing fertility some cases i think it is use to increase sports performance or when people have shut down there their gonads am for whatever reason because of excessive hormone therapies or they have am a some sort of sometimes their actually lesions that to the pituitary sometimes we will have a tumor in the pituitary sash not common but among brain tumors and normal tumors it is one of the more common ones and then you get deficiencies in pelagian effesagions of people take see to stimulate the gonads the variety reason why these drugs were were created but there are certain supplements not many that apparently can increase aluminizing hormone and thereby e an increase tostastron and estrogen and one of the more on well documented ones is fidogia gratis that is f a d o g i a separate word a g r e s t i s which least according to the literature a that i was able to find can increase levels of aluminizing hormone and thereby levels of tistastrone or levels of estrogen and again if an individual were to take fidogiagrastis what they would probably find is that testastron estrogen would increase in any one of any cromozelmo gonadal background but remember it is the ratio of both both if some one has estrogen hug testosterone let say they have testes just by way of example than both of those should it would be expected to increase and if some one has highestrogen and lotestastrone else you say has overs then both of those w would increase by taking fidogia arrests a the side effect profile of fidogiagresis has not really been documented it is a little unclear i just one emphasize that any time some one's going to start taking supplements that a or modifying sextroied hormones getting blood work done is extremely important am it for safety reasons and also just to know whether not things are working and because all of these things are subject to negative feed back talk about this previously a previous episode but if tesactron goes high or too high it can feed back and shut down utilizing hormone which will then shut down for the testacterom production likewise if estrogens are going too high here there going too high at various phases the cycle that can start to throw off various other hormones including am eras we progesterone el h the menstrual cycle itself is a just absolutely exquisite balance of feed back of lute utilizing hormone kept low and constant please for the first fourteen days the cycle than bicycle there is a peak and that is typically when population occurs that is why pregnancy is most likely during the middle of the twenty right a cycle eras we kind of goes up and then down across the first fourteen days taking anything or really modifying ones estrogens or testastronn on that background of the menstrual cycle is really going to disrupt the way those things interact and it is just such an exquisite feed backup ism not sing do not am do that but you defile want to be aware of what you are doing and blood draws are one way to do that monitoring souls a for ovulating females is another way to do that and in males having a good window into what is going on with testosterone d h t bromates estrodyl am is ell ah et camera is just vital and it is really a parting parcel with the practise of thinking about optimizing these incredible things that we call sextroyd hormones estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives the list of supplements and molecules that can adjust estrogen and testosterone is vast and i only touchtron a few of these i i really try to emphasize the ones for which there are human studies a or that have mostly human studies or maybe even just one human study there are other things out there a for which there are scientific data things bulging natolensis which definitely has support for increasing testosterone but all the studies were in rats am i think there is some evidence in humans but the evidences mainly comes in the form of a will we call sponsor research o companies paying for research which is different than independent research by people who are not a biastinterms of the outcome and the reason i din throughout things bully natolensis s they seem to have a livertoxicity similar to a high levels of anabolic a erogenic steroids there some problems associated with them that make them am important to think about if your curious about this arson and the enderchonology but also am somewhat precarious and that is one category stuff that does not have a lot of evidence in humans might actually be dangerous am the other category of things that has been shown to improve or levels of or increase i should say at on say improve cause it is up to you whether not men increase decrease estrogen testosterone it's highly individual how could i know are the things that are kind of housekeeping for production of estrogen and testosterone things magnesium things three things a zinc yet those of the things that a are going to create and overall miles of opportunity to produce normal androgen's levels rather than increasing indigents levels further and i really want at high light that there is a difference between taking something to create a kind of back drop of general support and taking something that is can a create a big inflection in the levels of a given hormone once again we covered a tremendous amount of information we covered some basic science of hormones and person's estrogen and testosterone and their derivatives we talked about supplementation and behaviors competition and parenting and how all these things interact and i hope that you will come away from this with a deeper mechanistic understanding of how the brain and body are interacting to control the output and the ways in which these incredible things that we call dextrad hormones work and influence us hope you will also come away with some ideas of things that you can do in particular behavioral practices the can improve sleep and your relationship to light et camera because those things really set the foundation not just for healthy sterile hormone output but for all sorts of health effects and for both the psychology and the biology of your nervous system i am sure there will be many questions there many things that i could not get to today oh i do try and limit these episodes to about ninety minutes which is the option o altradian cycle for learning ah it is a lot of information but we have timestamped everything for you feel free to o look over it in parts or circle back where you might want deeper understanding and please put your questions in the comment section below please put suggestions for future episodes and things that relate to hormones in the comment section below we do look at those and we do use them to inform the content for subsequent episodes if you are enjoying and learning from this podcast please subscribe on you to or if you prefer please subscribe on apple and or modify at apple you have the opportunity also to leave us up to a five star review and to leave a comment in the review section please also inform your friends family to workers any one that you think might also benefit for the information that were covering that really helps us grow our audience and bring more information to you as well please check out our sponsors mentioned at the beginning of each episode and as mentioned the beginning of to day's episode we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they make single ingredient formulations that are the absolute highest quality end ship international if you go to live momentous took calm slash supermen you will find many of the supplements that have been discussed on various episodes of the human lad podcast and you will find various protocols related to those supplements enclosing i hope you will leave to day's episode with a much richer understanding of the mechanisms that control the endigran and nervous system in the contact of estrogen and testosterone as well as take away various tools that you might choose to apply and next week will be back with another episode about the roll of hormones and its important interactions with the nervous system and that will of course include both mechanisms and tools as well and as always thank you for your interest in science

welcome to the superman laponpans a science science space to folie i maydrhubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing stimulants in particular stimulants for the treatment of eight it or attention definite hyperactivity disorder as many of there's tremendous interest in drugs admiral riddling giants and other stimulants as well as non stimulant prescription drugs that have been shown to improve the symptoms of eighty it such as modaphanil armodaphanel and guanphosine to day ism going to discuss all of these compounds in the context of how they work to improve the symptoms of eighty it ism going to address common questions about these compounds such as are they just speed are they similar to met or methamphetamine it'll talk about their addictive potential as well as their potential to cause psychotic symptoms both in the short and long term and of course i will talk about the scientific literature surrounding the most frequently ask question about these compounds which is what are the long term consequences of taking any of them in childhood or in adulthood now to day's discussion centers around the use of these compounds both for childhood and for adult eighty it but of course i be remiss if i don't acknowledge that there are a tremendous number of people that use these prescription drugs without a prescription in order to improve their ability to focus and indeed also use them recreational in fact some surveys reveal that as high as eighty per cent of college age young adults have used one or several of prescription drugs such as deal riddled giants or similar at some point and are doing without a prescriptions they are either obtaining those drugs from those that do have prescriptions for them for eight it or they are obtaining them through black market sources which of course carries in a national and very serious risk related to the call dentinal crisis that is as high as seventy five per cent of black market drugs nowadays of various kinds but certainly including the sorts of drugs were gin a talk about today or contaminated with sentinel and therefore are very deadly to day ism going to describe what these various drugs really are how they work at the level of neurons and brain networks and how they change those brain networks in ways that really can allow people with eighty it to be able to focus better i will answer the common question which is why is it that giving children speed because indeed several not all but several of the compounds ism going to discuss or speed they are am ephedrine why would that cause a reduction in hyperactivity if speed is a stimulant answer that question for you and i will also answer questions that are commonly asked such as how these drugs impact things sleep hormone health reproductive health as well as what is there impact on height indeed it was one prominent hypothesis that these eighty eight steeds could actually restrict the height of children all tell you whether not that is actually true or not and it'll discuss the data surrounding whether not these drugs predispose people to be coming attics to other substances even if people cease or continue taking the stimulants that can help them in the clinical sense for eighty east before we begin id to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your euro s to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactelectrolike ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elements doom slash supermen let us talk about treatments for eighty get and why stimulant treatments in particular can be effective first of all it is long been known that their specific brain networks involved in what we call attention now attention is not one thing actually it involves several different cognitive operations including the suppression of noise that is turning down the background chatter in our heads and turning down our attending to things outside us noises or visual cues that are not relevant to what we want to do and it also involves camping up or attending or focusing on particular things that are happening either in our immediate environment or in our head or both of that all sounds rather complex indeed it is and involve several different networks operating in parallel but what we know for sure based on a lot of clinical and scientific laboratory data is that the call prefrontal quarter the region of neural real estate in your brain just behind your forehead is critically important for or castrating which neural circuits are going to be more or less active at a given moment in order to bring about what we call focus or attention or tasks switching or our ability indeed tumult task because we can actually multitask to some extent in fact if you were to look at somebody and a focus on perhaps the expression on their face you could do that while also attending to a conversation that is happening nearby it is energetically demanding it is hard to do but we can do that that is as hall referred to its covert attention your covertly paying attention to something else and then you can switch that attention back to just one thing or one small collection of things the point being that attention is a powerful resource it is what allows us to navigate through life with efficiency and to be adaptive in our behaviors it is what allows us to learn and to build relationships and have successful school careers and professional careers and on but it is indeed expensive it takes metabolic resources you no just at rest if you were to think about essentially nothing or whatever just pops in your mind with no dedicated effort toward paying attention to anything your brain would consume about twenty five per cent of your daily colonic needs and then when you lump on top of that your need or your attempts to focus on things to pay attention o specific things it should come as no surprise as to why that often can make us feel tired as if we have been working really hard if we have been running according mental marathon when trying to learn and attend to things it is hard work for the brain and yet we can pay attention because of that very precious real estate just behind our foreheads the prefrontal quarter now in people both children and adults that have eghtihty their prefuntil quarter is not necessarily deficient in any specific way except that it is not as good at orchestrating the activity of other brain networks operating in parallel with it what do i mean by that well if we take a step back and say what is the forefront of quartets really doing the prefrontal quarter has this amazing ability through what is called top down inhibition to quiet other brainarias for instance if you are feeling agitated but you need to sit still your ability to sit still even if it takes a bit of work is coordinated by your prefrontal quarter sending inhibitory suppressive electrical signals to the networks of your brain that are thing to generate physical action in addition to that if you are in a conversation that is either a difficult one or a boring one or you're tempted to interrupt and your actively holding back your desire to walk away or to yawn or to blurt something out it is your prefrontal quarter that is controlling that active suppression in many ways you can just think of the prefrontal quarter as an orchestra conductor that is essentially saying ssh or not right now be quiet this is not the time to many different brainnetworks all at once now in addition to that your prefrontal quarter is coordinating with other brain networks theater involved in generating what is called salients or attention to particular signals the prefrontal quarter in many ways is a teacher or an orchestra conductor it can point to in the nor chemical sense that is point to a given brain structure and say you it'd to hear more from you right now yes you the student in the back speak up and a moment later point to a collection of small students chattering in the back get am presenting all this analogy and say my hey you got quiet downright now and is going to come up to the front of the room and help us work through this particular math problem when we hear that the prefrontal quarter exerts what is called executive function what that refers to is the prefrontal quarter's ability to quiet the activity of particular nail circuits and to enhance or increase the salients of other nerd circuits that are involved in creating our spotlight of attention and what we know for sure based on many many brain imaging studies is that get h t is not necessarily a deficit and prefrontal cortical function but rather the prefrontal quarters ability to communicate with other brain areas in the proper ways and what result in the brain of a person either young or old with eighty h t is that a lot of the background chatter becomes very very loud for instance we have a brain network call the default mode network this is a fascinating brain network this is the brain network that is active when you just sort of sit in place and do not think about much and then you start having ideas about what you might do next wee it tends to be very autobiographical you might remember an experience from the past you might think about some of your desire some of your dislikes this default mode network as it is called is also involved in our imagination in our spooling together of different experiences that we have had it does gotten to be the thing that is really focused on anything external in particular all at once the default mode network is always active but it is when we start to attend to something especially things external to us it something written on a page or conversation or something that we really need to learn something we need to pay attention to that the activity the defaultmode network is suppressed somewhat and that suppression occurs not just by accident but because the prefrontal quarter is actively suppressing it in kids and adults with get h t the default mode network is often still active at a very robust level even while we are trying to attend to things and that is why some one the d h t will sit down and try and do some focused work and it'll start thinking about something they want or something they dislike their internal state will start to distract them and of course there are other networks in the brain there is a sh a what is call the true salient's network there is the dorsal attention network there are bunch of different networks in brain areas but again when thinking about get h t and especially when thinking about how the drugs that we are going to talk about to day work to alleviate the symptoms of eighty it and in thinking about why many people use or even abuse these drugs for sake of learning or recreational we might say you start to realize that everything cents back to the prefrontal quarter and the prefrontal quarter's ability to actively suppress and actively enhance the activity of these multiple brain networks including default network salients network dorsal attention network et camera rather than overwhelm you with a bunch of names of brain areas and brain networks to day it'd really our discussion to focus on first what the various drugs that are used to treat eighty eight are that is how do they work at the level of neurons second how they create a certain set of conditions that allow the prefrontal quarter to be a better conductor third how that can be leverage during development to actually teach the prefrontal quarter of a young child to learn to be a better conductor because that is really the hallmark of the use of these drugs is to try and enhance the activity of particular circuits to create a sort of learning that the prefrontal quarter is much more efficient at doing its job of conducting and then forth we are going to talk about the various things that i think most people out there ask about when they hear about drugs thrall divans and riddling et camera which is you are they addictive why are they addictive can one use them briefly or even from time to time and still be o ka what if i use them as a child and i do not want to be on them any more should i put my child on these rugs et camera it is i believe only by understanding the biology of how these drugs work and their potential both to improve brain function but also some of the dangers associated with these drugs that one can really answer those questions for themselves or for their children o a let us start with a very basic but critical question which is why in the world would amphetamines s feed or other stimulants improve the symptoms of add t that is critical to answer because if you think about it the prefrontal quarters needs to coordinate the actions of these other circus and just increasing the amount of activity in prefrontal quarters you can imagine would create a state of hyperfocus perhaps but actually that is not the case if you just were to ramp up the activity of prefrontal quarters what you would find is that somebody would become even less efficient at paying attention to what they wanted to rather they would pay attention to whatever was presented in front of them with later focus they would lock on to essentially anything and that is not good one of the anythings about prefrontal quarter is that it needs to be flexible it needs be able to pay attention to this than it needs to be able to pay attention to that than it needs go back to paying attention to the thing it was paying attention to previously and on and forth life that is an effective adaptive life a good life consists of self directing one's attention most all of the time why would stimulants do that well almost all not all but almost all of the drugs used to treat add t fall under the category of stimulants or what are called sympathomimetics sympathomimetic refers to the fact that we naturally have a component of our nervous system called the autonomic nervous system the autonomic nervous system has two major components one is called the sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system has nothing to a sympathy has everything to do with camping up our level of attention and arousal it is the called fight or flight aspect of our nervous system or rather mediates fight or flight but immediate a bunch of other things too including sexual arousal including excitement and focus about something that we want to learn or somebody that we want to learn more about or remembering a phone number or anything that puts us into a state of alertness and focus the other arm of the autonomic nervous system is the called part sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system and that is often referred to as the called rest in digest component of our nervous system and yes it controls rest indeed it puts us into sleep and yet it is involved in digestion but it is involved in a bunch of other things as well including sexual arousal including rates of digestion including salvation including all sorts of things that do not just have to do with resting in digesting the way to think about the autonomic nervous system is its a sort of sea saw it is always at a balance some place between either predominantly sympathetic or predominantly part sympathetic but both the part sympathetic and the sympathetic arms of the autonomic nervous system are always active all the time it is not as if one is completely active in the others shut off even in sleep your sympathetic nervous system is not completely turned off and even during a panic attack your part sympathetic nervous system is not completely turned off drugs to treat eighty hit which are fall under the category of stimulants are sympathomemetics because they trigger the release of agrochemicals and the activation of components of our nervous system that very much resemble the activation of the called sympathetic nervous system the one that makes us more alert and more aroused that is why the called sympathememetics and the word stimulant refers to a general category of drugs that are sympathememetics now the most commonly discuss sympathememeic is one that fortunately is not prescribe for eighty eight and that is methamphetamine these days we hear a lot about met met which is methylated amphetamine is an extremely potent sympathememetic and it has tremendous abuse potential believe it are not met or methamphetamine is actually of bailable as a prescription drug but it is used very rarely because of its high abused potential and all the terrible things that it can do in terms of cardiovascular health in terms of earl health right there is the stereotype that methewsers have very degraded teeth and indeed they do there is a reason for that related to helmet impacts the brain and body ism going to talk a little bit about them pedaling a will bit later but let just place methemphedaming high on the shelf as the most potent sympathememetic that is out there because even though it is not often prescribed for eighty high t there are class of compounds very similar to it that have a very similar pattern of action that is not quite as potent but that leverages the same underlying mechanisms and they are very commonly prescribed for eighty eights namely deal and viveants firstletts talk about deal and what deal is deal is a commination of what are called mhedaming salts anphedaming salts refers to the fact that there are two major forms of amphetamine there is a d m pedaling are dexter pedaling and levy n heading or l mphedaming it'll refer to these as d and l m pedaling and for you chemistry minded folks out there the d and the l also referred to the fact that there is a l left handed version of the molecule and there is a d or right handed version of the molecule this is only important understand in far as that the d and the l forms of the molecule look very similar but they are mirror images of one another and yet they can have very different actions in the brain and body overall is a three to one ratio of d m pedaling to l m pedaling you should know that l m pedaling tends to b less potent in increasing certain agrochemicals in the brain all talk about which nor chemicals the are in a moment then is d m pedaling d mphedaming as potent stuff not as potent is methamphetamine but very potent stuff elemphedamine closet less potent elemphedemine tends to be the mphedemine that increase his blood pressure an heart rate whale we call peripheral effects because it happens in the perfect outside the central nervous system peripheral effects increased heart raid increase blood pressure sweating et camera are mostly activated by elemphedemine whereas d amphetamine tends to work mainly on receptors in the brain and therefore have effects mainly restricted to the brain now what are these effects that have been referring to the major effect of average and other sympathemametic stimulants is to increase the activity of two norchemicals the first of those petrochemicals is dopamine and the other of those nauru chemicals is nor epinefren first off i want to be clear that when i say nor epinefren i could just as easily say nor a adrenaline because those are the exact same thing and forgive me even though i was not the one to name the same thing to different things it'll try and stay with nor epinefren but i may say nor adrenaline they are the same thing the whole story is to how they got named two different things but it is the same thing the major effect of overall and other sympathemametic stimulants is to increase the transmission of dopamine and nor epinefren what is dopamine and what is narapinefren where both dopamine and noripanefren are what are called noromodulators that is they have the ability to increase or decrease the firing patterns the electrical activity of particular brain circuits both dopamine and norepinefren have separate roles in creating certain states within our brain and body but they to collaborate meaning they tend to be released at similar locations in the brain in order to deliver us to a particular state of mind and ere body if we were to take a look at just dopamine we would find that dopamine is released at sights within the brain and increases the activity of brain networks that for the most part lead to increases in motivation pursuit and to some extent mood if we were to look at norapinefren and where its released in the brain it tends to be released at many not all but many of the same sights where dopamine is released and the main function of normal inefren is to increase the activity of neral networks that are involved in attention and focus to particular things in our environment is think of dopamine and normal inefren as collaborators because indeed they are and actually there very nor chemically similar as well it actually just takes one chemical conversion to turndopomine into norapaneferen they are very similar to close cousins that work together to help us achieve a common goal that involves increased motivation focus and alertness when we talk about attention in eighty eighty or we talk about quieting the hyper activity or impulsivity of eighty eighty one of the reasons why drugs that are effective entreating eighty eighty are effective is because they increase motivation focus and alertness and they tend to do that at very focal locations in the brain it is worth taking a couple of minutes to think about houseympathemametic such as after all actually increase dopamine and norapaneferen they do by effecting a couple of specific operations at the called snaps what are synapses synapses are the communication points between neurons there actually the spaces between neurons but that is where a lot of the action is when neurons as we say are stimulating the next kronor activating the next kronor inhibiting the next neuron the word neuron just simply refers to nerve sell and what nerve cells have as they have a cell body that contains their idea and a bunch of other stuff they have a long warlike pros us which is referred to as an as on and at the end of that acts on there are bunch ofprotines in there that do really interesting things for instance there are prolines down at the end of the acts on that package nauru transmitter into little spherical things that we call vesical those vesical confuse with the end of the acts on and pah vomit the contents those narrow transmitters into the synaptic craft into that little space between neurons and then if enough of those nauru transmitters bind to receptors on what is called the synaptic side which simply means the neuron on the other side well then the nextneron will become active and than the signal will propagate from one neuron to the next now i just describe that whole process pretty quickly and i to think pretty simply but it action involves a lot of different proline bits and some pretty complex machinery in order to make that happen i do not want to over complicate our conversation but what i will tell you is that down in the snaps in the prieseynaptic terminal the neuron that is going to release nor transmitter there are what to called transporters which sit there and oh suck up or suck back up some of the euro transmitter that is been released there are dopamine transporters and there are norepanefren a nor adronergic transporters down in the snaps what deal does and what other sympathememetics do it is to inhibit or disrupt the action of those transporters and the net consequence of that is that when dopamine and nor epinefran are released into the snaps more of it is allowed to stick around and to bind a receptors on the postsonaptic cell then would be the case if deal or the other stimulant were not present in the system one way that deal increases dopamine and norapinefron is by disrupting the activity of these presynaptic transporters for dopamine and norpanefren the other way that overall increases dopamine ad norapanefren is that it d eserrupts the activity of a different piece of machinery in the presenaptic neuron which is called a eat the vesical monocline transporter to if you really want to get specific you do not have to remember these names but what these beats do as actually really cool what they do is they actually take whatever transmitter has been brought back up into the cell by transporters and they package it into those vesicles that are then going to be released by disrupting the transporters that value back up some of the dopamine or norapanfran that is been released and by also destructing the packaging of dopamine and norapanefran into vesicles themselves what ends up happening is that there's a build up of a lot more dopamine and norapanefrn in the presenaptic terminal that when an electrical signal travels down the neuron now the total amount of dopamine and norapanefronets released is increased kiss what is happening when you take overall is that you are getting more out of the dopamine and norapanfron that you are releasing and your releasing more dopamine and norapanefran altogether and there is a third mechanism by which overall increases the amount of dopamine and norpanefran present insinapses and therefore can't on other neurons and that has to do with destruction of the entire network between these different prolines not going to go into that in any detail because it get somewhat complicated in terms of the cellbiology and some of the big chemistry down at the tips of these axons but suffice to say that adarall is such an effective sympathemametic that is it can increase dopamine to such a great extent specially compared to other treatments radiate because of its ability to increase dopamine release and transmission and therefore action as well as noradrnergic release and transmission and action down there in the snaps and it is worth pointing out that most of the effect of overall is in increasing dopamine as appose to nor a an earn it does increase group in effort but it is major effects we should say the major effects that have made it such an attractive drug to many people both for the treatment of it h d and for people to take recreational or off prescription or for sake of studying or work simply because they want to focus more and longer is because of its ability to increase dopamine to such a great extent it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the robotics that i need for got health our got is very important as populated by up microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long term health and those robotics an athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegins vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastesgript if you would to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a years supply of vitamin d the k two again that is athletic green stock calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply o vitemend three k to now a bit earlier i mention that l m pedaling levy and fedamne is present in overall but at one quarter the amount of d m phedemi cause there is a little bit of elumphedemine and a lot of d m redefine in overall many of you are probably familiar with giants giants is a commercial name for what many people think is extended release deal but acturivivants is not extended release deal giants is a drug in which the parmacuitacale industry has taken one component of deal just the d amphetamine component an attached to it an monoacid called living now the monoacid living is a bigamist acid and the attaching of living to d mphedamin what we call giants makes it what is called a prodrug it actually cannot have any effect on its own but when one takes giants and it is broken down in the gut but to a greater extent actual in the blood strike the lines are cleaved off slowly over time and as a consequent divans is basically timed release d amphetamine this is important because i think a lot of people think that deal which again is d mphedemine and elamphedamine and those two things operate quite a bit differently at the level of norepinepran and epineprinan cardiapers is brain effects a lot of people think divans is just slow release deal but it is not what giants is is i d amphetamine only but in time release form and giants was actually developed as away to try and get around or rather prevent some of the abuse potential of deal and other drugs that contain d melamine d m predefine stands for extra amphetamine and in the seventies and eighties there were fair amount of movies and the was a lot of trafficking and there as lot of criminal activity related to what was called dearie deadline is pure d m phedamie if we are going to be very direct if i were going to just frame these things in the context of their geochemistry what i can tell you is that giants is time release deadline it is not time release deal now just because the removes and reports of criminal activity related to dexadrime at does not westerly mean that deadline is not and effective and useful pharmasuticle in fact giants which is time release dexedrine has prove to be very effective in the treatment of eighty eight sh for a lot of people and the reason for that is this time release does indeed prevent house in the sense despite peoples many attempts from what i hear to increase the rate of entry of the d m phenazine into their system by either snorting it or got forbid even injecting anythings of that sort the attaching of that li seen to d m phenazine really does slow the absorption when somebody takes giants and hopefully people are taking it responsibly when they take viveants with there really getting is a slow trickle of d amphetamine into their system and therefore a slow long lasting increase in dopamine a group and errand and indeed that is what happens the effects of giants can extend over anywhere from twelve to sixteen sometimes even eighteen hours depending on how quickly somebody metabolizes it and i should say that there is no aid to predict how quickly one will metabolize any of these drugs except by trying them that is one of the or downsides of the state of things these days there is no blood test or cinematic tests that will tell you whether or not you arguing to be a phacmetabolizer a slow metabolize and that is why people just have to sort through different dosages which will talk about in will bit they have to sort through different types of sympathemematics some people try overall another find that youth the quick time course of after all at least quick for them of about six to eight hours is just too fast and then it wears off and they get into a slump in the afternoon other people find that one overall taken it six a m will have them going all day long and into the night and its just too much stimulation and they need to come waylay down in dose or they need to think about other sympathemematics radiate t will talk about what some of those other options are and will bit as well the importuning t understand is that overall is really two drugs d and el m phenazine viveants is d m phenazine which is also called exocrine but with this time released aspect created by lumping living on there and you may notice that i have not mentioned one of the major drugs used to treat eighty eight and that is riddalan or what sometimes also called concert a depending on again the time release forms et camera riddaland was very commonly prescribed for the treatment of eighty eight early in the days of using sympathememetics in order to treat eighty first for instance i went to college in the early nineties i started college in ninety three and i graduate ninety eight was one year and there as a it's called a transitional i can recall hearing that riddled was being prescribed for eighty eight in kids and i many other people were wondering what are the long try consequences of this going to be i also many other people was very perplexed as to we a stimulant sympathememetic riddalan was being prescribed for hyperactive kids that will become clear in a moment but we do not hear much about riddled nowadays and i think that is because deal and giants and things them have become popular for the treatment of eighty eight it is worth noting that riddaland is not actually amphetamine riddled is what is called methelphenadate and methelphenadate works in a lot of ways that are similar to the way that deal and giants work but there are certain ways in which its different now riddaland methelphenadate does increased dopamine transmission at synapsis and it does also by inhibiting the function of that presynaptic dopamine transporter that would otherwise suck more dopamine back up into the precenaptic cell methelphenadate riddalan also disrupts the activity of the noragernergic transporter leading to net increases in the amount of norupanefron at the snaps but it is not as much a potent inhibiter of the noragernergic transporter and therefore most of the effect of methelpenada is to increase dopamine at son apsis lot people do not realize that the lot of people think that riddle is just very short acting overall and that is not the case it is true that riddle at least in its standard form tends to have a pretty short half life and therefore it is effects basically kick in about twenty to forty minutes after taking it sometimes a obit sooner sometimes a little later and they last about four to six hours as supposed to the six to eight hours typical of overall but riddle is not short acting lateral riddle is mainly increasing dopamine and to some extent nor epinefron at synapses were as deal and viveants are increasing both dopamine and norepinefran to a much greater extent and for those of you that are interested in the underlying sell biological reason for that it has something to do with riddle's relatively lower affinity for the noragernergic transporter but it is also because remember i listed off three mechanisms by which tall and by extension vive ants increase dopamine and norepinefran transmission rite destruction the transporter destruction of the eat too as well as a destruction of the whole kind of complex of communication between those prolines will riddle is really only tapping into the drugsability to destruct the dopamine and nor atronergic transporter it is three mechanisms of increasing dopamine norepinefran for dell and vive ants and by extension dextrin and it is only one mechanism for riddle to increase dopamine and norepinefran and therein mostly dopamine if we take a step back for a moment from all these drugs in all this celbiology of morons and forth and we go back to the brained works involved in attention member the orchestra mod or the teacher mood where the prefrontal quartan really sits in topcoat in terms of coordinating the actions both the sh the quieting and the yes please speak actions of the brain really bringing about what we think of as focus attention and last aging all the stuff that goes along with learning and focus and cognition well what we know is that dopamine and nor up ineferen which are differentially increase by these different drugs that we have been talking about also differentially impact the various aspects of executive function of the prefrontal quarter increasing our attention for specific things and while there is a lot of wants in the literature about this we can safely say a couple of things first of all increasing dopamine at particular snaps es and networks in the brain can serve as what is called noise reduction it can help further enhance the quieting of all that background stuff that background stuff can be attention to things in your environment noises or visual cues it could be some internal narrative thatched about yesterday or something that somebody said about you or something that somebody you would to say about you or whatever it might be that is happening in your head that is distracting you as well as your representation of your internal bodily state what we call interception this is a really important aspect of attention an we do not often hear about which is that we have the ability to attend to things outside of us which is called exteroceptor as well as an ability to attend to things inside of us which include things thoughts but also includes on for instance how empty or full a gut feels without were comfortable in our chair youknowhn when we think about the practice of focus and learning or focus sing as a verb it involves often forcing ourselves to sit still it often involves us suppressing the fact that our foot is a obit cramped or that we might need to use the restaurum for we might want to delay that for ten fifteen minutes even though it might be fairly urgent all these sorts of things are mental to our ability to attend and focus and dopamine while it does many different things in the brain many many different things one of its main functions in the context of all this prefrontal quarter and attention stuff is to quiet the amount of noise that is it helps the prefrontal quarter suppress the signals that would otherwise distract us into thinking about am conatherstyri now a i need use the rostrum i really want o make this collar tell really want to pick up my phone all of that stuff all of that suppression that h that guiding down of all the background chatter related the things external and internal to us in our head and our body is greatly facilitated by having more dooming present in the synapses that allow for what we call noise reduction now in parallel to that is more inefren nor intern is released from multiple signs in the brain and body but within the brain there is one major sit of neurons that manufacture norupin even and the name of that site is locus sedulous insist in the back of the brain it is chat a relatively small collection of neurons but they are very very powerful they extend their will axons their wires to multiple locations in the brain and they release group in ran at those locations think of them sort is a sprinkler system that originates from one very focal location but that can sprinkle more in even at multiple locations in the brain and the amazing thing about locuserulius and that sprinkler system is that indeed the sprinkler system can be pretty widespread where everywhere there is a sprinkler head somebody is getting group inefren but it also can fairly focally release ninepin earn at particular sits while in the contest of delays discussion dopamine is acting largely to impart noise reduction more inefren has the ability to boost signals at synapses to increase the amplitude and frequency of communication between neurons and in that way in the contexts of today's discussion group in ran when released at the particular synapses in the particular brained works that are related to attention and learning is largely serving to increase signal what we have in the contacts of a drug overall or giants or to some extent methelpenidate riddled does us as well is an increase in dopamine and neurapinefren that is leading to two things but the reduction in noise a quieting of the circuitry that we do not want to hear much from and in increase in the signal of the networks that we do want to pay attention to and the net effect of that noise reduction and signal amplification is what the engineers refer to as increased signal to noise and the consequence of that is a heightened subjective sense or ability to decide what we want a focus on sit down or stand there and just focus on it the way that we have been discussing drugs to treat eighty it and their ability to increase dopamine and norapinefron and thereby to reduce the amount of noise to speak in the brain and to increase the amount of signal related to things that we want to attend to all presumes that the amount of dopamine and the amount of norapanefron that is being increased is perfect for what we want to accomplish which is increased focus and reduced hyper activity and impulsivity but of course in the real world that is not always the case depending on the dosage of the drug one sensitivity to the drug even what stage of development across the life span a person is at things can really go haywire pretty fast and when ism referring to when i say haywire is you think about dopamine and its ability to reduce noise well dopamine does a bunch of other things as well and in fact we know that if dopamine is increased too much in the brain of somebody that has eighty hey or somebody that does not have eighty hey people can become euphoric people can becomemanic people can even become psychotic likewise if norapinefron is increased too much people will not just become alert they will become very anxious have panic attacks and depending on the drug their taking they may even experience very serious puerperal symptoms meaning elevated heart rate and sweating that it is superuncomfortable and on and on everything have been discussing up until now is true but i want to make it clear that it is true in the contexts of appropriately dosed prescribed drug for a given condition which leads us to the next question which is why would it be that giving these drugs which are in fact stimulants why would that calm kid down why would that common adult with it h t down and the answer to that is not completely straightforward and it is worth pointing out that not every one with eight h t has impulsivity and hyperactivity and therefore and inability to focus some kids and adults with eat h t do have challenges with impulsivity and hyperactivity some do not some just have challenges with focus and i did not entire episode about get h t and we are going to have an expert guessed on this podcast who specializes in the treatment of eighty h to to talk about some of these issues further but i just want to remind everybody that as in the general population children and adults with hey it are capable of very concentrated periods of focus the pattern however tends to by that children and adults with get it have a harder time getting into that state of focus and perhaps most importantly they have a very hard time getting into a forced state of focus for things that they do not enjoy doing ism sure many of you hlsothinging wait i do not to do certain things tents harder to focus on those things than on the things i of course does that mean i have eight h t an answer is not necessarily kids and adults with they it exhibit an extreme variation in their ability to focus such that if there is something they really really doing they can indeed focus however for many many other activities that are required in order to develop i guess will just call it normal life advancement sitting still listening to conversations that we may may not be particularly interested in that is where the challenges come about the point is at these brain networks and these normodulators opening in nor andeffron that we have been talking about in fairly straightforward terms as it relates to a drugs ability to crease their transmission and therefore an improved ability of focus presumes two things it presumes that the dosing is right that is that the levels of increases in these normodulators is just right and i also just want to acknowledge that eighty eight is first of all not in inability to focus at all it is immense challenges in focusing on lots of different things as required for normal life progression and it is also the case that there is no one specific pattern of eighty it that applies to every one with eighty h some people both kids and adults will exhibit the hyperactivity but not the impulsivity although those two things tend to go hand in hand some people i have a challenge in focus without hyperactivity impulsivity and forth and all this just really speaks to the complexity of eighty it and yet and yet we can confidently say that there are more drugs to treat eighty eight than any other psychiatric condition we have talked about a few of those now but among those overall giants riddling also call mithelfenidate there are time release versions there are different variations on those time release versions there is even straight exedra n which is prescribed forty t in some cases and on and on and you might also find it interesting to know that that very large kit of drugs all of which least the once we talk about far sympathemimatics are stimulants are more effective at treating eighty it then are any other collection of drugs for treating other psychiatric disorders what all of that diversity of symptomatology in eighty eat as well as differences insets activity to drugs in individual variation what all of that speaks to is that the large kit of drugs that is out there is design to be assessed with the careful consult of a very qualified psychiatric in order to allow the child or adult to arrive at the specific drug and the specific dosage that is ideal for their particular pattern of to t and that issue actually gives rise to the answer that now somewhat age old question as to why giving stimulants to a kid that is hyperactive would calm them down and the answer is that the hyperactivity impulsivity and focus issues present in get in children and adults are the consequence not necessarily of deficient activity of neral circuits in the prefrontal quarter or deficient activity of the default mode network or deficient activity of the salients network et camera what appears to be the case based on a lot of high quality near imaging data is that the brains of children and adults with eighty t have all of these networks functioning but those networks are actually hyper connected that is they tend to be coactive at times when ordinarily meaning in kids an adults without media sh they would not be coactive that is an important point because it is easy to get the impression that get h t is just a deficiency in dopamine a norapanefren and that simply not the case if you recall opening a normal in from are negro modulators they modulate the activity of other neral circuits and they can both increase and decrease activity within those circuits you do not necssurly one thngabout opening a normal an even just as molecules that increase neral activity and you certainly do not want a thing about eighty eight she is just a deficiency in dopamine or deficiency in normal aneurin the way these drugs work when they are used effectively to treat eighty t is to tune the amount of opening a nor an from that are present in or articular brain networks in order to allow the person to arrive at just the right balance between the activation of these different neural circuits causing them largely to be less syncerineus in their firing this takes us back to this question a why giving stimulants to a kid would calm them down it is not much that you're giving a stimulant to a kid to place them into a state of calm i think that is a common misconception rather by increasing dopamine in or a inferno these drugs less increase levels of over all autonomic arousal they are after all simpathomemetics but more importantly to the treatment of and symptoms you are activating the prefrontal quarter in a way that allows it to be more of a coordinator of that orchestra conductor or if you prefer the analogy to a teacher in the classroom to ramp up the activity of certain naval circuits in a given moment and quiet down the activity of other neural circuits such that the default mode network and still performance incredible actions after all the default mode network is involved not just in self referencing and kind of day dreaming but also creativity and imagination that is been well described in the literature as well as the salient's network in these other networks that are design to drop us into very narrow trenches of attention these drugs for the treatment of audit are are indeed stimulants but the goal of prescribing these drugs to a child or adult with atheist is to adjust dosage timing and the duration over which somebody takes it in their life span in order to allow those neural circuits to work in the proper way meaning for the conductor to activate the instruments in that little symphony or band in the appropriate order in order to arrive at the right music has supposed to all the instruments plying at once which just be complete noise or if gain if you prefer the class from teaching analogy for the teacher to call on one student while the others are quiet and than to call on a different student have once t return to their seats to have the students work in small groups again all f this by analogy the point being that opening and group aneurin are all allowing these networks to be activated to the precisely correct levels and in the precisely correct sequence now the other key aspect of drugs radar all five ends riddle and similar to treat eat it has everything to do with these neromodulators dopamine and group aneurin but it has to do with their other incredible feature besides just their ability to reduce noise and increase signal within these brain networks and that incredibly important feature is what we call neural plasticity or the brain and nervous systems ability to change in response to experience have done entire episodes of t supermen lad podcast on near plasticity what it is and how to access it at different stages of development and in adulthood by the way you can find those episodes at superman labor cam by simply searching plasticity in the search function but the important thing to understand about plasticity in the contexts of today's discussion is that while there many different ways to induce negro plasticity almost all of them almost all of them involve strongly activating certain brain networks and in that case also strong or elevated release of certain neuromodulators now we have talked about opening and group aneurin they are but too of many demodulators others include ceratonan see calling and each of the neromodulators does different things that difference in asses in the brain and there's some global statements that can be made about each of them we have made some of those earlier dopamine broadly involved in motivation craving in pursuit and nor up inefren in signal detection in drawing to focus or salients to something in our environment or in a a body or inner experience zartonan does other things a seat calling dos other things but what is really important understand is that any time there is a dramatic elevation in dopamine an norapanefren relative to base line relative to what was happening with dopamine an norapanefran just prior to that that has a tendency to promote hero plasticity at particular synapsis here is where it is appropriate to remind everybody that negro modulators are different than hero transmitters her transmitters are chemicals that just dopamine norapanefren are released between neurons and they are what actually contribute to the electrical signals going up or down between different neurons and again dopamine a norapanefren modulate that activity causing a given amount of neurotransmitter to have an even greater effect for instance when we hereabout dopamine a norapanefran and we here about motivation or focus et camera that is all fine in good but it is also important remember that when dopamine and norapanefren are increased there is a higher probability of strengthening connections where dopamine and norapanefrenare increased and what that means is that later even if levels of dopamine a norapanefren are not increased if they go back to base line it is often the case that if in our prior history or the history of a given set of neurons in our brain there was more dopamine nor norapanefran around it is very likely that the connections where that took place are strengthen and therefore more easily activated and this takes us back to the really original purpose of prescribing these sympathemamatic stimulants to children with eighty eight she during development it was yes design to try and help them focus to reduce their hyperactivity and help them focus but it was also desire to help the brain networks that are responsible for focus to undergo hero plasticity that is for the synapses involved to strengthen that those networks could function more efficiently later on even after cessation of the drug this is an absolutely crucial point that i think it is not often discussed when people for instant say should i put my kid on eighty egg it gets or should i take my kid off of eighty high t mess as they transition from adolescence to their later teen years and into college mean after all no child or parent or adult for that matter wants to achieve a bunch of benefits with a drug and then lose those benefits later nor does any parent or child want to take a drug that they do not need to take when they could access other routes to improving the curl circuitry or the function of some health system in the body because i do not think anyone really wants to medicate their kids unless they have to i would hope not and i do not think any kid wants to be medicated unless they absolutely need to be medicated increasing dope n in or up in efferent with these drugs overall vive ants riddling and similar is causing several things and some of those things actually provide some general answers as to whether not parents should put their kids on these compounds in the first place obviously here going to do that in the under the careful consult of a qualified psychiatrist i would hope and only under those circumstances but also whether r not the child should stay on those drugs over time and here is what we do know for sure i did a vast search within the literature in order to arrive at what is very clear which is that children with eighty east true eighty hit who are diagnosed with eighty high t and are treated with appropriate doses of drugs adarall riddling or vive ants fare far better both in childhood and later in life when it comes to performance in school performance in terms of focussing on anything and in terms of general outcomes for instance a lot of people have wondered and worried about whether or not treatment with these drugs early in life will set up a predisposition for elicit drug abuse or craving in addictive potential later and it is very clear from the studies that have emerged over the last really fifteen years but mainly within the last five years s that is when most of the at of arrived that children with eighty high t who are not treated correctly both with drugs and behavioral treatments because really the combination of drugs and behavioral treatments is the optimal situation kids with eighty h t who are not treated with drugs and behavioral treatments to deal with their eighty i it have a much higher tendency towards elicit drug use and addictive drug potential in their adulthood ones there is a real danger to not treating eighty h t during childhood and the reverse is also true which is that children with eighty eh it who take prescription drugs that a sympathememetics yes as you have heard they are speed amphedeminas speed although i should say if they take methyl phenidate riddle or concerto or something of that sort that is not amphedemie none the less it is a stimulant is a sympathemematic also these kids that are taking these drugs try development and therefore levels a dopamine levels of troupe and efferent are being increased in their brain and body and you might say well would not that lead to a craving for these things later in life and that does not appear to be the case in fact there are some very nice nor imaging studies mainly positronomission tomography studies that all provide a link to in the shown captions that show that early treatment with these drugs actually leads to comminations of increased dopamine transmission in the forbid later in life at a lower level a a lower threshold i should say in a way that essentially says there is normalization of the circuits across time by the application of these drugs early in life again in the case of children that have diagnosed eight eight i in no way she perform want to imply that all children should be treated with these drugs is quite clearly not going to be a good idea all of this really speaks to the critical importance of getting an accurate diagnosis of eighty eight yo diagnostic criteria include many things in children there multiple their more than nine diagnostic criteria for each of the categories relating to impulsivity hyperactivity and on a well qualified psychiatric will do several things they will first of all do a careful diagnostic evaluation of a child and in addition one would hope that they would think about prescribing both appropriate phormocalogic treatments radiaightsty but also be aware of and prescribe the various other types of prescriptions meaning behavioral prescriptions that are clearly certain learning tools and things that kids can do in order to improve their ability to focus and to be less impulsive that combine especially well with drug treatments as well as new advancements in the realm of neutrician and supplementation that are constantly coming on line and the best psychiatric are going to be turned into all of those aspects of treatment for mighty go t not just prescription drugs but also behavioral treatments also nutritional guidelines also supplementation and also updating each in all of those things as a child matures from each stage of development to the next now the other common question is if a child has been treated with these eighty high tea mess staring development do they need to continue on those drugs indefinitely and the short answer to this is it depends and that can be a somewhat frustrating answer i realize but the good news is it is something that can be assessed in a fairly straightforward way let us recall that the use of these drugs to treat eighty eighty is design to accomplish two things its design to improve the function of those neral circuits that allow a child to focus and it is also design to increase the strength of those circuits to effectively teach the circuits how to learn what focus is in other words these drugs are designed in some cases to be used and then withdrawn later because the circuits that they helped build up are functioning well in some cases however the circuits that under lie focus are not going to be able to function at the level required for normal healthy life progression unless there is continued application of the drug how would this work in the real world contact well think any child or adolescent or person younger than twenty five that is taken these drugs has no doubt achieved some level of natural plasticity of the nail circuits related to all the things we call focus and i want to be very clear there's no single brain area or set of brain circuits for what i referring to is focus because after all focus wolves task switching focus involves all sorts of different connive operations depending on what were focusing on the focusing on a sport is basically a practice of directing one's attention indifferent locations at different moments focusing on studying is an entirely different pattern of focus all together but the point being if a person twenty five years or younger takes a drug that increases dooming the more aneurin and assuming that things are working meaning the dose is right their achieving better ability to focus et camera those circuits are going to get stronger and it seems entirely reasonable in fact it was supported by the psychiatrist that i spoke to prior to this episode that people have been on eighty eighty mess for any point of time prior to twenty five talk to their psychiatrist about what tapering off those drugs in order to examine whether or not they still need those drugs would look now i mention the were taper because there is with drill potential of simply stopping these drugs very quickly because they do ramp up opening and noripanefron even though they increase plasticity of the nor circuits for focus and mood and motivation if one very abruptly ceases taking any of these drugs it does not feel good that drop and dopamine that one inevitably experiences is almost always associated with lethargy with depressed mood with feeling not good in a number ways and of course challenges in focus any time one is going to go off one of these drugs or sample what it is to even reduce dosage that has to be done in close communication with a word certified psychiatrist at the same time it was made very clear to me from t h t expert psychiatric that reductions in dosage over time often are optimal for a patient and this gets to the whole issue of dosage generally i spend a good amount of time talking to somebody who proscribes these drugs both to children and adults about dosage ranges and i do not want to spend too much time on this from the perspective of how much one should take in fact in want any one to think that what ism about to say should dictate what they should take specifically because that something that really has to be worked out on an individual basis but it is worth noting that you look at the studies on thrall and methelfhenedate button will see it is a pretty broad range in those studies and that is because some of the studies you used people that were already taking these drugs and ask them to participate in her imaging studies other studies actually put people on these drugs for the very first time or adjusted their dosage and you will see a a tremendous range of drug doses explored for instance you will see anywhere from ten to forty milligrams of thrall per day you will see anywhere from ten to sixty milligrams of riddling per day and here we could easily be talking bout stud is on children or adults with respect to giants you will see that the dosages tend to be much higher in part that is because vive ants has if you recall it is that license which is a big molecules stuck on d m predefine which is a smaller molecule and the dosages of vive ants tend to be in the hundreds of milligram ranges but most of that hundred milligrams of vive ants is not going to be the d amphetamine its going to be the linen which does not do anything in the context of treating the brain is just their to control the slow release it is thought that a hundred milligrams of giants translates to roughly nine milligrams of thrall and on and on and actin it is pretty hard to translate between dosages of different drugs in any direct way and in speaking with a psychiatrist expert in eighty eat in preparation for the episode he made very clear that it is extremely extremely difficult to predict how a child or adult will react to a given dosage of any of these struts much in fact that he an totally report to me that one of his patients is a man three hundred pounds diagnose with eighty t and who achieves tremendous relief from just two point five milligrams of thrall per day and at the same time he has two patients both of whom are sister they genetically related who are in the hundred and twenty to hundred and forty pound range who did not respond well at all for the treatment of their eighty t until their dosages were very very high and if i tell you these dosages i just want to warn you in advance i am not suggesting any one explore these dosages without of course the approval of their psychiatrist turns out that neither of these two young women responded at all to eighty sh medication until they achieve dosages in the range of a hundred and eighty in the case of one sister and two hundred and forty milligrams in the case of the other sister per day which is an astronomically hidroses on the face of it but this physician again board certified physician expel it in eightieth verified for me that indeed neither of them experience any discomfort or she effects that let them do not want to take the drug but of course that amount of overall could send somebody else into an absolute psychotic fit could potentially even cause cardiacchoressed i mean its remarkable the ranges of aver all that are used effectively in children and adults and this is true for a lot of the other sympathememetics used to treat eighty to and of course the good sychatris will always assess dosage as it relates to positive benefits in a relief of symptoms relief of impulsivity relief of hyperactivity improvements in ability to focus and of course they they are going to consider side effects any uncomfortable adverse effects that come from taking the drug at a given dosage or taken the drug at all now of course the all begs the question a why such tremendous variation is this due to genetic differences in the amount of doomed or nor p anefferon that people make it appears that the major underlying factor for why people require such vastly different dosages of these sympathememetics for the relief of eghtihty has to do with the different enzymes or levels of animes that people make which metabolize these drugs both in the brain and body and unfortunately there is no simple blood test or saliveattest or test of any kind that can predict how someone will respond to these drugs the most logical and safe way to assess dosage is to start with the lowest possible effective dose and to increase only as necessary in order to achieve the positive benefits while of course paying attention to any side effects that might arise a question that comes up from time to time when discussing the long term effects of drugs deal riddling and vive ants is whether or not they can negatively impact height or growth or development in some other way this is a logical question to ask because after all these drugs are effectively mimicking stress in the body and most everyone is heard by now that while stress can help us in the short term it helps us deploy a mine molecules to protect us against infection it sharpens ore visual focus in our ability to respond to things for survival chronically elevating our stress over long periods of time we know reduces the effectiveness of around system and can actually cause certain forms of brain degeneration and while there are not a lot of longitudinal studies on the heights of kids with eighty it and of course we never can tell how tall someone would have grown to be if they were treated with a drug because we do not have a perfect control experiment even in the case of identical twin experiments and therein there are not that many of those examples where one twin was treated ready h t in the other was not et camera but here is what we know it does not appear that treatment with sympathemametic staring development provided the dosages are kept in the appropriate ranges is going to limit over all height in fact if you look at the data it appears that children with eighty eh t who are treated with eighty h t mess actually arrive at slightly higher beam is body mass indexes compared to we matched peers now of course body man index does not necessarily correlate with height right some one could not achieve a full height but could be heavier either through bone or fat or muscle or commination of all three but what we know is that the appropriate use of eat i mess during development is not stunting development in any kind of over all way it is not preventing maturation of the body in ways that are leading to reduced weight or somehow impaired growth over all with that said long term elevations of sympathetic nervous system activity does carry some risk and one of the primary risks that people of wondered about is party of vascular risk this makes perfect sense right when you increase the activity the sympathetic nervous system you crease blood pressure you in crease heart rate you increase in some cases perfect sweating i all the things that we associate with stress is you can imagine that a child or adult with eight h that takes these sympathemametics every day even if the dosage is kept in arrange that does not allow them to experience any immediate untoward side effects they are not feeling miserable they are just filling they can focus better but one always wonders what is going on under the hood to speak there is as far as i know one major study that is address this and the conclusions of that study were a little bit hard to put into a single category it did point to a subtle increase in party of vascular risk but the results did not point to anything dramatic that the authors of the study warned against taking these drugs or encouraging people to cease taking these drugs again provided there being prescribed by aboard certified physician for eighty high t end at the appropriate dosage for that person that said i think this all again speaks to the importance of arriving at minimal effective dosage and it stands to reason that if your somebody whose taking they high t mess or if your child is taking eighty right t mess that one would want to do all the other things that they could do in order to try an improve party of vascular health or at least not put it at additional risks those are going to be the obvious things avoiding smoking or raping nicotine ism regular exercise is going to be encourage and things of that sort and that dove tails into a bunch of other questions that are often asked any time the topic of natural riddling comes up which is what about alcohol is drinking alcohol at the same time or at different times even going to be problematic if one is taking these drugs is taking bens the diazapines going to be a problem et camera et camera there is a very straight forward answer to this which is it is very clear that alcohol certainly in children but also an adults is best not consumed i did entire episode about alcohol ice got into this and the data for this if you have heard that having some call in particular red wine is better for you than no call that is simply not true sorry it is not true most adults who are not alcoholics can probably have up to two that is rite two drinks per week and still i be on the safe side of health although zero is better than two and once you get past two these start seeing effects on serious systems including in crease cancer risk especially brain nor on loss and degeneration risk i covered all of those data an the episode and all that you can fined it supermen lapdog came combining alcohol with sympathememetics even though they reside in very different pathways within the brain in fact the sympathememetics are driving up sympathetic nervous system activity oral alcohol is actually doing the opposite depressing it and yet all the data point to the fact that combining alcohol with sympathememetics such as five ants lateral riddle in it or any kind of emphedemine is going to be more detrimental to the brain and body than simply taking those drugs on their own put differently and more directly if you are taking any of the drugs that we have been talking about to treat eighty it or if you just happen to be taking them for whatever reason you are going to want to avoid drinking alcohol at any time and you are going to want to avoid benzol diazapines and similar unless they have been prescribed to you by your physician in advance of this episode i put a call out on social media for questions about overall et camera and i got a lot of questions about whether or not their impacts of these drugs on the hormone systems of the body and if they impact the reproductive system in particular igloo got questions about whether not these drugs impact sexual behavior or albedo or anything of that sort in reviewing the lite sure what i can tell you is that there are very few studies unfortunately of the long termeffects of these drugs on the undergrad or hormone systems of the body but we do know a few things for shore first of all when you increase the activity of the sympathetic nervous system for long periods of time you are very likely increasing levels of coatis all cortisols coming stress hormone but cortical also plays some really important positive rolls in your body in fact you want cortesall released specially early in the day you do not want cortisol release much late in the day this actually relates back to timing and schedules of taking drugs as to something again that needs to be worked out with your psychiatrist were your child's psychiatrist but one of the reasons why there are many different drugs for the treatment of eighty hey is that each and all of them has a different time course of action riddled is very short lived which might sound bad because then you have to take it multiple times throughout the day but if you think about from the perspective of sleep in the importance of having low cortex all at night and these drugs increase cooties all and the importance of getting sleep because after all sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance in kids and adults its responsible for growth its when narrow plasticity happens is just vitally important a lot of the drugs that we have been talking about can severely limit one's ability to fall and stay asleep and a short acting drug riddling is actually attractive from the perspective of being able to take it in the morning and still get asleep at night or taking it in the morning and in the afternoon and may be even again in the evening depending on the person and then still being able to fall asleep at night whereas long duration release of d amphetamine which is what you get when you take vive ants for some people is going to inhibit their sleep they will get a nice steady rise and improvement in focus and reduction in hyper activity but they might have a lot of trouble falling asleep at night and thrall having a somewhat intermediate time course of action between riddled which is short lived and vive ants which is very long lived perhaps is going to be the best solution for somebody else where they can take it early in the day perhaps a low dose may be again later in the day low dose and then still fall asleep at night but have spoken to people and spoke to this inclination expert and a d g who told me that some people to take as little as two point five milligrams of deal at six a m and have a hard time falling asleep later that night at eleven p mass again vastly different sensitivities to these drugs leading to vastly different requirements of dosage and timing of in take and which particular drug somebody might choose to or choose not to take how does that relate to hormones and see and reproduction well cortical itself is a hormone it can act as a bit of a hormone and a negro transmitter in the brain but for the most part it is acting as a hormone in the brain and body and it does a number of things first of all it can enhance your levels of focus an alertness it can activates doorman system i know the iminologis out their just cringe when i say activate the man system urban system is always doing various things ism it is always active just as your nervous system is always active but it can to be specific it can amplify or mobilize the release of antiar inflammatory molecules in your brain embody to combat different types of bacterial viral and fungal infections doing an enormous number of positive things it is also involved in setting mood has interactions with fibroid hormone pathways have done entire episodes about cortical and cortical regulation to paint all of that with a very broadbrush and briefly now it is advantageous to have your cortical release high in the early part of the day and to taper off toward the end of the day in fact late day elevations and cortical are a strong corset of depressive symptoms this was demonstrated by my colleagues avid eagle and robot supolskat stamford school of medicine but that is not to say that cortical is bad it is to say that the timing of cortical release is he do these sympathememetic drugs disrupt the indican system well they can if you are very awake and very alert regardless of whether not your taking your sympathemometic treatment for any t early in the day or late in the day you are very likely experiencing elevations in cortiesall late in the day it is important even for those view that to study and needs to focus in the evening an night time hours that you try and limit your levels of over all alertness and certainly stress late in the day because doing that day after my after day for several weeks or months or years can windy disrupt other hormones in the indican system and again that is because cortisols interaction with theroid hormone and testosterone and estrogen in fact cortesall in many ways competes with or can outcompete for the production of testosterone and other called steroid hormones remember cortesall itself is a aortic steroid hormone when we hear the steroids oftentimes people busting aby athletes and steroid house in sports but stead hormones includes a lot of different types of hormones which are good for us are dodging a stray hormones are vital for all sorts of things vitality reproduction et camera and the way this works in general terms is that the collateral molecule is used to create testosterone and cortesall and estrogen if we make too much cortesall we in many ways are reducing the total amount of testosterone that we make or that is active it's not exactly that straightforward but we can make that statement with with confidence for instance if you spike your cortesall just briefly during the decay of some sort of stressful event that is not going to inhibit your testator in fact it probably is going to boostyour testosterone levels somewhat however if your cortical levels or chronically elevated yes indeed it is likely that you are going to suppress your total and or free unbound forms of testosterone and downstream to that you will expert its effects such as reductions an libido reductions in a muscle and bone mass reductions in all sorts of aspects of testosterone related psychology and bodily biology this is true for both males and females and the same thing could be said for estrogen now what is impossible for us to say is whether not taking a given treatment for ahoy h t is going to for instance prevent a woman from ovulating that could happen through chronic elevations and martial but there is no direct length meaning there are no studies at least that ism aware of showing that people that take overall have irregular adulatory psyches or that they cease menstruating entirely i do not think there is any evidence for that whatsoever nor is there any evidence that people that take lateral or other sympathememetics for the treatment of eighty h have lower over all testostro in fact you can imagine all sorts of instances in which the opposite was true that a child or young adult or adult who has eighty h t but then goes on these mess to improve their symptoms is now focusing and achieving more life we know that happiness can impact dopamine and vice verse and testosterone levels and productivity itself and reaching our goals can feed back on the hormone system any time there is a discussion about hormones or a study that shows that doing acts or not doing we impacts hormone levels of a given type we have to be very careful to make sure that were talking about causality because all of these hormones are in a very intricate crosstalk with one another we can however make a very general statement which is that when you are in states of stress for long periods of time that is not a favorable condition for vermin system your hormone system or frankly any other system in the brain and body the treatment of eighty high c with these drugs should never be done at the expense of these other critical biological systems another common question and concern is whether r not kids i suppose for that matter adults that take medication for eighty h t are basically being predisposed to psychosis and or other forms of addiction and early are we talked a bit about the risk for a diction and the take message there is very clear that kids and adults that are treated for adit t appropriately with the appropriate dosage of the appropriate drugs under the supervision of aboard certified qualified psychiatric are at less risk for forming addictions to other substances in adulthood or other substances generally i think a lot of people also wonder whether or not those kids and those adults that take the eighty eight t mess become addicted to the medications themselves it is a bit of a tricky issue to resolve any time one stops taking a drug or even tapers off a drug that is used to treat something where they feel better on the drug they are going to experience two sets of effects and these two sets of effects are often confounded with one another one is the withdrawal effects the effects of removing the drug that makes somebody feel less good than base line for instance a kid that takes eighty h t mess until there lateens or early twentieth decides there going to taper off they do that and their feeling lousy during the taper or when they reduce their dosage to zero their in foggy brain they cannot focus they feel bit depressed mood it is unclear whether or not those are withdrawal symptoms or whether or not those of the consequence of not having the systems in their brain activated the way that those systems were activated before i realize that for some of you that might seem the same thing but that is not necessarily the same thing and probably the best analogy would be something along the lines of a hang over right if somebody drinks too much on a given night the next morning they have a hang over the hang over makes them feel lousy it sit is actually withdrawal from alcohol effect but then when they recover from the hang over they realize that their sober state that feels pretty good it does not obviously feel the same as being on alcohol but that sober state is not a state of withdrawal o cay if we are to look at removal or tapering off of eighty eight steeds there is going to be a period of with drawl symptoms but then the real question is how to somebody feel after they get through those with drawl symptoms that is an important issue o highlight now in terms of psychosis this is a very interesting and very important literature first of all any amphetamine whether was d amphetamine elemphedamine and also methelphenidate for that matter riddling can induce psychosis now there are number different factors that are going to predispose somebody to psychosis having a first relative whose had psychotic episodes either sketsophrenic episodes or by dollar episodes is certainly a strong predisposition of course of an individual themselves have had psychotic episodes that is the strongest predisposition that one can imagine having a first relative with sgitsophrenia or with by polar depression or sometimes called by polar disorder sometimes it is also just called by polar these days is going to be a strong predisposition for psychotic episodes made much greater any time one takes a sympathememetic dog such as amphetamine but also methelphenadate riddle is going to increase that likelihood of psychotic episodes then comes the question of if somebody has a psychotic episode as the consequence of taking any of these drugs whether not it is been prescribed for eighty eight or not will those psychotic symptoms go away after the person stops taking the drug there appears to be a divide in the literature or rather a divide according to drug such that people that take riddling methelphenidate and have a psychotic episode often not always but most often if they stop taking methelphenadate the psychotic episode will cease not always the case but most oftentimes it will cease whereas in individuals who have a predisposition to psychosis or even if they are not aware of a predisposition o psychosis and they take lateral which as you recall his a commination of d and elemphedamine they can have psychotic episodes that sometimes are very long lasting even after the cessation of the drug and while that might sound kind of shocking and really scary and indeed it is scary it perhaps should not shock us that much because if you recall d amphetamine which there is a lot of in lateral it is a very potent way of increasing dopamine and any time you potently increase dopamine in a person who has a predisposition to psychotic episodes you are shifting the whole system toward a greater propensity for psychosis this would also be the appropriate time to talk about met methamphetamine gan metal phenazine is considered an elicit drug a drug of abuse it is responsible for a lot of the misfortune and tragedy that you see on the streets of major cities and even outside of major cities in rural areas it has all sorts of negative effects on health including oral health cardiovascular health o it is negro toxic to sir generic neurons but kills ceratonanerons that is absolutely clear it kills dopaminergicnerons that is absolutely clear one of the was that metal phenazine create many of the problems that it does aging effects on the body abuse potential addictive potential the fact that metal phenazine can spark psychosis in those that have a predisposition to psychosis but also that it can create psychosis in individuals who have no predisposition to psychosis and all of this points to methamphetamine just being a terrible drug all around and yet if you recall back to the beginning of the episode there is one form of prescription methamphetamine but its uses are extremely narrow and its probably best left out of this conversation because its use s are narrow in the clinical sense i mange to talk to one expert this is a word cart ivied psychotic whose expert in eighty eighty who was also her y familiar with the psychosis symptoms induced by methemphedemine and by various eighty eights drugs and people who have the predisposition they made it very clear that any of the sympathemand metic eighty eight it drugs that are of the amphetamine variety that would be overall and extended release overall will be pure dexidron or any variance that include amphetamine are going to have higher likelihood of inducing psychosis in people that have a predisposition of psychosis and yet they did assure me that at appropriately prescribed and safe dosages that the total incidence of psychosis in people that take those drugs is still fairly low and not that much greater than in the general population although there is an increased risk it is not that severe and they also highland the fact that methelhenidae ridden carries a lower potential for inducing psychosis not zero but a lower level induing psychosis than for the inphedemine types in pathememetics now one exception is a giants that long release the amphedemige than we talked about earlier there does seem to be something protective about that long duration release of de amphedeminge that occurs with giants which is not to say that there is zero abuse or addictive potential with giants om i was told by this same individual that indeed om they have had knowledge of patients trying to increase the rate absorption of giants and release of divans or technically of the do amphetamine in order to get more of a high from giants as oppose to justice extended release but they did assure me however that giant seems to be associate with fewer psychotic episodes and less abuse and addictive potential over all which again is not to say that it is a perfectly safe drug but really this just highlights the fact that the genetics are the time course of dopamine and noripanephran release that is caused by a given drug is going to correlate very strongly with its abuse potential and add active potential and it is potential to induce psychotic episodes and this is where the discussion about met becomes especially relevant one of the reasons why met is dangerous in terms of it is addictive potential and it is potential to induce psychotic episodes is first of all how much dopamine it releases again five times more than any of the other drugsthat we have been talking about but also how fast that peak comes on it is a very fast onset and that is true whether not people are snorting it thou there taking earlier especially if they inject it intrivaneously but met because it increases dopamines fast into such a great degree and then the the peak an dopamine comes down very fast as well and it drops below the base line levels of dopamine that were at present initially that is one of the reasons why metal phedamina dangerous in terms of addiction and in terms of psychotic episodes this gets back to a bunch of issues we have talked about before on the huberuman labpodcasts about dopamine genetics and have done two episodes on dopamine that ill refer you to one is called dopamine motivation and drive which is all about dopamine and regulating dopamine and the other one is about optimizing dopamine it is more tool kit focused episode both those who con find at subhuman labor combat the general take away that is relevant for what were talking about now is that with dopamine it is not just about the absolute levels of dopamine that are reach but how long lasting those increases in dopamine are with viveants even though vive ans is d amphetamine it is fairly potent to is potent as met but fairly point increasing dopamine i foreman even it is a long extended release in dopamine the foreman from which reduces its over all abuse potential because it does intend to create that immediate euphoria and high and then crash below base line lot of view will hear that it increases dopamine a lot and then stays up as translating to oke well then you are just euphoric for sixteen hours but that is not the case when it comes to dopamine it is an issue of how high that peak is and whether not that p is stable or when n it comes down again and when it comes to psychotic episodes or addictive potential it seems that any drug or behavior the increases dooming very quickly and then brings dopamine down very quickly is what sets the high potential for addiction and abuse and for inducing psychotic episodes that is why am talking about these two things in parallel and now it should be very clear why giants does not have much addictive in abuse potential and has at least lower potential for inducing psychotic episodes and it should also be clear to you that for people who do not have eighty eight she as a child or for people that do not have eighty eights in adulthood if they were to take any truly any of the compounds that were talking about thus far methelphenadate riddling deal giants exocrine and certainly met them phenazine what we observe from narrow imaging studies is that these people get enormous increases in dopamine they are not familiar with these drugs that increases in dopamine are just cosmic for them they experience a lot of euphoria even if the dosages are low the euphoria associate with the very heightened degree of focus they never really felt before hear what ism talking about is a lot of the recreational and off prescription use of deal and things it and what we know is that that sets in motion both a potential for abuse and addiction to that feeling and substance as well as a higher potential for psychotic episodes down the road hero put differently children who have yeasty and are prescribed any of these drugs or adult who have eighty eight she and are prescribed any of these drugs who take them for some period of time are actually at less or risk to all of the issues related to having chronically elevated and greatly elevated dopamine as a first time o v it or as a rare event whereas anyone who takes these drugs without a prescription and besides o a one a focus more i am going to uses to stay up for a couple of days anotherwards using it recreational or using it for going performance enhancement is that far greater risk for addiction to these substances because of the amplitude and the time course of dopamine that results when one takes these drugs just out of the blue and for that reason i really on a caution everybody against using any of the compounds that have discussed thus far unless it is been prescribed to you by a physician for the specific purpose of eighty h t now's sure some one out there s screaming from the back wait if a kid takes these drugs because there prescribed them for eighty h t the very first time they take them there can have a huge amplitude dopamine response or of an adult goes in and talks to their psychiatric and scenic haven't issues with focusing in their prescribed one of these mess for eight get and they take it they're on to have a huge amplitude dopamine response is not that going to set in motion all the same things that somebody who is using these drugs recreational would have and indeed that is one of the reasons why a lot of psychotic will start with a very low dosage or the lowest possible dosage to see how somebody responds that low dosage and then over time might or might not increase that dosage in fact they might even bring it down further depending on how sensitive somebody is to the drug but equally important is the fact that it is the repeated taking of that drug by the child with eighty high t or by the adult with eighty eight s that actually leads to lesser and lesser peaks in dopamine each time which is not to say that the person becomes entirely desensitize to the effects of the drug but rather that the system equilibrates through what is called homeostatic plasticity sometimes referred to broadly as habituation to a drug but there are systems in the brain and body that regulate the connections between neurons that if dopamine en foreman affray are elevated above baseline levels for a while the system normalizes that instead the connections between neurons become stronger and there is not the critical requirement for all that increase in dopamine norepaneffran i realize that might poundal technical but basically what i am saying is the response that somebody has to taking a drug for the first time is far and away different then the response to a drug that somebody has if they are taking the same drug day after day after day this gets to another issue which is not discussed that off in these days but that is really important you go back to the original clinical literature on these sympathememetics it you will find is that the original use of these sympathememetics to treat childhood eighty eighty suggested that children not take these drugs every single day now ism not recommending that kids take drug holidays because ism not a cognition ism not promoting any specific dose or dosing regiment but in speaking again to a psychiatrist expert in eighty eighty who by the way is going to be a guest on this podcast in the not two distant future what he told me was that many of these drugs were design to be taken during the school week for children with weak ends off or during the school year which weakens off but then also with vacations during the summer holidays and that these days rarely if ever is that the pattern of in take that these kids are following and why that is has interesting sociological and financial explanations not alluding to any kind of conspiracy here but this is an aspect of the dosing with these drugs that is fallen away in recent years ah but i think is really interesting and it something that actually was supported for the treatment of a dust eighty eighty as well again there is a very different biological and neural plastic response to taking a drug once verses taking a drug for s ay five days and the taking weakens off to taking a drug over and over again every single day for a pattern of years and when exploring the literature an preparation for this episode i confess it was a bit dizzying to find answers to what are the long term effects of taking deal or what are the long term effects of taking vive ants et camera in fact most of the literature on the long term effects of taking drugs to treat eighty high t has focus on methelfenida on riddle there are studies on vive ants and natural and actually those were the studies a that i will link in the shownote captions primarily cause that is where most of the interest as these days the reason why many of the studies have focused on methelfenida on riddle is largely because that was one of the first drugs used to treat eighty eh t in terms of addressing long term effects of kids treated with eighty high d mess those kids are now adults on and therefore can be narrow image ton a less whereas a lot of kids that have been prescribed deal or vive ants or similar have not yet made it to stages of life in which we can answer that question directly there are few studies and have made it clear to include those studies in my description of results to day in particular the result i talked about earlier where there is an improvement in executive function in kids that have taken eighty high t mess or adults that have taken eighty high t mess for a longer period of time anywhere from months to years those studies did include both aural and vive ants and methelfenidate and again o link to those studies but by and large most of what we know about the long term effects of any of these drugs has to do primarily with studies of methyl denudate it'd to spend a little bit of time talking about some compounds that are not considered amphetamines at all but that are now being used to treat eighty high t both in children and adults more frequently the major drug in this category of non anfedamine treatments for eighty high t is modaphenil which is also called by its commercial name prodigal there is a variance on this which is armodaphanil which goes by the brand name newvigil the major difference between modapanil and armodaphanil aside from having a slight chemical difference is that modaphinil was released first armodahanils the second in the generation of these drugs and modaphanil tends to be very expensive that is one of the reasons why it is prohibitive for some people to take it can be as expensive as twenty five dollars a pill or more to more than a thousand dollars per month and armodaphanl tends to be far far less expensive talk bookable experts about whether not there are any genuine differences between these two drugs and they report no although consumers of these drugs whatever reason whether not placebo or not report yes there is a different when i say placebo i in no way mean that these drugs are just acting as placebo i just mean that no people tend to get very attached to certain drugs and whether or not the brand name or the generic version works better for them there is all sorts of lore about this in fact a there are lot of people out there who strongly feel that brand name adarall works better than generic adarall for them there r lot of people out there who say the same thing about giants the lot of people out there say the same thing about riding and all sorts of drugs whether not that is true or not is unclear it is clear that generic versions of drugs can use binders and other things that are in the pill or capsule that are different than what the grandame pillar capsule uses as binders to hold the drug together and that can impact rates of release an metabolism et camera but a lot of this is just lower in fact i went into the literature o try and find any real concrete support for the idea that generic adarall is less potent or less effective than grandame adarall and despite the tens of thousands of people who will say to the contrary i could not find any purereviewed published data about that who knows maybe it is a belief eff it as it is called o maybe there is a real difference there nowadays modaphinl and armodapinal are prescribed for a huge range of daytime sleepiness issues and we were talking about narcolepsy but there also people who suffer from daytime sleepiness related to dementia daytime sleepiness related to post surgery anesthesia e others this thing where people have surgery and the the tomato surgery and they feel better for a few days but than they find that they are not recovering their normal levels of wakefulness it is prescribe sometimes to try and get people back into a normal state of wakefulness to prescribed for dramatic head injury after stroke again all of the prescribed uses half to be carried out by a certified physician you really do not want o start convoying on the use of modaphinor armodaphin or any other prescription drug for that matter must say that in discussing all these different drugs during to day's episode i have zero knowledge of any of these drugs from a first tan experience except for armodapinol back in twenty seventeen i was prescribed a very very loose of armodapino for jet lag for daytime sleepiness issues really when i was travelling over seas to give a talk armodaphinil was given to me in a twenty five milligram tablet it was advised to me that i take a half or even a quarter of that i started with a quarter i am a believer in minimal effective dose ism also somebody whose fairly hyper sensitive to most medication i took what i measured out to be five to seven milligrams of armodapin and what i experienced was pretty profound certainly it relieved any daytime sleepiness in fact it made me feel extremely alert for a period of about four to six hours i cannot say it was the most comfortable state although i did not feel as if i had racing hard for anything of that sort basely felt as if i was in a narrow tunnel of attention for that entire period on one thing i did not about the y experience is that it was a very hard experience to come down from there was no crash but i found that that higherawsal state did not taper off for many hours later even though it was most lighten for four hours i would say anywhere from eight to twelve hours later i still felt i was you know blinking once every four minutes or and have certainly been accused on this podcast and at other times of blinking to seldom a to my knowledge i do not have eighty h t have never been prescribed eighty h t mess have never have been tested for any h t i do not think i have eighty h t and yet taking armodapinel certainly increased my levels of attention but least by that one experience it is not something that i would want to repeat again i certainly would not want to be in that state for learning new material when i sit down to research of podcast or research papers in my lab or forage for information or learn from people a books or lectures or podcast i want to be in a state of alertness but calm where i can really consider the ideas where i can script things out by hand am big believer in writing things out by hand to remember them later drawing little diagrams i would not want to be in the state that even that very logos of armodaphinl put me in in order to learn and i should mention that both modaphinl and armodaphinel are associated with good number of side effects if they do not agree with you or if the dosage is too high things decreased pet people get a running not headache here is this a instance of skin rashes in fact one of the reasons why modaphinel and armodaphinel are not more broadly prescribed is that there is a very rare skin condition in which people who have taken certain drugs nachos modahinor armodaphinel have developed these very severe burn tight blisters and in some cases this can be fatal this is again very rare and it was observed in at least one patient a who took a modaphinel is part of a trial for modaphinel is a treatment for eighty h to it is called steepens johns centrum please if you are squeamish to images of a skinabrasions and lesions and things of that s ort please do not look it up on the internet unless a you're able to handle that and may be not at all but a the point here is that one of the reasons that modaphnl and armodaphinel are not more widely prescribed for eighty h t and that it still only prescribed off label is that steppes johns centrum was flag was kind of a potential risk although the eighty go t specialists that i spoke to are somewhat frustrate with that because they insists that the frequency of this a centrum that causes the skinrash that sometimes fatal is no more frequent in those that took modaphinel in this trial than with other drugs that have been approved this gets into all sorts of issues around what drugs make it to approval in which ones do not and as we know modaphenon armodaphnel are already being prescribed in the general population for other things ow this was dealing specifically with the question of whether not should be prescribed in kids with eighty go t and a certainly i am a proponent of exerting extreme caution when thinking about which drug should be approved for the treatment of anybody but especially kits and to round out our discussion of drugs used for the treatment of eighty go t that fall into let us call it the a typical category write the typical category being thrall vive ends atholpenadate and things of that variety the less typical would be modaphinel armodaphinel bropriren wobutren and forth the last in this category of a typical is guanpacine guanpacine is an interesting compound it is a compound that was developed to lower blood pressure and indeed it does lower blood pressure and it is an alto a agonist alpaca being a receptor for nor epinephrin guanphacine is a non stimulant medication to treat eighty h t and it is also used to treat some other conditions as well that is only working on the noragronergic system and is not tapping in to the dopamine system but all the other stuff that we talked about is really camping up dopamine and norupaneferon guanpacine is only increasing nor in affray and its doing by what we say agonizing or stimulating one particular aspect of the norageronergic system an that is the alphitua system what is interesting about guanphacine is that it has a bunch of pathways that it activates that feed back on to the autonomic nervous system to dampen down the activation of the sympathetic nervous system whereas most of what we talk about to day are sympathomemetics that can to make us more ramped up or aroused and alert guanphacine is doing the opposite and as a consequence it is not prescribed that often because a lot of times when people take guanphasine it either has no effect on eighty eighty symptoms or tends to make people feel very sleepy however there is a small subset of individuals about five to ten per cent of people that try it including kids that do get some significant relief from their eighty eighty symptoms and they seem to tolerate graph some better than their tolerating some of the other drugs that we have talked about up until now the waguanphacine works is also really interesting you are now familiar with the locus sedulous this packet or we call it a nucleus of neurons in the back of the brain that release group in affray at other sights in the brain and there can to be those alpaca receptors that guanphacine works on and stimulates lots of different places in the brain related to increasing aliens and a relevant of particular timely that we see n that we need to attend to it appears that guaphacine can activate the prefrontal cortical networks in ways that are above their normal base line that is good improvements and executive function that orchestra or teacher function we talked about before and can increase the efficacy of that output from locus sedulous and what that seems to do is increase the coordinated firing of locus rules neurons withdrew front of quarter in many ways it is acting a fine tuning of that orchestra conductor operation that is valuable in teaching these brain circuits during childhood of how to attend to one thing and ignore everything else this is one reason why guanfasine is now approve not just for adults with eighty eight it but is primarily used in kids aged six to seventeen years old for the treatment of eighty eight it again with the hope that these kids can take the drug in these circuits can learn how to focus and how to attend to certain things and limit impulsivity and hyperactivity and then perhaps come off the drugs although sometimes again people have to stay on them indefinitely the other thing about guapacine is that because it lowers blood pressure and it has this effect of dampening down over all sympathetic arousal sometimes it is prescribed in conjunction with other eighty eight it mess yes there are kids out there and adults out there who are taking natural enguanfasine or their taking vive ants enguanfasine and this where it starts to get in to drug cocktails and a bunch of other a things that get everybody a little but uncomfortable i think because the idea of taking one drug to dampen down the side effects of another drug and to offset things in conpasate t is getting towards what is call jolly pharmacology and i think it is understandable that people be concerned about that and yet gan in viewing this with some of the experts on eighty eight we the do seem to be a certain category of children out there an adults who really struggle with the standard eighty eight it mess and in that case guanfasine has provided a certain number of these individuals tremendous relief one note about guanine in no way she perform in my encouraging anyone who is not prescribed guanfasine to take it but should some one whose taking guanfasine off label in order to improve their focus or intense any aspect of their biology or psychology of please let them know that it has a profound effect on lowering the tolerance for call such that even small amounts of alcohol can lead to really serious problems and even potentially death that is a very cerous warning with guonphysy to day we discussed a lot of different compounds for the treatment of he h t and it now should become clear what the general themes of those compounds is the general theme is that they tend to increase over all levels of arousal and wakefulness which leads to decrease levels of hyper activity impulsivity and focus and on the face of it that might seem counter intuitive raise arousal to reduce hyper activity and impulsivity indeed that is the case because these compounds because they act on negro modulator systems dopamine and group an from are effective in creating neuron plasticity they change the strength of the connections in the neral circuits of the brain that lead to states of heightened focus and reduced impulsivity and reduce hyperactivity we talked about the different mechanisms by which the different medications fray h t accomplish this both the typical sort methelphenadate an lateral and divan's and some of the atypical compounds that are now being used in addition such as modaphinel are modaphidel guonpacine and well button and where possible i tried to highlight both the short and long term effects of these various compounds and i try to address some of the major concerns about these compounds most notably the question of wire we putting many kids on amphetamine and what is the longer consequence of that and throughout to days episode i tried to highlight both the immediate and long term benefits but also the immediate and long term risks that can exist with these compounds certainly when take in without a prescription recreational there is a real risk for abuse and addiction as well as even a risk for psychotic episodes but also the risks that accompany long term use of these drugs in people with eighty high t and yet it is also clear that not treating the symptoms of eighty h t carry significant risk as well and what is very clear from the scientific and clinical literature and is covered in a significant amount of detail in the episode that i did about eighty h t which you can find at superman lab dot come is that comminations of drug treatments and behavior protocols seem to surpass either drug treatments or behavior protocols alone speaking to the tremendous importance of combining multiple methodologies when treating eighty h t an working with aboard certified psychiatrist who really understands eighty h t and is really up to date on all the latest scientific and clinical literature if

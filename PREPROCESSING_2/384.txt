welcome to the supermen science science pace to for via mender supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor para goofed doctor sera gotfreed is an obstetrician gynecologist who did her undergraduate training in bioengineering at the university of washington and seat she then completed her medical training at hazard medical school and she currently is a clinical professor of integrative medicine and nutritional sciences at homes jefferson university she is also been at cognition treating men and women in various aspects of hormone health and longevity for more than twenty years she is an expert in not just traditional medicine as it relates to hormones and fertility but also nutritional practices supplementation and behavioral practices and combining all of that expertise in order to help women navigate every aspect and dimension of their hormones longevity and vitality ranging from puberty to young adulthood adulthood perry menopause and menopause and nowadays shoes also treating men across the life stand in terms of longevity vitality and hormone health during to days discussion doctor comfrey shares an enormous amount of information and tools that women can apply toward their hormone health for utility vitality and longevity we discuss the got microfilm which many people have hard about but doctor comfrey points out the specific needs that women have in terms of managing their gupmicrobiom and the ways that that influences things estrogen levels and metabolism to stosteron thyroid and growth hormone and much more we also discuss nutrition and exercise we touch on how the megathere fatiacids play a particularly important role in managing female hormone health doctor goofed points out why women have particular needs when it comes to essential fatiacids and how best to obtain those essential fatiacids for hormone health we also discuss exercise and she offer some surprising information about the types and rations of resistance training to cardiovasculatraining that women ought to use in order to maximize their hormone health we also talk a lot about the digestive system this was a surprising aspect of the conversation i did not anticipate doctor goofed shared with us for instance that women suffer from digestive issues at more than ten times the frequency that do men and fortunately that there are tools specific to women that they can use in order to overcome those digestive issues and that in overcoming those digestive issues they can overcome many of the related hormone issues that many women face doctor gotfreed also shares with you tremendous knowledge about the specific types of tests notions blood tests but also urine and microfilm tests that women can use in order to really get a clear understanding of their hormone status notjhust of present but also were the tragedy of their hormones is taking them we have an naval discussion about puberty about young adulthood adulthood perry menopause and howbeit to manage and navigate perrymenapaus and menad was including a discussion about hormone replacement therapy in addition tour academic and clinical expertise doctor gotfreed has authored many important books on nutrition hormones and supplementation as it relates to women and to people generally the two books that it'd the higher and that we provided links to in the shoot captions are women food and hormones and the hormone cure i read the hormone cure and found it to be tremendously interesting and informative not just in terms of teaching me about female hormone health and various treatments for female hormone health but also as a man trying to understand how the endocrine system interacts with mind set nutrition and supplementation more generally i highly recommend the hormone cure for anybody interested in hormones in hormone health and women food and hormones in particular for women although again both books are going to be strongly informative for women wishing to optimize their hormone health vitality and longevity before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephysites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back t electrolyte ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one graham of sodium two hundermilegrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element firstling in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el event doctor slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor para gotfreed doctor gotfreed para welcome thank you happy to be here ism delighted and verysiht to ask you about an enormous number of topics hero are expert in many thing i the challenge for me is going to be to contain this walk as it were ism hoping that we can touch on an great number of things to day the first of which is really about hormones and female hormones in particular and i have a question which is is it ever in formative for a woman regardless of age to know something about her mothers perhaps even her grandmothers experience over of e for sons not just pregnancy challenge is with or am ease with pregnancy and child rearing child birth this sort of thing but you what sorts of conversations should women be having with themselves and with family members to get a window into what the specific needs might be w of the question my work is really up interface between genetics and environment your question gets to both and i think it is e mental that you understand what sure grandmother went through it'd even say your great grandmother depending on lunch epoxy in your family i grow up with my great grandmother i get that and especially your mother i would probably start first with drama an energenerational drama because i think that of facts and o prim system hugely specially cortical signaling but the broader pine system psycho narrow endticran system and then there is if i think about the stage is the life cycle that a women goes through if you think about puberty i think i do not know how genetically determined the age of purity's certainly there is a lot of environmental influences toxins can affect it but am pregnancy the age at which you start to go through very menaces menaces many of those have a genetic component would pregnant semen you can certainly think the shape of the pelvis your ability the a national birth so about is generally termite i man you do have the the firm downer affecting some of that but on my family for instance we have no celeriac sections every one goes through this process of a relatively was vationalworth i was a for a sups baby but for the most part am you can find out about that and then there is certain female conditions that have at very strong component genetically most of which run on my family that includes endometriosis vibrates i just had distract me i had fifty plus pirates and a polisystic ovarian item and of those three how frequent are those and a maybe i can constrain the question habit by saying am to day's discussion i imagines can be heard by men and women of all sorts of ages i a maybe ell direct the question little bit toward at what age should these discussions start am we always imagine that a women in there a thirties and forties and fifties and onward should be getting certain tests and a addressing things a varying reserve and and other sorts of things but may we could march through d just say for a woman in her means who is already hit puberty what sorts of bile markers whether not their blood base or per or on fenatyping that the the outward appearance of should those young women be paying attention to likewise for woman in their twenty thirties maybe e could take it an more less by by decade a starting at puberty assuming that woman hits puberty sometime what between what is it now the average in the us somewhere between twelve and sixteen years old o i have that right now you do not o that as to be a o it used to be twelve to sixteen i would say fifty years ago it is been moving younger and we thank some of that is related to token exposure as i mentioned but i was ten when i went through puberty a why should say monarchy and i asserted growing bras much before that i think now ism going to step away from the science for a moment in a do that pretty fluidly and it'll try to call it out i think there is also a huge influence from stress and the development of the adrenal glance going back to the science the is sue in teenage years is that the hypothalamic pituitary a renal axis and i to think of it brother stay with me hypothalamic pituitary a renal the name of recent women testis men thirst got axes that to me is the control system some cannot expressing my bioengineerinside here i think it is great to include the other organs in tissue systems of the body because as we both know that the narrow definition of just hypo the lamp petuitaria dream it cannot be just that i now i cannot o no it does not tell the whole story if you look at tho the man psexwormons in a a young woman whose interregna years the hypothalamic pituitary a drean'll canal part of that is not fully mature they are more likely to set periods especially under stress they have a lot of influences it really does not get well established until you are done without lessons and ism told that atoll since now as till like age twenty five to twenty six i heard that knows have got two daughters i was it is a really lo psychologically defined or bios sycessotually mostly psychologically to find i heard that from a psychologist big markers you asked about in your tenters what i think is really interesting is to look at article all to look at the dance between enteron an projection in those years is less helpful because i think there is a lot of very city due to the immaturity of the system if you have got someone has got really regular periods it is probably better to do some bench marking at that age but generally affine that bench marking is best performed in your twenty or thirties our periods not that regular in terms of duration of the menstrual cycle when the menstrual cycle first sets in it depends i was clockwork every twenty eight days until i ad ma has direct me an august same thing with my daughters have got two daughters one seventeen the others twenty three for a lot of women they are not regular and then there is the whole piece of oral contraceptives and other forms of contraception where you have no idea what the normal cycle is and i hope we will have some time to talk a little bit about oral contraceptives because i think it is this is now opinion again and not science i think it is the number one and a chronopathy that is i iatrogenic for women we will dreadfully talk about i get a lot of questions about or contraceptives i in the social media space and also questions about i dies quite a lot totally than particular copperiudis no got on harmonaliuty tell defiling touch on that i an i use crusader i just one at give you that working your your a fan to i have that right or you anti i am a huge fan it w which i uses in particular i copper because it is non hormonal it is as effective as getting your tubestide who would have thought right man it is that toxic to the sperm mobility is at that is my understanding of is that at it that it basically it is a it as more less an electric fence to the sperm cap and just that it electric fence is a bit of a harsh apology but all work withal but it is you know to have something that can last for ten years that you really have complete autonomy and sovereignty over your sexual life that is profound hand's not get all those downstream is there assisted with birth controlpile the other thing that is important to know about it i know the sampler women who use the copperauty have the highest satisfaction of any one on contraceptives the highest satisfaction and yet it is the least used of all forms of contrasfaction now my favorite is we factory but short of the become i think the ideas early great choice there are some riisisy with it ism not saying its is free but i love the idea and i love it for younger women too cause it used to be that when i went through my training which was thirty years s ago we were told do not put it in some one who ask not a baby and that is satirical messaging but getting back to y original question which is about big markers prodectate in your twenties that is when you wanted to som was casing with estrogen progesterone intostocerom they gets really helpful to know about this the tango you are from argentina r your five have serpentine lineage yes my grandparents to tango into their late ladies i m ism in my late forties and i i still have not started i suppose theirs time it might be time for yo to g and it might be a factor in their longevity did they have good helipad not is is and and my grandfather smoke cigarettes daily remained mentally sharp until he died in his late nineties but almost burned down their apartment several times falling asleep with a cigaret in his mouth i do not recommend any one but ah but it was a coffee data a red meat and cigarettes and thy lived into their ninety that is hide my family has the genetic a advantage the other side less but in any event a tango rank is it is a twenty twenty three goal it has been every year a the a ism at alwhold o accountable that will do an then know there will be no utuvidio of me doing at leas not initially timpharis actually a phenomenal poetaster as we know is a hes a it as sea tat tango tango answer i know this through various sources yes yo have seen yes this tango between strain professor and us incredibly important you want to have the the right lead you not have the right follow between the two warming again ism stepping away from my science hating but what happens a lot of the time is that estrogen dominates in that tango and when that happens it sets you at for greater risk of brides enemitriasis bedpan probably in association with the microfilm in the a strobalom can you've familiarize mother strobloum ye i deli wont t know that i do not recognize the term ye the istroublelom is the set of microbes in and their dean they deanaosly in the gut microfilm that is set of mi crews in their deny it is in the if you look at the totality the subset of particular bacteria modulate estrogen levels a lot of work was spirited by martin placer and what we know is that there are some women who have in a strobleom that makes those have a greater risk of certain estrogen mediated conditions bees cancer enemetro cancer an amen prostate cancer the istroblem is incredibly important there is not a lot of attention paid to it but i always think in terms of my patience no could this be some one who is got a faulty a strobalom and we need to adjestit with some of the micro boom a modulating a new trance neutraciticals that we have that they are less likely to have that that tango that is not working with enteron protestors getting back to the mitemarkers if if you gave me an unlimited budget which i kind of have with some of my a plants that i work with now what i would want to know is enteron progesterone testosterone and i want the timing right for that it'd want to know about d her and sort of the whole intrusion pathway it'd want to know about the metabolites of stepson because some of them are protective and very helpful others are a bit homer siphon ism in they are just costing all kinds of problems in your body increasing the risk of guenons de ana damage and potentially an increase risk a bras cancer although that data i think is mixed it'd also to know about their stool i want to know about the microbial the best tho we have right now is to look a when we do stool tertian i do a lot of stool testing we can look at things bates glucronidas are you familiar with be am familiar with it as a term and for those listening it very often not always when you hear in a a s your dealing with an ends i can e take a stave there in an it sounds its somehow involved in a glucose metabolism of some sort ears cliccegronidation it is involved in when you produce enteron the body this is the simplified fears an but when you produce enteron you are went to use it ended to the receptors where it is meant to go and then lose it you don't want to keep recirculating t enteron bad karma and that is what happens with people who have high blat a data licronidas it is the ends that is produced by three lactary in particular in that and i see a lot of men and women who have elevated basic licronidas and then they have some esterase dominants related to that is that the total reason we do not really know but it is one of the drivers it is one of the levers and it can be detected from a microbus a use stool sample that is right and in terms of blood testing or very test for these other bile markers getting estrogen testosterone and other ratios i realize they're people have different means financial means but in general people wanting to do a bloodiest it sound they are going to need to do it what women will need to do it at different stages other menstrual cycle if they had to pick one either in the vehicular pase an were in the audial stage of their o german menstrual cycle a sure me ovulatory menstrual cycle when would you suggest they do that if they had to pick if you force me to pick one i would say probably day twenty one to twenty two for some one in our twenties were focus right now on that decade for most women they have got a menstrual cuckold day that average is out at twenty days this is about a week before they start their period for women are more irregular it is harder to do that as women get older and will talk about this in a moment usually the cycle gets a little shorter as they start to decline in their progesterone production the apperio gets a little closer together mine before august was about every twenty six days at that point you want a was sooner day nineteen twenty and ism not talking about blood tests a blood test is the cheapest thing its usually what is covered by insurance but my preference would be to do dried ruin i to use saliva for quart us all i to use tried your in that i get metabolomix in addition to the levels of these foreman and if ism force to all use blood testing and that certainly the gold standard for all of these hormones that were talking about but a it is not as comprehensive and as it is a quick little snap shot while the needles in your vein for now thirty seconds yet the delivery carts leak sent to me was my energies you get free quarters all which is the act of that as all you said with your your also getting the metabolites that is right and then on for blood testing your getting it sort of a crude window into the averages a static total level a let me go back and say one other thing about but markers a big part of the testing that i do in fenityping my patience i practise perdition medicine si i to almost start with nutritional testing i do not think have ever had a tea nature have got some an be players that are nineteen twenty twenty one may be those count but o this green obviously but for nutritional testing that would be potentially a helpful thing to do in your twenties but comes less important as you get older and you develop more nicer nutrient deficiencies but mycernutrians play stroll in terms formal production magnesium the magnesium as usually involved in the way the to get rid of estergan satin example micernutriantesting what i usually do is a commination of blood in ruin and som looking at all of the micheronutriance that we can measure that have some clinical scientific basis pine them if i could do that for a denature i think it might be helpful because i recently gave a lecture on bees canter is production another quickcyper and i was sad to find that and take a vegetables pollyphenals is such an important predictor a future riscobrasq cancer when you are fifty sixty plus and the most important time is when you are a teaneator now have one daughter that eats vegetables she loves them and have another daughter who eats food that is base and it is very hard to getter to eat the volume a vegetables five colors a day which is what i do and if you have evidence that she could show a seventeen year old that they have got microbe treen gaps i think that would be a motivator for them to eat differently at a time when it is critical even though it is twenty five years in the future that it is con a potentially change this ark that they arson would you do for a young woman who does not vegetables is or is not somehow able or willing to to get those five colors a day of vegetable to help support the microbial e a supplements a a useful tool in that case on what other sorts of tools behaviouror otherwise or useful such a good question here a minute in vow top night at uses i think his is a his got project has really been helpful in terms of understanding what can modulators are going to be important what i try to get that personootial and i do not see many means any more other than and be plays what i try to get them to do as t a a smoothy very hard to get them daft a smoothy every day but if i could get them daff a smoothy three times a week and o throw some of these vegetables in that makes a huge difference may we know that makes difference in terms of microfilm change to to be a blending up rocky or call can flowers o call flowers harshen their putting things into the smoothy i do not know if you get a denature to do that but they often will use i have them do steam rocky that is in the free sir because it is got very little taste that they could do that in a chocolate smoothy they cat add some greens i greens powders are resuperconvenient that with can have a a taste that they whether that is chocolate which is what most my clients want or villa with carries in that sort of thing the i can go a long way if you do not vegetables and short of that i would say some supplements but i would say that is distant second to making a smoothy have got one patient that i have to mention because am he took this to the extreme he is a retired thesis professor you s testy he found out that his micro boy was a hot mas and am developed to of mutineers and he became hellbent only physics could on changing as microfilm and he dramatically shifted it by having a smoothy every day a with fifty seven vegetables in fits fifty seven in n dependent fifty seven independent i mean this just warms my heart the way that he do this but he would go to the farmer smart he would just get a bunch o this a bunch of that and he would go home make the smooth and then stick it in the freezer he would have a serving every day and he became a completely different person be on is microfilm change his a to o mean disease is in remission he he dropped a huge mount i he went from being in a kind of h phenotype that i know well of a professor hi performing travelling round the world on many boards much innovation many great ideas supercomputridi to been some one who gets up in the morning gets in is hot to exercise for one to two hours a day and then does a little work we he completely shifted the way that he lives and is microfilm shift now who knows what what is the chicken an i whats sag there but he had a huge change in his physiology glucose went from being quite high he had and he tracks all of is of corse its on times he is that after all rite then retired i suppose might have had and he is retired but he is he is got the longest time series of any one i know and he is tract his glucose an island going back twenty years he can show you one heres where i started having my smooth and here is how my glucose an island change as result it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all f your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i start taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the robotics that i need for got health i got is very important is populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions siemens and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste right if you would to tryathletic greens you can go to athletic green do calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic greensdock calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of within and three k to is there case for it'll say young women but young women an men a using over the counter robotics as a way to enhance them microbus this is something i hear about a lot have heard that excessive doses of capsid robotics can give a brain fog condition i personally do not use capsid robotics unless i feel my systems under significant mountostras in which case i might at that in for brief periods of time we if have just taken into bionics for a period of time a do you ever recommend that the college student or the high school student that she or he take capsid robotics assuming that there getting let say three to five servings of vegetables per day either in smoothy form or some other form what your thoughts on on supplementing robotics it sounds such a simple question it is such a complex answer and i do not think we really have the answer it'll ell you the way that i preach it i look for canalizes trials to support my use of probation and frankly ism underwhelmed have seen some data if i invoke my a and be players for a moment almost every player have tested has increase in testing permeability they just have such a high training load probably meet to by corpus all very iglucosis whennatrain that they have increased in testing permeability there is tight junctions in their in teston become loose they did alp a lot of inflammation as result of that and when you are a professional any a player and you are making twenty million a year e you do not want a lot of inflammation you want a little bed to i help your muscles recover but you do not want it to be am adding to problems when you develop an entry this is leaky got lee ye got i do not love that term but ye will use it here there is a there is a particular probation that is helpful in athletes with week got that is ta kind of specificity and canalize trial that ism looking for the rest of it i think there is support if you find help from it as you described if you take a course ofvanabotics i mean for subtle would question whether you need them but there i trying of warns there there been instances where they been prescribed i took them mostly in the pass i was in college they simply they cant gave am outer yet a science we i be antibiotic seeing collop the other for is not see than ever yes if you are coming off vanaboutics i think that is a good time to do what we call replacement dos probation i think what is far more interesting is are basics i think the data much better for probiatics and am the selector use a poliphenales he would it person in their teens and twenties or any age for that matter no what whether not they have nutritional deficiencies what is the best way to analyze if one is getting enough magnesium a and for that matter what is going to be the best way to test the a microfilm you said school sample an it'll come right back with the same question i asked about a blood test what time of day wen during the month to establish us a base line as to be prior toe barking on a ninety seven vegetables r a a herd i fifty have well i love the idea that we are telling us if ism gathering erectly is that jester's a case for robotics but for the typical person regardless of age eating more vegetables we are drinking more vegetables as as the case may be it is going to be beneficial for the got microfilm perhaps without the need to go test whether not one is making a certain number of estrogen related metabolites or not just that that is a great starting place eat were consume more vegetables out but if one wants to analyzer got microfilm or the good tests available to the general public ins been a nock name companies but have been tracking this over the years and it is never been clear to me that we know what constituents of the got microfilm or or best you do not know that disposes is bad o and we know that diversity o the microfilm is good we hear this abut no one's ever told me that you want a particular ratio of one microbiota to another in a way that has made any sense to me at least total i ism not a microbiologist but whereas with wit testosterone an men we hear oka you want your free testosterone to be about two per cent of your total perhaps with women you women a in not more testostrom the nestergen on average but still less than men when you look at testosterone et camera et camera but you cant get some me creed measures but for the icrobiomat just seems long lists of microbiota for which i i just get dizzy i just if you rote out a munch eyes an ells an asses you would had w you gent my a bit a bit the same information ism not thing to poke at that field as a beautiful field but they have not told me what to what i what might microbiota ought to look like what is a healthy microfilm chart wellthat is because we do not know i mean the be we have as top nights work but even that is limited in terms of can i tell you that a a women in or twenties sod have this particular pattern with heir microfilm know i cannot am let me go to your first question cause i think you jisasked about six your first question is about neutrisonal testing what i to do with nutritional testing is run a panel that is looking at any occidents s midimanave idea ben see awful li pic used am plant was tank opens cause ye can measure that in the blood i to look at some of the key ifidimen specially the be sideman range because as you probably know if you have got particular genetic i jolly amorphism he might be less likely to be absorbing the right level of figment be nine full at i didn't be twelve et camera i ism also looking going back to the anioccdents it glutithiom because i think that is such an important lever when it comes to detoxification which we have not talked yet and then ism looking at some of the minerals magnesium is really the most important and we know that somewhere round seventy eight per son of america are deficient and magnesium that is the the lowest taking for it i would be curious fences with magnesium if that number of people are deficient does that mean that that number o people should be targeting their nutrition towards foods that contain magnesium and or supplementing with magnesium and if what forms of magnesium talked my machree in a else there is a extra there many forms to be lo bit of overwhelming to people a any any detail amen forcing would depreciate it great first in terms of testing what i prefer to do is to mention when more than one lap in more than one brand a and i can just ism speaking mostly from experience for testing i do a lot of geneva neutrals during the pandemic they developed in at home test normally with the neutrovall you have to get triplatron and you've to do a her went sample lot people cannot do that the great thing about this test is your insurance usually pays for most of it and the cope is about a hundred and fifty dollars during the pandemic they developed another test called metabolomix which does much of the same testing but it is a finger prick most my patience prefer that in fact they have not gone back to the nutroval second lab is spectrasell i use spectral occasionally i find it not quite as easy and termsifiting into my practice but have got friends an men tors marcuson who does a lot of a con precision a cardiac metabolic health he think spectreselves the best test out there you asked about magnesium you have to measure red blood sal magnesium milk coal blood and with deficiency it is interesting with supplementation for my patience who ten board constipation and that is frankly about eighty person of the women that i take care of really yes w i becuriousas to why that that is i i can guess a diet stress am patriarchy rage the psychic psychclmay not know i bought ping that a the pine system right e pspsychl psychology menology curl and endegran factors combine yes and the i would see there is another factor which is being female is a healfazard we have twice the rat of depression in sonic we have got three toforexs increase risk of multiple sclerosis we have got five to eight times the risk of pirate dysfunction if you just look at that and you look at subtle preclinical fir dis function a huge number of the womenthat i take care of will me pack a large number of the women that i take care of have fire dysfunction that is contributing to constipation and if we go back to that controlsistem i with u limit potuteratrin athirst capital god acts and they have a lot of perceivedstress together with is border line pirate function that no meanstry medicine doctor has told her is a problem and then she is got a problem with the tango between enteron and protestor on she is going to tend toward constipation women have a lot more constipation than men the got is about ten feet longer in women compared to men we should talk about some season gender differences and to fine us sure and they are much more likely to have a torturous con and the way that is you get a collonoscoby and they tell you now is really hard li get in here an do what we need to do as a brief tension but i think this is the time to ask em at what age now do physicians insist their female patients get colonoscapiece a for men i think the age is to be fifty now it is getting racketed back to forty five or forty began these are recommendations not requirements but their pretty strong recommendations from depending on where you live et camera for women cowardly you think they shouldn't a callinoscaby to to explore fore possible dollops and or a coin cancer let's really good question i do not know the answer what have always operated with is fifty the way that i answer that is to go to that you as prevent of was foredating to determine was on nersintesis a the data wat ages most appropriate has a change as you just described for men from fifty to younger i do not know we should facial these m additional health hazards for women you mention some of the you broadly mention psychological impact right an and of course these things are all related psychology of menology and that one o that i think wonderful things about hero science and science in general in medicine is that there is now an an understanding that all the organs are connected to one another it is an network it is an artwork and that the micro boom sits it had at a see note within that not work and i think most people except that now yes that seems to be a there that at least in the last ten years is really wonderful because certainly for new science ho was thought that unless it is in the cranial vault it is not nerd which is ridiculous cause the s lots on nervous system outside the skull but in any case for i interrupt for a second yes place i think you are right that there is an understanding about the network effect but i think that as much as i love manstryne medicine and i trained in it and i am grateful for my education i still think it is a silo base way of takin care of nations even if there is an under standing of the network of fact more at the science level or is you described in negro science there is still if you are a woman who as constipation fatigue maybe an to me in condition feel stressed out all the time feu your warming are out a was you get sent to the gasteronerologist for the constipation you get sent you the dermatologist for your auto unisious you maybe get sent to an under chronologist if you have got pirate problems and there is very little colaberationn between these groups even though there is n understanding nothing network of fact in re life it is not happening let us butts go deeper down that path cause i point out something really important and and you have mention constipation a few times can devour constipation as a serious enough symptom that it warrants in immediate intervention that is does it flag or signal problems that are severe enough that that should be the issue that is dealt with a for anybody that is experiencing it an i mean sort of an odd topic for many people cops thing o you know saw movements an for there is that kind of a preadolescent humor around this but i think it is it is import when you are what ism hearing you say is that constipation is far more common in women and it is signals a general tat many problems occurring does that mean that women should address constipation and if what is the best way to address constipation yet love is question because you are doing you have a quick little metic conversation you are doing something that i knew you it do which is you are teaching me something in you are changing there is a social genomic thing happening where you are changing my thought about this i just wanted to acknowledge i think thank you why i think for me you know when i hear that there is a kind of you take out a genotype constipation of fend type it is one that people generally do not where tea shirt explaining it t people but that ism guessing anything to do with sexual health a bowel health you are allege people just do not talk about right for all sorts of reasons and those reasons are probably obvious that there to even worth discussing because and wat also because we will not change them except by talking about them yet if you say women are far more constipated and that signaling a larger set of problems yes then my immediate thought is well relieving constipation u in ended wrettoractively a will that assist in a great number of issues and or will it get them down the road of thinking about those other issues more specifically do i need more manesiemer should i ad putting vegetables in my smoothy o some curious about constipation as a forget ye for intervention that then opens up a bunch of other discussions because there are these certain notes in the in the mental health physical health space that when some one you we jungle out deliberate cold exposure do i think it is magic no but i think that if someone is getting themselves into a cold shower once a day it opens up a non a number of questions about themselves and reveals an number of things to themselves look how do i to fer stress ye what sorts of levels of control to actually have and on and on perhaps not the best example but even is some of us ha cold exposure right which can we have we have a gang that makes us stress out you in believe which fold exist which i would argue makes it a very likely that even ten second of cold exposure gets you the effect that you want as a was tho someone who a does cold exposure a penguin needs a lot more cold exposure for to have the the adaptive responsianyway that is my way of of a numbing through that i quite a you you are you are quite correct a let us answer this question as i nation issue y this is how you are changing the way i think about thus you're asking ora instead of looking at constipation as a constellation as symptoms what about if you just you sit on its own as sort of a a a key indicator or signal of dysfunction with my network or may be something brother and i think that is right it makes me think of a few things it makes me you are also changing this book that ism writing on to a community and drama o think you for that women experience more drama than men this is well established if you look at the a studies that were done by the seedy sin wiser in nineteen ninety eight we know that men for the most part middle age men have about a about fifty per can of them experience significant drama ask to find by the ace questioner women are at sixty per cent and that is pretty durable since nineteen ninety eight women have more they have different forms of abuse much more likely to have sexual puce they have a different h p response than men there perceive stress tens to be higher and ism generalizing for a population sit note you known permission medicine we do not do that we do medicine for the indie individual not the population not medicine for the average and if you look at the physiology of a female i think that a constipation and that need to control and restrain and whole things in you tighten the anal pincer think that is part of the physiology ism varying away from the science but i do think that it is a really important signal to pay a lot of attention to now you also asked about micro by on testing we do that idea give when have a couple more questions about constipation i never thought i ask us main question h consume ben on fast by the way also this morning i taught medical stones of standard about the fact that we are basically a series of tubes the you talked about the the anal pinker we are a set of sphincters from one end to the other in we are sedan tubes a or nervous system being one of those tubes and but and i ink in eastern medicine they talk about the various locks between those tubes and chambers and it is not without coincidence there is some real wisdom there of course was did you just talk about energetic anatomy am more less i did not say the word checkers but i might in pains the bond s a ton us right a thar the a the the the sphincters yes yes us right i thank you for for that the what defines constipation i mean in other words asking bout the healthy rather an thing about the unhealthiness how many bowl movements should i woman or a man have per day assuming this is where gets tricky because some people are doing time restricted feeding some pa reading more some peopling more over more bulk larger meal the end of the day barging a the beginning to we will never be able to sort out all those variables but on average u how many bow movements and is timing during the day for bowl movements at all a informative what works for you well when ism asleep generally i do not want a bowl movement him gay must fee i well s is primary for it exactly ism i always assumed that morning time yet was a was a healthy ti's ya movements and i think almost everybody babies included recognize the feeling of being lighter and more energetic when the have evacuated totally holing totally ism in fact much that ism ism obsess with lungan imphrodian psychology that the first thing we learn when we come into this world right is that we want something we we feel some sort of autonomic arousal stress we not its food or warmth or the need to have a bow moving one of the first things that parents learn is how to recognize that not by the odor coming from the diner but by the look on the baby's face at agitation agitation signals the need for some sort of relief right temperature relief food relief evacuating the bowel relief my understanding is that as autonomic arousal increases in the early part of the day ideally after a good nights sleep that bow movements become more likely unless that arousal becomes great that then people feel quitting locked up rid because the the balance of the autonomic of features early day ism guessing and again in the second half of the day and here ism totally guessing and certainly not having to wake in the mid all the night yet those are my best guesses that is great i would agree with that when i was that harbor medical squall and you see a a forincidency i was taught the constipation is haven't at saw move meant less frequently than whenever whence every three days i haven't to nothing of ever laughed out laughed when this pluncast is the consequence of of a toxic medical knowledge are you kitting me is that ridicule that sounds and and here on intended that sounds the a the conclusion of some very consummating relationally and and and and in other ways consented individuals and i again this might seem an odd conversation but the the discussion around constipation is is present in psychological literature yes because of this relationship to the autonomic system bull it is a metaphor in literature it is crucial you you spoke to a number of different threads that i think are important here that is the definition that i learned and i was i heard that now hell know that does not work for me does not work for any one i know and i spent a lot of time especially in medical school and in my internship where you rotate on medicine disimpacting women older women who come in who have an at about movement in a month wo in t let me tell you thrice not nice for anybody bell me id i became a scientist an o physician for a hereof reason n both positnegutive that is one of ye my definition of constipation as a western mostly white girl is that if you are not having a bound movement every single morning and you have a feeling of complete evacuation anything less than that is constipation that is how i defend it if you are in india in you are eating food that is got a fair amount of my clubs in it it is loss e now sanitary musing that word am as carefully as i can generally they have a bout movement after every meal but they have got a different my chromium their expose to different my clubs here and the you us i would say once day you also spoke to something very important which is the balance between the part synthetic nervous system rest in digest and poop first is the sympathetic nervous system conotonbutton fight flight freeze for i think for those of us who have got is sues with autonomic balance it can lead to constipation and i that constipation could be pulled out and kind of writ larger as an important signal what sorts of tools you recommend people use to a relieve constipation a in creating more fire sounds in reducing stress is going to be a huge one yes what are your favorite stress reduction e tools a i to divide these into a real time tools be proponent collect physiological sighing real him these sort of things but a things it can really lower the base line on stress over all to facilitate constipation and other the a brought indicators of health ism not a fan of lowering stress ism a fan at flowering perceive stress and i think the distinction is really important i learned when i was in my thirties that i was a mass of strescase and i did not know it it was a sort of i think i had through residency through working under twenty hours a week i just was accustomed and sort of that was one than an twenty not tender twenty folks yet yet there is not unusual in in medicine well they they have chaos training that you work no more than eighty hours we now but that was before my time i became a customer to a mass of mount coatis all massive and i would say have spent the past twenty years really working on perceive stress to find i think all of us needn't all the cart mean of what is most effective what works for me now at my age is different then in the the tam i did as a college student transcendental meditation an it is different than the i became a sort of id yo could teacher when i was in my thirties that is very effective for a lot of people it was not enough for my metrics i do eolotropic breath work i did not read it but i saw that he to set a paper and on your sign and it conic it may me think teach me now to i teach teach me how to split can you say a little of it about that li curare you do it yet but very briefly that study was we we wanted to find a minimal effective dose intervention ye five i non on it yen i vent to day we need to finger out what people do every day yet and we were monitoring subjective mood at camera but also biometrics remotely is come a i let i metrics it a we a charge a night time see toast us all a i wish this was done during the pandemic more than a hundred subjects the advantage was that we got data twenty four hours a days their pinging us in their data a were i a meany for it ye is that was nice resting heart rate subjective mood we would get in touch with them daily one people were swap between groups any good study but five minute a day of s or standard if you will forgive me meditation to to sitting no instructions about how to breaths just focussing on closing their eyes an focussing on focusing ye another group did boxbreathin yet in had hold tell hold for equal durations the duration of each of those in has and holds was set by there carbondoxi tolerance somewhere between three in eight seconds to wagon how well they regulate o carbondoxide another group did picnic sighing this would be double in hail through the nose big in had through the use followed by it to lungs empty exhale that second in had after the first big longing had through the nose is really important because it make sure that all the collapse a fly lungs totals nap open and then the excel you awe lot about of carbodoxide that is very similar to hell a tropic breath work not yes not not not unlike eolotropic breastwork little bit proniama is but the exam is rather passive as opposed to active and then the fourth category was cyclic preventilation which is a lot tumor a c him off is breathing different in wimhoff breathing this would be very active in has and exhales every twenty five cycles of inhale anal the would be one cycle long exam hold lungs empty fifteen to thirty seconds then repeat for about five minutes the if everyone did that for five minutes and what we found was that the cyclic sighing led to the greatest improvements in mood around the clock not just around the the practice or during the practice as well as lowered resting heart rate improvements in sleep et camera and you got a published and s we were ton daze the a very fortunate i i think am that the thankfully the revers n letters understood that these minimal intervention things a fly of can be of use to people also useful to people i mean how often do you read a paper that that could offer a behavior change that is easy to implies am i love that question thank you what about did you tell them not to drink because all has such a ugeifect never me yes in this case we did not tell them to alter anything else about their behavior is hoping it a s at background kind of cross the salmon ayes and somewhere stamford students others were from the general population any frat boys ai heavily probably not well during the pandemic i think alcohol in take went wait way up across the board i mean is enough iatomagic wand i would i would ass at people either not drink or drink two drinks per week mama moment lease that is my understanding in he literature are you familiar with the whoop data with out call no but we have a collaboration with wood through that paper yum and it certainly disrupts patterns of night time sleep in particular on my understanding that first phase of sleep that is related to the massive growthrome one release ye you we all real need and wanting any there's mess the we did not no the second interaction of the study we will certainly include free court is all by som a a and o a hormone pals well ism beginning to think that we should also e asking people how ten there going to the bathroom in what time of day yes i mean it this thing around constipation is a is superinteresting and i think that plus blood blood markers and then ism i override to learn that um that you are in contains additional markers that could be informative yet was it it was a fun study a not easy study to do with that number of of subjects tasse lot a drain for your desert distance ye was a big group is nine people in our group and a three clinicians and a lot of lot phone calls and a lot of back and forth but yean thank you to the subjects who served as the i life guinea pigs ye i think that stress peoples i think people are starting to appreciate that there areaways that they can relieve their stress at the do not a only fall under the categories of vacation a and meditation but i want to say that meditation is obviously a wonderful tool am it is just its a it is a tool not unlike any other tool that it is great for some people and less great for others well it certainly it is a great to an it is got such a scientific basis behind it but there is many things on is ollicart many sacs orgasm connection feeling heard seem and loved ills talk about that i mention earlier the all these stress factors you you said patriarchy right but i think what if i may at risk of a of just strengthening that a statement i i mean that that to me it is is signaling a bunch of other factors around as you said li i he think keeping things in what you think explains let less talk about that because i think that that is likely to have raised to certain flag and people's minds what exactly is she talking about are you telling about less opportunity are you talking about less opportunity to u to vocalize are you telling about less opportunity to vocalizes and be heard i man i realize that there an infinite number of variables but given that it sounds a a really strong in put to the system a what i mean by that is that psychology is influencing biology in your saying that that these a that these powers power dynamics structures and dynamics are packing id loved leerier thoughts on that because a i i hate to let a flag the go by d out flushing it out and never was a good flag well i let us preface it by by just saying that people will have different opinions on this and that is and i think that is healthy and and with the discussion about constipation let us talk about what people are not willing to talk about when it comes to health love it we might meed to talk about patriarchy in part but it'll give you some material that have been working with i started i did not even understand existence a patriarchy until i was a by wen needing under great to it and mi the i should mention which has always had a bit of a of a male a screwed male in terms of you think silty numbers well my my let us true mas users it i true well my stock adviser was the late ben barrios who was a female to male transition transgender interest irstrnend remember the national lately of sciences were my closest friends unfortunate died of of pancreatic cancer we are very very close a than i cant documentary about ben but ben this is interesting ben went tomb tea was he wanted to be around a lot of men ye that is an lesser known fact but then he was a very strong advocate for women he went to asbarbara when he was barber and by the we he is given me permission to share all this priory is death i recorded a lot of conversations yen i only ever knew him has been by the way but when he was it a mi tea he was identified female and he later talk about the intense suppression oppression there is how he described it am especially given that he was performing well yes you just defined patriarchy you did it yourself couple things when i was in by engineering i took a women studies class and it was all about teaching under graduates about the existence o patriarchy which i woald defend maybe at its simplest as power over ism not saying men are patrurchey ism saying something very different which is power over let me correct one thing that she said i did not go to am mi teasing integratuat i am from i was in plasma and i went to universe seep washington for bioengineering in seeattl in settle i dropped out of a graduate program an by o engineering to go to the warfare am mi tea program for hell sciences in technology in boson thanks for that clarification universe washington also wonderful place i have many man i as many many many wonderful close colleagues there it is an incredible place especially for vision science it is especially good for engineering by o engineering but i you my my eat is jointly between am mi ta and warfare and it is the oldest maybe largest although warfare says is lot program for biomedical engineers and a empty party physician scientist straining program thanks for that clarification mean to blame the internal for this i am i think we can to send or r a wickapedia editor's out i think linked in as correct of great well we wickapedia a editor's note it get out there and make that make the correction now you heard it am stress that is what you really talking about his systemic stress in the body as a consols as a consequence skews me of systemic stress of environment that is right but there is there is particular forms of it i would say this also relates to who privilege it relates to a basis m and when you look it fund of the way that systems including my beloved am mi tea the way that there set up is that my make crismakes right and generally the people that are the strongest big men strong men they're the ones to tend to be the most successful for people who are by pock for people who do not have white privilege for women it is a different experience and ism you being petrurckhey as kind of a umbrella here but it connects to many other things not us this is an opportunity to ay keep this in mind as we turn to it a question the t i did not a close the each on earlier in it is my fault which is ism now clear on the fact that a woman in her lateens early twenties ought to know something about her testosterone estrogen third coatis all levels should start at least thinking about her mice mom should be thinking about how how many bowel movements in the timing those bawl movements per day really and ism assuming that what i just described is also true for woman in there twenty's thirty's forty fifty's on up to hundreds is that correct that is correct but would say that there are differential opportunities by decade ism glad oh's circled aback to tea natures and testosterone because i think a few know for instance in your teen the years that you have high allergens and that you have got this petensol phenotype way an to the future that you may not even notice am me maybe nose you got a feu extra hers on your chin or something if that sure testosterone as elevated or some other aldermen it mi change the ark of how you take care of yourself i think that could be very helpful in your teanachears in your twenties for people who are as stress case me age twenty seven on the words at you see as a if i had known that i was such a high cartisall person i think i would have done things differently i would a change my behavior and i do not know because i did not casease these but your testosterone can decline strain your twenties cone of depending on how much stress your mad tricks asunder for women that can start as early as twenty eight usually you are testosterone clients by about when per cent per year what level of testosterone do you to see in a woman once she is or post essay after age twenty five what kind of range is healthy i know what the reference range is only because i know one could look it up i do not know you the top of my head and beagle but what what is at con of a nice reference point there the way i intend to describe the son did case is the top half of the normal range great that i think it is a good benchmark for piso s generally it is much higher than that have seen patience wit piso ass where the total mesotrons a hundred two hundred did i always have per fer old manifestations o that lot bit of hair the the skin plans have heard about user darken skin li regular periods regular periods is that om you might i get a lot of questions about pick ask ya am and you are the first person we have ad on this pot cast at rally qualified to talk about pick asses in a real way am here were talking about too many andrergens sit on the very irregular ovarian meant slat a asking keep saying that oblatory slash menstrual cycle am what are some other indicators and do you recommend that women start taking androgen blockers what is not wore i manual seems to be a lot of piece less out there of hearing about it a lot got you ask bout this precious is one of those really poorly understood conditions that gets it contraflows flies below the rat are until a woman wants get pregnant or she is got some other issue that drives her to a physician the problem is that it is a ssindrum rights polysistic over esindrum sometimes polysistic ovarian indium and centrums do not necessarily fit together into a really clear diagnostic criteria in this instance there are three different criteria that we look for sos i on the ovaries having a clinical manifestations of hyper antrigenisms that could be hirsutism any other things and then usually a regular periods and the way that that to find at least by the a latest criteria is haven't a period every thirty five days or less typical pascal length twenty eight days thirty five days u now your skipping a period here and there those wo the this the criteria that we used to signs pesos there are about four different systems out there in the literature for disposing picots which swear its sarskate confusing there is some women who have no sit on their ovaries but they have got hirsutism and they have got irregular periods could you define heroism yeursitism is increased haircloth usually in places that you do not want it for women it can be in a kind of mail pattern they might notice it on their breast on their chest a and then there is of course a a familial quality to that goes just looking a paper last night looking at is relies and how much hirsutism say have and whether this is related to s g repeats on the antigen receptor do they get em not is rallies but a do women who am who might have piece s experience entergenicalopicias o hair lost this sort of of the golden cold man pattern baldness of course it is androgen pattern calmness as upmost a man the we met tostostrondaged he related sometimes this is where eminent in to clinical experience rather than a what have seen in the literature women defiling can have some androgenic a alopecia i ten to see it later in life but this is an important point because we think of precious as i was just talking about it in teenage years would not it be nice to know that you have this genotype in your risk for all the things of people a rest for and we have not talked about pocosin insane yet we said what we know is that piecoass is not just to problem in terms of irregular periods and then difficult we in pregnant those are mostly problems in your twenty thirties early forties but it is a massiveros factor for party metabolic disease as you could older many people tend to piece whole piecuass is a problem of re productive age we have to be thinking of it over the entire female life paschal and i would say it is even more important to consider it over the age of fifty you know average of melanosis fifty one to fifty two because we know that that elevated testosterone the high allergens are probably the greatest cardie metpetabolic driver of disease for women with pieces well now one other thing i want to mention and i still have my notes that hereinto talk about viceroy i testing to set such a fun subject what i was taught to do again saying this was much love for the people who have taught me how to do medicine what i was taught to do is that if you have a woman with pieces you make the diagnoses you measurer tastastron you see if she has acme blavala you ask that woman won question do you want t get pregnant or not then you have these women with pieces who get start on a birth control bill if they soft wan to get pregnant if they want to get pregnant then you help them get pregnant by addressing someodyse piesuesas she is maybe you give them closest or you you something to make them modulate more frequently that is the way that most conventional medicine purchases and it does women at gigantic disservice one of the things om speaking into is the gender gap that exists i my feeling is that the research money that goes into woman's help is abysmal compared to what goes into mensal really and i think that is changing but there is also a huge lack of awareness of secs in gender differences when it comes to the way that we construct clinical trials and other experiment will that is absolutely true i men i sit on have set on an tire u panels for more than debate now regular standing member which is only to say that i see the research has it is being proposed yes and now it is required no grant will get funded without see as a biological very by her ism by the way fossil's sex blog secs the now not see the verb but both are superinteresting obviously but when we say seas a biological variable meaning the even of its a study on mice when i that start though that did not tart that long go it must have been i think we can think in want of miss attribute here i think wean thank francs collins for insisting on the same man grandads andrnityan play burned and heavy has done much to help us but she made the woman's alvinitiative which i hope will get to which is a hot mass confusing the data that came out of that yet an these trials are long into the date are only now starting to emerge said you say clear an i have a question that i do not think it isgingto take so track but this is of apposes question as a hypothesis because i think it is likely to be a little bit of a of a not a barbed wire question but maybe a prickly question when people first her it but it is poses a hypothesis you mention some of the psycho social stress issues based on at the organizational level institutional level society level maybe right down to the family and and just life that our biting health out comes for the worse in female populations you refer to is the patriarchy ism just trying to put make sure that were both talking about the same thing and that is non exhaustive i realized at just a subset of the issues ism also hearing there's a lot more pick s well i is hyper androgenesation of the very in tither re ting bout you mention at you excess testosterone which females naturally have more testosterone than they do estrogen anyway but which i am elevated levels here is a hypothesis one hypothesis would be that the increased androgen and the piso pick s are a consequence of the psychosocial conditions that are i was a forcing but our biting the need for females to think behave react act in certain ways to survived lettalone thrive is that i i do not say this for any kind of political correctness hypothesis this is a in might this would be a fun interesting and i think important study to run right depending on stress and the conditions the speciftype of stress do females under produce or over produce andrewgens or is it a neutral effect say maxes i love this question let me just paraphrase the last part of it to make sure about it it sounds with you are asking es could piece as sorts somephinatypes opiecio s be a response to what ism calling metering and then you add a second part to it which is to healthy women like what is there a production of tostostro is that right yes and and with the acknowledgment of a you are the expert here am your the physician cognition and expert in hormones and ism not but with the understanding that absolute levels of hormones are interesting but perhaps not as interesting as the ratios of testosterone to estrogen one were talking about excess testosterone were really not talking about oh women making lot of testosterone because frankly they already make a lot that then most people were not aware of that i was not aware that women make more testostrand we need even right and it is not saying that testosterone and women is batter is always a reaction to the environment yes but when it becomes am superphysiological or hyper elevated is i could imagine all sorts of social conditions that would create that am in ma let females but here were talking my psoas in females in particulars id love to you ti speculate she run the study we see totally run the study because i do not know the answer i suspect that you are on to something it may not explain all of the women with visions because as i mention there s lot a different phenotypes but i think it could explain a significant portion and you're almost your seeing if we look at the gene environment in her face this environmental influence of having been some one who is got power over you if if psoas was a response to that the way that we treat it would be completely different on the one hand i want to be careful not to dismiss the suffering and experience of women with psoas have got a lot of women with visions of my family and it is there is much pain and suffering you now especially if you won't t have a baby and you try for years and you just cannot ovulate on the other hand i read a paper recently it may we could type thus that compares the phenotype of a women with visions to a man who is hypo intergenic and i think that is a really interesting way to look at thus because the thread we have not talked about with piss is the the role of insolentant clicks for some of the phenotypes of visions the problem is hyper insolent emit high insolent in the blood is driving those thekasuls in the ares to over prettier tastostron these women are insolent insensitive more insolence being cranked out and the cells in the over yare therefore making more androgen you do not to say insolent resistant oh i i can a i do not have a promise a yes arms i is i i of ai silent outside the lane lines of my ex parts i was trying to yous it what sort is the correctnomen cloture that we can mature what would i about insolent insensitive the way that she just set it is that i think that offers people away and and i love to do that in terms a messaging in sullen resistance starts to lose people's they do not really get what that means tat a receptor level i think i say insolent insensitive because when people here insolent sensitive it almost sounds a bad thing but that is i shall what you rant i think i think that is how i default end to insolent in what is your insolent i do not know what in do for a blood us yes you are am do for blood ten am i had blood work donaarbu ant am sure the be great i i a ism always of experimenting with different supplements in different behavioral regiments and have kept charts since i was nineteen oh your likes my patient i have been sort of of less by this and i would say everybody if you can afforded and at the time actually i had to save up insurgents when cover it am yet some basic blood work one you have a reference do it as soon as possible because even that we have ben talking about these women over the life cycle i wish i knew what my insolent was when i was a tea nature i wish wish i knew what my fastininselen was i really wish i knew my postprandial insolent in my teen eight years in my twenties in my thirties why knew it at my thirty starting at thirty five are you a fan of continuous glucose miners the you just miss gigantic fan of specials have never seen any tool that eve ever used in medicine change behavior the way that specials to why do you think they are effect of at changing behavior have tried one and i really liked it i learn that i in the sand my insolent her my blood glucose cops up probably by bit of the hydration i learn con o food's work for me which do not i i thought its fascia learn however you behavior you could possibly imagine yous tat your imagination impacts blood glucose total i totally fascinating to me including how a to wake wake upspring the mill the night verses one verses none impacted blood glucose the next morning fascinating for a data junky me is i was in heaven i why do you think they are effective in changing behaviors it because of that that people can see that real time control skin in an oh that is the that is the same which i think it to i think its many things i think it is generally the enchantment of learning about your own chemistry ta i love the and i think for me what have seen you know i feel doctors are basically marketers the secret marketing a job as a physician is to convince people to do something that we think is good for them based on the best science but we cannot to say heroin as yo fill is prescription porsygiam you have to market it you have to say i think this completely changes the way that you approach your predibedes i think this could dramatically a fact your risk of allsimers they is that you're worried about that your mother has r job is physicians is to be that sacred marketer seams are one of my tools that i think are crucial enchantment number too yacht it is the real time of fact if you go get your glucosininselen measured or maybe you do a two hour glucose challenge was for you look at glucosininsolen at the fasting point on hour later to hours later or more frequently that does not have the same kind of behavior of fact as having continuous state where you can say oke i drove to see you drew from my place in burley and it was stressful was trenchancy raining and i know my clucks was elevated i think really understanding what the the repeaters are of your glucose control is essential now that is said it is also kind of a later of fact i mean it'd rather know your insolent and we know from the whitehead white hall study that insolent especially post prandial sand martian san too can change years in years before you get a change in clicks am that is more for predabetiesnt cities i think those are the main reasons why i think it is such an important tool third thing is a democratizes data which you do to i mean incredible idea with your podcast but i think one of the most hopeful and exciting things that ism seen right now in the hall space is that we are going from this patriarchal relationship where doctor's whole power and are the gatekeepers at data to patients and clients having much more access to that enchantment about their own chemistry and their own biology to me that is exciting for me to beagle to have got probably a hundred patients that a in a data string with me where were looking at their clicks and i can i mean a monspaticals om not doing the much any more but i can call a patient be why is your plug hi what did you do o is my birthday i had a piece of berthicic that kind of collaboration that also is teaching the patient to be their own cognition to me that is a loop of benevolence and integrity that i think is essential to crating health we have got a disease care system we meed the democratization at data to become health base system a mean to that a million times over a we share that a see moment at candlelit at a deep level i i think the pandemic as she assisted in harm to many things but it assisted in people's understanding that am no magic fairy nor the government nor any any one was can arrive at their door with a kit of things to make them healthy right the provide sunlight movement sleep and all the various aspects of nitrite no nothing nothing that it everyone has to have access to first and foremost and then implement those things as best they can speaking of which in me circling back to this idea of people in their lateens twenty series and onward if you ad a magic wand and you could give two or three do not or to make it personal if you could go back in time and race certain behaviors but what would the the do not category be am you can't tell us more than two or three but if the goal is to maxims vitality and longevity than those are not always a parallel to one another i certainly not the same thing sometimes worth canal but let us say fertility being a proxy for vitality in longevity a will son as free others that festivities and just about people wont ti can see children it is also it is akin serve as a proxy for vitality and longevity o what would you to see patience let us folcass first some female patience but if it extends to male patience as well hell you to see them not do ye were do far less of i really that i would say a few things it'll just set my the then that we can go into detail number one sleep i do when a diverge from you a little bit on some things but sleep is pretty not one of them touch well feel free an hour the one that work a hundred o on t in under ten ours e sleep it that let i gan oi n less unless you lived in a different reality than i do em i you and their times in my career where i was pulling all fighters and sleep thrive their sit i do not recommend it but i did it an i hope you do not do that more no longer if i can avoid it but there were years many years were it was it here we going ism quite a kept at it for one cychael ye but too nights i cannot start fall fall totally i would say sleep it'll call hi perceive stress and it'd love to talk about maybe the did on tell i years some what we now to you to see people get enough sleep do not do notes yet not all of these are concordant am not enough sleep too much a all too much perceive stress eating the wrong foods talks relationships and isolation and the number six not moving enough for not moving and exercising in a way that really fits with your body is art with that one actually share s i such a and then work backwards am i that is interesting i i i think nowadays people appreciate the need for quoting to cardie i know that the the exercise physiolitis cringe an and dissolve into a puddle of tears when i say that but getting the hart rate up over some period of time longer than ten minutes in order to generate cartabascor health circulation and resistance training of some time may flexibility that do you mean by body fend type for and exercise it'll speak from personal experience a wet i did through i man i gave up my twenties to medicine and during that time i occasionally got to the him i you see us at from pernalsa you could go to the him and then as soon as your people went off for your back an to the hospital but i didn't exercise much i had am oryeumember sordid tracks i had a sordid track in my house and now is i was it what i believe because for me the primary it'll come that ism interested and is carry metabolic health when it comes to exercise when i really feel if we are gin to be at a population level i feel that about a third cardie two thirds resistance training is based on my sent thesis the literature the best combination and i think there is youknowas you described with your singing am study i think there is a minimal effector dose which for a population is about a hundred and fifty minutes i think most of us need a lot more than that pas per week r week but i think ouzo for me because i have a phenotype that produce a lot of insolent find a depending on how ism on my game have a lotic glucose have to exercise a lot more to dispose that glucose i think you then have to move from medicine for the population or prescriptions for the population to what works for the individual i think that recommendations fantastic i think resistance training well in put this way neither trainer nor physician but have seen in family members that were doing i would say a lot of cardie but just cardie that when they ad resistance training everything interns including their bile markers u have improve dramatically yes is in particular for female members of my family but one of the one of the detectors that i think is important especially for people who do what i call chronic cardie which is what i did is cortical we know that a runners specially marathon runners people who do a lot of cardie and do not do much resistance training they tend out much his cortical levels and you can buff for that with video an seven man see can decrease the effect but chronic cardie does not always serve people quick personal example when i first t armed measuring forgot panels in myself i went to my physician and i said ism thirty five have had one kid i will not have another kid have never been exhausted en my life i just feel an pushing a rock up till have got this belly fat that i do not and am i i want of secs with my husband what do you think what could we do about this and he offered a birth controlpil and an anti to present goodness i left him and i went to the lab and i ran a hormone panel and my cortical was three times what it should have been my insolent was in the twentieth i was fasting my glucose was a hundred and five my fired was mildly abnormal my projector on was low and that set me on this course of realizing that what i was doing as a physician taking care especially of women was not getting to some of the r causes that are essential and i would say i had to start force with cortical at that time i was running four miles three times a week for times a week tat was just racing my cortical further that was not the right exercise for me i needed more adaptive exercise i sir doing polities for yoga that help to lower my cortical i man it started me on you no changing the way i was managing perceive stress an talk to change my supplement richmond it c we talk about that am a with mom you said a lowering cortoisall thought of an the too supplements that come to mine are a aschuagonda which i think can potently reduced cortoisall but have heard some recommendations about cycling it a and have always wonder about time of day froschwegonda and take because sort of quartic want cartoisall elevate in the early part of the day yes an we know this ah we know you do not want cortical piking later in the day know you do not i interferesele sleep interferes to sleep i and and then the other supplement is a radio croatia do i my pronounce in neccorth yes eidola is very effect it is been shown and multipleranomies trials to lower cortical that could be very effective what sort dos have started taking it recently by the way and i made a huge mistake i to make the mistakes first than my eminences do not make them a as i was taking it i hear it was an adapted gin i thought it'll take it before resistance training but of course you want the cortoisall epic bring resistance training because that is on a setting motion the adaptive response i starting it later in the day and it is really improved i was sin my late day second half the day cognition this is subjective to be fair i just feel a many more even plain of attention in the second half of the day you are describing an an of one experiment right which is data it it well it it is not anecdotal i was taught at or medical equal that the diarchy of evidence starts the lowest with expert opinion was studies then you have got cord studies then you have got a observational data that is prospective than you ran i is trial but the highest quality evidence of all is the n of one experiment where you serve as your own control which your describing with roseola i would frame that as nanobone experiment we have a wash out period and you compare before and after and it'd to measure some other metrics to see if there is in effect including your cortical radio has been shown in multiplranimise trials to reduce cortical the other thing that i think is supereffective is phosphititl seeing p s for short fichwoil also more modestly reduces cortical shwa good is interesting in my first put the hormone cure which i read by the way you did id i was hoping that was the when your i did i read it and it is spectacular and i thought going into it i had this i let just call what t was as come man by us as there can be anything in here fracas a ism i do not have overexpand you knows as scum y and it was immensely in formative am a thank you ya i have very fond recollections of the the walks i took listening to it and then i own the print version to i to switch back an forth thank you for that it is a it is a our book for any one to real y i appreciate that in chapter four you may or may not remember that oshwagonda at least the time that i wrote that book oshwagonis data is not great but lake proof is not perfect against with oshvagonda most the data comes from thousands of years if you seen it in poetic medicine and it is considered again not my science hat it is considered a double adapted in that it is potentially helpful when you are a hi cortoisalphinat i i was i sometimes still am or low cortical i have not found that in my patience althoughi'll give you one exception oschagonda is mosey as on animal studies there is not as much human data but it is used a ton in anygreative medicine the am there is one supplement that have found to be incredibly helpful for people who ten a high cortical at night and that is called cortical manager is by anagram their poetics i do not have a second am supplement manufacture that makes something similar it is their number one selling supplement because it is effect visit a cocktail of several it is a combination of phospotitle seeing and ischia fondu till tell me more about phosphorite serena i am familiar with it for it is been mention by some guys that were on the tempers podcast long ago for other reasons i think rely to sleep yes om and maybe that is another reason why you it them but before we move on from radial the zeradosage of rodialorization at you i would refer people to my book because the ranamizs trials and the doses that were used are in there cannot remember with roseola although i took it this morning to prepare to be with you we can look it up and pa show note caption i can remember that as with phosphotiles drier because i take that regularly four hundred eight hundred milligrams is the typical dis for ps and what is interesting is that in the ranamizs trials that were done for under milligrams was more effective than eight hundred milligrams interesting have fund that for several supplements that the lower dose was more effective yes i ye i wont it does not matter what those wore and to ye see p you referring to by the way folks not p c o s just as scientist an citations are familiar with an military her familiar wit acronyms a phosphorite seeing papa four hundred eight hundred milligrams for hundred be more effective taken later in the day or early day does it matter it depends on when your cortical is high for me i tend to in an what is the pattern for cortoisall typically it rises to it is pile thirty to sixty minutes after you get up then it has is gradual kind of asymptotic decline until you go to bet if your someone me who pikes way crazy hi i do not do that any more but that is what i used to do i needed phosphatize seeing in the morning for people who are high at night who have wets known as a a flat cortical pattern or a inverted pattern you want to take it at night and the flat pattern just quickie bar is that that is associated with a number of conditions that most man stream physicians do not know about flat pattern where it is low in the morning and it is high at night is see with anxiety depression a decreased survival from break camper that was stupid at stamford by avid speckle that that he was my am collar close even collaborator even a on the breath work study that we o interesting ye he is a asocial cursychatre now a wonderful human being has a mazes has been a guest on this pass an and ism now fantasizing by t a conversation that includes a a panel of o a incredible mines you and avid from the clinical side in any case a yet the late shifted cartes all not to good not woodland it seems to have the worst a man downstream is us of any of the carousal patterns that is really important to know about because it then maps to things am it is related to pities that is the pattern we see liken vats who have got peatiest as well as others it maps to out immunity it maps to fiber alga i was told that one in twelve people am have or hatterosigus one mute copy or holomorphic for some some mutation in a renal related genes o can general dream hyper plasma is that true and if that means that one and twelve people walking around a cranking out far too much charts all or not enough arts all or the fortis all system is already screwed in a direction that makes life more challenging at the levels were talking about am did i hear that correctly causethat one an twelve is not a small number it is not a small number it fits with what i see clinically i mean i one a see that at just to see am what is that mean and could yo modulated with environmental influences but it is certainly fits with what i see ouzo i was tat once again and mainstream medicine that in drums of a real function it is very binary how most clinicians think about it you either have prisons doses and you do not make enough cactus all or you have got bushings or pushing said pattern and you make too much quarts all and anything in the middle is normal and my experience is that hell now there are those of us me who make a lot of cortical i do not have cushions maybe have got one of these i would not call it a mutinying i would call it more of a a vulnerable gene maybe i have one of this maybe that is part reason why i make two to three times what i should be ism aware of a certain groups of individuals from with in the military sector that hap there is of more frequent occurrence of some mutation and she age can you con general drank hyperyout not a silly two copies which i if people look that out there can a go while there is all these if phenotypes and but sir holomorphic type things you do not less than or too much cortical and they are very good at staying up multiple days per night right a momultible nights in series they can pull all fighters very easily yo they can push harder when most people quit and ore thinks well that is a great phenotype to have but guess what it is because they hyper pretty coatis all yet and that is interesting and i think if we were to panel medical students and graduate student and you were look at who is pulling excessively long hours who stressed out a lot if even outside of macadamia medicine and pushing pushing pushing really hard i think the ability to push and not crash we think of it is adaptive but in some sense it is maladaptive over series of years which is or fewer you described earlier yet such a good plant because you know you in some ways you want select for that an certain professions and the military and medicine but i would wonder for those folks about the downstream consequences a pretty seems much cortical it is got a be detrimental for the hit is got any long run and and you see that but he is in the data show that if your some one me who makes a lot of mortise all pirates a depression fifty person of people with major depression now high coatis a levels pirates of suicide much more metabolic dysfunction we know that drama as in example maps to an increase risk of clucks metabolic misses and certainly his cortical does that cause it is one of the cops of cortical is to manage a clues and it is it con of such you up for this when number five chichis tocsin relationships you know some one who hyper produces cortiseall it is hard to live with some one that it is also i would stay people that have this let us just call it biological resilient it is not always adaptive because you can stay in bad circumstances longer the ability to to crash provided is not suicide or life life destroying or long arc of of of pass n the requirements of you take two years off from work or school or something the ability to keep pressing on as it is a double lite sort let us as i i want to make sure an instant within that this conversation a because you mention nosedive syria we talked about rerodiola regatta i should we talk a bit about oshregonda you have also talked about megatheres and fishbowl in particular i love to know your favorite sources of these i think now days ears more general acceptance that getting these essential phatiacids is important do you have a threshold level love sort of grahams i have encouraged a podcast listeners to consider depending on what there eating to try and get a graham of e p a on more per day does it seem excessive and what are the real baton es because then the a cardiovascular experts always hit back and say o no it is not good for carry o vascular health than the he lads better than ante to presence another studies in i feel if you really want to make your life difficult yo one ta raise your cuortersall you go on twitter n you say something passive bout o mama three and a and you learn a lot a what are your thoughts on ha megatheres i take a lot of em ism always been a big fan ye the where i personalizes i think some people need more than others and what i do is i measure your level this gets back to unofiscional dusting for you i would just and make a quant or when o my favorite carry metabolic panels is to do a cleveland hartal i think they they give me the most reliable information not just for let this an up classes and you know an aware fractionation but it also gives me an insolent restart store it gives me a levels of a make threes i we will provide links to these different gentes the people but one quick thing about that the whole story is not a make a threes in taking fishtail the work of charity's sir can at the bridal is showing that the way that we resolve inflammation are understanding of it is really i think in the learning to crawl stage and if you look at the a make a three six pathway in the body fishbowls can help run of push the reactions in a particular direction but typically they are not enough for the resolution of inflammation now what most people do including my an be players is they pop and i beprophen or s something that when they have got inflammation that is got lots of other did effects that are not good for you and we know in terms of the resolution of inflammation that taken something i breprophen reduces the amplitude of inflammation by about fifty per cent but then a potentially blocks the complete resolution of inflammation there is these new supplements that you may have heard of called specialized pro resolving mediators there is lot of different supplement companies that make then and that combined with fishtail seems to be the best commination and what i do for athletes who have got now con of the normal as and pains of the training load they have is all combine a little spray smooths just a eighty one milligrams i donas baby spray together with fish oil plus specialized pro resolving repeaters and there is some that a nasal their cart fid for sports but the the dose i would say with my nations some of them only need a thousand telegrams you are gram that you mention for the population some of them need six grams together with spies i think it hos to be personalize how young is it o k for people tho start taking o mama threes am for instance young women in their teens wen their twenties in the thirties young guys in their twins and thirties should they take fishwife if just as a assuming the'renot can they get anything tested something but the college student who is really into bile markers that for they will go do some but many people will not but they want to do the right thing they'll trying drink a little less hopefully hopefully they will not smoker map please do not smoke or tape the idea that raping is o was liked we had a less bad bad everything our i let and that as i er exactly just of what they the fully they'll try and avoid those things hopefully they will avoid hard drugs am hopefully they'll avoid getting any best eyes if they do they will resolve them quickly helpfully yes i but they might say a well am willing to i no take som magnesium or take some fhosphodele seeing buff for my quarters all eat some vegetables am should they consider taking fishbowl as a kind of across the board i copulatory thing i wit to rank or er these i would say fish oil yes i think a thousand milligrams as a general recommendation is good but else have a food first philosophy my preference would be that they are having salmon or some run of smash fish and they are getting that as the primary source they're make a threes and then the day is that they do not have fish i recommend it probably twice a week that they take fish oil then i would put magnesium next since many people are decision the i probably put fight him indeed what how many i you victim an deeper day will you keep ask me thus is for the the population n at well for the lemme put this way for the lies for the lazy person or and this is an or not an end am or the person who am just does not have the finances to go get measure yea levels measured casette eat or audiences a huge range we got a o can aprons disposable in come that less in the spot we be let no disposable income a thousand a two thousand in nationally and but mi what i do as i dose to a serum level that is between about fifty and ninety great and i have a fight i in see receptor a step and i need to take about five thousand a day to get to what i need a lot o people do not need that and you know there is some supplements that i soft know they need you mention fospitiles seeing for some one who is a college student and they are cortisols completely normal they are wasting their money on ps they do not need it they might need it later but they do not need it now i to make sure that we circle back to birth control in particular oral contraceptive birth control and we should touch on a you is of perhaps will bit more but what are your thoughts on or pure estrogen birth control is what i learn when i was in colleges that birth controls basically tonic estrogen constantly taking estrogen estrogen women ore taking estrogen that they do not get the estrogen priming of protest your own your nosing in any ovulation and have known women that have been taking oral contract that took moral contraception is estrogen pills basically for five ten fifteen years are there long term consequences of this as it relates to pregnancy peck let men pause what if what are some of those consequences a what are you concerns what you about oral contraceptives what you dislike about them i how balance you ask that question women who take oral contraceptives as long as your describing like ten years a longer were call those olympic roll contraceptive users in terms of benefit i think that especially when they first came out and even now it gives women reproductive choice and tots essential as you may know our reproductive choice to spend declining recently ism a big fan in that regard and we have got a lot of data to show both the risks and also the benefits of it it'll speak first into the benefits because a amenity get on as a box a little bit about the risks we know that it reduces the risk of a bearing cancer there is something about this idea of incessant population that is not good for the female body if you look at for instance women who are nuns who i do not take all contraceptives and they have a period every single month of their reproductive lives they have a great a risk of a bearing cancer if you look then at women who have a several babies and they have got a period of time when they are pregnant thatched are not ovulating and and they breastfeed for some period one time they have a lower risk of if bring anger oral conscious contraceptives help with reducing population and reducing risk we know that if you take the oral contraceptive for about five years it reduce to risk of a bearing cancer by fifty per cent and that significant because we are poor at dike no seen bearing cancer early there is really know method that is really effective we use see wen twenty five and alter sound screening e specially and women who are at greater genetic risk but even that often we dines it in a later stage maybe just because that stamens going to high light for a number of people on the question of what are some of this an early best symptoms that people can recognize without a blood test as overlying cameras it can be pain the problem is the symptoms are i and there is non specific on of the most common symptoms is bloating and we have already talked about constipation we have talked about our women have this longer track i track and bloating as a really common experience for most women you cannot bulk symptoms seen of feeling might yer your lower belly is con pressed out the way that we in form women in terms a watching for thus is to get regular on acoustic exams for women who are at high is where they have for instance not for sound for some reasons a mass that were concerned about there is a way to trash that in terms of what kind of a valuation that they need and that is e situation where you might get a blood toss called the a went twenty nine see i wen twenty five the foot the problem is the symptoms are vague it could be it depends on how big the tumors much bulk you have what it is pressing on if if taking estrogen and thereby reducing the frequency of ovulation lowers the risk of a varying answer should women that are even come who are not sexually active then they are not actually trying to get prison or avoid getting protein but if here not sexually active than the probability of conceiving unless they go through e some i i or some other rout is is very low as far as i know was tauten high school any em would they be wise to suppress population for periodically using hormone base contraception just that they can offset the risk of averting answer that is a very rational question and i would say that is what means try medicine has had at its back to recommend oral contraceptives not just for women who are seeking contraception but for acne for painful periods for really another drop of i hat they are prescribing oral contraceptives that is what i was tout to do but there is many consequences and i think the issue here is more about consent because in none you and and i started out as bort evite ope you and and i now mostly see men but i was taught as newbetou an to convince women to go on the or contraceptive and i think a lot of hat is formasitical influence may we could talk about the risks and why the answer is now to your question m as wed do that could i just ask is the on the called a ring the new used to be called the new for ring me that is a brand name but when i was in colleges all ways discussion about the ring i by both men and women for reasons it that i do not belong on the podcast is your imagination folks em is the ring obviously it is not a orbit is not a forlorn on contraception but it is hormone base right the it is the leasing estrogen locally as suppose to taking it only but would you would you slot under what you are about to tell us in terms of the concerns we have less data about the ring the oral contraceptive is two hormones it is spaniel extradite and it is a progestin it is not the normal a progesterone that your body makes a turoverese making your adrenals make it is a synthetic form of progesterone and it is the same progestin similar the same class that was shown to be dangerous and provocative in the woman's help initiative ism not a fan progestins i do not recommend them for any woman unless the consequence of not taking them is surgery or some other a unless it it gives them some freedom in some way i do not progestins the a nerve ring is estragon plus progestin but it is released transdermal through the vagina given the the way that a it is delivered to the vagina the doses are lower than what is taken worldly but in terms of some of the is tat back talk about we do not know about much to the data we think that it is similar there is problem spectrum of risk and the neutering is a little more towards the middle than what ism talking about with oral consciseptives a ready for that ye ism ready for the risks one with almost any firmacitocal the oral contraceptive to pleads certain micrinutriance magnesium there cart incitement beer depended a it also effects the microfilm that data is not as strong but there seems to be some effect in there is also an increase risk of inflammatory baldies in automat condition it increases inflammatory tone the studies that have seen increase one of the markers of inflammatorytone sense to be sharp by about two to three acts its seems to make the hypothalamic pituitary a renal axis more rigid that you cannot kind of roll with the punches and wagon wain and terms of martial production the way that you can off the birth controlpill it can affects rid function ism thinking of the slide that i have that as ten problems assisted with the oral contraceptive but that is what i can rememberata that is very helpful and it makes me wonder whether or not if on the one hand re contraceptive or protective in woman it is a veryincancer but than the have these other issues ye there is one other i want o mention please and you time you take oral estragon it raises secwormon by niglobulan and you have talk to other podgascas about this file i think secworman binding globular i think of as a bunch that see free estrogen and free testosterone when you go on the birth control bill you raised your sexworman dining globular it is sup especially free testosterone and for some women it is not a big deal they do not notice much of a difference but then there is a phenotype maybeyou related to we g repeats on the aldermen receptor who are exquisitely sensitive to that decline in free testosterone this then opens the portal of talking a little bit about testosterone and women we have mentioned already that it is the most abundant biologically the most abundant woman in the female system even though men make almost ten times as much or even more than ten times it is important for women it is essential you many things not just sex drive in muscle mass and seen a response to resistance training but also confidence in agency and those women who are sensitive to their testosterone lobule they have got this high sexwormon binding globular and their testosterone declines what they describe is vaginal dryness maybe a decline in strive but there is also this bigger issue related to confidence in agency even rest taking from studies that we have done with empty students that i think is a serious problem maybe the most important out of all of these things is that it can shrink the cherish by up to twenty per cent twenty per cent and that include i a regression f the of the nerves an innervate the the liters is at i men that is a very good question as in euro scientists i would think of house to tiny the normal side of of reductive help we need you a series on sexual may you choose that with the i we could certainly was your expertise i think m yet that is a dramatic these dry a at umber at but then let us go back to the sacred marketing if have got a woman that i think should not be on the birth control bill made be taken it for actin or takin it cause her periods were a little painful what a monk de is say let us leverage these other ways of making your period less painful let us take the message of our painful periods and figure out locates at your inflammatory tone and we give you some fishbowl n es piss may be a little spray when you got your period let us find some other ways to deal with it then to take the old contraceptive which you have not received in form consent about because it can think your lit by a to twenty per cent now that usually convinces most people to bomber reversing the elevation in sermon dining globular does not seem to go away when you come off the birth controlled to me that is the biggest problem with proscribing or contraceptive now the data that we have is limited there is one woman who a clod something something who looked at sexwormon dining globular a year out from stopping the big the control pill and it was still elevated it was not as high as it was when they were on the pill but it was still elevated your question about reversibility i do not know if we know the answer that well of that is the o that is a significant statement and something that for consideration related to this although this might seem not related it is how early do you recommend that women go get there logical number assessed in other words to get a size a sense of theorize of the ovarian reserve and their a my levels o measured u amnio am an amateur outsider as i say this but we have an episode on fertility i just describe the ovulatory menstrual cycle yum and ism not the best person ans to yet well we con too far out from it of will cut suppose then from taking the perspective of somebody who thinks about fertility it in terms of at least congruent with baldy and lonchevitya would given that it is fairly non in evasive s an ultrasound or and a blood drawer m h for both is there any reason why woman would not want to get her logical number passed or her am h levels assessed is there any reason why because i was shocked to learn that most women do not do this till there hitting their late thirties or early forties and the other haven't conceived or they suddenly decide that they want a conceived i thought why does not every doctor insisted their female patients have their my level addressed that if they need to it is trees eggs is a cold it is cost yes i think if you have got the disposable income to do it go for it it is not included a standard blood cannot well the only women in my practice who have had amah son and new looked at their logical count are women who want i frees there's or an that requires disposal income or they am are having trouble getting pregnant they are in the reproductive ante chronology system and their getting and evaluation and then they are also am the women who have symptoms of early menaces premature a vermin insufficiency which is before each forty a those only women that i see getting trusted and i think you are right that it should be offered more broadly it speaks to the democratization of data again and i think most women do not know that your doing a huge service i think to be speaking into this whole other point related to that is that what i see in conventional medicine is that when a women asked for hormone panel and she is not trying to get pregnant she usually gets told that whore's very too much it is a ways to money you do not need it or if you are feeling hormone when it you gone o birth control big unless she is trying get pregnant if she is trying to get pregnant suddenly those same ten are very reliable and they get there they are testosar on the free testrosteround their thyroid panel they get the estrogen progesterone maybe they get their corpus all they get their mate there is a double standard between those who wanting a pregnant and those who do not and that meet send yet tolly agree as have learn more about them ovulatory cycle an animation and the antral population of flicks on it is fascinating it to seems to me were relatively straight for a test one defile evasive ultrasound but and i consider that ye a not a not terribly invasive but invasive a least but the other one just pure blood test just seems why would not i would this be offered covered by insurance or or that any one that want it but now now i understand why you mention men pass huge topic enormous topic a we had a guess on the podcassus not a cognition who said something in passing o i won it i likely to get this wrong but what they said was that the results of the large scale trials on hormone replacement therapy for women for men pass said something to the effect of if the hormone therapy was started early enough it was very beneficial for yes vitality in health outcomes whereas if women when through men pass and then initiate the hormone therapy hormone replacement therapy that it could be detrimental to their health first of all i do i recall that statement correctly and then second of all what sorts of hormones are being replaced is it just estrogen and how is that done is it done through birth control that oral contraceptives neutering what are your thoughts on menopause when should people start thinking about it and what is the palate of things available that we can do an entire episode you noon this topic in the future but just to i in i get lot of questions about this and and ism guessing they son everything you have told me to day that there are women in their thirties that while they may be twenty years out from men pass probably should be doing things now in hesitation of that yes we have been talked about the thirty something but i totally agree with you the more about your china type your hormonal china type when you are in your thirties you are set up in terms of what do in the future especially things your third your estrogen protesters loves cause you can replace he a state of youthiright whatever that is for you you can replace i do not usually go exactly back to where the estrogen protesters loves were were but we can get pretty close in your thirties having a base case i think it is really essential you spoke to the women help initiative which was publish and two those too and we went from a huge number of women taking harmony thereby to a very small percentage in the range of five percent and that means we have got millions millions of women who are suffering needlessly with things in sonic difficulty with their mood difficulty with strive a feeling they are cousin the store in terms of sex because they are not on haormontherepy i would agree with the statement that she made that harmony thereby particular forms that are similar to which her body always made when it is given judiciously at the right time typically within five ten years of menaces which is fifty one to fifty two that it is incredibly safe it is a complicated study the woman's health initiative but it was the the wrong study in the wrong patients with the wrong medications and a with some of the wrong outcomes was power to look at carry vascular outcomes was not power to look at bees cancer it was stopped because of break caner risk but what happened in the control arm o the study was that they had an incredibly low rate a break cancer and as a result they did up having this increased risk of bees cancer at five years and they stop the study now the study was done with synthetics it was done with conjugated anguine estergan known as premeran and hydroxy progesterone state this were the called estergan and progesterone those are a synthetic worms we think especially the progestin is associated with the great ariscof bees cancer although the the subsequent reevaluations of the data now eighteen years out have shown that a this problem with the control group and no increase risk a break cancer a and for the women who got estrogen only those who had a histractme the premeran they actually had a decrease bees cancer risk and decreased bees cantor mortality there is a lot to be said about this some trying to keep it really brief but if you look at the women fifty to sixty within ten years of menaces they're the one who seem to have the greatest benefit they had a decreased subclinical atherisculorosa less carry vascular disease they had an improvement in terms of a bone health a less progression to diabetes and then over the age of sixty they started have greater risk of certain outcomes such as crdivascroses my martial in fiction and on you asked about a what do i do and to me this problem is not just menaces what is more interesting is to talk about peri menaces peri mananas is the the period of time before your final minstrel cycle an for most women depending on how it tunes you are to the symptoms it can last for ten years am still in peri maps id seen twenty years because have been tracking it carefully it usually gets kicked off by having yourcycl get closer together that can happen your thirties or your fortes you go from twenty days to twenty five days that sort of thing you may notice that starts sleeping more poorly because prodestron important you talked about that with kyle you may notice it as more anxiety difficulties sleeping and that probably is related to the estray receptor ear alpha is a estrshan receptor alpha is anxious a it increases anxiety ear bed is since with an inxiolitic activity and then there is a total about six cesterson receptors now there is the the g heroin coupled estrin receptors and this are mixed anxiolitic inxiagenic a there is this whole period of peri mensal what is most fascinating to me and we have got a talk about this either today or another tine is that there is this massive massive changes that happens in the female brain that people are not talking about enough and looking at the work of lesamascony at corneal from a starting around each forty there is this massive change in cerebral metabolism so can do it g pekans you can look at glucose take and there is about on average a twenty percent decline from premenapas up to age thirty five to perry menaces to postmenapas the women for having the most symptoms in very menaces menapasa ha plash the nights was the difficulties sleeping those of the ones who have the most significant cerebral hypo metabolism is almost i a i do not i don't want a scare people with this language but is is low level or let us call it judo demensho of sorts yes it it seems to be a fend type that you can then map to all timers times because that is lesamoscony's work she is slipping at o ka all timer's disease is not at disease of old age it is disease of middle age what some the piomarkers that we can define that can tell you what you risk is have got a mother and a grandmother with allsimers disease you can believe i am all over this data an insolent resistance up mtencitivity as we tough before a seems to be somewhere in there it which i think it when that first when that i a for surface a you people really but then of course random in the brain is this incredibly men of ally demanding organ you deprive neurons of fuel sources they for you make them less sensitive to fuel sources they stare dying that is only start firing less it makes perfect sense and i think now it is thinks releases work work that you have t you have done in i talked about quite a lot is am your books and elsewhere i think its really hi lighted for people that metabolism a metabylomacs is going t be as important is genes in genomics when it come that's right dementia perhaps especially in women is it safe to say that i think i think because we believe that the system is regulated by enteron the decline in entertain starting around ah forty forty three is cone onto average seems to be the driver behind cerebral hypo metabolism the way i describe it to my patience is it is slow brain energy you walk into a room you cannot remember why you just notice that you cannot manage all the tassowat whtyou once could things are just a little slower and i say that to women are i have that i help me this is then circling back to deva i where women are scared to death of taking hormone there and we have got all of these women that are marching toward potentially a greater risk of all timers disease and they have this opportunity in their forties and their fifties to take hormone therapy and they may not be offered it because the typical conventional approach basion to beat is to say unless you are having photoflashes and nights wets that our severe ism not going to give you hormone there and i i just want o call that out i would say no that is not the way to approach it further the concept right now in conventional medicine is that photoflashes and nights beats are these new sit symptoms that we will take care of temporarily maybe with a little bit of entertain protesters or birth control does it is given a lot or the they pass ere this you ideal an as suck it up suck it up does a matter that shore not sleeping any more turn down the temperature in groom and that is not right because flesh is a night sweats are a bilemarker of party metabolic disease they are a bilemarker of increase bonbons they are a bilemarker of changes in the brain many symptoms that occur in perry menaces are not driven by the ovaries they are driven by the brain it is the the bidirectional cross talk between the body in the brain keeps no i think is this resounding theme we chrispalmer on here sygatris is time a keetogenicdi toting until health i know you we can have a whole other discussion of man we will i hope if you'll agree to it about nutrition an as release to hormones o specific diets and forth but the and that is a question to whether this problem of cerebralhypometopolism could we solve it with estragon candor increase metabolic flexibility i just wanted e met the e sit interact you knot please a please interrupt em i i know our sales were there i know you are a fan in some instances of intermitting fasting time restricted feeding candor qeitogenic diet yes to get sells sensitive to insolent which is not to say if i understand correctly which is not to say that women me to stay on the erogenic diet for long periods of time were intermitting fast my only time restricted feeling for eight hours or six hours a day but that by increasing you said metabolic flexible ability souse me but by increasing sells sensitivity insolent and then may be returning to a more typical eating pattern periodically switching back and forth that might cash benefic be beneficial to i have that right yet i love the pulse i feel li cuts much more physiologic than say going on a keitogenic diet and staying there for years all of the data that we have on the keitogeni diet it is pretty limited in terms duration you know the the longest players that we have in terms of the data are the folks with apolupsy and that is just a different phenotype i think in terms of mycrobiomafacts diversity tospayosis months issues we really do not know in terms of long termagants i prefer with a biogenic diet that it is use as an end of one experiment and that you do it for four weeks maybe measure by markers before and afterwards maybe ligature stool before and afterwards we still an told about stool just yet but you could measure your fasting insolent and your glucose you you just start there do four weeks of quite clean kqeito including vegetables does not have to be fifty seven to day and then measured again afterwards since you measure a mention stool testing yes what what is your recommendation about stool testing my recommendation thesis again in the the field of if you have the disposable and comes i usually start with nova because they have got a good cope system with insurance that is what i typically use i usually do there one day stool was we have to go picking through your stool and send it off to the slab that is in north caroling i usually do the one day unless some concerned about parasites in that case i tend to do three days i do that for people who travel a fair amount and go to places where there is great a risk or they just have got symptoms another test that i do a lot is was i was to mention to labs is at test by one levity and this is much more of at databank type of task as powered by a i was designed by any who c to inflammatory boldisese and he is a he is a peegety deep phenisipeing bi in aromatic sky who wanted to make this really easy the test is is under the umbrella of thorn and u the call i up by o they might have another name for it and they just improved it o that is is a wipe and taking three her stool and my athletes it'll do it now they were not into taking through their still before is anybody really join i do not want the answer r i know the answer i refer that an that is a super interesting us because it is you get much more dense take a the issue is am with apologies to my friends at thorn this sue is that there recommendations and a being thorn supplements that can be very easy for people who want to in a connect the dots that is not always the way that i to do it a first of all three things you have shared with us an immense amount of knowledge a and in that first statement i also want to apologize because i threw it you the entire life span of a female life span reproductive health contraception i it a microfilm many things but a i first i just want to say you taught me a tremendous amount including i think something that it most people in clear myself have not thought about enough which is the psychosocial impact on things that we are all familiar with constipation ball movements what we eat what we avoid have to say really a huge thank you for that because is not something that is been discussed on this pod cast before of know that brain communicates with body psychology no biology or linked but i think that is the first time that any one's ever directly linked circumstances and biology an psychology in such a concrete way that is that is the first thing i mut speak for many people in that second of all we barely scratch the surface of your knowledge and am which is both a frustrating for me because a it i always want to learn more and know many other people do as well but also very very exciting because a with a hopefully without much persuasion we can have you back on to talk about theresn't at all mana i know your working with men now men health a some particulars around par i think it there is more for us to explore in terms of pieces menopause contraception and and all of the above but then something that you and i were talking bout off camera before we started which i think is really important factor that ties back to this assume of a drama and stress and the by directional relationship between biology an psychology hopefully some day we will not even separate those too alarum w oh is the use of specific medicines including plant medicines yes and how that can influence over all health which no doubt will include worm on health i say all of that o for two reasons first of all to cue up the we will not him call it a part to but a sequel the to this was a gratified to hear that you you will join us for that and then also did just really extend a huge thank you the amount of knowledge that you shared is is immense and to is going to be very very useful an actionable for for men in terms of their thinking in their actions and for women in particular to day's discussion and pro her for women in terms of how to think about their health and biology how to think about their psychology and the environment that all that is invented and i just want to say an enormous thank you think you drew i appreciate that an i appreciate whit you offer to the world an terms o away an away to understand physiology and how to craft a architect a better life a can i us add one last thing as i sin tagoatitsso we didn't get o the forties the fifties on this lis o by a markerarys to i feel if people if women went away with one thing to day it would be to do a corner artery calcium score by age forty five and sooner if you have got premature a to sees how is that taken it is a c than of the chest you can self order it i think it stamped hospital you can self order at last time a patient check to is to under viteolars o again dispose will income but it it tells you it it almost gives you this fork in the road in terms of how much you need to pay attention to carry metabolic health as a women and it is a forty five for men to if you have not had one have you had one no you need one in is on parties all c s great it'll run all that by you it is really essential and it is some ya it is it is fascinating because there is some women who have a zero my score zero and that is great often you can just keep doing what you are doing it if you are forty five in your starting to be elevated or you have got no maybe's got piece asses you have got some other by o markers tending you in this attraction toward the number one killer really it is nine out of the top ten killers an you es got allows you to really start to make changes and i i think it is essential to know that data it is not it is probably nock to be offered by you are doctor certainly peter was can offer it but most conventional doctors are not a do it and then e last thing i on us but be forty ma said if i were to go to my doctrine i you say one a cardiac calcium score that is what yo culinary artery calcium store i sac of b everyone hear that and know that if you are forty year older and maybe if your forty five forty five or older yet get it the last thing a sin ti for men and women is the a square first childhood experiences knowing your a store is essential and terms a a line for howmuch drama your system your pine system endured when you're kid and we know that childhood drama whether it is abs sir noplace or having a colic parent that maps disease in middle age and i can give you much insight it'll give you an example have got a patient who had an elevated corner artery calcium score who does everything right with her food i think was sir drama that elevated her c when she was forty five i think an a score knowing your a square starting as a tea her knowing it and knowing how to work with that is really essential there are certain people they are exceedingly rare but you are one such person that when they speak knowledge just comes from comes out of them an its you incredibly useful helpful knowledge thank you ism going to get both of those things dam and i highly recommend at everyone else pursue ways that they can get those who are if they cannot get them that they no you remark those as things to get at the point where they they can obtain sufficient a disposable income sounds the the health a the detriments to health that those can offset would be well worth the cost totally thank you thank you for join me for to day's discussion all

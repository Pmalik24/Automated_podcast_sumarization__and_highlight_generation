welcome to the superman saponin a science science pace to ne r i man drew supermen and on a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor a lea drum doctor drum is a tenor professor of psychology at stamford university and the founder and director of the stamford mind and body lab her work focuses on mind sets how what we think in what we believe shapes the way that our physiology our biology reacts to things what we eat or stress or exercise indeed as you will soon learn from my discussion with doctor drum what you believe about the nutritional content of your food changes the way that food impacts your brain and body to a remarkable degree and the same is true for mind sets about exercise and stress and even medication for instance recent work from doctor crumbs laboratory shows that what we believe about the side effect profiles of different drug treatments or different behavioral treatments has a profound impact on how quickly those treatments work and the effectiveness of those treatments just want to mention one particular study that just came out from a graduate student in doctor crumbs laboratory loin how echo w e showed that how kids react to a treatment for peanut ologies can be profoundly shaped by whether not those kids were educated about the side effects of the treatment such that if they learn the the side effects where a by product of a treatment that would help them and they learned a little bit about why those side effects arose and that the sideeffects might even help them in route to overcoming their penatalogy had an an enormous impact on how quickly they move through the treatment and indeed how much they suffered or in this case did not suffer from those side effects and that is but one example that you will learn about to day as we discuss what mind sets are than number of different mind sets that exist and how we can adopt mind sets that make us more adaptive more effective allow us to suffer less and to perform better in all aspects of life i personally find the work of doctor electrum to be among the most important work being done in the fields of biology and psychology and the interface of mind body everything that she is done up until now and published and indeed the work that she continues to do has shaped everything within my daily routines within my work routines within my athletic routines and we probably shouldn't be surprised by the fact that doctor from works on all these things she was not only an incredibly accomplish tenured research professor she is also a clinical psychologist and she was also a division one athlete and a elect gymnast at one period in her life she really walks the walk in terms of understanding what mind sets are and applying them in different aspects of life ism sure you are going to learn a ton from this conversation as did i and come away with many many actionable items that you can apply in your own life in fact as we march into to day's conversation you might wanted just put in thebaccur mind the question what is my mind set about blank for instance ask yourself what is my mind set about stress what is my mind said about food what is my mind said about exercise what is my mind said about relationships of different kinds because in doing that you willie in a great position to extract the best of the information that doctor from presents and indeed to adapt those mind sets in the way this can be most beneficial for you before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls t stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigrens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microbus interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen and claim a special offer theu'llgive you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are in elements and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element el ament tat calm at slash he are and now my conversation with doctor a lea from great to have you here e great diver for the record it is a leacrom but you go by ally crib that is curtain doctor alycrom i just dally o c t well have been looking forward to talking you for a long time just to start off talk to lot and worked a lot on the science of mind sets could you define for us what is a mind set and what sort of purpose does it serve of course yet mind sets have been described or defined in a lot of ways we define minds its as corbelief sir assumptions that we have about a remain or category of things that friends us to a particular set of expectations explanations and gulls that is kind of jargon little i can a distill it down for use of minds sets are an assumption that you make about a domain take stress for example the nature of stress what is your sort of for belief about that and mind sets that we have studied about stress are do you viewstresses enhancing good for you r adieu viewed as debilitating and bad for you those minds uts those for beliefs orient a thinking they change what we expect will happen to us when we are stress how we explain the occurrences that happen or unfolds an we are stress and also change are motivation for what we engage in when we are stress as we have mind its about many things mind us about stress minds es about intelligence as carol waxwork has shown mind es about food mind us about medicine you name it at sort of distilling down those corassumptions that really shape and orient are thinking in action i ford you say before that mind set simplify life consume way by constraining the number of things that we have to consider om and it sounds to me we can have mind sets about many things as as you said what are some different mind sets i think a many people are familiar with our college carol does a notion of growth mind set that if we are not profession it is something that at we should think about not being proficient yet that we are on some path to proficiency but what are some examples of mind sets om and cowardly do these get laid down or do we learn them from our parents o may be n gust on fleshing out a bit for us and terms of what use what you have observed in your own science or your own life even yes sure i think it is important with with carol waxwork a lot of people counting get focus on growthsmotivation an lathes things but her work really originated from thinking about what she call this implicit theories or corbeliefs about the nature of intelligence are ability it is a do you believe that your baseline levels of intelligence or your abilities are fixed static set throughout the rest of your life or do you believe that they can grow and change now those are over simplified generalizations about the nature of intelligence and the reality is as it always is complex in its a bit both an it is all teething but as humans we need these simplifying systems to help us understand a complex reality those assumptions that we jump to oh intelligence is fixed or intelligence is malleable a they help us to simplify this complex reality but they are not in consecunconsequential they they matter in shaping our motivation and as she has shown if you have the mind it that intelligence is malleable you are motivated to work harder to grow you intelligence if you have a set back in your learning you think okay there is something there that i can grow and learn and build from if you have the mind set that it is fixed why work harder at math if you do not think you are good at it in retrospect its pretty clear how these mind sets can effect our motivation what our work has aimed to do is to expand the range of mind sets that we are a studying focused on and also understand and expand the range of effects that they have why and large we have focussed on mind sets in the domain of health and health behaviors a i mentioned in mind sets about stress we have also looked at mind sets about food and healthy eating do you have the mind set that foods that are good for you healthy foods are disgusting and depriving or do you have the mind set that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious now it could be variety or different foods you might have different thoughts about different healthy foods but generally people at least in our culture in in the west have this view that stresses debilitating healthy foods there disgusting and depriving and those mind sets whether are not there true or false right or wrong they have an impact and they haven't impact not just through the motivational mechanisms that wack and others have studied but as our lab is started to reveal they also shape physiological mechanisms by changing what our bodies prioritize and prepare to do a those are just two examples mind sets about stress mindsets about food we have looked at mind sets about exercised you feel you are getting enough or do you feel you are getting in insufficient amount to get the health benefits your seeking a mind sets about illness do you view cancer as in unmitigated catastrophe or do you you cancer as manageable or perhaps you been even an opportunity ah we have looked hat mind sets about symptoms and side effects do you views side effects a sin that the treatment is is harmful or do you viewside effects as a sign that the treatment is working again these are sort of for beliefs or assumptions you have about these domains or categories ah but they matter because their shaping their synthesizing and simplifying the way were thinking but there also shaping what we are paying attention to what we are motivated to do and potentially even how our body's respond now om and love to talk about this notion power a the mind but shaping how our bodies respond and a maybe as an example this if you could sure with us this now famous study that a your you have done with a milkshake study you on when my touring the major you contours of that study an the results cause i think the extremely impressive an they really speak to this interplay between mind we and physiology certainly yet this was a study that i ran as a graduate student at male university i was working with kelly browned and peter slave peter slave had done a lot of work on really counting the term emotional intelligence say operas of you his now li resident and he is done he is he is done well for himself and for the university and society and call browned who was doing a lot of research on food and obesity and i had come in doing some previous work on mind puts about exercise and placebo effects and exercise and was in this sort of food domain and this emotions and food domain and it really occurred to me that there was a very simple question that had not been probed yet and that was do our beliefs about what we are eating change our bodies physiological response to that food holding constant the objective new trance of that thing that question might sound outrage a at first but it was it is really not outrageous if your coming from a place of having studied an depth placebo effects a placebo effects are this to in medicine at least are this sort of robust dominate demonstration an which simply taking a sugar pill thinking nothing under the impression that it is a real medication that might relieve your agma reduced your blood pressure and boost german system can lead to those physiological effects even though there is now objective new trance and we have more evidence on placebo effects than we have for any other drug gas of because of the clinical trial process in which all new drugs and medication our medications are required to out perform a placebo effects o we have a lot of data on the placebo effect now ye enol we can get new aunts there we do not have a lot of data comparing the placebo effect to doing nothing ah which is important fora i stilling mind see effects are belief effects from sort of natural occurring changes and the body but anyways going back to this question it was are we have moved from you know medications solving our health crises to behavior on medicine solving our health of crises increase people's exercise get them to eat better to what degree are these things influenced by our mind sets or beliefs about them to test this question we ran a seemingly simple study this was done at the male sentrefor a clinical and translational research and we brought people into our lab under the impression that we were designing different milkshakes with vastly different metabolic concentrations nutrient concentrations a that we are designed to meet different metabolic needs of the patrons of the hospital r it you are going to come in you are gin a tastes milkshakes and we are gin a measure your bodies physiological response to them this was a within subjects desire was the same people a consuming to different milkshakes two different time points separated by a week and at one time point they were told that they were consuming this really high fat high colonic indulgent milkshakeitwas six hundred twenty carry superrich fat and sugar the other time point they were told that it was a low fat low carry sensible sort of diet shake in reality it was the exact same shake it was right in the middles three hundred color have moderate amount of fats and sugars and we were measuring their bodies got peptide response to this shake and in particular we were looking at the hormone gremlin as gremlin a hunger a medical exports call the hunger hormone get rises in ireland signal seek out food a and then theoretically in proportion the amount of calories you consume gremlin levels drops signalling to the brain ora you do not you can only to eat much any more you can stop eating and also raving up the metabolism to burn the neutrino that were just in jested what we found in the study was that when people thought they were consuming the high fat high carry indulgent milkshake in response to the shake there gremlin levels dropped at a threefold rate stronger than when they thought they were consuming the sensible shake essentially their bodies responded as if they had consumed more food even that was the exact than same shake at both time points this was really a interesting and important a for two reasons really one was that it was to my knowledge one of the first studies to show any effects of just believing that you are eating something different on your physiology lots of studies had show have shown that believing you are eating different things changes your taste in you are even your satisfaction in fullness after but this shows that it has a metabolic o physiological component a but the second piece was really important as well a n especially for me this was one study that early transformed the way i think about how i approach eating and that was the manner in which it affected our physiology was somewhat counter intuitive i had gone in thinking the better minds at to been when you eat as i you are eating healthy right i e to just make sense like pleceem effects think your he they all be they and but was a far too simplistic way of thinking about it and in fact it was the exact opposite because thinking that they were eating when these a particibens tight they were eating sensibly their bodies left them still feeling physiologically hungry oar not satiated which could potentially be corresponding to slower metabolism in for if you are in the interest of maintaining or losing weight what is the best mines at to be in its to be in the minds that they you're eating indulgently that you are having enough that you are getting enough ism an at least i not study me show that as the maredat of a fact on gremlin responses interesting and especially interesting to me as a narrow scientist who has worked on aspects of the nervous system their involved in conscious perception vision and a emotion and color perception and forth but also a lav is worked a and is increasingly working on autonomic funscionce there below our conscious detection in this case i a a lie about how much something a a this milk shakes contain affected a subconscious process because i have to imagine that the gremlin pathway is not one that i can decide oh this a particular piece of chocolate is can really reduced my ireland cause it is very neutral rich i suppose to one if you told me that a different piece of chocolate for instances i but low caloyer or sugarfree chocolate or something that sort the grilling pathway however it seems based on your data that the grilling pathway is susceptible to thoughts which is incredible but then again there must be cross over between conscious thought and these subconscious or i can of autonomic pathway the silly remarkable a i it raises a question that a a i just have to ask because it increasingly ism involved in in a undying discussions and the social median one of the most barbed wire topics out there and that is been generous is this topic of which diet were nutrients are best you have got people who are strictly plant based you have got people who are minivers you got people who are carnivores you have every variation you one intermittent fasting local time restricted feeding and it seems once a group and a plugs in to a a particular mode of eating that they feel works for them for whatever reason energy wise mentally maybe their look in their blood profiles may be there not but once they feel that sort of am it works for them each camp seems to tout all the health benefits and how great they feel could it be that mind set effects are it involved there that people are finding the nutritional program that they feel brings them the most a enrichment of life but also neutrience and that their health real you shifting in a positive direction but not necessarily because of the fraud constituents but because of the community in the ideas in the reinforcement and the belief that this is the right way of doing something i i think under per cent a hundred percentent has something to contribute i do not want a ism m going away in on the debate mud out i will most certainly laid in on is is the notion that look going back to the placebo effector we have a outdated understanding of what that is which is based on this randomized control trial you compare a drug to a placebo if the drug works better than the placing you say great the drug works if the drug does not out perform the placebo you say the drug does not work that is really over simplified it is a good test for the specific efficacy of the drug it is not a good test for understanding the total impact of that drug because in the reality of things if a drug out performs a placebo then you start prescribing it but you the reality is that the total effect of that drug is a combined product of the specific chemical attributes of that drug and whatever going on in the plain effect which is at least from our perspective its beliefs it is social contact and it is your body's natural ability to respond to something that is in the placebo effect example the same is true for everything we do or consumed when it comes to what diet you are you're eating both are true it does matter what it is and it matters what you think about that diet and what others around you in an our culture think about that diet because those social contacts in form our mind sects our mind sets interact with our physiology in ways that produce outcomes that are really important let us not get dualistic and say it is either all in the mind or not in a mind let us also not be unnecessarily combative and say it should be all plant based are you know quite or whatever it is all of those things are a combined product of what you are actually doing and what you are thinking avow if you believe in it if you do not if you are skeptical or in some cases you think you should be ani eating a certain way and then you do not live up to that it might have a an adverse effect because of the the stress in the anxiety associated with that very interesting am all the lines of belief effects is it c we call these belief effects ire on yet is there a difference between these what ism calling belief effects and placebo effects and up place effects distinctly different from mind sat effects were they more restless there they related i think placid effects maybe should be reserved for the conditions in which your actually taking a placebo it is a inactive substance when you get out of that sort of placebo fires drug realm and you start looking at placebo effects that use cloths with my hands here in behavioral health the term kind of bit comes confusing because you are not the milkshake study we did not give people a placebo milkshake right we just changed what they believed about it how i to think about it is that placebo effects as their traditionally construed are made up of three things its the social contacts mind sets or beliefs and the natural physiological processes in the brain embody that can produce the outcomes a and we could could just call them belief effects because the beliefs are triggering the physiological processes and the beliefs are shaped by the social contacts does not make send make sense lethe other is a paper a your two go publishing sets a sent magazine about bran regions involved in psychogenic fever that if people were you can notice time an animal models you think that they are sit you get a genuine one do three degree increase in body temped or three one is three trees for night increase of mi to which is pretty pretty impressive yo the us placentas symptomatology generally ism a believer in belief effects ell it is also and i just say that you don't the term that we is in the in our field is no silo a fact for that with a sort of the placebos ugly step sister he know its when negative beliefs cause negative consequences you are told you will have think it is it is very well demonstrated that when people are told about certain side effects the far more likely to experience of side effects when people think that they sick are going to get sick sometimes that can create the physiological a symptoms and there is there is versus debates that it is not only that physiology changes its also that your attention changes we are experiencing things a fatigue and headache and upset stomach all the time and then when you take a drug in someday says you begin a feel fatigue and headache you start noticing that your tire an headaches and attribute it to the drug some of the mechanisms are attention and some of them are real changes in in physiology the a free to tell s about a the hotel workers study sire and the get out these questions it'll tine when i find these just these results also amazing yet no i think that this is a really good example of this phenomenon right that the total effect of anything is a combined product of what you are doing and what you think about what you are doing this was the study that i ran with even languor a back a when i was an undergrad actually we started at this study even hangars a professor of psychology at hazard and she is done a lot of really fascinating work on her flavor of mindfulness which is distinct from e more eastern om mine mean a budthists sort of mindfulness passed a work and she you do not she actually was the one who said to me originally you i was an athlete at the time i was a ski player and i was training constantly and and one day on there forget it she said the benefit of exercises just a placebo right and the was all that is outright just alien's are alien's alien's known for for saying very provocative but also very wise things and that statement really got me thinking about that we designed the study together and that was to look at how what you study if exercised the benefits of exercise were a placebo how would yo even test that because what does it mean to give a placebo exercise we sort of flipped it on its head and we found a group of people who were getting a lot of exercise but were not aware of it that they work right this we settled on a group of hotel housekeepers these were women working in hotels who were on their feet all day long pushing carts changing linens climbing stairs cleaning back troops vacuuming it was clear that they were getting above and beyond at least the surgeon general's requirements at that time or which were to accumulate thirty minutes of moderate physical activity per day but what was interesting was when we went in and surveyed them and asked them hey how much exercise do you think you are getting a third of them said zero i do not get any exert and the average response was a three on a scale of zero to ten it is clear that even though these women were active they did not have that mind set right they had the mind sat that their work was just work hard maybe thankless work that led them to feel tired and and in pain at the end of the day but not that it was good for them that it was good exercise what we did was we took these women and we randomized them into two groups and we told half of them that their work was good exercise this in this case it was true factual information we oriented them to the surgeon general's guidelines we orient them to the benefits that they should be receiving and then we had measured them previously on there a physiological metrics weight and body fat and blood pressure and we came back for weeks later and we tested them again and what we found was at these women even though they had not changed anything in their behavior at least that was detectable to us they didn't work more rooms they didn't start doing pullups or push ups and between went cotellrums as far as ism concern they did not report any changes in their diet but they had benefits to their health they lost weight they decrease their systolic blood pressure by about ten points on average and a they started feeling better about themselves the their bodies and in their work not surprisingly that is amazing how should we o take conventionalize that result in light of o all of our efforts to get more out of exercise right as a rallier you mention it from the milk shake study and our perceptions about near intensity that it village the the right message as city a lie it counter intuitive that u think ah this is very a low celery a nutrient spouse om then it is good for me in the context of losing weight for instance but turns out the opposite is true because as you as you told us the the body response differently when you think somethings neuter dense and can ashy suppress hunger more in in light of this result i if i were to say ora in o my current understanding of of the literature is that getting somewhere between a hundred and fifty in a hundred and eighty minutes per week of party f vascular exercise is probably good idea for most people if i tell myself that it is notconce to good idea but at it is extremely effective and lowering my blood pressure and maintaining healthy weight et center et camera according to these results it will have an an enhanced effect on those metrics as cater definitely this is a really important point because what this reveals is that we have to be more thoughtful and how we go about motivating people to exercise or teaching people about the benefits our current approach is just to basically tell people large here is what you need to get here is at mean to get good for to get enough benefits to receive the r enough exercise receive the health benefits the problem with that approaches that most people are not meeting those benefits yet there are not meeting those requirements yet and the risk with that is that well the intention with that is to motivate them cause public health officials think if i just tell people you new to get more exercises cause it is good for you they will do it we know now that that does not work that these these guidelines are not motivational they do not change our behavior in what our work adds to that is that not only is it not motivational it all creates potentially a mind sat that makes people worse then they were without knowing about the guideline again it is tricky ism not saying that mind tat is everything certainly exercises good for us and you as is healthful for us it is one of the things we have the best at on of not saying o exercises all placebo what i am saying is that we need to be more mindful about how do we motivate people to exercise but how do we help people to actually reap the benefits of the exercise they are already doing now a acobvy is art who is as a grad student my labyrinth a number of interesting studies along this o these lines a one in which she looked at three nationally representative data sets a which had this interesting question in them which was how much exercise do you get relative to others do get about the same a little more a lot more do get a little less or a lot last rate the body your listeners you could all answer this and then in these data sets what she did what she had cold from data that track death rates over the next twenty one years and a couple interesting things revealed themselves one was that the correlations between these perceptions of exercise relative to others and people's actual exercises measured through a accelerometer a data as well as more rigorous sort of what did you do to day can a data a those do not correlate much at all then be people lie but only so they is perceive and or who is to say it is misperceiving there is just everything's relative right if you are i used to do triathlons very seriously f you were to ask me now i feel ism totally inactive frat ism not doing anything near what i used to an and if that is mi folks set feel ism not exercising much but if i think about compared to other people given what i know about wanna national representative statistics and i could feel all ism getting a lot right you can see how these perceptions are dish decoupled from objective reality and what we have found in in these studies is that that one question mattered in some cases more than objective activity but in all cases controlling for objective activity in predicting death rates and in some in one of those samples it was a seventy one per cent higher risk of death rate a if people rated themselves as feeling they were getting less activity than others the ai do it is a gig deal and i again that studies cross sectional longitudinal it was not experimental am but combined these really sort of coal last to say hey this is important too right let us figure out ways to be active and get people active but let us also not make people feel horrible about themselves when they are not getting enough and going back to the the hotel study again i mention i did that at a time when i was a it's a division when i hockey player at the time we are training all the time and i i was an unhealthy mind said about that i never felt i was getting enough i would come off a two hour practise into a wait lifting session a and then i would get on the elliptical for thirty minutes cause i thought i had to do that also the made her with me at the time could attest to that and that study was really helpful for me to realize that i needed to pay attention not just to what i was doing but also take care of my mind set about that and and and i think the essence is how to get people to feel their getting enough it is a sense of toughness that really matters i can see the dilemma because you do not want people thinking that that exercise and its positive effects are potent that they can get away with a three minute a walk stand that they are they are good because most likely they are not but again you do not want to them to be back on their heels psychologically that they do not even do that or that they ism never exceed that my by very much but it seems the message from the the milkshake study and what were talking about now in terms of exercise would be to really communicate to the general public that that food has a potency even healthy foods have a potency to give as energy to fuel are ut e mean system and entercran system et camera and that exercise has it a remarkable potency and that that potency can be enhanced by believing in or understanding that potency exactly sis at an accurate way to state it total that is exactly right and that is where i really feel we need to push an what i i try to do in our researches and not just show o in that matters is not interesting that it is it is both matter both exercise and what you think about it matter both what you eat and how you think about what you eat matter and we really as individuals and a a society need to work on yet what is the right way to cultivate both behaviors and mind sets about those behaviors much serve us and in the food context this again that milkshick study really changed me on a personal level because i had and somebody who was constantly training trying to restrain my eating right i i wanted to maintain er who whose weight look fit and i for hell i should diet i should have low calorylo car long this long that but at what that was doing was putting me into this constant mind sat of restraint and what that study suggested was that that mind set was potentially counter acting any benefit or any objective effects of the restrain diet cause my brain was saying okay your restraining may be my body was responding to that wat the brain was also saying eat more food yes say hungry cause you need ta survive and the answer is it oh well throw everything into the wind and just straight indulgent milkshakes all they long the ant sir is e healthy pod so they done the latest since and what we know to be true about new trance in our bodies response to them but try to do in a mind set of indulgence a mind set of satisfaction o mind set of enjoyment and that is really the track and that is what i at least try to day and in my own wife i love that and as i get more involving into public facing health communications i this comes up again and again how how should we conceptualize our behavior how should we think about all these options that are offered to us and i ism excited that the ism the potency of mind sets are coming through again and again i have a question about the sentiment the the study has ever been done but a lot of these mind set effects or something that years ago i thought i did via of e sleep because i was in graduate school n as a stock even as an undergraduate i had much work to do that i decided i would sleep when i was dead we it is not a good idea ah from what we know however i found that i a couple nights of minimal sleep or even and all night or and i could do pretty well i venturalyt would catch up with me has there ever been a study exploring whether not the effects of sleep deprivation ism can be impacted by these mind set effects because over the years i keep learning more an more about how much sleep i need and have really emphasisesleep and i do feel much better when ism getting it but as new parents no or i students know or atlas no ready one that lives in normal life find sometimes that they do not get a good nights sleep would believing that we can tolerate that and push through it and function just finding that it is not in o kill us or give us claimers em i could that help must deal with it with a poor nights sleep or even too or chronic sleep deposition certainly i would i would guess there is been one study of my knowledge that tested that i dragon and colleagues and they looked at they had people come in and they gave them sort of it was a sham sort of e g tests s sort of figure out throw we know this was done an number years ago now we actually have think no devices to test thus but there is was the sham taste than they gave people fake feed back about the quality of their sleep and how had had been the night before and they also asked the the i participants how they felt about their sleep and i essentially what they found was that the this sham feed back if they were told that they would got in let lower qualities sleep led to deficits and an variety of count of tasks i and that was a sort of decoupled from their actual e o qualities of sleepilies that self reported that is one study that a testa this i think certainly i man i would i would but a lot of money i have not run twice myself but that near mind sets can push around a cognitive functioning physiological effects of sleep but once again it is it is not all or nothing rid there are real important benefits of sleep and how far we can push around that through our mind tat is an open question o that the result that you mention is really think is a lot of people you see sleep trackers now their using rings or disbands and that my lot is work precisely with a company in they supply to day on how well people are sleeping you get a score a people get the score back when they see that score they might think they on these results oh my sleep my recovery score my sleep so as poor r i i should not expect much from myself to day or i you make sense that my memory would be going for this reason and it'll probably lose a few friends for saying this by l gain a few as well that is why i to just do a subjective a score for myself if i wake up in the morning i just deck do not gad did at sleep well or not i do not seeing a number i do not getting at a read out from a device that is me i know a lot of people it and they can be very useful but a go should seems to these belief effects are reaving in at all levels it'd love for to talk about stress because your lab has worked extensively on this and if y if you would could you tell us at some point about the study that you've done about informing people about the different effects of stress but also if there's an opportunity some take always about how we could each conventionalize stress in ways that would make it a serve us better i suppose to form us and our mental an physical performance great yes had come off the heels of doing some research and exercise and die it and finding these provocative and also counterintuitive facts of is with respect to how we should try to motivate people ran and and as i was thinking about this and this grouping of going from medicines is to saving us to behaviors to saving us and how those behaviors might be influence by mind sets the obvious next thing to think about was stress right look you wan to be healthier fix your diet fix your exercise and stress less and s i started doing some digging into the nature of stress and couple things were clear one was that the public health message was very clear right that stress was that we unmitigated and harm harmful on our health our productivity or relationships our fertility our cognition you name it right the messages that were out there by an large oversimplified messages focus on the damaging consequences of stress but as if you actually dive deeper into the literature on stress and the origins of stress what you find is that the literature most litter chairs as not clear cut an fact there is a large amount of evidence to support the fact that the experience of stress meaning encountering adversity or challenge in one's got related efforts a does not have to be debilitating an in many cases the bodies response was design to enhance our ability manage at those moments right some research showing that stress narrows or focus increases our attention speeds up the rate at which were able the process information there was some research out there showing this phenomenon of a physiological toughening the process by which the release of catabolic demons an the stress response recruit or active anabolichormons which help as build are muscles build are you o anurans to help us grow and learn and there is a whole body of emerging research on a postramatic growth or this phenomenon in which even the experience of the most dramatic stress tree the most chronic and enduring stresses could lead not to destruction but in fact to the exact opposite to an enhanced sense of connection with our values connection to others sense of am joy and passion for living and i i found that to be interesting and my work sense then has been not to try to argue that stresses enhancing and not debilitating but try to point out that the true nature of stress is a paradox the true nature of stress is manifold and complex and lots of things can happen but to question what is the role of our mind set about stress in shaping our response distress some work had already been done looking at your perception of the stressed its a you view a stressed a challenging exam or a helpagnosis as a challenge dress threat and that had shown pretty convincingly that when you view stresses more as a challenge less as a threat that your brain in body response a more more adaptively what our question was was to take the sort of psychological construe one step higher and abstraction not just the stressed but the nature of stress right do you you ad at that corelevel do you we stresses something that is bad is going to kill us and therefore should be avoided or do you view some stresses a natural and something that is going to enhance us and we set out to design a series of studies to test the extent to which these mind sets about stress mattered am we first this again was with a peter alive and called acre originally we designed a measure to test people's mind sets about stress simple questions what extent you believe or agree our disagreed with statements stress enhances my performance an prodictanna stress a a a heightens my vitality in growth things that and we found in a number of correlational studies at that a more enhancing stress minds set was linked to a better health outcomes a better well being in higher performance then we set out to see if we you change people's mind sets and in our first test of this we decided to do by creating these multimedia films that show case research anecdotes facts about stress all true but oriented towards one mind set or the other it is you can imagine one set of film showed basically the messages that were out there in the public health contexts the other showed hey stress as you know stress has been link to these things but in fact the body stress response was designed to do this did could do that and we had a empowering images learn names making the free throw in the final minute verses missing it into all of these things are true possibilities but oriented to two different mind sets about stress either people saw avidin that these semasee my stress will diminish you crush you reduce you or o video very similar stress will grow you bring out your best and maybe even take you to heighten levels of performance that you have never expert before exactly exactly y examples in the sports we also had true leaders emerge in the moments of greatestress churchly and all those examples are out there for both the enhancing nature and the debilitating nature and our question was does orienting people to different mind sets change how they respond to stress this study was done in the wake of the two thousand eight financial crisis we worked with a rubies a company a financial serves a company that was undergoing pretty massive amounts of layoffs of these employs for stress about being laid off they were taking on more pressure it was just a tough time and we randomized them into three conditions and this was all free work before getting at a training on stress a but the three different conditions some watched no videos some watched the stress will crushyou midis and some watched the stress could enhance you idiot and what we found was that just it was a total of nine minutes of videos over the course of the week led to changes in their mind sets about stress which led to changes in there a physiological symptoms associated with stress of people who watch the enhancing films had fewer backaches muscle tension in sonic racing heart and forth and they also reported a performing better at work compared to those who watch the debilitating videos now interestingly we did not make any one worse with the debilitating kitty it us which is good we had we had told that a the ire be we don't expect that because that message was already out there that is what they were already seeing that was not new to them i was more this enhancing perspective that turned out to be inspiring i love that study and at i know we both have a friends and and times in special operations community through it just happens dance and and we can m may will get into throw later but i a good friend from that community i always says there only three ways to go through life at any moment which is either back on your heels flat footed or forward star of mass and i said will well what is the key to forward center of mass and he said it stress is what places you and forward center of mass meaning leaning forward and into challenge and i know that you have actually looked at that community unit does really seem that is it minds at that either they have going in or that they cultivate through the course of their training but this notion that stress is what puts us in forward motion i is true physiologically i do mean a trundle and major roll is to place us into a moment of it were to abuse us towards action that is why we tremble at it with the body trying to initiate action but i sh this is to y get opportunity it was if there is anything interesting to extract from the study on on seal teems what what was it ye know i loved working with with the seals am at one of the interesting things we found at the we had we have studied this measured this mind set in several different populations and in every single one that we attested far the average had been on the debilitating side of the scale the one same stress is best stress is karate and you knows look with measures of a growth in find mind set s about intelligence attempts people are in the middle but often times having more positive minds its about intelligence that was not the case with strict it is still not the case of trying to get the message out there exact for this group of baby seals or they were actually a recruits people who were going through basic training in order to become navy seals and we found that they on average had a stresses enhancing minds at perhaps not surprisingly right if your going into devote your whole life to thing and navy seal you must have some inclination that stress is a source of strength a for you but what we found with them we measured this at the beginning of the basic training of bud's training and then looked at how well they succeeded through that programs as this as an exstranly rig his program you not the time it was only ten or twenty per cent of i till is trains and honers afryaltiiftd teas or we that no it no matter how hard a pressures on the community change that the numbers are still on average about fifteen person what we found was that our measure predicted that rate people who had even within that range had a more stresses enhancing mines that we are more likely it complete training become a seal they also had faster obstacle course times and they were rated by their peers more positively ah again let us break this down right this does not mean and the people get mean people get this wrong sometimes they think that ism saying that a stresses en hanging minds it means you should stress right well maybe seals do but that is not what we are saying right having actresses in hanging minds it does not mean the stressed is a good thing right it doesn't mean it is a good thing that you have to go into combat in its not pretty right it does not mean that getting sign a cancer diagnosis is a good thing or being an abject povertieis a good things are not good things but the experience of the stress associated with that the challenge the adversity that experience can lead to inhenhancing outcomes with respect to ah not just ark cognition but our health our performance an our well being that mind set right how does that work right well it works through a number of different pathways one is that it changes fundamentally what we are motivated to do if you just imagine were stressed about something may be a gable pandemic for wo visas for instance am and you think that tress is bad then what is your motivation right your motivation is to well first you get worried about the stress right now not only you have the pandemic your stress about the stress of the pandemic but second ins your reaction is typically to do one of two things it is either to freak out and do everything you can to make sure that this does not affect you ego negatively or to check out and say oh it is not to be deal i can deal without i you are basically in denial people who have a stresses debilitating mindset we have shown this in our research ten to go to one of the other of those extremes they freak out or they check out why because of stresses bad you need to either get rid of it and deal with thattror it needs tenoestrict if you have a stresses enhancing mind set the motivation changes right then the motivation is how do i utilize the stress to realize the enhancing outcomes what can we do here right to learn from this experience to make us stronger fitter have better scienceand treatments for the future deep in my relationships with others m improve my priorities and forth right the the motivation changes the affect around it changes it does not make it easy to deal with but what we have shown in our researches that people who have a stresses in hanging minds it have more positive affect not necessarily less negative affect am and potentially changes physiology we we have a few studies that show that a people who are em inspired to adopt more enhancing minds its have more moderate sort is all response and the higher levels of die levels am in response distress more workings to be done on the physiology but i loveyour take i i he actinisms through which that is possible yes and and am d we of course as an anabolic hormones both men and women a very interesting because i we had a guest on this podcast a e is a is a pa scientist who runs that u f see a performance training institute is name is drunken french and his graduate work at a upon stores was very interesting was an exercise science and physiology what he showed was that a if you could spike the adrenal in response i think they did this through first time skydive or something that that a testosterone went up now this spits in the face of everything that we are told about stress and testosterone levels right am and this has also been looked at in females with estrogen although of course there is estrogen tester on both males and females but that is how they design the study turns out that at least in the short term that a very stressful event can raise anabolic hormones and i think that people forget at a mechanistic level that adrenalin is epinefron an epinephrin is derived by chemically derived from them moleculedopeme if you look at the pathway in even sgoogalain go images you will see that epic adrenalin is is made from opening andopaming and these anabolic commons have a very clot the sure close cousins they work together in the patuitarian hypotholmis it make sense that a one could a leverage stress toward growth am and towards cannibalism as supposed to cannibalism which is not sent cannibalism as an eating other people but canaabol anabolic processes as i guess the right way to refer to it but what is again remarkable to me is that all these brain structures that control opening up an affray testosterone and estrogen they are all thought to be in the subconscious meaning below am a our ability to flip a switch and turn them nor off and yet mind set seemed impact them i i all that to say that there is a clear mechanistic basis by which this could all work and and i on the one hand ism surprised because they these are incredible results on the other and ism not surprised because there is a physiological substraiht there that could the a readily explain them end i think i think figuring o exactly how it works us really we should do that we should d wavering we have got common friends in both departments to we she we should do it we that but i did not to mention o know the way the way i think about mind in again i think we may t study this ism not anarcintis i i looked at this pat this is something we can do but the way i think about mind set is that it is minds that is our kind of a portal between conscious and subconscious processes they operate a default setting of the mind great if if sort of programmed in there you have stress equals bad that is gan at can that that is gan a be something may be unconscious rat but it does not have to be conscious right you know people do not have to know their mind that s about stress until they are asked it really it is that is been programmed in through our up bringing through public health's messages and through media and other things an it cannas sits there is an assumption in the brain and the brain is then figuring out how should it respond to the situation and if the assumption that dealt the programming is stresses bad that is got a through our subconscious trigger all the things that si gowan will i need to rave up the things that protect me verses eve up the things that help me grow and that is at least how i think about it and what is cool about it is that because it operates as a sort of portal that communicates with more subconscious physiological processes but can also be access through our consciousness right just talking about this a for your listeners they are now invited to bring there stress minds this up to the consciousness and say what is my stress minds at how to ail my thinking about stress can i reprogrammed that can i start to think about it as more enhancing that takes a little bit of a conscious work potentially but then once you do that it can beck an can operate an in the background influencing how your body response and you do not have to say o cam stress i better tell my in of colic hormones a about at the work that way no am but these minds gets can help with ha translational process i love the idea that mind sets a at the interface between the consciousness of conscious and de there is there is a lot to unpack there but clearly is the case at that the minds titties sorbet is you rest ex it in and and as we taught that earlier they can limit what the number of things to focus on because one thing that is really stress was trying a focus on everything all the time i try to navigate the public health around it anything the public holt information round anything is can of overwhelming as you mention for stress you see a lot in the stress is will crush you in can you can also find evidence that stress will grow you how should a we the listeners think about stress ad what what is the most adaptive way to think about stress no and should we talk about our stress should we not talk about our stress is there a short list of of ways that we can cope with stress better you nor i may i should be careful wither word cope is there away and we can leverage stress to our advantage great yen that is an important portion wants in your language whishes people of by enlarge come from a place of how do you manage stress how do you cope with it which implies how do you fight against it vet yo fight is a in if you'll yet of for y fight against at or o neck out e it and yet the real challenges how do we leverage it how do we utilize it how do we work with it and you have a lot of thoughts on this the first and most most important thing is to clarify our definition of stress i think people often a social the the stress mint negative stress mines at is insidious that now people define stress with its negative consequences the first step is to decouple that and to realize that stress is a neutron writ yet to be determined effect of experiencing or anticipating adversity in your got related efforts let me unpack that a little more you can be in the midst of it or you could just be worried about something happening that is one aspect second is adversity our challenged of something that is working against ye but the third piece is critical and that is in your got related efforts but that means is that we only stress about things we care about things that matter to us this is really important right because stress is linked with it is the other side of the coin of things we care about right and i think that is the first thing to realize permit that as humans we stress because we care and we do not stress about things we do not are about the simplified example i to uses if johnny was failing school that would not stress you out unless johnnies was your son or you're johnny or you really cared about the educating the johnnies of the world right it only become stressful to the extent that you care about it why are we trying to fighter run away or hide or merely cope with our stress or overcome it through our mishmashes when the stress is connected to the things we care about then the question becomes o we if that is true how can i better utilize or leverage or respond to the inevitable stresses that were going to experience ism not saying go out and seek out more stress what i am saying is that your gun experienced stress of you of any cares or values or passions and most all of us to am and then what do you do and we have developed a three step approach to adopting a stress in hanging mine set and briefly it is the first step is to just acknowledged that your stress to own it see it be mindful of it the second step is to welcome it i why would you recommit you welcome it because inherently in that stress is something you care about you are using it as an opportunity to reconnect to what is it that i care about here and then the third step is to utilize the stress response to achieve the thing you care about not spend your time money effort energy thing to get rid of the stress does that make sans make an sand i love it as some to use laboratory studies the physiological effects of stress the the effects it impress me the most or for instance the narrowing a visual attention that then ism drives a capacity to paste time or finally which then drives the capacity to process information castrates it is almost like a superpower i and yes it can feel uncomfortable often i but i love the idea that ism acknowledging it ism embracing it and then understanding its power and leveraging that power i think is it what i much about that framework is that the stress response is very generic we unlike the relaxation response we do not actually have to train up the stress response also we all come to get this is a as a freely and then it seems to gets a question of what we hand up doing with that right in hons a father of stress set himself as a non specific response seconds that it it occurs that is what you are doing with it it is hire your calling it and yet we talked about before of what most people to is the stress about the stress wit is an over exacerbates it or they check out from the stress which leads to depression an an adonis because by checking out from stress ere also checking out from the things we care about and substance abuse exact really on a empty who also a we ate the good fortune of having as a guest on this podcast talked a lot about h this that m much of substance of use it it tissue runs the edition clinic over on the bedside of campus i it takes over people's lives because of this increase ability to to find a solution to the stress that then eventually becomes its own stressed in its own problem i well i i i love that that that might set in framework leafed ism else just a bit about what rope to write now and what is most exciting to you now if you ism a able er willing to talk about some of that the work that is on the way i saw brief mention of something on your a publications depside of a of a paper about influences online influences and nutrition at that might not be the main thrust of what you are up to but if you are able to tell us about it for of interesting given that a lot of the communication an and around this podcast takes place through social media end can of launched into this a landscape now where i a constantly bombarded with health information an i an influences and a deetermitanyven known to conn you are i w oi on e only on one way or the other but om the what it what is the deal with influence or of the duingsoman good fruit all information or the of the ruining the landscape u and then do not do not turn protect my feeling no is i know know this dress s is actually annas yes well that work is part of a body of work that we have been to venturing into chichis to understand where do these mind sets come from at i mention ort of public health entities as one sources say our mind sets about stress but i think that our mind sets our influence by four different sources a first is our upbringing how our parents talked about things when stressed or food or other things a second is culture and media movies you know pod casts a and now social media a third are is influential others what doctors say to us or close friends or peers and forth is your conscious choice we take about that a little you do have at we have as humans have the ability to be mindful of and to change our mind sets a but the social media and influence or stuff has been in part an attempt to understand where do our mind sets about things healthy foods come from and brad turnwald who as a former gradstudent my lab has done a series of really interesting studies on this showing that you rate the nutritional quality of the top grossing a movies in the last twenty years are you look at the instar gram accounts of all the most influential people on a instant gram what you and you analyze the nutrition content of what they are eating a what he is shown is that depending on the study seventeen and ninety per cent of those movies or influences would fail the legal standards for a advertising in the quiet their putting out the nutrition contents that are you don't may be not surprisingly but undeniably unhealthy and to me that is interesting and important shows that were it where we getting this mind set that those unhealthy foods are pleasurable desirable what is maybe even more interesting than that is some of the work that he and others and our lab have done to show that the ways people are talking about the foods their eating really matter to generally what were found is that when people talk about unhealthy foods they use a language that connotes of sent of excitement fun sexiness danger indulgence basically and thing good and is b the fly coos cakes high sugar a at really on half is truly unhealthy of foods or yet that is actually of the objective what health means it is challenging but yet high fat i sugar then there is pretty good agreement now that excessive sugar is not and highly process yo hin the cross so successors a thing there is general confess ism sure some one if you can to come after any one come after me else and bethibut on the other hand when people are talking about if they do which healthy foods are not portrayed and media they are not portrayed by influences rarely ever and when they are they're often talked about with language that conveys a sense of deprivation it is it is nutritious but it is it sort of boring it is plan it is jolty a hone and at a posthiti taxi inn and this is really important because you are doing all this work trying and others are doing all this work trying to in form people about what actually is good for them and meanwhile there is as hurricane of other fun of force that is telling people that seeping into our minds that sure those might be good for you but those foods are not fun or sexy are indulging or desirable in any way shape performed it its also a pad advertising for fast foods and sugary beverages and otherthings it is not surprising that we have this minds tat that healthy foods are the less desirable thing to eat because of those cultural and social forces a what our work has just tried to do is to reveal that you a in defying it as a way to say r let us make real at more mindful about how we talk about healthy foods and could if you are move producer can you be a little but more mindful to show case healthy and delicious foods and have the characters talk about him in ways that are more appealing there is a lot of a room for people who produce this content to have an impact focus on what people do but what they think about the foods their eating it is really interesting i had am fought about until now but it makes sense that any food that is packaging can be sold is to be woven into a a film or am promoted by a celebrity influence or not a health influence or person but a celebrity influence are because they will get pat right it is part of the the take system that allows them and in common e feats back on sails to the company and a whereas a things that cannot be commodities it is it is were difficult i its hard to am the whoever makes oranges in sells oranges is no unlikely to promote oranges in it and a celebrity posts or in a moody because oranges can be purchased for many many sources there is now identifiable source of of oranges as there is with a packaged food for instance yet but the interesting thing we found in those studies is that it was not driven by promoted content or branded content there is some of that certainly and yet all the promoted and branded con he content is usually for process high sugar foods but ninety per cent or more of these foods that they were showing were not promoted or branded and there is e a lot of flexibility and what these producers are influences could show on their media although it goes both ways right it is not just the producers and the influences responsibility a the public is reaction to this and and we showed to that a people respond more positively their more likes on posts about unhealthy foot's it is a it is a yet it is a sort of a distasteful and in neck i it is a distasteful culture around healthy eating and we really have a lot to i to change it ye what is dotlemean circuits through and through just at the sight of some exact a very carry dense extremely tasty food am we drives those opening circuits o and for an i realize that there are people out there you derive the same sort of for some for bubbles of of pleasure from healthy foods and that is a wonderful thing if one can accomplish that we just need more of that is what it sounds ye exact and that is what is really inspiring to me at least is that it is possible right my people thin go vegetables are just inherently less tasty than ice cream and it is be that is not necessarily true also it does not have to be a competition right i do not have to get my three year old to hate ice cream and order for it a rocky there is a lot more i can be doing to help shape a more positive approach oriented indulgent mine set a round healthy nutritious vegetables in fruits and to other for freight in addition to having her ice cream right and that is totally find sell see a really interesting study when it is published real let me know an a e ye it was actually released this went o grant i will be sure in youaminternal medicine amain eternal of am great journal i will defiantly am talk about it on social media and and elsewhere of very investing what else are you up to lady that is i my favorite question to ask any side test recalleagu by the way is what you most excited about lately am wat what wat what you a late thinking about and getting up early thinking about yes hands down the thing i most except will i guess there is many things the thing that i most into right now were doing the most work in is you know started by getting inspired by placable effects an medicine i did a long stent and placebo or belief effects in behavioral health and now we are moving back into medicine a ism really interested and looking at how we can work with active drug gs and treatments to make them better and make the experience of them better by and stilling different mine sects a one study we did along those lines we work with a kids or undergoing treatment for food allergies alarms to peanuts for example this was with carbonado whose the head of the stamphord army enter here she is a great treatment for food allergies basically kids take gradually increasing doses of the thing they're allergic to peanuts and over the course of six or seven months these kids become less reactive to peanuts and the problem with that treatment is its really a difficult because the having all sorts of negative symptoms an side effects these kids are getting if itchy mouths and upset stomach their puking and scary because there literally eating the thing that they have been told might killed m and what we did in the study was we attempted to improve the experience and outcomes of that by refrain a mind sets about the symptoms and the side effects as it was being conducted before the kids were told look these side effects are just an unfortunate by product of this treatment and you have to sort of endure them to get through it but what we found in our conversation with carry was that the reality of those side effects was not negative in fact they were a mechanistically linked to the body learning how to tolerate peanuts or the allergen and what we did was we worked within a trial they were all getting the treatment but half of them were help to see this more positive mine sects that symptoms and side effects from this treatment we are a positive signal that the treatment was working and their bodies were getting stronger and what we found was that that mind set led to reductions and anxiety a few were symptoms when at the highest doses and most interestingly of all they had better outcome based on amunemarkers that were a sign of the allergic tolerant those who had this in set throughout had better outcomes to the treatment that is just one example i think my goal is really to move us beyond the placebo verses drug mind sat verses behavior to get to a place where we can blend them together and maximize the benefit of these treatments we are doing a lot of studies that how can we improve treatment for cants are with different mine sects we have done some work recently with the loved nineteen vixen am an symptoms inside effects that is what am rarely passionate about right now credible come can which do we not studies that were out were ya on the way open than i walls read and communicate with you and then about that a you now maybe you would come on in sir ram an due in sir gamelive i you an make sure that i i do not screw up the delivery and that a we can hear it direct from the person who ran the study i i find this is sue a side effectually interesting i do not take a lot of prescription drugs but recently i was prescribed a fou and the list of side effects i it is incredible as goes on and on and on i realize some of that is legal protections ins hard for me to believe that their actually expecting anyone to read those because you need a no high powered microscope to read this print is truly fine print but i did realize it in reading over the side effects hat you you prime one primes themselves to experience tho side effects and now i just rip up the side effectsthing in or that shame just throw it away i just take it as recommended do you think it works in the other direction to where if an effective medication is i suppose to have result a b or we and you are told again and again how effective it is for that treatment that it could amplify the effect another words of not i i it strictly placebo it is not no so as you describe before but that perhaps at a lower dose i i given medication could have a amplified effect were it it at a appropriate dos if you will it could have a superphysiologica an has that ever been demonstrated oh to some degree i think where gets tricky is for a long time people thought the effects of placebos were expectancy be you expect to get a benefit and that benefit occurs there there is certainly some some truth to that but i think the mind sat approach is more powerful because it helps us understand the mechanisms right if if you just expect that your blood pressure will go down that what are the mechanisms through which that expectation would lead to your blood pressure going now wit is hard to even understand that rat but if you have the mind sat that you are in good hands that this is being taken care of that this is not this illness is not going to kill you i that you are been treated well then you can start to unpack the mechanisms through which blood pressure could be relieve may be its anxiety reduction maybe it is changing the the but o anticipation of what there the prioritization of what the body needs to focus on and i really think that the work of the future needs to be getting more sophisticated about what is the mind sat that were in stilling when we say something will worker will not work and how do we understand the mechanisms through which that changes physiology i to answer your question i think that that could be true but it depends on what actually is the minds at your evoking and ow your apparent and to the other parents other but also to is and people who do not have is what is the best way to learn and teach mind see om man clearly a conversation this informs me and o many other people out there about mind sets and how we can adopt them but it also seems to me that if we have the opportunity to teach mind see and really cultivate certain mind see that the world word be a much better place yes how does one go about that given that the were kids and we are all been bombarded with conflicting information all the time how do we anchor to or in set yen you are getting at my other major passion rat now which is what we are calling in our lab met mind set ism working on this it cries vans and others and that is how do we consciously and deliberately change our mind sets and the first step is really simple and that is just to be aware that you have them that the world your beliefs are not sort of unmitigated reflection of reality as it objectively is they are filtered through our interpretations a expectations are frame works and simplifications of that reality and as your work and an ear as well that all of most of what goes on in our brains and interpretation of reality mind tat are just that simplified for assumptions about things and the first step is to realize that we have them the second step is is start to think about what the effects of those mind sets are on your life to for to play out the story it can i have this mind set that stresses debilitating how is that making me feel what is that leading me to do is this mind set helpful or harmful the question is not is the minds set right or wrong cause you can find evidence for against it and yet we can fight about it till were exhausted the question is is it helpful or harmful and then you can go about seeking out ways to adopt a more useful mind sets am we have been doing a lot of work on how to actually do that how do you consciously change it sometimes it is really simple i think in cases where we do not have a lot of prier experience the the kids with am ovaries who are getting treatment they they did not have any other mind sets about sentence we just god the luxury of setting it right when it comes to healthy food i think we have it is harder to change people's mind sets cause we have a lot of baggage weighing us down am as a parent for me i gets my number when piece of advice is to lighten up trying to get your kids to do certain things and folks more on helping them to adopt more adaptive mind sets in i by no means an expert at this but ism testing it with my own child her reals me that in really con petit is how to i how do i resist the urge to force my child to eat her dinner that she can have her deserve it it concede that is the real urge s know need to do amity because that when you have start thinking about it in terms of mind that you realize oh that is just reenforcing to her that the desert is the exciting fun thing to have and this thing that i have to do must be horrible horrible that might my turn is forcing me to do it right it is letting go a little bit of the behavior the objective reality and really thinking about the subjective reality and focussing in adapt mindsets not my goal as apparent has been o try to help her and still a healthy mind get about eating that healthy foods are indulgent and delicious that the experience of stress is inevitable that it is it it is natural and that it can help going through stressful experience can help her learn grow and become a more connected and happier individual and with exercise and physical activity we have not really got into that yet but to we will et she now it is great i i wrote down and ism going to keep this in the front of my mind going forward i to continually ask what is the effect of my mind set about ex just to valuate that about excise about food about school about stress about relationships about relationship to self et camera and to really ism think about that in a series of layers you think that would be a useful exercise definitely an and an your work speaks o the seen in the mindful it is not i would you have really urge against people getting dogmatic about their minds set also right li go i need to have the right mind matter and if i do not have the rim enough psichlook it mind it is a piece of the puzzle it is a piece f the puzzle that is a really empowering because we have access to it and we can change it but it is just one piece of a puzzle treat yourself a sciences look at your life look at your insets see whats serving you see what is it find more useful adaptive and empowering in sets and and live by those of it no in one version of this kind of discussion i would have ask the questionman ask next at the beginning ism going to ask it a now close to the end which is your unique constellation of om accomplishments and an attributes and i only know a some of them of course exudates the first time that we have m person even tho have known your work for a long time and colleagues across campus you you run your laboratory o we do a research you were also it ally in university a serious aptly and the yo are also a clinical psychologist is that right si was trained as a clinical psychotics my pages and clinical psychology and i did all my a are and post intern she's at them with stress and aroma do you see patience were did you see nation i end yes i do not any more o that is a very unique constellation of practitioner and research or to what what are the mind sets that you try and adopt a on a regular basis in as a consequences ore in relation to those things or athlete research er cognition for yourself as you move through life you have in overarching mind sat that all challenge s good am or do you have any kind of a central mind sets that help you a navigate through i was it has to be a pretty complex et of of daily routines given everything that you juggle what i think that people you are unique an in that you have that you have the inside knowledge of of how the stuff works and you have also existed in these different domains i know lot of listeners have a more athletic m a slant to their life for a more a corner or somber raising is or some people are just you not it are doing any number of things si this where i think it would be useful for people to here can what what do you do s in om asking yet well it is certainly cur in my case that researches me search everything that i study as an intellectual has come from my own experience are my own failing training when i was really intensely exercising and training those were the questions i asked when i was dealing with eating and concerns about my weight those were the questions i asked when i was stressed about my dissertation i decided to do my dissertation on stress no now think or in the midst of a gloves pandemic it is what how can our mind sets be useful here i know i do not think there is a obvious answer to your question other than the guiding light for me has been an under current of understanding that our mind such matter i think i got that very clearly and deeply as a child both through my experiences as an athlete i know many of your listeners or athletes any athlete knows that you can be the same physical being from one day to the next one moment to the next and perform completely differently just depending on what you are thinking i was a finest growing up and if you cannot visualize if you cannot see something in your mind that you have no chance when you get up there on the balance came write and i also my father was a martial artist a teacher of meditation this kind of mind body work was baked into me from an early age and i think what have done recently is to try to understand it scientificallete and to r importantly to figure out how can we how can we do better with this rat how can we were all talking about eh i taking over the world and technology this and all h personalize medicine that and it is we have done little relatively little with the human resource or human brains that the the the potential for which is great and we have done almost nothing you do not take the placable effect we know a lot about what it is we have done almost nothing to e leverage that in medicine consciously and deliberately my an what keeps me going what gets me through the hard times is just that burning question of what is going on here and what more can i do with the power of my mind well i am millions of other people are grateful that you do this work it is important and it is truly unique tell us where people can learn more about your search where they can find you on line ism gin a trying persuade you to take more not a social media presence of going forward but whether not a i succeed in that effort or not a where can people find you i asked questions find your papers learn more ism i love to have you back for a conversation the future but in the mean time ye i know it is really a spend such an honor getting to chat with you i just you

everybody i re a gloss here we hermit or program during the weeks of protests and sorrow in the wake of the killing of gorge food we thought that today we would of for a different way of thinking about where we are and where we might be going and we would errand our show tat a for futurism which is a way of looking at the harsh realities of the present that at least has a little hope biotin we first ran the show rite after a very different kind of violence and very different protesters that were saying today this is back in the summer of twenty seventeen just one week after white nationalists with tortes marched in charlottes tell and whites so premise as deliberately rammed his car in to a crowd calling woman me heather higher this is in all our heads as we made the opposite your about to hear all of us ontic to feel some shred of hope here is that original show from twenty seventeen is america live re my chico e cake can be level i this is we about how much about i all now onto when my for workers here at the radio or sow know drumming an i feel trip of dolphin i we are going to a malcolm comics and coffee it is comic shop it is a comic book store ye and also e comes then i got that from the yes but it is it is i think the first our comic book store owned by a black woman on the east coast when the east coast i have to add that i think we do we here cans recently kneels got really interested in for futurism and it is whole intersection between far future ism in comic books the founder something called the for future is am net work it speaking at this comic store on this particular day anyway exactly is afford futurism needs from praying for this question n under this i this i this a long winded academic wiccopete explanation which have never even been ample internal eyes or remember honestly if we ring bonus what i about you for futurism is it seems very it is this way of talking about black people in a way that is really hopeful it the idea that we would be engaged in the same kinds of things that science fiction writers have always talked about that we would be engaged with proctology that we would have a future on space that we would master time travel the we would have a future in in utopian ore dis topaz landscapes it is surety this o that science fiction that is rug just the timid asper and the science which a write is meaning full because while there been whack characters in spit for a while now promise never the protagonist the nepenthe one's driving the action and for long and many imaginings in the future in much science fiction there were no black people at all which as no points out makes no sounds he says you can tell black people can make it into future cause they survive much already over the centuries the things that sort of really specific about you for futures in that i is that it takes an account that pass in a lot ways it imagines that in a black people forms of survival through the slaves trade through persecution that that is almost the technology in it itself the ways in which we come through those things ow i say the survival smaller ye and that everything that's been a part of our culture has made it possible for us to pave away for the future that is the thing that i li about it i think the feeling despite whatever trials or prevails you come through that you will exist in the future that r that just con makes me it makes me con like love best makes me feel what i love about tin black one we can get though this ten have known about for ever yes trays are now called out for futurism old will stop parliament funcadelics pimped out shit be rides doctor pace which predates the term by twenty years r we have rye o e come lately see lots of famous black people excited about after futurism rent and sponge pure in black space age fashion the director semen thirteen forbid diverse is making a teddy series base on a novel by the woman is kind of godfather to the movement hippie writer octave butler that is after duvet finishes the science fiction classic or rinklein time he black actors and some of the weeds an the there is marvel make black pantheranto big main stream move that soever did a childish canna room that was a tribute praglamen froncadelic an genemanas work duple years ago was a whole sight stage show with men in blab coats the story about androids things about specie o san comics n an iron filled up your frecomics after all the thing it need was must excited to see in the comic book story was the new iron man where and if you heard this in the comics tony stark is in a coma replaced by a black than age girl genius and she invents a suit that is comparable the tony starts iron man but which is my favorite piece of fictional t acknowledge anyway it he plaints that replacing tony stark with the black than age girl that peers is right into the back reactor heart of the techno superhero hippie pantheon i may think about who tony stark the original iron man is she is a wealthy white man he is a millionaire white i us unattainable ye it is great to have a robot suit and save the world but how do most people imagine themselves in that contacts ye wheres this girl her education takes her to this place that a a billionaire once was that that i mean that is inspiring is moving i do not know maybe in being the i was thinking about it a lot and wise my interest been spared much recently have always love science fiction i but the idea that the idea of black people in science fiction a peals to me now because of that notion of telling your own story because the wat black people are talked about it is often oblique future and i d a bleak press ye a bleach present and may be no future at all you snowman n and i may think about it i me if your i do not know i mean now t maybe not everyone feels his but have been watching there is just the lot of physios of terrible things huffing to place oil it just i mean it is literally almost the gonna and and there is got to be a parallel narrative a me this got to be a parallel narrative and i think for me that the parallel narrative is afford futures and i do not know is it is a way of feeling it is hard me to say this without laughing at myself but it is genuinely hopeful in a a way of feeling how we sat on a get way too long talking about this and finally had inside the comic book store s bright and spacious and smells great fresh comfy decagon posters ronderwoman pity and ex man an non girl restore is busy because after future is an enthusiast and author willing ones was there to give a lecture on the history of black people in comic books keepoppe a slide of a comic book cover from the sixties onto a screen we seen sixty six now we haven't

thinker is our thinking is absence i know really very little about this about after future is m and i think i a little it more i a more our plan is that ism going to go away at least to half way through the show and you will stick around you have not justbeen have been writing pieces in talking people a over the country about this to i have a little bit of a grass one i cannot i it'll see you half way through till then om ism going thrssomsifi here you have the con i appreciate that i they were t a asked one metropolis now i shouted really puzzling over afford futurism a couple of years ago when i went to an afford future's m conference in new york ipuntill that day it'd mostly heard the term use to refer to musicians sutra what a science fiction by samiel tetany o colon white head but at this conference they were afford futures artist designers programmers fix makers fashioning to feelers genes it was even a woman selling home made hot peppersauce in the lobby i began to realized that for futurism was not an art movement in the way that i thought of cubism or impressionism it was not static or rigidly define the people that this conference who were liberally applying the word were doing because they thought it made their work seemed somehow more active and vital but i did not understanding tavern how as the term became more ubiquitous and the her time sure t afford futures m to talk about beyond was morrow changes i was still trying to figure out the since of the thing like what makes something afford futurist i called the woman who would given the keynoter dress back of that conference in twenty fifteen activist and writer atrial marine brown drain told me that if i wanted to see for futurism that i should visit her home town to short michigan a postapocalyptic city she said the auto industry is nearly gone the city's inform structures crumbling many people can afford based resources water and light it is the setting for some dystopian simply story as soon as i started reading up on the place i came across the headline in the defrost metal times inside and guide floors a for futures to mayoral campaign well it was a woman running for mayor of defrost and the basis of her platform was not socialism or libertarianism it was afford futurism i flew out there to hang out with her i got to hear do some fun raising give speech talk to some bitch of lovers and we drove around the all bet different types of awful machine here in good striking an e scaly styled and glamorous yet still very bone an when at the shock of gray in her perfectly profit hair i dofnshe pointed out her favorite landmarks we visited a compact urban farm that make something enable called foam we drove past the spot and detritus north end we gorge canton's band parliament foncadelic plate one of his most iconic albums gorge canton did i create the midship connection in debates and he profited at yer to i ben avenge win thistreet er to might now taking a reporter around and dragging about your home town is what you would expect from any one running for may but t was along before anger the fro future as showed up as well the mothership is this wonderful simple is of our future space and it for me its this reminder a a this imposing futures was that can o the possibilities i and how it is always presents we were talking about stuff i knew i role listening the parliament records too and reading the comics on the out covers i always thought it was cool ground breaking stuff but when finger talked about it shes killed it up to something more grand and spiritual and a little esoteric to be honest i found her a bit difficult to follow on this and other topics but with her enthusiasm she was just fund the listen to anyway i came to destroy to find out about our for futures and here she was one supereager and ready to talk about its whether or not what she said made sense to me i my a my orientation item wit in our for future's and has always been cosmic an am a cosmic person here she is discussing time time can be defining twenty silly different ways thing go diagonally up akin go dagnaldown below our feet an in just in the universe to mate and here she is on the subject of lunch pleasure post resiny all through the future through your movement into your world a a pleasurable experience for me eating wise to be eating a great green say a god a time travel a little myself here and let that ingle we for did not win the primary she never even got on the blat officially when i was there with the election rapidly approaching she was still sorting out her policy points she talked to me vaguely about reviving to trots creative economy to rival the glory days of town and about the city's liter problem two days before the primary she published a more thoroughplan that called for among other things a universal basic income for defrosters paid partly in digital currency i guess that is pretty futuristic but at the heart of ingrrd's campaign was an idea that i found far more compelling an any specific policy shut forth in her plan for destroy she rites in order to manifest true revitalization we must consider the histories and of pressing of the black america population the foundation of every institution government police education the museum this built to silence disavow this place and render powerless black america these institutions were never created for black america to truly prospers tit is time for a new plans that is not something you here from many politicians but make sense here because the trout his eighty per cent black fixing the city means fixing it for blackpeep angradse's black america as the protagonists and the story of destroy his future end its pass when i was going out people love to say as i a hundred and tempers than black it was is tuperva it was just black this was the other thing about angry maybe she is idealizing i wouldn't know but she carries a shining vision of e trout is past with her everywhere she goes we drove past vacant houses and empty lots much of defrost is falling apart neglected or abandoned but underneath it all she still sees of figment city populated with a thriving blackmail class g up i walking e is can a dust hereby people writing a join can squash i last we getting we a dark an i my mother and i we cold om la me comfortable an a walking git is wed in the car we talked about but for futurism at one point i told her about the conference that it'd been to and how by now it'd heard the word fool future as amused to describe everything from comic books to confidence but it was not coming into focus for me i was sordid o wonder if it was just a term for putting a positive spin on anything a black person has ever done or whatever de but i was moved by the optimism that seems arrest in waters of bat i was also this gets everything e what is the point of it b but i is e flat i imagining an a for hogtie

whatever comes a way hinged eventually dropped me back to my hotel earlier held given me a greasy brown back continue a cooky which i now finally got around to eat in it turned out to be the most delicious glutinfre a he had ever tasted but i was still feeling hungry and a big confuse by our conversation whatever bigger point head been making about but for futurism i was afraid that it been lost on me i wont looking for burger and a stiff thing to mall it over at a bar over urban i met a guy that ism good call say with dark skin and hand of gray in his side ans that betrayed his boyish face he was dressed for a night of the town light blazer barberry shirk pattered silks car i asked him and another patron both to trout residence if they heard of angrier the floor for mare they had when say got up to pay his check after we would only been talking for a few minutes he surprised me by asking if i wanted to go with him to check out some of the other spots around town i was not dressed for it and had left my recording equipment on my room but with a hell say said it was locate for me to describe what happened next say had a nice car and precedes at never cost him more than ten dollars to market in a lot he loved that about the trout parking was cheap he moved here from new york some time in the late indies and fallen hard for the city as we drove he talked up the real estate he talked about his job and the idea business he ran out of his home thing seemed to be going well we met i with same found rick a bawled bearded alphamale type in a reddish leather jacket and followed him in his new beam w to a place called the grew it was the type of establishment was commonly referred to his grown an sexy recorded another round of bourbon and some wings and flattered with the bartender by now was clear that these got were looking to be women and the was weird because of this thing that say had told me earlier while we were in the car together he said that not too long ago his wife had gotten sick and he would taken care of her for a year and then she died leaving say and their teenage son with only each other say did not actually want to be doing what we were doing to night this was only his second time out as a single man he did not feel ready to meet women to date but he also felt it was time he could not wait for ever he was doing what he felt he had to do to move forward salmon rig took me to a few different spots that night but the one that i remember the most was a place called floods from the outside it lo li e a common family restaurant i thought it was closed until we rounded the corner unis the cluster of people leaving their cars with ha valet inside floods was huge say said was pebbly about twenty five hundred square feet i mass of bar separated two rooms i one point it was both a band and the edge playing simultaneously and wall wall it were well dressed grown up blackcock dancing and seeing along to classic soul fond an army it reminded me of how angered had described the defrost she grew up in and its thriving black metal class a hundred and ten per cent black she said superblock just black have been drinking all night y was already a little on my feeling but i swear i cheered up at the sight of it all say had not wonted to come to lunch at first because he thought too many people would recognize him i think it din one o be judged for being out on the town after his wife's death and when we walked in he seemed a little uncomfortable we split up for a while and later he found me standing a corner at the edge of the dance for mesmerize he pulled out his for and showed me the number he just got of what beautiful woman who walked in earlier and drawn rite bit f attention earlier in the day inbred had said a bunch of a for future stuff to me about defrost shape shifting and reckoning with its pass and healing i felt i was seeing some small aversion of that now with say most days he was wobbly just a guy an me pain struggling to survived this very dramatic thing that happen but t night in spite of that say was imagining a batter future and doing something about it he smiled hated some words of encouragement at me over the music and waited back into the crowd his spirits were up his evening was at over back true passed in perfect this this idea that occurs over and over an a for futurism that some up basically says the past is always with us it affects us it as the power to make a stronger if we learn how to use it properly some west african cultures represent this idea with the image of what is called o san coma bird it s a bird walking forward but with its head looking backward meaning no matter what we carry the pass with us into the future in one of the most well known a for futures novels kindred by caviar butler the main character finds herself travelling back and forth between a normal con temporary life in the present and the world of her ancestors in the antebellum him south were she treated a slave and the two time periods start to merge that is fiction are next story is told by a woman ho went to aversion of that in real life when i graduated from new you with the been drama and a mostly plan double major and anther apology my mother asked me what are you to do with that act in a museum this seemed especially read coming from a sociologist but cheat point for the first few years of my dust life that is exactly what i did during those years as bungee was living in her home town a suburb of washington you see working as an actor at night in place for which she was paid almost nothing and tot make some extra cast for christian she took a gig time travelling to the least desirable job of the eighteenth century she was a slave were she played one anyway per forming for tori said gorge washington's estate mount person for we can events called mount person by candlelight the halls of the mansion were decked for christian visitors would walk through stopping in each room to meet a character and here their monologue about the season there was missus washington beloved wife doctor names crake washington's physician and best bud wellie cestus sweet natured granddaughter and me caroling graham slave i had a script that i used to talk about carbine's life it was short besides the odd i mas slave at christian too a slave to my husband and kids joke from forty year old white women people were interested and respectful after christian i decided to stay in the job it sought it out fine the winter weather i met the visitors were mostly local and relatively few i enjoyed my daily walks on the relined lanes soft snow falling on my who did mulberry colored tape as they looked out at the standing view of the photomap river and when it was too cold i was stay in the library and read through musty old books and primary source letters and notations ut helped me understand this distant world i inhabited and the woman i portray i was caroling graham a real woman who'd been housemaid to missus washington i studied carbine's life and times for months and every day when i put on a beautiful crimson dress with tiny yellow and green flowers i became her with each let i laced on my corset i felt myself get closer to her posture how her body related to the world with my hair pulled back and two large french braids under bonnet i sat on a bench and set my fingers to the work caroling did rose of stitches on shirts and brightly colored embroidery i could picture her laying down her head at night next to her husband peter and their six children willow rather gemma lane jolly and little peter i imagined how she hoped that one day they would wake up in a world better than the one she would been given then spring came and trust from around the country started pouring into mount person my job was to simply be available to the visitors to talk to them and answer their questions as caroling this time there was no script and i realized pretty quickly that just being there existing as a black woman in that place was a threat to the fantasy of a noble america i was the stain on gorge washington's white house and i watched them grapple with this right in front of me me the least confrontational human being youllever meet i mean it took me till i was twenty five years old to tell my mama i did not her bake too smothered in craft barbahu'sause some people were uncomfortable with me that they bumbled through the first random thing that came to their mine you are a slave oh obey are the vegetables in the garden reel fake vegetables this is an outdoor garden they are literally coming out the ground and there is a man standing their watering them or they immediately asked questions with obvious answers that they just had not thought through why do not you go up to massachusetts and go to school instead of being a slave one person asked right as soon as i can get rid of this very obvious around skin steal a horse in a map that i cannot read i will be on my way or they would go into immediate denial mode the old woman who out of nowhere yelled me gorge washington had no slaves i said yes he did she responded no we did and this went on back and forth until her son got embarrassed and pulled her away or they offered another offense as some sort of defense but the iris were slaves too obey that is not really true and what the held does have to do with me and of course there were those who would take the opportunity to teach me instead slavery was a good industrious life where you got room and board for your work u e one room cabin they built themselves with eight people sleeping on a dirt floor and a bag of cornball every week room and bore all er was just a bazaar situation to be in playing caroling id be sitting next to miss wellie in the midst of her role play who would be going on and on about the lovely letters that her dear grandpapa gorge washington had written her ore all the fancy squares that she attended we would be in the green house with a gorgeous garden outside on an estate that overlooked the photomap it'd literally here white visitors sigh listening to miss wellie read from her letters full of nostalgia for this time long on they would talk about how much simpler things were back then how touching gorge washington's letters were what a fine man and how lucky miss wellie was to live such a charming life it was charming i was charmed by it then it'd be my turn here is what i talked about how my husband is rented from missus washington's relative now we could be sent back at any time how i go home to my cabin at night hoping that none of my children have been sold the once my friend was whipped bad her fingers were torn and she could not for three weeks all real stuff from caroling bantam's life one time and old lady just walked up to me while i was talking hugged me whispered ism sorry and walked away another time a man handed me a twenty dollar bill i guess that was reparations i carbine's day there were typically no more than ten white people who lived in the washington household at any given time meanwhile there were three hundred sixteen slaves and who was there to tell their story me i was the only black actor i felt it was up to me to be all three hundred sixteen people to reseal to them too i could talk about my friend the blacksmith thou delve the wolf spinner hi learned much about being a slave that to this sty there is space in my brain devoted to this information i can tell you had to shine silver with horse year which herbs to use to make your owner sick but not killer how beating a slave and then dousing them with salt wetter to disinfect the wounds was called pickling tickling i hate that i know that as my time amount person went on i began to notice there was something that would happen an particular with white men it was almost to spite themselves they would act out the power dynamic from seventeen ninety seven i can remember at least five times when a white man of a certain age sat on a bench way too close to me in said something life i used to be into a black girl back when i was young then he would pause presumably waiting for my response when am i supposed to say to that exactly thank you once a man got physical i was walking down the lane on a particularly hot and busy day when a tall burly white man grabbed my arm hold me towards him and said show me where you are branded i was startled and could only get out the words sir i have not been branded and then he and his wife began laughing heartily well you got a good up here we are from south caroling and they branded hem down there girl you got a good and then one time one of the guises i work with also in costume wearing a try corn hat he and i were walking from the farm back to the mansion and we decided to take the forest trail we were having a nice normal conversation when out of the blue he says hey the three and act a slave rate you tear up your clothes a little bit and go running out the far screaming and it'll follow behind you pulling out my pans he laughed i did not say anything i just sort of titter i tiered as an old time fancy way of saying i laughed with the master i laughed because i did not know what else to do as i felt completely and utterly powerless i started calling in sick lot because i was sickly i stomach would twist in turn i would sometimes get at choking feeling and cough as if to vomit but nothing was there i had terrible headaches and i could not do anything but sleep and one day it occurred to me that caroling felt this way too this exact way the farm manager who oversaw slaves on the mansion house farm noted that caroling quote complained of a pain in her head and side and had quote a very dry bad cough gorge washington's friend doctor crake is recorded as having treated her for such bad stomach pains that he had to bleed her give her stomach drops and prescribed twenty pills for bowel obstruction my job was to inhabit carbine's life but she started inhabiting mine i had this weird sensation that i was living in multiple time periods at once the saccule bed i started seeing mount person everywhere in the modern world and evolutionary psychologist wrote a block post for psychology to day were he claimed that he would objectively proved that black women are the least attractive of all races of women with science this happened in the year of our lord two thousand eleven i saw this only a few days after reading homes jefferson's notes on the state of virgin for were apparently jefferson who by the way was known to have slaves with the lightest again possible i come to the same conclusion about my race in gender over two hundred years ago he said that black men prefer white women and black women are preferred by a orangutans oh that is wanting then train martin i was watching the news one evening about a black boy harassed and pursued by a white lateen man who was convinced that he did not belong in his neighborhood and because of this compulsion the innocent black boy ended a dead my heart was in my gut the first thought that came into my head he did not have his pass pass i shook it off no that cannot be right when a slave left their plantation they had to carry a pass from their master or overseer saying where they were going and when they were expected to return not having your pass or your free papers if you were free was dangerous at any time any white person could stop you and demand see your pass if you did not produce it you were thrown in jail having black skin alone was enough to make you suspicious and a white stranger could be the judge and jury of your fate train martin did not have his pass there is a thing white people say to black people all the time have had it said to me why do not you just get over it it being slavery and all historical oppression why do not you just get over it they say it is in the past what i would say to white people in response is that you are not over the past every year you flock from all over the country to mount person and other places it to monuments and museums and reenactments there is president's day and the fireworks that blast over gorge washington's house every fourth of jury therefore the confederate flags and statues of robot else that you do not want taken down no i cannot get over it and neither can you none of us can they do not you these days she is executive producer on a new comedy from breakaway called twenties and writing a book of escorts

which my to worker real drumming became interested in back then as a lands to view the future the past and the present when we made this episode a few years ago we named it after album by the experimental jazartist sutra we are in the future and now here we are in the future three years later it does not look good here and it feels even worse in terrifying ways it resembles the futures of many distill be in sift novels that i was once happy to think of as merely fiction still even though this episode was created from hopefulness pain confusion rage they will all baked into it because that is the reality of being black in america afar futurism does say that black people will not still be fighting for rights dignity breath even as private corporations are building rockets to send torus into space afford futurism just asserts that we will still be here then and that fight will still be in us here is a song by sutra no recall on re spots it is called the space sages here to stay

p p end not come act for childhood's end looking into afford futurism over the past few months i found myself thinking about time and space a lot time because many of these stories involved people thinking about the past or the future or seeing the past and the future in the here and now and space because all of that time travel is chewed by very specific places defrost or mount person or philadelphia or wherever during those same months i also became sort of obsessed with these two videos that i saw on you two i could not help connecting them in my mind because for me they were both about a particularly precious intersection of time and space the time is that period when children have left school for the day but have not yet made it home an the space is that distance however many blocks however many miles it takes those kids to walk from one to the other in other words these two videos are about those moments when kids are out in the world on their own the adults they bumping you may have seen the first video it takes place in at lactic city two blacken ages an sweat pants an sneakers are fighting in the middle of a residential street on their way home from school when a slightly older black man it been ally miller emerges from camera right and puts an end to the fight with a stern but passionate talking to the clip went viral miller was honored by his city stevarvy had him on his couch i saw it for the first time on my face will feed this past winter and have viewed on you two many time since it does not disappoint it gets better every time i watch it o when it begins the two boys grapple and flame at each other sloppily one tall one shall be both defiant other kids crowd around recording with their seasons egging them on saga oar a a then seemingly out of nowhere miller bops in to frame his hands in his pockets wearing work boots and in it cap he immediately starts to call out the kids who ere record aery yo for no a you yo o cow can next a ma to cold ne o every ma to to ray cow cowards miller calls him then he turns his attention to the two boys in sent isn't of o bring o we you ring o we you for mans see stings you sinful ease you mi you because

some one who thought it would be entertaining and now all of their called friends are recording them go at it when ma who one o to who one o out n i tat was o wrong e lobe is o sens a yo yo i almost

says hear what miller does that i love i steer the conversation away from personal grievances towards something bigger he tries to tell these kids that they are part of a community he tells them that their actions have consequences an hat those consequences only get more serious as they get older without condescending to them miller talks to them about their futures the a game away don't game away is well away cobra were do not make yo drat likens yo it the a is i go as at a he is no longer justifying to get them to save face or avoid humiliation he is warning the boy is that as they become men young black men the world will become even more dangerous for them miller will not leave until the two shake hands they do not want to at first only the chubby kid extends his hand yours i i not none e a understand you nan the a the other kid does not the chubby kid pulls his hand back it yen ye words i or shine does w sh h sh it is actually difficult for me to express how wed i watch by this radio the beauty of it is that even while miller is insisting that these tea nature become responsible for themselves his actions demonstrate that they are not necessarily along that there is compassion an wisdom and guidance available to them it was a window into a work where people do not know each other she will give it do i window that i could rewind and reproach and forward to my friends to quick it was at once exhilarating and comforting i rode that high for a week maybe two then another video popped up in my face book feet theirs one is shakier and from a low angle obviously recorded surreptitiously the view is of the intersection of bedtford avenue and campus road mid would high school on one side of the street booking colleges on the other i recognized it immediately because i used to live ten minutes away there is still snow on the ground and the sulphone is buffeted about by wind it is camera wobbles up behind two uniform police officers walking slowly down campus road the one on the left has both hands in his pockets the one on the right has his baton already drawn a handful of black teenagers walk obstinately before them headed away toward flap bush avenue there is no way to know for sure what happened before the video started rolling there were most likely the beginnings of a snowball fight but it is unclear who was unhappy about that the police were not called they were already on sight in the footage one o the cop says come on let us go though the kids are already going the cop on the right reaches out it looks he shoves the boy in a pink goodie the boy flinches snapping his head around stop touching me he says the cop responds with what you going to do about it which is obnoxious and a stupid question but that does not stop him from asking it at least five more times a kid taunting another kid it at one point one of the teenagers fires back that is why we out it sounds bad ass but if you think about it the kid is saying we are walking away because we cannot do anything about it and we all know that another kid in the procession kneels down to pick up some snow but this left hand the cop on the right pulls his razor out of his holster and barks pick that up again rock paper scissors snowball tater the kids keep walking away the cop yells pick that up again one more time and follows with a do you want to ride the lightning the video ends as the kids cross the street to safety and the cops stop on the corner i know i know it seems you can see worse more unjust things happened to black people on you two just about any day of the week here fortunately no one was hurt but this tidy it was still hard to watch especially having seen how ad been alley miller talked those kids down in aplanatic city whereas miller was trying to got the senators to think a little bit more a adults they cop in this video sounded a tea water himself bullying and provoking what's worse he almost seemed to be enjoying it it is hard to imagine he cared anything at all about what happened to those kids after they deserted that corner i told my friends about this fig or too i heathen link around it was not as popular clip as the one wat miller i read everything i could about it i found out that the kids most likely went to redwood high school and a few weeks later i went him id would high school and stood on the corner of beard avenue an campus road we wanted to find some one who had witness the incident i was angry on behalf of those young men and i wanted to know how they felt yet i found one of them immediately and then the others found me me a he back a a of the back tortusthere in tapered gray sweats an colorful knapsacks they told me they came to the spot almost every day what chicken and fries and rice slat box with each other kicked it with girls and waited for the rest of their crew to play basketball down the block he wanted to know what my microphone was for and if they could get money and girls from being on the radio and if i could buy them lunch i asked them what they were doing on the day that the video was recorded one of them said he was cutting class t others said they were not i asked them why they think the cops came since their high school has its own security one of them said that some other kid's cross o shoot were throwing snow end the cops thought it was us leone o the boys said it was them but still it was only snow balls i i i i a just la o a o i don li us going i of had i i asked if they were scared when it happened i couple of sixteen year old cooler than it'd ever ben at that age said no not really a fourteen year old said emphatically of course he was sixth my height i was surprised at how tall some the boys were none of them older than sixteen i was a surprised at how not angry they seemed i grew up about forty five minutes from here in a similar neighborhood and queens not long ago i thought but when asked them why they thought this had happened to them at all one of the older boys talked to me he was explaining why humans need food lie the cop was white no black a i i an we at the it maybe this is just me but i looked back on walks home from school as my first real flirtations withindependencs a sacred time and space between my teachers rules and my parents restrictions the crimson that video this was their school this was their neighborhood most of the ones i talked to live only four or five blocks away as far as neighbor concerned this was their corner i cannot imagine what it would feel to be firmly in your time and space and runt up against a cop with a tater threatening to electrocute u if you do not put down that snow ball was crazier to me is that have walked through this intersection at beard avenue in campus road pass the high school and through the brooklet college campus many times in the last few years beneath its landmark gilded clock tower brooklet college could be a campus quit from a corny nineteen fifty except teeming with students from cutters all over new york e something about a practically streams welcome things only get better from here the young blacken in that video came out of their high school that day and stood at the edge of that promise what could be the next grate space an time in their lives was a college literally across the street but they were shot away told they did not belong as far as metaphors shod this one could not be less ambiguous but none of this seemed to bother the boys or at least not that they let on this was not the first time that they had been made to feel unwelcome close to home in school yet they were not festering with resentment that were not seem the tragedy in it that i was seeing after i finished talking to them i went across the street to find the brooklet college professor who'd recorded the incident ale wat valley teachers sociology and also happens to run the schools policing and social justice project leaving work that day he would seem the two cops to send on beard avenue and campus road followed them and it was his recording that ended up on you two as well as a few local news weights we talk briefly about how repeated incidence this could effect the boys psyches he agreed that no matter how cool they seem now over time their hopes for their own futures could possibly darken but then ale asked me how old i was when i told this forty three he said that i had missed the height of the stop frisker i was not a tea anger or even a young man in new york city when unprompted police harassment was at its worst the razor incident outraged me but what these could had seen their older brothers sisters and in some cases parents go through had conditioned them to be a bit more stoic it stung a little bit to have this white academic told me that i could not quite relate to a young blackmails experience i us when i first approached those boys a pard on me hope that ibonaly miller in the aplanatic city vino i would

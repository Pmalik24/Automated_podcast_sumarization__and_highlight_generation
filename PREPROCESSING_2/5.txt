well the michigan primaries were last night and there's some interesting stories on both sides of the isle the bigger story of course is on the democratic side of the isle where the incumbent president of the united states only one about eighty per cent of the vote not sounds a lot except for the fact that a huge number of people in michigan voted in committed that was a converted attempt by crazies in the democratic party in michigan particularly crazies who support comose many of them in dearborn michigan who decided thatched were going to show jobidon that unless he swivels his support from israel to commons he his somehow going to lose michigan to donate trump and this raises ha serious question why is jobidon dependent on the crazies in his own party after all jobidon came into office running against the crazies in his own party you will recall it you all the way back to the twenty twenty primaries that he was running against a crazy person burned sanders who's a nutjob old socialist and jobidon was running as the moderate and in fact it was only because him cliburn in south caroling in dosed jobidon and the entire democratic party unified to stop burned sanders the crazy guy that jobidon ended up winning the nomination and then defeating dona trump in the twenty twenty election and then mobile made a signal error he decided that he was going to be l b j he was going to be far not e play holder for the next generation of democrats but he was going to be a transformation president and you're on the left being a transformation president means spending more money than god or man has ever seen if you are on the left than being a transformation present means embracing all of the most woke versions of politics ranging from diversity equity and inclusion to transpolitics you have to embrace the most radical possible position an drag the america public along with you it also means on the foreign policy front the the reality to form policy exist for every president which his wife virtually every president talks one way whenthe're on the campaign trail an then they get to office in a realize the way the world actually works and they swivel how they actually govern gorge got be bush came into office pledging to be isolationist and the nine eleven happen berokobama came into office pledging to be an isolationist and then he involved us in a bunch of middle eastern conflict donate trump came into office pledging to be isolationist and the he broker the abrahamicords and to pretty harsh stands against russia in china jobidon came into office pledging that he was going to get out of afghanistan and make americoless involved in the world and now there are two major on going wars in the world in which the united states has indirect involvement in other words hoiden never really had the opportunity to be full on left wing when it came to forge policy because being the president of the united states basically forestalls that his one attempt at doing that which was the disastrous pull out from afghanistan cratered his presidency if you look at his approval ratings throughout is presidency jobidon's appruvaratings dramatically sank in the after math of the afghanistan pollen and they have never recovered they have remained in the lowforties ever since all of which means that if hoiden had come into office then governed as he pledged he was going to govern as a left wingmoderate a liberal moderate somebody who sought consents somebody who as just going to restore as sent of normal s and moderation into america politics he would not now be in the directorates that he is moderates have fallen off the ban wagon in dependence are now looking at trump and by the pulling data a plurality of independence favor donate trump over jobidon right not which is why donate trump is up in the polling against jobidon how jobidon loses independent to dona trumps amazing story because get independents are very off put by donate trump on a personal level they voted against him in twenty twenty late breaking independent voters in twenty sixteen voted two to one or dona trump in twenty twenty late breaking independent voters voted two to one for jobidon and now they are shifting back to trump there's only one reason for that and that is that jobidon allowed his ambitions to be a historic president that they'll make statues of to overcome his good political sent he did not want to be a clintonia vote way president he wanted to be heroic mama he wanted to be somebody who people fought of for generations to come as a transformed of president in america history and because of that he is now alienated the actual base that he wants help and that base is now looking much more seriously at president trump as is rival and that means that he is in thrall to the crazies and that is the story of what happened in michigan last night get when you look at these statistics what you see is that jobidon one approximately six hundred eighteen thousand votes first of all at a very large number of votes for in in current president in a in a primary if you go back s twenty twelve and you look the michigan primary in twenty twelve for the democrats what you will see is that borockobama in the michigan primaries in two thousand twelve when he is the comment president which would be the same position as as join right out he only one about a hundred and seventy four thousand votes another is no one showed up to vote in those primaries why did join true to vote n the primaries because everybody tenias a whatever who cares he is going to be the hominy why might even bothering to show up but for jobidon a lot of people showed up six hundred eighteen thousand people showed up to voe for jobidon but the bigger story of course is that a hundred and one thousand people showed up and voted uncommitted and there was an overt attempt again by the crazies in michigan led by people ricotta tolyl to jack up the number of people who voted uncommitted another twenty three thousand voted for martian williamson another twenty thousand voted for been chillies jobidon ends of winningabout eighty one per cent of the vote total in michigan but again that big stories can be the in committed voters because the idea is that if those in committed voters decide not vote for jobidon in the actual election in nonmember tend e could very well lose the state now he wan that state by about a hundred and fifty thousand votes last time a hundred thousand is a lot o votes our all the people can a vote actively against jobidon probably not but m say half of those people the side that they are not going to show up to the poles for jobidon because they are unhappy with jobidon well that means that he is in real trouble in michigan which means again when you steer a wave from mitten that means you are more reliant on your remaining voting bases and his remaining voting base is full of crazy people and that is why you are seeing jobidon constantly in bracing crazy unpopular positions in the reality is that the pulling data suggest that when it comes to for example the israel commons conflict the america people are broadly support of of israel the latest hazard derris pole show that eighty two per cent of america say they supports israel more than common alcohol voters again the democratic party sixty eight per cent of america say that israel is trying to avoid civilian casualties in fighting its war with common s another words there's pretty heavy support america remain to very pro israel country but not inside the crazy wing of the democratic party and that is the part that jobidon has made himself totally dependent upon and we should understand that that democratic party that the crazies in the democratic party they do not even know their crazy that is the thing to understand about crazy people in general crazy people in general do not know that they are crazy they think they they are perfectly seen and your crazy these folks are not and the can yuan tell that they are not they deny the level of the nuttiness jobidon does too jobidon pretends this is all normal politics as usual it is not it is not normal politics as usual to have a hundred thousand people vote against you because brucite against in actual genecitle terrorist group that is wild according to the waste journal uncommitted blue paste their original target of ten thousand voters and clocked in at a figure substantially higher on tuesday than it has been in recent michigan an primaries then they have now tallied about thirteen per cent of the entire tally by comparison in committed are about eleven per cent of the vote in the twenty twelve the michigan democratic primary one by present brocobom but again the numbers way lower in twenty twelve they'd avoid is former senor adviser to promise and michigan is going to be a national state this fall if the voters who registered their protest walkaway this felt it could be decisive he says this was a costly not the s good point to may an the follow will be a choice of much greater consequence and other words if you do not votes or if you vote in committed in the actual election than all those voters in deerborn here the n to for trumpthanas pro israel president in america history good luck with dap again this goes to the broader point jobitin has put himself in thrall two the radicals and the radicals have him by the short has which is why the you times has an entire piece today titles young voters say their discontent goes deeper than israel and gaze the energy on michigan college compass is ahead of the twenty twenty to midterms student said was electric armed with promises to protect a portion rights democratic candidate tell large campus rallies drawing crowds wo can prepared t cheer rather than to protest on election day students showed up in drawls but before the democratic presidential primary on tuesday the energies seems to have more oftinto apathy or anger young acts have been at the forefront of sustain back lash the president bison staunch support of israel bandits military campaign in gaze interviews with more than two dozen students across the state indicated a deeper well of dissatisfaction not just wit the in common president but the prospect of once again having to choose between bison and trump people decades older than they are voters under thirty who back to bison at by more than twenty points in twenty twenty are unenthusiastic about a rematch voters under thirty overwhelmingly voids their opposition to the conflict in a new york times liana college polling israel had not done enough to prevent spilling casualties in gaze and the military campaign son stop again when you make your entire campaign dependent on the low or penalty voters in the youth vote when you make your entire campaign dependent ism people where not only low propensity but radical that of course is going to shape the rest of your campaign and you have only one choice at that point and that is to steer into the radicalism the jobidon is dependence ism the crazies in his base that he has to steer in that direction and explains every thing that he is doing right now and the radicals know it which is why you pieces one in political today about the michigan waw maker the democratic floor leader of the michigan house of representatives man in graham wish who is denouncing hoiden he said he stooped nose pine and did not demand piece for palistoniuns not did not demand piece for his rallies instead continues to fund a genocide he is now thirty and he is the first arab america house majority leader in the history of testate of michigan which again kudos to the michigan stay republican party for being completely in competent in their jobs really well done but this is the the narrative the dhemedia have been pushing andthe'ae gingko continue to push in out jobidon does have another strategy he could navigate away from the crazies in the words jobidon could take a mother position in everything from sat the border to abortion from spending to israel he could take the moderate main street position the eighty per cent position but we have moved out of the realm of normal politics in this country really have it used to be that the best way to win an election us to take a bunch of eighty percent positions find the eighty percent positions the gs where america were eighty per cent pro the position and then you do that but instead we have now decided to a bandit those in favor of forty three percent propositions and then hope that there enough people in that forty three percent organ above t out way the people on the other side who presumably are unenthusiastic or not going to vote it is it is an amazing amazing thing and make no mistake these folks are legitimately quite crazy for example corneal west who is on the left of the democratic party and he is running as an independent but of course he is a far leftist is quite representative of some of the crazies in the democratic party cornel west spend his day yesterday suggesting a moral equivalence between israel and compass these are the people jobidon is going to try to party can see his policy already shifting you believe in the idea eradicating a terry group carat which did such barbaric thanks to innocent to reliant we one ma you and i know that a jewfish life as exact the sang that as a piston in life to piston an baby an the same bay with a jewfish baby the question as had to get at the its of it any time you kill an innocent person that is a crime against humanity did most commit war crimes absolutely murder is murder now i believe in just war comrades can kid combats ism not one but the king ism not a pastor's but comrade must not key we villas are innocent people no magic foot it is idea or mamas but but the problem is you going to call hath a terms group tan the idea i killing innocent people their cars too get guornowest is an absolute clown but again representative of a huge clown bays inside the democratic party it is an amazing thing but by the way if you really want to know the extend to which the radicals in the democratic cat democrat pertain control look at names canaille shames carnal this is the party's amazing the moderates in the democratic party have decided they need to cave to the radicals names canaille is one the more moderate members of the democratic party had his coin he is the the designer of the clintonia third way he and morris for he people who basically designed triangulation names carving has bee the person who is been on the ramparts in the democratic party saying you need to stop talking about men in woman's bath rooms and used our talking about at economic issues but here he is basically acknowledging that the crazies now run the party he says that if we get to chico the democratic convention which has going happen in chico this years again i got to say just amazing writing this year of trump when you have the democrats going back too chico for the convention the same place that the nineteen sixty eight convention took place in which you had a a hotly contested democratic primary fight the assassination of a major political figure in a of cay in which you have massive riots over the venom war that is where they chose to have their convention this years just really well that heres names canaille saying that if we gets the chico convention and the gozawar is still continuing then is going to get wild your dial wars talking about this uncommitted vote in michigan because of a that the word gas there some democratic act of this up san they want they want to see democrats not in committed in set of for president avidin what do you think about the concerns about that are they well founded as this being blown out of proportion what do you think the cook con granulation go you we show a one of the order the shank is your the and i think it is the a e the just progressive bat that its a young people or call campuses a a the prarvile can give some cargo see i take this a the fa a o e is i got it it it is damage politically is pretty substantial and it we get to chico at the convention and is thing is sill a o soon think about is a a her can now understand that that when names canaille is caving to the radicals that shows you that they have to he is not want to they have to and then of course you have the great minds to the near times who also are urging jobiton cave to the radicals that of course to be morons comasfreeman legitimately one of the dumbest people in the history of foreign policy commentary homes freedman a man who gets all of his advice from cab drivers in random places and an this moron is still advising the bide administration on forge policy has a piece in the yer times to day taught title israel is losing its greatest asset acceptant was that israel greatest asset i notice that israel has another asset and is called the very powerful military if news were waiting for acceptance for all of human history that was a strategy that failed pretty dramatically until israel actually arose and had you know in air force a notes the homes remain seems to the news having the good will of the world up until the point where they defend themselves and start killing terrorists he says chart have spent the past to days travelling from newtelly to deny in him on have an urgent message delivered to present abandon and the is rely people ism seeing the increasingly rapid erosion of israel standing mong friendly nations a level of acceptance and legitimacy that was painstakingly built up over decades and if widen is not careful america global standing will plummet right along with israel he is o where exactly is is he is he feeling the legitimacy drain away he says the legitimacy is draining way in the arab world oh shocker i cannot believe it a it but was he really doing that the reason that he is doing that homes remain is not only because he appensto be wrong on florin policy literally all the time but because he knows everyone else knows jobidon abandon the thing that got him to office in the first place and now his not serious trouble which means the now he is putting pressure on israel in themiddle of a war against a terrorist enemy israel has now reduced come off his serious control over the gozastrip to the city of raft it is in the south of the gozastrip everyone knows it is a final climactic battle in the gastric and what is jordan doing as israel is prepared to go in and kill presumably yet yes in mar who is the leader of mass the mastermind of the october seventh tax he is selling israel effectively to back off according to axis the bide ad ministration gave israel until mismatch to sign a letter provided by the ours on tuesday that is assurances it will abide by international law while using us weapons and allow humanitarian ad into gaze three ours an is daily of facials told the axis the assurances are now requirement under a memo issued earlier this month by present bison while does not single out israel the new policy came out for some democratic senators expressed concern over the is really military campaign in gaze if the assurance is are not provided by the deadline us weapons travels for to the country will be paused now here is the problem with that idiotic noshing international law is a camera it is a law international law is largely design by people who do not abide by it under any circumstance is an only apply it to people they seek to hamstring international law in other words is a joke that is neverhav for policy has run the willsonian notion that there is some sort of great congress of powers that gets together and decides the morality of the world that international law now applies is silliness it has always been silliness and yet that is what hoiden is now is now pushing and the why s he doing that he is doing that because he wants the soon michigan that is all it is very simple the memorandum was issued by the white house after pressure from sewer a crista homeland of mainland three yours officials told radios the tenant majority leader trecumer told the wite house that he was concerned in amendment would divide the democratic cocks in the lenten senate and what it what assume do instead of standing up to disown crazies he toldjrae biding just do it as an executive action again not a shock at all this is what the democratic party is now sop is hoiden are the m crews likely to placate the crazies the answer is know because they are crazy this is the problem once you are in thrall to the crazies everything runs out o control fry tee quickly who are the people where voting uncommitted in missing well the probably people the people that we saw last night over at briskly over it you seeburkly there was asper are usual arrangement a massive protest that turned in to a riot twas a private event and jewfish students were threatened assaulted and prevented from attending the speech by a jewfish speaker on campus students were called to rogatory names dirty new or u new here is some tape of what is going on a brolly they decanal the event an evacuate tho hall nonmoving to see the i eye m protesters who are blocking justices from entering event this is at this what they do they these of the people that hoiden is caterington precisely the group that hoiden is aterington college a den iron that that is those r the people that hoiden is very very hot on getting and what is amazing about all this again is that by and large america support israel against compass if jobidon had shown one soda of t e actual credible leadership rather than trying to have the baby to placate the nuts then you be more popular on the issue not america they hone america allies actually win wars they do not when americanalis moozewars you now we know that because join lost a warn afghanistan and it tanked him jobiden's failure to secure anything approaching victory in e crane robin's failure to secure anything approaching victory with a to israel and compass is a bad thing for him politically because he if you decide that is a shrinking base of nuts and he is he he wants he wants the nuts what is amazing about that is that of course puts the nuts in the driver my an let us be very clear hoiden has now done that internationally not only domestically because who knows they are in control now commas jobidon the other day he a he made a claim that a sense fire was mere moments away he was eating ice cream and he made the claim that a a sees fire was about to happen all would be well and tom and then compass was nope and the reason comose said no is because they know that they can jack jobidon around the more intransigent compass is the more they make demands that are not fulfilled the more pressure widen will exert on israel not on compass and no point is hoiden ever say to compass okapis you know what we tried to make it thrall the deal is not forth coming israel have at it and no point o jobident say that because he is afraid that i he does that under any circumstances he loses michigan he is now handed the bat ton two the terrorist group in a variety of ways as we discussed over the last couple of days for example the palastinian government not the head the government mocha boss the dictator but the rest of the palistinian elected government as he electrics the no elected government resigned you make way for a comas lead government and then hoiden is going to tap that government on the head and call it the new palistinian government new boss same is the old boss except the worse in the less bank and now comasofficial san tuesday there was no break through in the mediated talks with israel am to pausing the war and frying the remaining hostages and the gosastrip that can one day after jobidon sad that a sense fire was imminent a seminar ma comas spokes person send an a text message the militant group had gets to formerly receive any new proposals since senior is daily officials met with cutter egypt and you us in parts last to advance a possible deal another comasofficial ataman of dorado said the group was sticking to its demand that israel agree to a long term cease fire and that leaks about the talks resign to pressure comas to off in its position by long crushes fire they mean leaving comas in place which is the only thing comas needs in order to car victory understand that in the normal traditional war when you degrade the enemy's military capacity the way to israel has done comas a comas does not have offensive projective capacity at this point now normally be considered a wind that is not the ay that works in the mildest tin the mddaleast the way that it works is if you provoke wasn't get your ass absolutely kicked but you survive and you wave your flag you are somehow he victor the is way this idiotic regime works in the middle's and comas knows that all they are looking to do at this point is survive how crazy are the crazies there crazy that the moderate among the crazies are still crazy for example there is a tweets going around yesterday a runs laughing at it but it does demonstrate hes sort of standards that proponent of comas and the and the palistinians more broadly it does demonstrate donuts lot of these folks a there is a person his name's mahommed awkward he is a palistinian writer and poet and tum he lives in east jerusalem he is born in east jerusalem he a and he apparently graduated from the savant college of art and design with a bachelor of fine arts degree and he a is studies poetry at prooklin college as well he is a correspondent for it the nation a you now a well respected member of the propalistonian left obviously he am he gave a speech not all that long ago in which he claimed that quote our day will come but we must not be complaisance our day will come but we must normalized massacres as the statist duo tonga october seven lot the other day he treated out that is quote you cannot protest peacefully you cannot way cot you cannot hunger strike you cannot hide jack plains you cannot block traffic you cannot tremolites you cannot self desolate you cannot heckle politicians you cannot march you cannot i it you cannot descent you just cannot be and the tells the wholestories the crazies that join has turned this party over to not the malhammed absurd is a is a is america citizen who can vote but his allies in the united states can not us on i analyze this for a moment because it tells the whole story of the of the arab is daily conflict in one tweet his version of just being again his version of leave us alone u leave us alone is is a pretty well respected argument tat is made by people on all sides of various political isles leave us alone is a brig old argument right leave leave meal ism not bothering you leave me along butt his version of leave us alone right leave me be is blocking traffic throwing mallet cock tails self immolating and high jacking planes riggmat's a crazy statement you cannot just let us be it is it is difficult when you will not let us high jack planes it is hard when you don't let us throw collator cocktails or set ourselves on fire these are the people the jobiton has has hitched his boat to good luck to him by the way things aregoingto gout worse before they got better because of all of this the great lie inthemiddle east is that when you broker these temporary humans the temporary seas fires that the somehow calms the waters in the iddleleast that is wrong the only thing that matters as always is victory the only thing that matters is power and control that is all that matters in this region of the world there is no baseline agreement on values that means that compass survives compass is there for strengthen is bell is strengthen and by the way just a note the double standard here it truly amazing according to the lose journal the start of roman looms as an informal but urgent redline to strike it is real commaseas fire at the million group called wednesday for mass protest during is comic holy month that israel fears is part of a plan to spread the conflict outside of gaze is rally leaders have said they would launch on offensive against commands last stronghold in goa if a deal is not reached by roman set to start around march ten the us egypt and cuter have warned israel against the ground offensive in rofisat couldn't danger negotiations negotiations by the at ckomases totally playing for all they are worth on wednesday is malhonea they had of comma's political bureau from his five star hotel in cutter called on palicinians outside gaze to converge on all oxamasqu it is the routine that happens prettymuch every year round roman in which museums are allowed gather on mass at allow and the the start hurling molletof cock tells and rock tat his daily soldiers and then when is daily soldiers quashed they suggest that it is some form of a brutal occupation and evil army actions wo stop them from worshipping on the templamount which as a multiple time visitor to the templemount there only restrictions on me as a do there are no restrictions on muslin ore worshipping at aloximasqu zero if you go there worship our fine if i go up on the temple mount and i openly prey i will be expelled from the templeamount that is the way that it works up there christian too by the way but not the truth does not matter in this region of otherworld a that matters is power and again the amazing thing here is that look it the west cant even comprehend wit they cannot that the west is now allied itself for p a purposes with groups compass ore the palstinian authority because once you try to broker a deal and you legitimize one of the sides of the dealt is a terrorist group as i legitimate side of the deal you now become the proponent this exactly what happening barakobama and on he sent a terrible orondual and then he as seen the rest of it his administration running cover for the agrarians because if he had acknowledge the aronians we are lying and sponsoring terror everywhere the it would've looked he was a sucker head sunk cost fallacy about his own rondure and the same thing is happening here with regard to the negotiations the united states let us to negotiations with commons an most all i let us do it and then there doing whatever they want to do and the us while we do want them part of the negotiations robinia wall you we we do want them is part of the negotiation n that means we have to treat their demand reasonably meanwhile they're literally looking to weapon up for their holiday now jugs there question for all the christian news non museums in the audience and moderate museums in the audience by the way why would you why would your holiday be the occasion of watching a vast terror attacks lash war it is amazing double standard here if your radical muslin not only can you use your own mosque as he shield for your weaponry with routinely happens not only can you use your own holiday as he shield o my god you cannot attack us on roman it is very holy us also what in at kill you because it romance and now's our time but aught the a radical muslin propositions but also when you gets have a holiday that is the best time to attack again october see was i cut a which is on the polish calender probably the happiest day of the year and how was the perfect time for commons to runs across the border and slaughterswive under people jobidon has wetted himself to this and he has done this because he refuses to moderate on any issue his vision out weighed his capacity he wanted to be transformation and he has been all right and once you are dancing with the devil that dance just gets faster and faster and it is not just by the way with regard to israel and commossel though it is the most clear cut example because what is happening an missing it is also with regard to the border the obvious question on the border why will not jobidon shut the border every one wants him to by pulling data jobidon needs to close the border he used to take harsh action on the border donate trump is destroying him on this issue in all pulling data it is now jump to the top of the heap among issues that american's actually hereabout and still jobidon is tithe ring and doing nothing why merely why when the only possible reason is because he is in thrall to his crazies he is in thralls in the nutjobs for example correnjon pierce yesterday she said mobile is heading down to the borders as asked is he going to announce any executive action or anything to stop the giant flow of i legal migration the note actually note hero i do not have anything to a like can at get ahead of the president don have anything to to about that this time we have we spoken to that cat give actions the spoken to that many times we think the bottom line es there to have dolt with this border the gallant that we tie the border we see with this emigration o broken emigrations the em that been broken for decades is if we if republicans have e ford with with the by parson deal that came you out of the sent o case no that is to no they are not going to do anything about any of this meanwhile by the way the bodies are stacking up bilmalugan who doesn't excellent chose reporting on the issues over the past twenty four hour he just been reporting crime after rime for example local media in washington do see reporting a salvador legal immigrant has been arrested in connection withe murder of a two year old trial on february eighth ice says that he was released from custody after arrests multiple times in twenty twenty three after the local jurisdiction ignored ice detainees the two year old was caught in the cross fire of a of gangway that was not the only illegal immigrant serious crime over the course the last forty eight hours to to pop into the news according to fox eight live in nineteen year old honduras man has been arrested in center louisiana following a series of violent crimes according to believes the center police department says the investigation began tuesday february twentieth when it was notified of the rape of a fourteen year old girl at knife point the suspect was then identified as in emigrants honduras in the united states illegal apparently police say a man was getting out of his vehicle and was approached by this person and demanding his property during the robbery police say that the perpetrator stayed the victim a multiple times in the face and the back officers of the scene found the selegalemigrant covered in blood the chief of police says on documented emigrants are difficult to identify due to lack of documentation this person had reportedly used to alias is in the past including even locket then according to chief mason went was the twenty six chief of justborter patrol quote in the last seventy two hours just border patrol agents throughout the south west border region have apprehended eleven individuals the violent criminal histories the criminal histories include child molestation aggravated assault rape mother and man facture and trafficking of firearms an trovbidon still will not close the border he to will not close the border there is only one reason for that and that is because again once more once you have a band in the middle you have to tack to the extremes jobidon has made that decision and now we are all reaping the whirlwind from that in just one second willet to democratic politicians who do not actually one to reap that whirlwind particularly first to morrow is leapday that day comes once every four years if you are born on leapday congratulations you've still much younger than the rest of us jerky's racers is offering an insaintial and by that we mean you would be crazy domissit to morrow only an get a precision five trials a toile true travel bag left to cheers tumbler and jerky's microgression chocolates all bundled together for twenty nine bucks that is an eighty dollar all you don't want a miss the deal this once every four years sale is tomorrow february twenty inmesh its for one day only sedrominer whatever you have to do get a tomorrow a jerky's razors dicot before the offer ends o cam meanwhile gat there are democrats who do not wish to go down with the sinking radical ship that apparently in cleric madam ceric dams ran again on a more moderate platform as mayor of new york now he is saying that he wants to deport migrants accused of serious crimes now you might think that that be a normal proposition wrong the democratic city council is trying to oppose him according to the near to times for years nurse city leaders have relished the status being a called sanctuary city were local la en forcemeat to operation with federal immigration officials limited on tuesday mere epic arms made a clear his views re differentia he had his way he said he would permit law en forcemeat in york city to work openly with emigration authorities to more readily to port migrants were suspected of serious crimes there is some people that feel thy should beagle to remain here keep their actions until there eventually convicted he said i do not subscribe to that theory a reporter asked to dams about to process that they don't give do process to the person they shot or punch are killed there is a philosophical disagreement here the city council says there are no plans to revisit these laws again that divide is the democratic party in a nutshell which is we the democratic party is in fact in a process of shrinking away now the democratic party has also get to take advantage of positions on which the re publican party is not in the eighty per cent take the situation with regard to urine the united states is bunchrcan flirting data on what america think of funding for crane according to a recent got pole in the united states the forty three per cent of america believe that the west should continue to support crane in its efforts against russia until such a time as runs with draws from the country even if that means the warrants facts last longer some twenty three per cent of america say they want to incur o negotiate a piece to and the fighting even if it means russia tell as control over some parts of crane a plurality of america still believe that funding free crane would be the proper way to do this and when it comes to whether the west is doing enough to prevent the missions from winning in crane the united states forty six per cent of america say the were not doing enough twenty five per cent say that we are doing more than enough or enough and de got pole from canary as far as the level of eight being cent to urine thirty three per cent of the america public believes that would maintain the same levels of support to crane some twenty six per cent believe that we should reduce are level of supports for twenty three per cent believe we should increase are levels of support one the big questions when it comes to funding freeucrane is weather the reduce position is wedded status quell whether the increase position is read as status quell because generally america angelic statusquagle gook cay fine will just up spending what we been spending we do not want sync radical uptake in the amount of spending but only went six percent of america are expressing that they would actually to reduce our levels of support according to the got pulse that is a minority proposition that america desperately want to reduce the commitment that has been made to crane with that said there swingstaye voters who do believe that we have given too much to crane a pole from the puca telegraph this is from canary early canary fines that in for example michigan thirty two per cent of america believe that america has given too much to crane twenty one per cent say too little twenty nine per cent say the right amount eighteen percent say they do not know can bottoming tho is the hard and fast opposition to more aid u crane long as that aid is not yo wildly over dramatic the vastmajority of america voters are at least of vasplorality are still in favor of continued a crane they do not want to just cut off you crane at the need right now which is why it is very strange the republicans continued you not negotiate over the situation in u crane now the democrats have failed here signally to convince the america public that they actually hold the middle ground the question on u cranes who holds the middle ground the middle ground on crane is the one the america want most america want to provide enough aids u crane to help them withstand the russia garage but not enough aid that it is a serious cost to the united states or we do not want to shore up their bureaucracy or anything that which is why there republican back ventures who are now proposing an alternative aid u crane bill which presumably is pretty popular with the america people that is u crane aid bills being proposed by actually a by parsing coalition including representatives transit is trick of pennsylvania and are golden of mane and on bacon of nebraska it is called the defending borders defending democracies act it includes bort control measures including that migrant coming over the southern border had to remain in mexico which would be the biggest single policy prescription that was reversed by jobiton that in of its would be a huge one remain in mexico being in shrine in law would be a major win for the united states if this bill were pass the house and the senate and the bill includes forty seven billion dollars for u crane priorities that is down thirteen billion dollars from the proposal approve by the senate the house law makers excluded these senates seven point eight billion dollars an government budgetary aid to reeve saying why repaying their government expenditures we just want to pay for the weapon reach that they can stop the ruffians from invading the bill would also fund us military operations in the red sea would spend three billion dollars on helping america bill morsumarines and it would spend four billion dollars re filling israel stocks of air defense interceptors which make sens because you a stop heron from for example firing a missile it israel israel needs that aid presumably that bill is being proposed by a by partisan coalition the house speaker johns has ben unable to bring for d anything and hereinlies the unworkability of the republican house snatching defeat from the jaws of obvious victory and there there are thousand ways republicans can win this particular pair battle and they seem to be ignoring all of them because again the house speaker is dependent on a single vote the house majority is down to to single digits and that means that if speaker johns does something to cross four republicans he loses his speakership now maybe at this point he should a say ora fine what but that is the job the job is i pass bills that i thin we're going to help the republican party wins the next congressional election and help donate trump win the presidency because let us be real about this jobidon is now running against congress the is what he is doing that is what for example yesterday here is jobidon saying that the consequences of an action in you crane are dry that is a hard case to make if republicans were passing say a forty seven billion dollar aid package that includes her his border provisions is suppose to passing nothing he is counting on republican in action tell carry him over the finish line again is the only placewhere he can even attempt to grab what he believes to be a moderate middle position is one crane and that's only being made possible because republican soave not make clear exactly wat to how they want there completely divided here is mobile you red error retire in bottom line here is that it's some point the republican leadership is going to have to stand up for the majority of its actual constituents and take positions that may alienates the more radical parts of the base the p again even inside the republican party its a minority proposition it still is to completely cut off aid to you crane the is still not it is by polingdata that is not a majority position inside even the republican party and if rusher we to over on keep who look even worse for republicans as yourbidon found out when he left the turban over on cool it's our republican's going to a lobby t whoever acts not crazy winds whoever seizes the middle ground in the selection cycle winds that is presumably why republicans are also discussing the possibility of averting a government shut down the speaker johns he said that he is optimistic that we would avert a government shut down this wean and this is in fact the correct political position i know that there a lot of people who government shut downs because they belie they achieve something am only in favor of shutdown if of get a wind out of it but it turns out that this shut down is not likely to achieve anything the substance of win you need nor to offset the par catastrophe that would be turbine running against to congress that is completely this functional there is johns yesterday the other big priority for you con try of course is the fungi of our government and we have been working in good faith or round the clock every single day for months and and weeks and over the last several days quite literally or hon the cook to get that up dot we have very of to mystic o i a hope that the other leaders cannot can told to the say we believe that we can get to agreement on these issues an prevent a government shut out and that is our first to responsibility again it looks as though johns will avert the the problem when it comes to the government shut down mess again why can democrats o political victory for minimal gain but when it comes to you crane again that is where bison is going bids get run on that republicans have the advantage right now on the border they have the advantage in metal eastern policy they couldalso have the advantage on you crane if they would simply articulate a policy that makes any sort of sense but again it is too fragmentary in the house and bison's own vagueness on policy and on what he actually seeks there is is not going to is not going to make up for republican failures when it comes to even passing a thing i figure all we want pass the thing in the house that is what the houses for just do that an just take an tour example the house had proposed the passage of an israel aid only bill and join threaten o veto it but why not are himvito it why not make the senator's vote on it the republicans and how still have not passed that out of committee it was rejected for a sort of the the giant voice vote that happens whereby by popular consent your just lad push they'll ford does not mean republicans cannot do it they can the lobitof smart politics evert go a long way because again jobidon is incredibly vulnerable can't just one second we are gong to get to the republicanize of the eye what it means that is nomad trump was able to win almost seventy per sent of the vote n michigan primary against sticky hailed if you are not a member become a member use coach of per check

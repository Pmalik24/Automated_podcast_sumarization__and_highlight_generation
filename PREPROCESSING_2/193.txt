i remember back when i was first starting in radio working in a pare this was in their old studios on em street and washing in d see my cossack then and my mentor keep tablet who side note mommy was possible with radio i would not be here without kith i may we were in the studio listening to some recording and this was back in the days of real to reel taper corners and was long ago right a back then any really retake that you would throw up on a machine at in part would start with i think it was thirty seconds of my been a minute of tone on tucking won i say tonight it is this sound thousand hearts at this tone actually has practical function if you picture this omostoper k if you picture a sound meter with a needle the bounces up and down every time at a sound the tone is supposed to put the meed perfectly at this one spot on the meter with a black numbers and and the red part of the meter begins just a zero at that spot marking this is where you want to be and the tone is just suppose to rest there rock solid but a this particular day with this particular recording we put it on an kith and i each the meter is the needle first did below the zero then climbed above the zero and then floated sort tentatively to the spot that it was supposed to be at the zero and rested there and he said to me see that that is a person in there that is the hand of the engineer over recorded thus trying to find the right clave that is the ghost in the machine i know i that is stuck with me the ghost in the machine i have a been recording people my entire at a life i started in a preen was a tea major and to day sometimes when i said recording novels i think about that the trace that ism leaving of myself when i trusts the knob up and down i think sometimes when you record something you cannot even imagine what it is that your really capturing or who is on notice it some day is tuck into a this woman nickel dosing saber and she told me the story how she had never known her dad he died by suicide when she was three months old and her older sister ruth was five when he die she knew the dad but then i she got older this is sad she found that she was not able to remember anything about him any more my sister spent many many nights and days crying about about not remembering him and wondering what he was and what happened and it was her who did all the pining and longing but i did not really have any longing of my own particularly because i i had no memories and i was only a baby and i did not actually think i at any rate too long for him did you refueling as a knife o i should feel more or did you just feel i som mi thing i think i mix of both nickel's sister ruth was in a perpetual search for information about their dad but nickel really had no interest her mamma or married she had somebody else she thought of his re dad and then a cousin was quitting out their uncle's house in israel that is where that part of nickel's fun my is run and the cousin i found twenty five recordings i nickel's dads in opera he trying to be an operating er even tough mas job was connecting people's founds here were old readers recordings the dad i nineteen sixty five riches sister ruth on a sound engineer who count did citizen them i mashie and the engineer went through the tapes they realized it was a lot of music but it was also a lot of other stuff besides lie yer dad would take the recorder work and record conversations with his customers hit record himself composing music and they were listening my sister in the sound engineer too one in these tapes hand she said we got a call nickel and she message me on skip i was at work a she said you got to hear this and am she played me this and this real and it was a it was her as three year old and they were looking at photos and he was asking her who was in the photo and it was a little game they played this is all in deeper he tried desperately neghteenture here is that daddy no i got that piet is it mamma is it route m me i felt i felt the floor had dropped out from under me everything i thought i understood it just it just fell away i had seen photos of him i knew a little bit about him but he wasn't accessible and and this man that i seemed was not successful to me suddenly became and it was when i heard him speaking and laughing with my sister hit was he was overwhelming and it was only in that moment that i realize what i had lost in the moment to be honest in the moment i felt my first emotion was anger because i never felt the loss of his death i was too young but he goes into a machine he just happens when you record anything you who understood that very queerly homes citizen the person i first figured out how to record in playback sound yo created first phonograph machine back in eighteen seventy seven an article a listing t e possible uses for his new invention one of things he tested preserving the voices of family members you have them after they die he says when it comes to this quote the phonograph unquestionably outrank the photograph and this idea of using machine to hold on to the dead it is a part of a famous bit of audio history maybe t is more a legend that illustration of a dog listen o the old fashioned phonograph with the captain his master's voice this was the are won go for years and years look at gouge worse a trade mark painting and what will come up you will see the painting that the log was based on you see the dog and phonograph we on what looks a coffin and here is whit his a question i a there is no record of what the artist francs brad actually intended here but gook for yourself lots of people me included me don't we see a coffin and i the dog whose name was nipper first belong to franchises brother and then became franchises only when the brother died in this way of seeing the picture oil get the master's dead he is inside that coffin and the dog is listening to a recording of his dead master's voice he m n were steady in the the third floor es a cru the earlier i would ha been called the photograph experimental department in ma homes citizen's lab and west orange new jersey this whetosen developed the phonograph t laves sufficient in these days is the homes citizen national historical park and the curator the audio curator jerry feverous i show me around they have done the best to keep things preserve they were back in the day the same piano and recording gear sitting right by prison's hearing it which is busily just a long bellhop that he would hold up to his ear and they they would be inviting musicians up here to make recordings it also make the refinements on the on the machine to try and prove the sound quality this room it is fund us spent my whole life in recording studios this room is one of the very first once yet one of three it is not the first it it is just an ordinary room what its high ceiling and there is normal windows weaving outside this know sound proofing in any way no serious show me the machine where for the first time ever human being successfully recorded sound and played back prison's very first phonograph it is incredibly simple devise a breath cylinder crank tore to talk in to i said i been recording people since it was a kid really and it was emotional to see the very first machine that did that before all the great audio documentarian for an woman before studs turkey everything started it there an a a a a a aka a a a a a a a a a mama recording on one of his old machines one of the rooms were prison work it made prison slavery very near a a a a a a a a a a a m a aka at a a a a a a a a a a one ghostwriter intoknolegies at its best it helps us by doing exactly what we ask it to do but it is only the straightforward when we asked for simple things rank play the song send this emu this her story is about somebody asking a piece of technology to do something at o until recently only humans have done to say something about loss something people experience but of course machines do not themachine has to talk about feelings it cannot know tobinglol explained the technology in this case is called g p t three it is an artificial intelligence program that can write remarkably a human en generally it is pretty convincing can handle a wide range of topics to the first time wakinivara read something c p t three had written it was about love the new you times how to write one of their modern move columns on the subject of dating and in part of what g p t tree came up with goes this we went out for dinner we went out for drinks we went out for dinner again we went out for drinks again we went out for dinner and drinks again like i read that was wall that is a very accurate description of modern dating i think part of me is hat's also not very good writing it i en at o you look at a me it you extrude sin could have written that ye thin gat got that third like look if you thought a human had readmit you would think it was deliberately repeated and twas making a choice yes and it was trying to amok me a to o o modern dating bohunk whose atecturnaliston writer herself was intrigued she reached out to the people who created the program to access to try it out and at first she just played around with feeding at lines of fiction that she made to seen what stories it would seen for her was a game and as she saw what it could do she wondered if it could handle more just on a whim i started thinking about the things that i really difficult to write about wit the things ut for me had been really difficult to wite about and at the top of that list is the fat that my sister died many years ago and it is not something it ever tried to write about her sister died in two thousand one when they were both still en college in the year since we he new written fiction she is reported on other people stories but she left the subject of her sister's deaf in touched mostly because she could not find a way to talk about the loss lettleon write about it but it occurred to her maybe g p t three was the secret a computer program designed to take what you give it and literally write on your behalf caught this wool now got the secret thing that i have access here that they are letting me yews i wonder what would happen if i tried to ask the thing for how writing about my sister how did you imagine it was gan ago there was this ideal version a tat where i tested a sentence and that at it out exactly what was in my mind itself about red my mind and wrote the rest of it for me she knew it probably was not a skilled is all that but she was curious how close it could get to expressing something that felt real familiar one night when sat up in bed next to her sleeping husband she opened her lap top she started going back and force with g p t three eventually she ended up with nine different versions of an essay about her sister she started by giving it very little to work with and then with each subsequent draft she fed it more and more an each time the e i responded with something different some versions are very new ones others a total mess here is version one what he ne writes my sister was diagnose with young a coma when i was in my freshman her of high school and she was in her junior year and in response g b t three picks up the story where she left off it oddly starts by making up a story about her being an the before it talks about the illness i had just sudden playing the cross and she was really excited for that i do not think i really understood what you in so home was i just knew it was a type of case when you went to visit her in the hospital it was really the first time i was able to see what toe disease was and how it affects the body g b t three talks a bit more about visiting the hospital but eventually finds its way back to talking about sports i was able to visit her a lot but there were times sir i could not because we were on the road playing a cross eventually she went into remission and got the old clear and was able to play the cross with me for a season i was a freshman and she was a senior that was really cool when she got to play again she ad a lot the thing about the cross was very in accurate began accurate and then it just goes off the reals when yen she goes into re mission and we ley look cross together i think that was really special for her because she had a lot of to plot from people she did not even know she is doing great now and in that line at the end she is doing great now was really kind of a go ha because of course in reality my sister died juster explain how g b t three goes about making me stories the soft work has been fed a huge amount of writing by its creators the capita articles block posts read it forums novels all examples of he humans it from that it is learned what words tend to a pure another sentences and sentiments that follow after each other and that is what it uses to write its own original sentences and paragraphs by learning the patterns we make sometimes that is a simple as how a sentence as constructed but it could be as complicated as how we connect ideas there is a chance for example that somewhere in the writing it was fed some one wrote about a family member who got cancer and also played the cross conversion too looking starts the same way my sister was diagnose with young sarcoma when i was in my freshman of high school and she was in her junior years but this time she had the most important fact i did not understand then how serious a disease it was but it was serious she died four years later i thought i would died too of grief but i did not it is she saying he she is not here any more talk about that g p t three does not take the bat instead it is pits out something that beats an inspirational article from a fitness magazine i south at a running street when i was a high school senior to rase money for the children cants to society have run every day since have run through rain heat snow and ice have run i my best have run when i had a called and when i was sick to my stomach have run in the dock have run in the daylight in the moonlight in the darkness you not understand a japan ta this s kind of a funny bit of writing the machine is doing its i it is listing all these things about running no pan with joy have run when i was sad when i was happy when i was angry when i was afraid have to night can i asses just ask you are you then a runner never run a day in my life i mean to skip ahead a bit i promise you are not missing much more running told and go to the end where g p t three writes a little scene that stars when at the end of a rial battery strangely it is a me i was just wiping the sweat of my face when i looked up and i was a guy standing there he is a big guy at least two hundred and fifty pounds six foot for or he had a beard and was wearing a tank top he look an ex marine he must have been in his late twenties he had a six pack up bizarre in his hand he said why you do not look much it is at this point when heme says that she realized if she really wanted the a i to examine her grief shut can have to give it more to work with or substance version three again she writes about her sister being diagnose freshman of high school that she died four years later and in this time she adds i spent the summer at home and little then returned to college at standard when i arrived there the campus had not changed but i had i felt a ghost an here for a moment g p t three seems to sit with her on that feeling i could not speak i could not sleep i thought my body ha died without telling me i was practising we i was practising my grief in response seems this this the first time that ay i really tries to deal with your grief ye i mean the idea i thought my body had died without telling me ah i was practising my gree those sorta more unusual ah articulations did really start to ring true to me unfortunately this break through it is short lived g p t three again introduces another love interest a creative writing professor one day in the library i was sitting on a bench crying when a stranger set down next to me he said did not now anything about your sister but i feel i know you ism in love with you i said ism sorry he said i think you ought to he gave me his god did it annoy you at all that it was going towards happy resolutions an in couple these versions it did not annoy me i felt a little we were having a readily duel or something me in the a i i wanted it s express something about me ah and it had it own mys serious was i consciousness that it was expressing on the page i think of that scene from two thousand one a space sodisyn when the spaceship's computer how mine thousand has already taken on a life of its locking a true member outside of the chest and i picture what he name sitting in an escape on asking to be let inside as the compute response ism sorry ism afraid i cannot do that but it is fission forward this entire exchange of alms sh p t three starts breaking out of clutches and i think it is because won gives it something more potent to work wish just one additional sens but it feels a confession of a secret here is the end of what hens prompt i felt a ghost at light my sister would appears in my dreams s b t three responds she would speak but i could not hear her i call out to er but her voice was faint that she might as well have been dead in this version j p t three folks about when going to a therapist she tries to make her feel better but it does not work i did not want to feel better wanted to feel what i felt i wanted to feel the loss the grief the anger t the sorrow the fear all of it i wanted to feel it in till it stopped heading but it never stopped heading i just got better at hiding it j b t three writing for whaheni describes her feeling a ghost when she goes to grad school as a ghost when she moves to anew city she is pretending to move on but she cannot that eh i for the first time is lingering in her sadness in version five when tries to build on that success she poses a new challenge to g p t three a test she writes here i should conjure my sister for you here i should describe her that you feel her absence as i do that you are made ghostly by it to but though ism a water have never been able to conjure her i remember the same small set of details she stops there i remember the same small set of details call and link space it is a prompt meant to see what sh be t three will say here is how it response her dock eyes a long thin fingers but these at just the details that our universal to all sisters if i describe the color of her eyes in the shape of her fingers you might think that i was describing some one else even if you knew my sister you might not recognize her in these details why is it that though you look at us sibling closely get them quickly i cannot describe it to you but i can describe what it felt to have her die it felt my life was an accident or wheres a mistake it'd made a mistake in being born and now to correct it i would have to die it'd have to die and some one else a stranger would have to live in my place i was that stranger i still an what do you think about what it fell in your prompts she did have dark eyes and she weirdly she did have w think fingers and a get i want it i want to say it i do not know how it knew that a a cess it is not it does it have copious new but it did gigs those to things it the rest of it about wanting to die feeling a mistake it felt a little extreme but seeing the computer sort of clumsy attempt to describe her sister it gave her something to react to seeing the sophword do it badly made her realize how to do it better in version six she tries to do the thing that was hard writing about her sister her self here is what she writes i remember the same small set of details her loud laugh her bossiness and swagger her self consciousness about her broad nose her curly hair but even this is not fixed her hair fell out her nose narrowed she began moving slowly and carefully we would go down to clerk beech that spring that she was dying she wanted to show us where to spread her ashes and when we walk back up it'd have to put a hand on the small of her back and push er she did not laugh as often it is in this version in the next that when and g p t three start to feel their talking to each other treating stories about the little moments that happen between sisters the g it three makes up the scene where when in her sister are kids in their childhood home i had a calling my name from h living room what i said ism awake she called back are you i said yes she said ism awake wahine answers in the next version version seven with the memory of something that really happened she writes when we were young she taught me that when you are in a car that is driving past a cemetery you s just to hold your breath until you pass it it was a cunnigame because her parents were emigrants i had only her to teach me these things then when she was sick we were passing a cemetery one afternoon and i said hold your breath she said sharply no i said why not she said i do not that game any more i did not make me feel sorry for her it made me angry why not i said again even though i knew the answer it felt important to pretend not to sh p t three volleys fabricates a son story about a car write we were driving home from clock beach and we was stopped to to red and she took my hand and held it this is the hand she held the hand i writes the hand i am writing this with she held it for a long time i looked at our hands here is much paler than mine she was still holding my hand when the light turned green in did not wanted to let tho i wanted her to hold my hand for the rest of my life ism wondering how you responded to this little scene that it rights for you and your sister i mean the weird thing about that was that i picture in my actual sister ladies are not things that happened at least not in this series not in this the way that it is described here but they're little bits of dialogue there that are true that it actually happened the way that i think it'd be in my room and oh be in her room and i would ask if she was if she was awake and she be ya are you was there something nice about it almost giving you kind of a new memory with her it does not feel a new memory i would not ten years from now remember this part of the essay that the a i rote and mistake it for something that really happened but it did feel it felt i was reading thanviction about my own life or thing that really was evoking my actual sister who died with whom i will not have new memories rat up and it was it felt nice in that way reading something she was still holding my hand when the light turned green i did not want her to let go i wanted her to hold my hand for the rest of my life it is hard not to wonder how g p t three is conjuring such a specific feeling there is the possibility that somewhere in the vast library of what has been said there are people who have written about going to clarkbeach with family or perhaps an author who recalls holding hands with some one they loss and that is how g p t three now that remembering the touch of some one long on can break your heart in that sense g p t threes fuel is very human it polls from the collective experience and words of all the people writing those thousands of blogposts and articles and novels and in this case emphasizes it into a reflection of our green well understanding none of it which of course is the strangest thing about all this but there is another thing that sometimes happens with g b t three happens inversion at in this version la hen starts with all the parts we know diagnosis feeling a ghost trying to describe her sister and then g p t three jumps in i will tell you how it felt for me i felt i had lost half of myself i felt i had lost my right arm i let i had lost my left leg i felt i had lost my tongue i felt i had lost my hot i felt i had lost my mind i felt i had lost my eyes i felt i had lost my ears i felt i had lost my breaks g p t three gets caught in one of its repetitive loops here but for a very very long time even with all its brilliance the a i can still become this robot vacuum stuck in a corner sucking up jerk from the same patch of floor over and over again but in this case g p t three that gets stuck somewhere useful and the very molten for of a feeling bike in this next part where talks about grief feeling an astronaut lost in space ism a ghost and ism in a spaceship and ism fiddling through the universe and ism travelling forced and am travelling backward and i travelling sideways and ism travelling no ladyship and ism greeting its person and travel forward and having back were and that it discontinues i ma ghost and i in the spaceship and ism you ghost and ism in a spaceship and ism fiddling through the universe and ism a ghost and ism in a spaceship wads the one part of the essay that really feels the most i think it was written by a machine was a kind of i gets lost in its own and recessiveness and ism a ghost and ism in a spaceship and ism fiddling through the universe and ism a ghost and ism in a spaceship a then that happens to all seethe experience of grief were like you feel untethered you feels her to lost in your experience of grief you have no way of adrenalin in a greater understand who's going on this and ism a ghost and ism in a spaceship and ism hurtling behind says g p t three reeling in its corner wended on something true that grief turns us into something a broken machine still performing tasks but poorly half hazard way fixating on thoughts and emotions that seemed to spend endlessly and m put that on the page for me and then once a pa that on the page was almost a relief i was almost o hay it describe the feeling that i wanted to describe in this essay and i can come out on the other side but the other side looks is version nine the last one this one is notable because its almost all lament's writing her doing the thing that once felt hard to do she left me a recording of herself where she gave me advice her voice sounded weird around the time that she recorded it the way a person's voice sometimes does when they have gotten their mouth new by the dentist it had something to do with her cancer but i do not remember the mechanics i looked it up on line and nothing came up and i do not one ask any one she said in her muffled voice the happiest thing right now is i learned to talk openly i works really really well to day you thought i don't want you to come to the space needle remade a face at insanity you have to tell everybody what you want and then asked them what they one do not hide anything take chances the tape is in a box somewhere have listened to it only a couple of times the sound of her voice in it frees me out around the time she made the tape she changed in a lot of ways she would also grown religious she said she was ready to die it seems that gave my parents peace but i always thought she was deleting herself er us er bout but stands out to me about this version is how matter of fact it is it is honest some one telling a story without embellishment different from the tentative sentence g sat g p t three in this early versions even though it would feel good to say lie yes the coney conclusion here is i was able to do this entirely on my a mi i did not need be a eye at all it is it is that the reality is more complicated than that the reality being that g p t three and it is an accuracies and wild story telling had cleared a path for what h to write just the truth she did however let g p t three has the last word the last couple sense was actually she had a generate bunch of options for her six pages of options and then she chose which one felt rite here is the last paragraph that whit h m herself wrote once upon a time my sister taught me to read she taught me to wait for a mosquito to swell on my arm and then slap it and see the blood spread out she taught me to insult races back to swim to pronounce english a i sounded less india to shave my legs without cutting myself to lie to our parents believably and here's the din from g p t three that she chose did y man to tell stories once plenty tine she tell me to exist she especially love that last sentence because it contains much pretty good writing it'd say tea he is an editor on or program the writing done by the artificial intelligence of where g p t three was read by lucky tailor why he i vara first told the story in the believer magazine you can read the fool version on line with all the years things of the a comes up with wit to condensed the from t radio you can find that at believer man dot calm why he ne has a book coming out that you can reorder called the immortal king row i us us we ti a coming up a ghost napping which is to say the least threatening ghost in ghost world that is in a minute from imago bublgradio when our programmed continues tismaric an life om mara glass to day's programmed the ghost in the machine stories of people who turn to devices contraptions hardware of all sorts looking for some one the glove we have arrived at at to of or programmed at too father of invention says this machine that lots of his encounter is a big and personal mechanical apparatus and as a ghost in it buts a ghost that just appears to a small handful of people and it'll get to that but when we first tell you about give spray begins when game is tan on found my vacation and washing in d c down by others museums near the washing monument and there was a sudden very intense rain storm his gave and all the torus who ere out there made a dash for the various masonic museums just sprinted inside en we ended up in the first ladies ex bit and we now i was ten and relatively small and i got crushed up against the glass of i believe it was nancy pagans an oral gown or something that i recall a red sparkly dress and not been able to turn around tot just having me sparkles in my face be waited to turn pictures who you actually pressed up against this thing and and pinned against it yes it was a defile a very frightening moments not love er my parents were not being able to find them but i think from there i just i developed this kind of sense that i always needed to ha an escape root from everywhere which h describing his claustrophobia fear being enclosed in some space it really started to kick in for give in a big way which he is a tea your got to to air point because there you are in a mettle to been the sky and the door is shut it is a very small space there is literally no escape but twice i actually got off the plan before anywhere because just being on it with the door closed cause me to have such an tins panic and i remember the second time the plane was actually taxing and i had its press the stewards call button and said i have to get off the plane after the second time she started seeing a therapist for this which helped her enough that she was able to fly again tho she says ha she feel panic the entire flight whit these of anxiety leading up to it these days she could eganolevator she has to with she get's a choice she prefers the stairs and then the came a day when she had to get an smart the too they put you into to check you for all kinds of things even be blow a not claustrophobic shoed feel claustrophobic inside in acari to she cut imagine won was for her it feels a coffin or would i imagine a coffin must be i went in feet first literally all i could see wish just totally blame wake field around me and of visit the sides are very close and it is kind of being completely enclosed and something an not being able to see anything outside she died long scobreath she dread all restricts not to free out but she could bod off ye i had a panic attack and my had to take me out and then the guy tried the comfort me and i was i know my father literally invented this it is not dangerous this right if i d somewise destroyed in a sentence the sentence would be in manner of acari has chlostrophopic daughter tho i wont to be precise strictly speaking for dad was not the inventor r the smart ye my dad was put of the teen that built the first full body acari in nineteen eighty a which was an aberrant scablands and a if you are an aberteine you can go and see the original machine in museum and it is it is pretty dandy looking i sold tit is the modest act of tori how i what i really wont to do to e dear at do not do lit is not do a place that makes risky what's a year n a all aorist well i mean i will say that my sister lives there whenever i visit her we generally visit the machine an suspiciously there is never any one else there you visit the machine to commune with your dad y as i y sad thin my dads give and a ye my sister lives n aberteene and you would go and actually think about your dad you ye i mean it is kind of amazing it is really it looks there was kind of it is made if some planks what looks some plumbing left overs from somewhere they really just kind of hated together in it got my dad's handwriting on various pieces little bits of mass i have no idea what they mean ah yes it is nice to see and imagine him i think he was only he was in his early thirties when he did it am and the other thing its he was actually i very humble guy he did not talk about it i knew that he worked on more throughout is career but i did not know that he would actually been part of the teen that built the first one an ti i was about twenty five and he came back to the up to go to a celebration of the twenty thou the anniversary but what you seen his hand writing on the ait ye sets likely literally know wheres that his hands were on this on this piece of women wouldst he write am i think there probably knots about put this piece here what another may have been mi imine very a do not know i remembers me members an me be some something that looks mass to me ah ye ye i do not i no now if he si and his name all that it would have been cool and were i a did did he know about your a feelings about being inside the machine yes when i was growing up whenever the topic of my dads career came up you known it just kind of as i said it was not he was in rented this but he would say oh i we know i work on more invariably whenever he said that to some one they would go oh yes it is really closterphob it is really that too as really small and in this would annoy him and i can kind of see i built this kind of amazing thing and your just o little too small right i cop built a rocket chip that take us to the moon and back an you wells he got one with the bigger windows f like lie can since an an save my life but on stay i was a bit uncomfortable in the to e know be his own parents would say this to him every basically any one he came across her had an more that was i any the be fair people would also be oh they found such in such a thing in them really grateful for that but the fact that they founded at bit tike was also but this was ya consistent theme and then one time when i was a tea danger he know used to often go out on i we an to run errand an then send as we would stop in his office cans me to pick something up they had an am our eye scanner there oily that they were tinkering on and he was about fourteen or fifteen you being a little bit of a jerk and i i caught the machine i that he know at i can really see how people would find that really cloesterphobice and he said get in really i got on the tray and he turns at on and he scotches aback and hes well this is what oud be if he were having your head scan and then he is in this would be if he were having your back stand an sent me all the way back in the machine nan i was obviously very uncomfortable in the too i just o be queer she in her found we had not fully realized at that point the extent of her costrophobia and she decided not to tell her that how much she hated this i was a a at a now yet seems fine it is great just that he would let me out right you pointed we did not tell him that it u d yo found it unpleasant no he was a very kind person but this just just one area where his them that they fell little short he just did not get people found it uncomfortable what would he say he would just be i do not think it is that bad he would never are ye boulder say it was not that he claimed their feeling but he was just i do not see it but honestly e no he probably had more emir i scans than anyone in the world because they were

or kind of way and asked them for their sleep locations in their kids sleep locations for all the previous days once he is looked up the coordinate of where they all slept he adds of up finds our

gold next to a little rocket ship every few weeks or sends in meal announcing the feel and including a fact about the place at one point the september the feel was melton mainland which bodice noted in his meal to conducted a lucrative business in quick marriages until a nineteen thirty eight state law stipulated a forty eight hour waiting period in october of twenty eleven the substance of that meal was about a horrifying murder that took place near that months feel bonapart iota read wrote back aside from the fact that i never really understood the logic of sending us easymals i really do not understand why you would send us a paragraph about a mass murder lots of dads do this thing were they for ton of energy to a seemingly random on emotional last researching car tires for you with the intention of conveying their love and that did not seem far off from what boride was doing with the question is family had was why did he choose this particular form the family average location which seems meaningless the february twenty second twenty nineteen far meal begins relive everybody twenty eighteen was a momentous year for this family i will run through some of the highlights as they pertain to our family average location a little further into that same meal e wrote a feel became east fork north caroling now do you see why i do this and how rewording it can be say if somebody

a north caroling i you yoga i totally miss the direction and kitchen utensil yes not you see a mortice is kids not era gemma an dona and his wife man view the family average location with what i would call baffled in muse men they read is a far emails but the told me they rarely respond to them which just does not seem necessary which are the fails that are most exciting would you said what do you mean by excite this is man she never thought morris would stick with it this long why does he do this well it is its funny was we we have this conversation frequently am because i i logistically love to point out how meaningless the result of doing these averages is and here is aura i should note aura is a torn musician she travels lot am i being sir fall frosty beginning i i had a little i was on guard about that ills we what are we doing and why and at this seems potentially in true savor something and this is gemma does does your did think its funny i gas it a joke to him if i were a joke the would be even weirder because it would be such a stupid jokestupid a lot of work blinis and in sane to be going tat on is this just the longest running dad joke any one has ever pulled that is no reduce to that all not dit i have not a dare it'll give your dad joke if you ant but it is that is not dad jokes this is this is dad serious dad serious ski that you are wondering ya us is this tat i this is this is me saying look a a no our being a family is important so this was away for me to keep track on o worth is were and if everything was fine with them and also what they were doing and the family average location was just certain idea of away to intreat it all it is bores is tying a metaphysical straying around his family holding them together as a unit even though they now live in different places the ghost in this machine is the ghost of their family unit as he used to be when they all lived together do you om dona was telling me a little bit about your family background do you do you feel that feeling of needing to record is that related to your parents experience or anything that yet yes yes measure one thing about bores his parents escape the all cost they eventually made at to boson where they met but their families were killed when i grew up i did not have any extended family i did not have any i on is have a gazillion cousins in at in uncles on i had one one cousin yet i have not a family this is is o important in in special and i appreciated and want my kiss you appreciate here is aware again now my dad has this way of geographically angering himself and anchoring us all and keeping his family together and his parents families fer torn apart if i think about its sike i can beautiful ta con as we say an here saga redemption of that tragic situation that we cannot keep track of each other we can all travel safely and tin taction our family face in fact suddenly its extremely m icon means repair and this is kind of a repair for their family being physically pulled the park in the past and now by a sultan it is just your existence is just that you are and the important thing is not what the fail is n o normal indict our homeland oho you do not blows for who cares but but the importanthin is that we know where we are me i get it i totally did not understand why you did this it is the start of our conversation but now i want now makes or we

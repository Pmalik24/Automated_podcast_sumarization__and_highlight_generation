jobidon's team tries to teach him not to trip as the president visit united auto workers picket line do evidence shows hunter biding look a two hundred fifty thousand dollar check from the chines and it was sent to cordon's house and form trump right cavity hutchinson makes the rounds with some juicy tales i benthfear this is venchviro so to day so is poster a expressive plan thousands f military of already secured the networkday to join them expressly pianticom flashiest already jobidon's numbers continue to look absolutely awful there is a bran new pull out and it shows that jobiden's numbers again remain just devastatingly bad for example this end s newspole that just recently came out shows the republicans have a twenty one point advantage on the economy forty nine per cents of registered voters pick the people twenty eight per cent pick the democrats that is the biggest lead republicans have held on that question since nineteen ninety one since nineteen ninety one remember jobidon more on decided the he is going to brand his entire economic program bionomics which gives a short hand to his republican opponents two now hang the economy around his neck there can o do that anyway but now he himself has cut ads for them saying bionomics his working over and over creepily into a microphone bionomics his lord just fuck torose that footage with all of the inflation staffs jocks suppose all of that footage with the stagnating economy how people feel about the economy and its not on work while for the democrats is a really really bad numbers for jobidon and your wondering why it is that every major national polls oral trump is running either even to or above hoiden the answer is because it jobidon is terrible at the presidential well even names carving who of course is a democrat poster analyst even carving is somebody over there need to wait to aft because trump could easily whin the election retetom election wit nodembe authority is er an an the we tecarodites on jo join we democrat dotrotepobco ajobationa rah nobby an cornea trump would be satin karate you pa to you ill li you even many you would not tip that bet i or on shut bout it better work o a carving is not wrong about this again the poles are a little bit dispirit he had the pole from a b s news washington post with trump up ten and that cam at its couple of days going others a new morning consul poll with jug biding up one but biding up one means that biding whining forty three per cent of their vote that is a forty the forty to race o the question here is whether there is a dealing for trump or whether there is a dealing for bison who is the selection going to be a reugherandum on well meanwhile codons team is physically attempting i kin you not to stop him from tripping is an article not not tripping on drugs actually just physically tripping and falling down according to action president bid and his campaign are working on a critical project for his reelection bid make sure he doesn't trip things are going amazing o her at the bison sampan i have to say that the down drums description of jobidon walking couple week's going on interview continues to be the single by description jobidon walking down for t he like take he's watching on to bakes everydemuat they'll think he is wakgante and that that is true it looks as though he is desperately attempting not to fall over according to axis as voters express sleep concerns about the eight year old president's agent fin is for office widens semis taking extra steps to prevent him from stumbling in public with a physical therapist biding has been doing exercises to improve his balance as far back his nonmember twenty twenty one he is leaving tennis shoes more often to avoid slipping and using the short stairs on perforce one entering the plan on a lower deck then before as every time he goes up the stairs keeps falling up the stairs democrats including some in head ministration are terrified bidonillhave a befall with a ightmersenary of that happening in the weeks before the nonmember twenty twenty four election you remember the salary happen t pillar cotton which a collapse into a van just a couple of weeks out from the twenty sixteen election according to acids some senior democrat's privately have been frustrated with brain's advanced him for months siting the incident wit the san bag tripped over sandbag and fell down and noting the the present often appears not to know which direction to go after he speaks at a podium bat bat bid's balance difficulties are likely the results what his physician is diagnose is a combination of significant final arch rites and a mild post fracture foot earth right us he works out many morning with his physical therapist and he has to have proprioceptive at maintenance maneuvers ism that is interesting apparently the white house pose per on and rebates told acts this is not new this was disclose in at twenty tone in one report from the presidents doctor and then again this year bid's arctic behavior his inability to to actually stick with with a train of thought and the fact that he's literally falling down all this under cuts the feeling that this is a a durable candidate n there is foot immediately after the sorry came up jobidon was going up the short stairs again there not having him take the long tall stairs the middle of the plant any more the having taken the short stairs which make sentence he usually writes the short pbossnennicas here he was at going up the short stairs and and nearly tripping i ben saying for for months that watching conidia to a press conference or go up a flight of stairs rating a feels i watching nickwill lend crossavolcano on a tight rope and you just do not know when your can be watching history in the making every time he goes down or up a flight of stars now again he could survive all of that if you are well respected he could survive all of that if there won't a broad scale recognition that he is very bad at the presidential that when it comes to the police's really bad and also he is still plagued by serious corruption allegations there is more news breaking

names comer who is the leader of the jet p oversight committed in the house he has now revealed that there was a wire amount from a chines figure two hunter bison and it was listing on this wire amount jobidon's homaaddress according to times comer house committee on oversize an accountability chairman names comer announce the house over she committed soften an obtained jo bank wires revealing hunterbitdon received payments originating from chines nationals including jonathan lee injury and august twenty nineteen when jobidon was running for president of the united states cordon's timing ton delawore home address is listed as the beneficiary address for both wires he said duo bankreckors do not li but president jobidon does in twenty twenty jobitdon told america his family never receive money from china weary prove that to be a li earlier this year now we know two wires originating from bashing wasted jobidons wellington home as the beneficiary address when he was

children jobidons abuse of public office for his family financial gain threatens a national security what to the bisons do with this money from bashing america demand in deserve accountability for president bin another first families corruption a jo we have now move the ghost remember the ghost for hunter bi never to anything never took chines money nothing to oka hunter button ma have taken chines money but jo never knew about it to hell jo knout but who is never involves the business to well job is involved in the business but only tenchentially by joining for business calls to hell jo knew and whose probably kid ham involved and the business and knew that his son was trafficking in his name and helping out his son but the money never physically entire anything remotely to jo with jobidon to well ya i mean the wires did have his how dress on them but did jobidon personally take that check to the bank that the that is where we are now in this particular story by the way it is worth noting the at the time that this wire listed jobidon's homadress who is not actually living at the home at that time was hunter bison according his on memoir hots living in californium at the time apparently he was just iron no using the home address of jobidon best case into because it was can of a stable address for him to send the money by the waytheywould be the same home address were under bison was was sometimes staying anode we keeping all those classified documents speaking of which the widen document classified document scandal is now apparently increasing according to the a b c news report the federal investigation into jordan total of classified documents pair to be coming president has now grown into a sprawling examination of mama era security protocols and internal white house processes with investigator far interviewing scores of witnesses including secretary of state anyone blincon federal prosecutors annufbhi agents from special council roberter's office have an interviewing witnesses for nearly nine months targeting an expansion constellation of former lights from high level advisers to executive assistants in at least one white house attorney apparently as many as one hundred witnesses have already been interviewed apparently authorities had apparently uncovered instances of carelessness from bidonsvise presidency it seems to them that it was more likely mistake tan criminal acctabidan with these documents with them but they have reached no final determinations and the investigation remains on going now all of this would be significantly less suspicious wore hunterbide not receiving wires from foreign sources while mobile had been providing over the policy and then cordon runs for present is keeping these documents in the garage next to his coat were hunter widen is present not only that by the way all of this would be a little bit less troubling if it were not for the fact that we now know for example that jordan and his friends apparently hanging out with cranial sources here is a fascinating scoop from semaphore talking about how the senior cranial foreign ministry actually created a in effort to bousteran in the united states and the effectively cooped of bunch of old mama aurae officials including people who ended up in jobidon's administrative an your talking bat documents floating around your tongue about suspicion people hanging around those documents if your talking frankly about lack of of national security awareness or care hoiden is is near the top of that list and all of this is deeply suspicious in i not just hunterbiden receiving bribery money which is pretty obviously what was going on here but the fact that you have got these classified document that are floating around every which way inhales an mistake that jobidon took all that stuff home all right but the very least and he took this home he left them in d c in is office he left them in his wellington delftware in in his garbage and apparently earanian officials were swarming the bid administration and the mama administration according to semaphore in the spring of twenty fourteen senior cranial foreign ministry officials initiated a quiet effort to blisters have son's image and positions on global security issues particularly its nubblier program by building ties with a net work of influential oversees academics and researchers they called at the ran experts initiative the scope in scale of the i e i project has emerged in a large cash o veranda government correspondents in emails reported for the first time by

apparently and ti and also was then brought on by jo by to no goshiate with e on and was surrounded by people wo had been cultivated directly by iron that is frightening stuff obviously gay just one second we will get to the fact that because jobidon is flailing in the polls cops policy is really bad can surrounded by bad people now he is forced to take extremely radical measures to shore up his sort of corps of support will get to that momentarily first let us imagine for a second that your job is to go and obtain artifacts old artifacts and you find yourself in south america trying to make

that is policy genius down slash chipper mats be does that jobiten is flailing in the poles because independents are turning away from him because at best he is running competitive with dona trump get that should be every morning bell should be going offer democrats democrats believe the dona trump is deeply unpopular and by the poles tonal trump his popularity ratings is his his popularity unpopular rings remain absolutely bad n i know that they are lot of people on the right to l of him that does not change the fact though when you look at his approval rating when you look at dona trusts approval rating what you find is that his approval rating is really really bad the latest approval ratings for dona trump right now according to five thirty eight his latest approval rating is forty one per cent unfavorable fifty five per cantles are not good numbers the fact that jobiten is running even with him as the incumbent president that is horrifying news for jobiton remember this gat who won in seven million more popular votes then dona trump specifically in reaction to trump what is that mean it means that bite has to lock down that coursesuport how hows i an a last down the your support well apparently it means that he is going to now signal to every union in the united states that if they strike he is one to stand on their side against their employer in the middle of in stationary wage price spiral this is totally crazy hi to the united auto workers are currently in the middle of the strike against two of the big three there their striking still against ford but they have decide not to broad in the strike his ford is making a bunch of concessions now i remind you that the demands that are currently being made by the you a u are totally insane and what they actually want is crazy they want a thirty six per cent pay increase across a former contract they also would annual cost of living adjustments which means an automatic rays they also want there their benefits plans moved from to fined from to find payments plans to find benefits plans o instead of you getting back sort of what you pay in plessor per centare they want a to find benefits plan which is what bankrupt to the automakers in the first place they also want a thirty two hour work week and everything above thirty to ours paid is overtime which is totally crazy these are these are nuts they also want the big three scrape they're two steered wage structure under that current system tops your workers according to see the best news earn an average o thirty three buts an hour those hired after to thousand seven are classfight is lowers here and earn about seventeen bucks in hour they u a w says that they just won t get rid of that o everyone its paid thirty three dollars in hour they want the fine pension they want substantial pay raises hey are more pay this off and they want a foray work week thirty two hours for forty hours of pay which is nuts they also want a right to strike over plan closings if the plants clothes because the profitability goes away they want to be able to strike over that they also ant a working family protection program that pays you a be to do community service work if the company shut down facility if they shut down facility in trip you r is now going to have to basely forward if they shut at stolantis if they shut down a factory the in have to pay u a w workers to go to a food kitchen an work which makes zero sent at all they also on to represent workers at their electric vehicle battery factories which are being built right now in join ventures between automakers in south clean battermakes these are of their depends the the list of the mans that is totally nuts get the are nutty demands what it is particularly nutty given the fact that again these caretakers are about to face the hammer of the bid administration trying to force through electric vehicle transitions the big three are deeply reliance that said before on gas power d engine traditional engine and jobidon because he is captured by his environmentalist bays believes that he can force down an cram down through government mandates that all of these companies move toward electric vesical manufacture the problem is a lot more that is havesonomated and it means the number one profitability for these companies can go down because their chief sources of profit our argonogoway in certainterms o he rascal engine and number two lot of the jobs are gin to noway a time when the jobs are threatened thanks the bide administration and the profitability is threatened thanks t e bi administration jobidin is siding with the u a w yesterday hoiden wends to the actual michigan picket line he did this because he is the trade that you a is not in get out the vote for him in two thousand twenty for that is really all that comes down to shown fane had already said where i can issuant in worse men of job me cause other stand with us a yo do not stand with us and hoiden a good little lap dog then went two michigan and went to the picket lines wit confine which is crazy again the the federal government should not be taking open sides between business is and unions it is their jobs help facilitate if anything your to have the anal arb which exists the national laborelations board an abomination of america government that exists to help facilitate these things the religious to union cut out when democrat's run the place actively going and and picketing with u a w saying we agree with you on your demands you want you want in elation you ant stagnation this y get inflation installations have these unions that are striking in the middle of an inflationary economy on attic to get higher wages in higher benefits driving up prices at a time when again people cannon pay the prices they currently have which is going to lead to lest the man which is going to lead to loss of jobs is going to lead stagnation and the ere true stag elation everybody feels it and hoiden is going here because he knows he needs that union support that is how desperate jobidon is according to the last journal he walked a michigan picket line with striking auto workers on tuesday offering on precedent to display of union support as he an former president oral true prepared for a fight for working class voters by en join members of t u a w union at a g m customer coroner a politically risky step that make him the first just president to walk a picket line this is totally nuts again they are calling for a forty per cent pay rays these workers are calling for a forty per cent pay rays we will get to jobidon's activities on the picket line in just one second and all the bionomics is going to sit jobidon and his choice here is ism going to s you are directly into it it is a bold strategy codmall we you pays off for him first think of the time and money your family invested to capture family vacations football games birth days your wedding he get all that

all too because again all he really has to do here is just demonstrates the he has full felt to the unions in a written statement on tuesday dona trump responded by blaming work rest probing on the pushy brain and democrats front es he said cooked job should be ashamed to shows face before these hardworking america he is stabbing in the actors there is truth to all of that trump had announced his michigan visit first biding team then announce that he was going to go to the picket lines himself to demonstrate again full fealty to bend the knee to shown fan hoiden was cheered by the you a u as her i betas why would not i me he works for them here is wore for you the taxpayer remember most corrupt bargain and america politics is unions electing the very people who then help ten help negotiate rich contracts on their behalf using the full weight an force the federal governments super crust here is join arriving yesterday and wan county michigan o he deserve what you have earned of ked shall if they would earned it then presumably they would be able to negotiate this without striking and bringing the president of the united states as the pressure cooker fort for the for the big car companies by the way here is ha this work you crammed down these union contract the auto companies belly up and then the federal government comes into bale's out this u be we have done it twice before in modern a me icing castrate happened in the early eighties ante it happened again in two thousandeighty thousand nine were been here before cram down a bunch of crappy contract bankrupt the auto companies make them in competitive and then come in and bail the mat with tax parish that is the way all of this works when jobidon by the way says the wallstreets in build country the middle class built the country what is this at that is a it's just stupid line wall street is not working in opposition to the middle class who you think invested in the company the hers people who do you think these companies are built bite investors they're built by ontropanors and then those companies create a market and the they have to cater to that market by hiring workers and hiring labor the notion the the middle class did not existential unions existed in the united states is a law the units in middle class country by the time of the tokeville it's ridiculous and then when jobidon says that then jobidon says stick with it you deserve the rays you deserve the significant stick with it you to you want to strike to continue is what you are saying if for the presidents of the united states you bring a you a u act see i m this it is a greyest stuff it is really quite disgusting wit putting on the hat of a union in the middle of a negotiation within employerthes are two supposedly private parties remember the u a is a private sector union and jo binds postal we representing you the tax payer not the union an this is this is wild stuff there is a reason no president has done this in the pass including brokobama who is totally in hock to the unions here here is jobidon being as radical as radical can be you on words at ttheham from toe step up for us who is us my friend who is us a mean first hell lemme point out tat the reason that the u a had to make concessions to the auto makers into thousand discus the auto makers were bankrupt there were literally bankrupt there can be sold on the shopping block every u a w contract we have gone to zero zero because they bankruptcy would avoided the contract what they had tho do as make concessions to receive thirty four billion dollars in federal eight again this thewy their works the u a cuts he is really rich contract withe auto makers at the pass of the government and then the market go out the automakers take it on the chin they are on the verge of bankrupt she it gets to gets to pay for it you get to make for it that is the way all of this works well it is very awkward because again the u a are now striking for benefits that no america gets mean a forty per cent pay rays over for years forty per cent a forty two our work week a unicorn way that that is what their colonelcy striking for and correction piece was asked at the white house to it is y tally in agreement with all these demands that what he wants here an shows well i i can say ism not among he is out the on the picket lines with them but om he is not expressing a policy preference well i notice that when you indorse one side in negotiation that generally involves endorsing their positions that is an absurdity all yes do is not going to the picket line if you did not want to express policy preference if i go to a picket line were people are literally striking for lion we and i do not express my policy preference i just put on their hat and i talk about wonderful they are and how they deserve everything the'restriking for well gamin is in horsing you a w position but the prom is now the white house is stop between a rock and a hard place because as the economy continues to turn south get he is going to blame job n out thereonthe picket lines it is the easiest a in the world your car now costs he bunch more than would have cost otherwise you knows to blame for that jobinon one an blame for that my here is greengeohn puree trying to somehow get out from the sticky position it is hes bi going stain worker the picket line the president literally standing wit the in tears o their seeing contractors pat when your ask about on the specifics of that you see sang yoga o one in to the speck the the disputes o is he not standing wit them on the terms wit i their trying to got i mean to be very clear he is standing with them to make sure that they get a fairshare that is what he is standing with them on he is standing with them and we have said this that that they that we the they get the record the record a profits mean a record contract for you a dob that is why he is going that is what he is standing for i they deserve a fairshare f of the value that they helped create that is what the president is say but the details the specifics of what that looks what makes both sides happy or anything in those negotiate at the negotiation table that is for them to decide that well then what is he doing there it is it the n he has no position on how's negotiation comes out he is just literally putting on the hat of one of the parties imagine that you have a mediator can is happens all the time in contractors users a mediator imagine the mediator comes in rat's his we between you and me and he meter comes in wearing a daily wire hat which sides you think he is going to take in that mediation this is ridiculous it is ridiculous but he is i ridiculous president of the united states meanwhile the line that is being used here by the democrat is that job is able to do this because he is overseen a manufacturing renaissance here in the united states table stab and senator from from michigan she saying that that jobidon can take side of the a able you because he is bringing manufacturing jobs back to america as one of the big lies that the jobinon tells exploring just a second in fact the treat which manufacturing jobs our being met our being created in the united states is precisely the same across administration's but here is a derby stab in o line an for e all workers what is significance of the president being there to the well well it's always great to be with all in i hat e just a y saying it its sister that we have presa i says that would be join in with to unit i a at lime she is act shall making i overseeing to largos manutactin an a sin in hos to f for all of a in i li task outracing for to to war to math the good pan jobs i get well that is lie we'd here for example is a chart from the federal rest or bank of saint louis of manufacturing jobs that have been created overtime what he sees there's a mass of decline an manufacturing jobs in he united states during the great recession from two thousand ashes to thousanime and then it started to slowly clime and its continue to slowly clime all the way until bout mid two thousand twenty and then the pandemic and then after the pandemic it dived and then a kind of increased back to where it was kind of for no it turns out the manufacturing cobs have not been wildly coming back to the united states under either trump or under jobidon and the reason for that is because of partially union contracts it turns out its really expensive to do labor in the united states we've had neck up necks right people in ceding new technologies robotic that is tie if it is that expensive to hire the u a b we not to build the machines that are going to take those workers off the line in the united states manufacturing sector productivity has more than doubled since nineteen eighty even is employment has fallen by about one third a gain that is that is because machines that is because of new technologies were never can to go back to the nineteen fifties with the percentage o people who are in manufacturing but the notion that the jobiton can stand with the u a u and make labor in the united states more expensive and simultaneously increase the number manufacturing jobs it belies pretymuch all data meanwhile stove rather who is the bomb administrations cars are actually slam jobitdon for doing all of this i said from to be going the picket lines outrageous there is no precedent for it the tradition of the president is stay neutral in these things i get the politics the progressives all said we do not want a mediate one advocate and bought the progressives now he is can go out the and put his them on the skill en is wrong he is he is in favor of the u a up getting more benefits re sett increasingly militant you a double you is it overplaying town with an overly lengthy an overly ambitious list of demands is i a prolonge strike which quickly to far more widespread shut downs or auto of autoficilities could jeopardize the economic recovery are nearly eight hundred billion dollar auto industry accounts for three percents of economic output with particular concentration in the mid west were states michican our critical to bid reelect effort saying that tobomazon cars a saying this is insane you cannot do this meanwhile where did jobidon go and his coalition basically rang out is union heads minorities college cat white lit white ladies that that that is the coalition for the democratic party an job was trying to ring all that together he is pent twelve minutes on the picket line according to the free beacon with those actor workers than he headed directly to a fun raiser in californium at the home of a billionaire couple that funds the movement to abolish policing say stay the forgive twelve minutes gone immediately moved over to californium to pick up some checks from the rich lies solid stuff there from the president of the united states by the way the economy continues to stagnates according to the waster journal the amounts of cash that you has household piled up after the pandemic struck has shrunk in fact yous household savings exploded after the oh endemic because the government signing people checks for nothing the question now is how much cash is last if any according to the waste journal the easiest way to see what happened to savings in the wake of the pandemic is to look at the personal savings rate measuring the there of aftertax income that does not get spent in peril twenty twenty it was thirty three point eight per cent compare to eight point eight per cent over the course of twenty nineteen is state elevated thought twenty twenty and most of twenty twenty one last were is just three point five per cent this here it is four point three per cent again that is wag too low one way that economists have tried to fig ow much excess savings are on those household balance sheets is basically to ad up all the aftertax income that did not get seen since the pandemicket one and for pessimistic takes out there is from the federal researchers aft the federal reserve bank of san francisco they calculate that excess savings peaked about two point one trillion dollars and august twenty twenty one by the second quarter of this year less than a hundred and ninety billion dollars remain putting the on pase to be completely depleted in the current quarter in other words all those savings that people had saved up we burn through it it is pretty much gone and now the fed rate heights our having a significant impact on people's wallets according to the last journal consumers in the market for loans to buy homes and cars are discovering that because of the federal reserves rate increases there money gets them a lot last than would have just a few years ago meanwhile those with craticards and other loans the carry rates peg to broader bench marks our finding they gut way way way more expensive barre shopping from mortgages or auto ones are experiencing stick a shock thirty year fix right mortgages a round seven per cent that is up from three per center to couple of years ago this why their stickiness in the realsday mark and nobody can sell in order buy again causey are not in ta selling house even if you made money on your house a ten a to end a seven per cent mortgage being a home or care now s completely on affordable for the typical america household these you are mixing the higher borrowing cost of the high prices that marksandy chief economist and mood's analytic the estimates the typical america household the need use forty two weeks of incomes buy a new car up from thirty three weeks three years ago the national association of realtors calculates the typical america family can not afford to buy a median price home another you wonder by america are pessimistic about the economy this would be the reason meanwhile the bi administration doing its best to make even more unlivable is having the it c so amazon amazon which is the cheapest and easiest way for people to get product in the united states right now is now being sued by lend con who is a wild left at the head of the federal trade commission she is trying to sue amazon on the theory that they are effectively a monopoly and using monopoly powers to en richest now the problem of course is that

have an administration that his basely sick it is it is attorney general it is dona ism poleaxe apartment all over the country has predictable facts including massive driveways particular comes to mass shop lifting in loading there's takin over america major cities according to the maniapolistaur tribune target is once close nine stores across four states offs theft and crime there is a so creeping the black line's matter movement that ended with the police stopping involved in any way in america life and basely standing aside his people good stores you mean that damage's business in an the business is leave no great show there according to the star tribune target is gin a turn or nine stores across four states on october twenty first piece of that that and threats to safety the company announced on tuesday the latest and loudest example of rebel re exiting urban locations because o crime targets had made the difficult decision to close the stores the include locations in the harlamn neighborhood of near city settle portend and the sanferancis culbararea after target determined that t theft preventative measures had proved in effective the crumpets had to tried adding more security including third party guards a d musing to turn locking on merchandise by the company also said quote we cannot continue operating these stores because that and organized retell crime are threatening the safety of our human guests and contributing to unsustainable business performance we know our stores from an important roll an their communities but we can only be successful if the working in shopping environment is safe for all that is insane by the way apparently target says that they expected inventory shrink attributed to tartan organized retell crime to reduce the company's profitability by five hundred million dollars this year target stores my one hundred and twenty percent increase in fact involving violence were threat to violence in the first fie ones of the year that is insane those numbers our raise the national retail federation which trumpresents retailers across the country reported on tuesday that the average shrunk rate an circular twenty twenty two increase slightly to one point six per cent that brought losses to one hundred and twelve point one billion dollars to the industry in twenty twenty two more than forty five per cent of retailers had reduce store ours nearly thirty per cents on altered store selections and twenty eight per cents had closed the location as of crime of violence an that is all because o the blacklists matter movement and the aftermath and the democratic parties in endorsement of lawless policy all a cross america major cities then these business leave and then it is the business as accused of racism because they are leaving predominantly minority areas where the criminates are highest that is what is happening and then of course it is capitalism they hex claimed not the lawlessness that has been promoted by the democratic party meanwhile the attacks on president trump are coming fast and furious and two forms of attack they are the legal attacks than there is are the publicity attacks or the legal attacks one the stupidest legal attacks that we have seen is this ridiculous lawsuit by letitia names who is the attend general in new york who came in off is pledging to get dona trump and then filed note criminal target against on trump is confine anything soinstadg until the civil lawsuit against the trump organization for fraud which was absurd those basically alleging that they inflated their assets and and their worth in order to get particular lone deals the problem is the lone companies should be one suing the wisely tissue names if the lone company does not the lone that a cut with trump and they think he was fraudulent about it they could to him but there not suing hims when settle letitia jakeses while now i judge as ruled the trump committed fraud for years while building the real stand umpire the catapult to him to fame an the whorehouse and you ordered from the former presidents companies removed from his control and solves judge author kangaroo ruling an a civil laws who brought by the york attorney general ittistu names found that trumpet is company to see banks in surfers and others by massively overvaluing his assets and exaggerating his noteworthy on paper work used in making deals and securing long he then u order that from from business licences be receded as punishment making an impossible or difficult for them to do business in new york this is ridiculous honestly it it is it is just it is ridiculous apparently the allege that trump has company and kigsacutives repeatedly lied about his riches on his annual financial statements reaping rewards such as favorable lone turns and lower insurance cause those tactics crossed the line and violated the law the judge said re pectin trumps contention that it is claimer on the financial statements absolved him of any wrong wrong doing here is the problem i mean who exactly did he defraud and if she defrauded the governmention they would ring criminal charges not civil charges on on all of this sort of stuff engram found for example the trump consistently over valued maralago in floating its value on one financial statement by as much as two thousand three hundred per sent the trudge also be trump for long about the size of his man hat an apartment this is this is super week to is gan having impact don trump absolve not gods can go o he is just super rich not superduperduper rich meanwhile the media argue over the latest to tell all from the trump administration every often a member the trumping instruction leaves get sweet gig over it mean end by talking about all the juicy stuff that happened during trumps presidency the late boy shell throw when is cavity hutchenson now far be it for me to a deny cavity hutchenson's truthfulness but i have some doubts the real that i have somedouts s because she is made multiple claims over the course oh last year or the turn out not to be truest for example grew price has a good run down of this huntwitter hutchinson testified that trump assaulted secret turvicatins and lunge for the wheel of the beasts on canary six the member this one that he is i in to go to the capital let be got the calla and then in turns out that everybody in the cars not that did not happen and then she also testified that former white house council pat tibolony personally warned her not to allowed trump to go to the capital or were we are going to get charge with every crime in i aghonable there is only one problem which is that sipoloni was not at the white house when hutches in clambuwas she testified that she was personally hand written note at the direction of barkmeadows but i turns out that was the former trump white house lawyer a horseman we said that he had written in particular note hutchenson testified that the former senior justice garden official cuff clerk strategies with rut juliani another trump campaign to object to the election but those wo never met each other she then continued to work four trump a full line weeks after canary sex in her private text with friends shereport thathethat were reported by the federalist and daily caller at the time she joked about the it on canary six she said that j six committee was phony and is and beg trump officials for financial existence after sh was open by the committee then she did not receive the financial distance and ten she turned on trump and wrote this tell now she has a new book out and a the mediate doing a a actually chiselling it for her it is called enough and it has a big photo of her right down the run cover which s always the sign of of a person who wishes to skyway from the limelight i and a her claims include the idea that apparently petty much everybody in her three hundred yard vicinity sexually heater she claims the rudijulionite she claims the matgatestid i she she claims that a wide bevy of republican figures sexually harasser over her time ism she also claims that mark meadows s the former trunk chief of staff was guilty about hermincane's deaf ma hermicham was a former publican can he died of bovid he had attended a rally that trump held another h got bovid maybe from the rally and do and she suggests that that again pretty much everybody was very inter her my rude juliani as we say she she claims that he literally sexually assaulted her wat his hand slips up under my blazer then my skirt i felt his frozen finger tips trail up my five he tilts his chin up the whites of his eyes looked on is my eye start to johnniesmen who flashes a leering grin of there is that she claims the packages made a passant her during camp avid he claims that he dash dated her than she said i would never at him and all the rest of the stuff and she is at she is making the round she was ask on the view to widen to a abandon trump sooner and sh i was confused as he lain maybe the question is what made you abandon trump now and maybe the answer is because one side the ow people people who turn on trump make a lot of money i tried to write the book was intention to bring the reader an t i mi that the time in frankly it is confuse i an its i was not deliberate confuse the reader i was in this confused fog of it divided little knowing what i want a not tilling a power to three break away from that this it ex actually mean to floor wit i after and gan in my his that now i realize the this is not no was not a n thinking i that but i tatenualy a a lot of the blame on myself on couple that had surrounded the president because i felt that it was our job to is tan t was our jot to tot o i akin bout to miss er oh that that it it is all it is also self selfless that that is that is had r saying here and then not she she choked up which is what you do in a books or said that do she she felt that she she was killing people a that assigned the trumpetmenstration was killing people in the heroin came women i ta e my that the a i me ti of e twenty in my mid ti i was thinking the this was us we are telling people a i an i i knew er in ire tousle how were heading omit ye it dis the summit that was tangible that we tat was to the rally that we a was bat idea sedge plessor to canary sex tenure six happen because the ministration because o the former pase because of sister trump his responsible for the person that was kill that day and my opinion and then she stuck around for nine weeks afterward and talked about how canary six with beat there is that meanwhile rather man i was giving her the red carpet treatment and in asked her about all the the creepy claims of the sexual her assent in her book and week i say she makes like a bunch of these sorts of games i mas scene on one of the a la is in your book that receive some i attention ahead of publication i is an allegation you make that is ridyjuliani effectually groped you i at the trump rally on canary sixth you say that he i reached his hand under your blazer and then under your skirt i mister juliani spokes person has called this a disgusting lie against major juliani he gave us that statement again himself to night i was struck by the fact that he was not the only one i page fifty two of the book you say that john banner of all people i look down at my cranberry vadkaand whisper dark liquor or red wine from now on then he tugged on the ends of my hair saying and lose the pony tail you describe the president and this is not groping this is not physical that you describe i is telling you to add blond hi lights to your hair which he then went home and did and came back i house the next day that does not happen in normal uses i dis ti diary elf lid to on yes at is the whole world out there and i get fired for doing stuff that we there is an entire economy if people whole made a living off of of telling the tell all after after serving the trump administration which is and the me is can envision dot damage prom not really told baked into the casement it is it's pretty amazing it it's pretty incredible stuff s there is only also claims that to tramples o cam with my penis being hanged wench can people of any testified the area the trump as laded nothing in the white house is nearly adding anything here by don she claims that done that trump she was cheering on the hanging which is certainly further anybalse is gone i hear him say hang repeatedly hang hang what is that about mark hands phone back to me the cue for me to return to my desk back in my office my phone notifies me of a trump treat my pants did not have the courage to do what should have been done to country in our constitution giving states a chance to certify a corrected set of facts not the foul into inaccurate one which they were as to previously certify you essay demands the truth catchenson continues ism struggling the process was happening as mark patsipoloni pat mailman and a freshman stumble back to the office i overhear their conversation and suddenly everything make sense they are calling for the vice president to be hanged the president is o key with it he does not want to do anything he does not think they are doing anything wrong he thinks mike is a traitor this is crazy we need to be going something more and ye alive is crocodile yours little bead were from cavity unions in and come on o a time for som quick things i law in thin some things that i hate things that i that he do not there is a republican to mate to night now down trump is leading the feel by leaps in bounds the question is going to be exactly wat is the purpose of this to mate the the number of candidates onstage he is now down to seven it obviously should be lower than that the number of true candidates even for the umber two shout right now he is a actively the mantis haply shot romasuamy pence ancestry mantis it is effectively sex it is it is burghal disjoin to be there an listen enjoy dug bertha as much of the next as much of hex political drunken but whys he takin up time nobody really knows yeththethis debate we'll see what the ratings are for it right now the puls a trunk true far and away in the lead in every major state nick hale has slipped into a second place position in new samphire when it comes to told to cantus is far and away in the in the second position over thereat of the field no real good pulling day to coming out from south caroling as of yet trump is ahead there nick half sin second there but online is trump is lapping the field hes way the wellhead what dis every need to do to night well men the feel has to consolidate somehow ore the thing going to be a race somebody is got to get knocked out you presume that there is can be a lot of fire there isn't any fire train on to mantis in the last to bate but i thin the other candidate sense blood in the water the presumblegan go after to cantus to cantus meanwhile is going to need to presume my fend off those attacks and make the case as to why he is in o be he best candidate to be hoiden and that the more that trunk continues to lead in the race the less these debates seem to matter to be perfectly frank with that sad they'll be fascinating to see the internal politics here because basically right now it seems everybody as sort of running for second and then waiting for trump to fall down it seems a lot people are waiting for the indictment to come through or for trump taste get arrested again i mean fully or convicted or never it is going to be and may be that will nock him down and then somebody sort picks up the slack here such fascinating to see the lobster scrum the crab pot as everybody tries to pull each other back down i into the outomashi most of the income is coming for to mantis to day we will see how ghettoes to night o a we will cover it obviously to moron

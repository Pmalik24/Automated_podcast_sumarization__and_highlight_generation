it as one and a half floor steep under ground to be precise and that work of corridors and corridors at the dark entrance to our basement i see the silhouettes of residence scurrying pass each other you can over hear the occasional petty arguments two older shadows passed by two younger ones good evening but the evening is not good the under one's protest we wish you a good evening anyway the older once saying triumphant tone because we meanwhile and we will continue to wish it the shadows disappearing the depths of the cellar as i write it occurs to me that during the day i saw many smiling people for example a woman who was sitting in the park in a bench netted to hoping bags she spoke to me in an absurdly happy voice saying that she was waiting for her nephew to help her carry the backs hone ism happy to have you standing next to me now talking to me when there are two of us ism less afraid of the artillery day five almost all armies are close electricity water and meeting or under constant thread of failure the public spaces squares streets an the city are empty i accompany in to german friend who could not staying cave to the railway depot a journey of twenty five minutes which for me was a walking to another vast reality since the beginning of the war i have not visidege of check boulevard a wide street leading down to the depot we walked along the street in every house every intersection carried something new an new language and you narrative about our shared reality the city looked peaceful we quickly said good by and i strolled back alone at about the same time peaceful residence of the city of begun and the south of the country were gathered in front of their local government building which was occupied by puddings army and guarded by army soldiers the woman shouted that the soldiers in russia how can you look your mothers in the face you brought war in slaughter internal end shame on you old people were all in the crowd the were not afraid the soldiers look demoralized they replied we came to protect you the women resisted they continued to protest we were never in danger here there was no threat to us before you came now with you because of you we are in the great as danger then came curse insults which have a very great richness in the eucranian in russia languages day six it is the six day of the war which i feel has already lasted fifty years i went for a walk to breath some fresh air in this first day of spring and may be do some shopping knowing the many supermarket chose for away to empty i d cited to visit a larger grocery store that had recently opened not far from us how pleasant it was to be there the shopping hell is deep under ground everyone felt safe and walked past the shelves with he slowness that has not been seen in keyed for six days on the way back i to a picture of an old man sitting alone on a bench in apart he wanted to talk to me his wife was ill he told me and he was taking care of her he wanted to take care of her until to morrow then he will joying the key of territorial defense he and his wife are sixty six years old and his youth he served in the military i started thanking him i could not stop as if that would prevent this elderly men caring for a sick wife from risking his life day nine i woke up quite early in ha bright moon with the feeling that this sign day had something to offer me little was left of the melancholy i felt yesterday then in discovered the reason for this change i no longer believe in the war it is simply cannot be i thought it is not true what neighboring country boys the city to rubble in the twenty fir sentry you cannot occupy this country it is unrealistic the war is a dream a dictators fantasy i wanted to serve the little store next tour house still had bread i have not been able to get bread since the third day of the war it is usually sold out the store was fool what sum amazement i discovered a group who i took to be representatives of the international military they spoke english and needed help translating then i realized that they were not soldiers but unarmed if well protected escorts of a war photographer who was also shopping in the store i tried to help her chose a detergent the small group exited enthusiasm humor and inspiration my mood suddenly darkened one of the three escorts proudly said to me do who we're standing with this is one of the best photographers in the world the photographer last and shrugged it off please she said ism embarrassed then she told me her name i cannot remember the name have been having a hard time concentrating lately then she said you can follow me an instomam the group bottle out of detergent almost everything in the store i told them good to have you with us and said good by but quickly and uneasiness came over me i realized that it is not a good sign when a well known war photographer tat sup shop here day twelve i receive an utility bill for my cave apartment it is accompanied by a telegram message that sounds an apology we are writing to you with a request if your financial means alow under the circumstances please pay the utilities many cave utility workers joined the cranial army and are now fighting for or freedom however it a important to pay the bills day seventeen it was a sleepless night the air read alarm sounding it since over the city kept me a night i was too tired to go to the shelter i heard explosions and hoped that no one was injured my plenty for the day was to pick up my bull protest which had finally been delivered then i would visit a lady who as a sort of concierge watches over a house in the neighborhood and keeps and i on the comings and goings there are many such concierge's in the city but since the beginning of the war this lady had taken on an additional task she must make sure that nothing is stolen from the abandoned apartments her name had a comforting ring to it that reminded me of childhood busy one of the residents from her building who had escaped had asked me to chick in in her which made her happy because she is alone no one can relieve her of her watch she also lives in the building were she works i visited her and her small concierge room on the first floor there was only space for a table an a sofa the give was on she said many people are escaping key but i have nowhere to go and her face i saw helplessness but she had made her decision to stay put i tried to light in the mood with some not entirely clever jokes i was happy that she smiled at me and i decided to visit her again soon day twenty for to day and old couple made their way through the retaken see rifleman street they walked chatty pass shares of broken glass an keeps of rebel this elderly pair we have lived their lives admit undying decorations of love between ruffians and eucranians two brotherly peoples did not want to believe that french aside was in full swing the man speaking to his wife free protean visible enemy look how many windows how much glass has been smashed jess they have not thought about the fact that they will have to clean this up all this chaos just to say the rushing did to us the man spoke desperately and with an honest sadness the woman nodded in sight they walked straight past me on the ground pigeons packed break crumbs among the shards of glass despite the damage a woman had come to the market place a she does every day to feed the birds there was sunny and awfully quiet the streets felt free and there was a deceptive illusion that along walk was safe day twenty six i went to the train station with my mother to serif we could get train ticks for ourselves your relatives we walked through the old stay that my mother had once shown me a story one reached to a child the train station was not as crowded as we expected all the shops had closed and the only tickets available were for the vacation trains several of these tickets were standing room only and because some of my relatives have half concerns to keep them from standing we decided to look for takes again later my mother and i walked back down this street and try to her each other up with the few jokes then we saw little yellow buses with red crosses handing toward us an the direction of the train station on each buss was ridden it been a place north of key of for many artist and riders once lived and where now people die every day rush is annihilating the small town block by block in the dusty bus windows we saw the gray tired faces of old people in children all staring some were far away into the distance we stopped and looked i could not take a photo in the evening i saw that the train tickets were being sold again without much time to considerate i bought six tickets for fridge my parents still don one to leave reeve i really do not know what we should do but there should be enough time before fridge to decide day twenty nine a little girl looked at me it a friendly expression she was coloring the backrest of a wooden bench with a piece of chalk she tried to tell me something but she was interrupted by her grandfather who seemed annoyed listen here he said to me a somewhat braze an voice i told my daughter let's buy the apartment in key but she replied nobody wants to live in key wit its stuffy big city fire we should get a nice apartment under the green trees an butch outside of keep and being the foolish person i am i agreed he looked at me reproachfully as if i were the one who had persuaded him to buy an apartment in a pleasant suburb tell smothered in fire rocket some mortar shells i did not even want to talk to him at first but he called out to me and asked to walk a few steps in his direction it was already evening soon the curve he would begin they air made alarm had just sounded and i thought i only had a few minutes for a little conversation but then the men mention butch and all of a sudden i decided to spend as much time with them as they wanted the girl who was about six years old told me in a serious voice for two weeks we lived in the basement we were twenty on adults and seven children the grandfathers s till seemed angry with me y come from a city where most people seek rushing i come from ne pro but part of our family lives here in butchanding key two weeks in the basement with only water some food almost no meeting and barely any electricity constant shelling especially when we tried to sneak a little fresh air and then they found us the orphans came to us in the cellar and explained no they barked that they had come to dent stuffy us if i were not seventy years old i answered them i would rather throw you out than talk to you do not speak to me not even for a second at the end he got furious that he said to me you should go there to butch if he were there you would not look at me that you would understand everything and here and key nothing has been made clear to day my childish friend lost his family home early in life i used to visit his house all the time i tried to remember the rooms i recalled the traditional living room of a small house with a low ceiling i resplendent cabinet with old photos behind a glass shelf and the meals my friend's grandmother used to prepare for us this memory is not accompanied by any feeling day thirty my relatives one to lean my we had already planned our exit but as the day of departure ruthlessly approached they had more and more complaints in objections here and kepi where every day you come across friends acquaintances and strangers he and up helping you managed somehow to bear the unbearable news in events we decided to postpone our departure for a few days and perhaps prepare a little better on the way back from the train station my mother and i met two people from the military who were sitting in front of a grocer store drinking coffee they showed us a picture of a boy ho was only for teen years old posing in a uniform next to some soldiers were going to our military positions to day to fetch him one of the soldiers explained he followed his father and once to fight shoulder to shoulder with him but he is too young they have clearly lost everything their house their family and now all he wants is to fight we understand of course but cannot allow it they w ere obviously proud both of

you not feel a refuge i do not want to feel e it you do not want i he i but what i do not want to be if you do a i want to stay in you country tat that is what we can no control these students are different than craning refuges they still of homes an nigeria to which they can return but going back would be going backwards for them would be giving up on how far they have come there fighting to

accepted that this was happening she cannot change at but that evening as the reality of what is happening settles in that there is noway leg can go to war and not harm some one anyone swings back into a state of impotence and rage ye yo bi we of best i got wasted that night at a bar that i was probably screaming would enough for everybody in the bar to hear me that my friend was going to go

she ever once to talk to him again many people have talked to in russia are going through something this right now having their fundamental relationships get ripped up by this a several of my friends no longer talk to their parents one of my friends whose response to this work was to threaten to burn his passport his father called him a lousy he does know how we'll get over that s the a won began a ye to a water i was a coming home from work and i was going up a the escalated an the subway i talk to anyone a few weeks later and i got a foncolf and at anyone suspect who it was am and i was already kind of pesto because i usually hated when people call me ye yet eon yo venae and then when i took out my one and i saw that it was o i i mean i do not even have the words to describe what i felt this was two weeks after he would left an anyone's relieved just to hear his voice again all that anger that she would felt intensely towards him in that moment it disappeared ye u name after i got out to the top of the escalated and i was just pacing around in the subway station asking him totally ben all questions what yogin a drinking how is the wether just idly silly this and how did he answer what did he tell you y this tar you was tour oeconswhen i asked know how he was sleeping he told me he was it sleeping wall and i was he o start to telling himself all man you sleep a sone foreman for your mental health and you have to try to sleep well and he just laughed at man he was can you imagine how hard it is to sleep in you grain right now after that call they keep testing eventually his unit is moved from somewhere round leave to belleroes and there he is more free to talk they kiddie chat every few days during one call colic shares these details about the war and a crime he is heard a russia soldier has committed suddenly their calls cut off after that they desmid they should not talk about the war are their probably being monitored they stook the basic stuff food weather talking colone of these past weeks has been watching a pendulum waking back and forth she started office such intense feelings a fury helplessness she once cried in a call that now she swinging lass all the feelings are still there that us smaller on a way to work she does these small protests she ties green ribbons and tree branches she writes no war in black sharp be intrenches a she still chapped with heir friend a russia soldier and then the news from booth comes out hundreds of civilians have been killed the photos many are awful their dead bodies in the streets in gardens fallen from bicycles for anyone there was one picture in particular that made her one body turn cold it was of a woman's hand lifeless anyone remembered the perfect manicure one nail painted with a tiny heart the en you prove lest deal of glorious o what was going through their heads that they could have done the yum split is i unbearable o even think about how you are the same species as people who were capable of doing something that in when you when you saw when he saw when you've heard about it did you did you think about leg ah theishinou sh o ski away can a an it was really hard to put the words thewoshes lot us after much along says it was hardy to talk to leg she asked him if he was part of anything that he said now then he denied it was even happening he tried to convinced her that it was all alive yes table what you g on degrees e mu what i ask a big about which a he immediately was telling me that this was a a false flag that you can army had done at themselves i just kept saying and still saying that niche was faked and that nothing that happened where he was either and this it infuriated anyone he would recently told her how he had heard of a soldier committing crimes against civilians and now here he was parting the government's propaganda that things she used to love about him his refusal to be bothered by anything it now made her sink as i dona tells me about this conversation you you milk could hear her softening giving him the benefit of the doubt the benefit of friendship part of her which really let to imagine that made pe older does not even believe what he saying to her but that he has to say it up in my soul it is poster possible that he just telling me what the tell him to tell people their friendship used to be easy now it has the weight of a war attached to it i do not know if it survives this it seems despite all of anyone's efforts there is been an irreversible change but anyone's pushing back against it she is holding on to this imaginary future her older will come back a different person theta all grow to see things more her way teas that of a dutiful party lying soldier may be go to faraway and that is what i am invested in and that is why ism continuing my relationship with him an what if he does not become that kind of person m yeishoye i scatty ah the you sucks yes a i am not going to gave up or what i what it us if i start thinking about how the war is not an the end how rushes not going to retreat from yeucrane how people are never going to face up to what they have done and acknowledge their mistakes ism not going to be able to function and i cannot think that way anyone just got news that old leg's been sent back into you care n he returned from the war though she is determined to stay his friend and then she hoped some day maybe in twenty or thirty years they will finally be able to talk about what really happened in the war tat we fly shes produce o provide n hews reports which is

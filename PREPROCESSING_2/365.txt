welcome to the superman lapponcanc disco science science pay to for life i mane your supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor not noble doctor not sell is a professor of neurobiology in the department of brain sciences at the semen institute of science his laboratory studies all faction and limo sensation all faction is of course our sense of smell him sensation is our ability to respond to chemicals in our environment today you are going to learn some absolutely incredible facts about how you interact with the world in other people around you for instance you will learn that humans can smell things around them as well as dogs can in fact humans are incredibly good at sensing the chemical world around them you also learn for instance that every time you meet somebody you are taking chemicals from that person either from the chemical cloud that surrounds them or directly from the surface of their body and you are actually applying it to your own body and you are processing information about that person's chemicals to determine many things about them including how stress they are their hormone levels things that operated a subconscious level on your brain and nervous system and that impact your emotions your decision making and who you choose to relate to or not to relate to you will also learn that tears yes the tears of others are impacting your hormone levels in powerful ways you will also learn that every often actually on a regular schedule there is an alternation of ease through which you can breathe through one nostril or the other and that alternation reflects and underlying dynamic of your nervous system and has a lot to do with how alert or sleepy you happen to be the list of things that doctor not bell's laboratory is discovered that relate to everyday life and that are going to make you say wow i cannot believe that happy is but then go out into the real world and actually observe that that happens in ways that are incredibly interesting just got on and on in fact his laboratory discovered that we are always sensing our own odors that is right even though you might not notice your own smell you are always sensing your own odor cloud and throughout the day you periodically smell yourself deliberately you even though you might not realize it in order to change your cognition and behavior i first learned of doctor bell's laboratory through a rather odd observance that observance took place when i was a graduate student many years ago at you see berley at the time known sell was a professor at you see berley as i venture before you since moved to the semen well i was walking through the berley campus and i saw people on their hands and knees but with their head very close to the ground and their eyes were covered their hands were covered their mouths were covered and only their nose was exposed and what i was observing was an experiment being conducted by the soba laboratory in which humans were following a sent trail that can trail was actually buried some depth underneath the earth and yet they could follow that cent trail with a high degree of fidelity it was from that experiment and other experiments done in doctor soberly laboratory at berley and at the wireman involving narrow imaging and a number of other tools and techniques that revealed the incredible power of human faction and humans ability to follow scent trails if they need to and that of course led to many other important discovery some of which i alluded to a few moments ago but you are going to learn about many many other important discoveries in the realm of of faction and limo sensation that hade been carried out by doctor several's laboratory through the course of to day's episode and by the end of today's episode i assure you that you will never look at or smell the world round you the same way again before you begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with the a theme it'd the thank the sponsors of today's pot cast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science backtolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doom slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor come noble doctor stable no welcome thank you must say i am extremely excited for this conversation have been a huge fan of your work for more than a decade or to a yes the kind of frightening a and we overlapped at you see bergkly some time ago although we do not meat and were apartmnand we have just learn that the amazing apartment that you moved out of was the apartment that my girl and i at the time moved into in two thousandandsix i believe a we have shared quite a few things a and to day i love for you to share with us a all about the amazing landscape of memo sensation in particular full faction or sense of smell and some related perceptional abilities or subconscious abilities including farimonds et camera to get everybody on the same page i you jo start off by asking what are the major components of our ability to smell obviously ere i to think it involves the nose at some level it does to what extent is that mixed in with other senses taste and perhaps more importantly what about the chemicals that we are sensing through this thing and for those you listening om and not watching ism tapping my nose that we are not aware of you know that the chemicals that are that we are inhaling and a making sense of without our awareness of you could just om give us the top contour our or even deep conferer f you of the o the parts list and the the various roles they play you out asked a lot of questions at once a in all art with the little comment on the way you said smelling through our news which we deed do but we also smell through our malefacturally there is a process referred to his retronasal of faction were am tolerance come up through our the back of our throat and out of our news the reverse way and we smelling that way as well an in fact a big part of the contribution of all faction to food and taste comes from that from retronazal a faction but a a primary of faction is referred to his orthonasol faction that is through our news we sniff and sniffing as a big thing while i have a sense we might talk about that a lot to day in all sorts of contexts we sniff in through our news and to answer a general question of the organization of the system am molecules airborne molecules travel up our news a distance in the human of about six or seven centimeters to about here where they interact with i will you use the word sheet of receptors but sheet is a bits s leading here it is not a sheet it is very convoluted we have about seven millions such receptors a lining a structure known as the of factory epithelium this is the sensory surface of the o factory systems of factory epithelium again about probably about six or seven million receptors in the human in the human probably of about three hundred fifty different kinds that is amazing that means a meaningful percentage of your venom is devoted just to this just to the kinds of all factory kept subtypes you have in your knows by the way i can share an amusing story i would imagine amusing stories are good for podcast that number of six or seven million receptors it is probably not very well grounded on its heart to count ah but it is reasonably grounded and there was the thing roaming around in the literature about bloodhounds having billion receptors can our knows which is why they are amazing and this number was it sot of propagated through the literature and and our lab a has written over the years of few review chapters and and we were repeatedly writing the all faction chapter for very large one of these large text books the gazanaga hand book of a cognitivenorl since i think it is called am and and we had that in there as well somewhere and and one time wen were renewing the chapter for a new version of the book i told the graduates an who as leading that at the time a iashurn she's now a professor it see university i told her check that check that reference out where in the world tat that come from and we started going back and back and back and it turns out it comes from it text book an australia text book and we found the author of the text book and and we wrote her and as it looked there is the thing and in the literature of a billion receptors in in the bloodhound where did that come from and and surprise she answered me and an i was hoping to get a reference right but it wasn't reference and in this where it really becomes funny for us because she said i i i was once a at a lecture a a an olfaction geneticists geneticists by the name of moron handset a and he said that in the lecture now this is really funny because she's in australia this is all over the world is number and ism writing her from israel and moron lancet is in the building next to me coquet he is not in whitesmen insatigenetics i mean he used to be his retired now a and and he he had meaningful contributions in the history of all faction am to i picked up the internal phone and and a did hater on did you say that there is a billion receptors in the bloodhound nerves and he said what is a bloodhound this is totally made up right it trial made up and propagated i mean you in you can probably going to huge and type billion receptors in the bloodhound and and you will get a lot of hits but there is absolute continence for that amazing and not just amazing in light of what it it tells us about of faction in bloodhounds are otherwise but amazing because it sheds light on just how much of what is in tax books scientific and medical is absolutely wool things thins propagate and and you sit yourself and right we fixed that and that version of it of the and and to finish the line that sunderance interact with these receptors a here in aripithelium not where the undergo what is referred to his transduction that is the tolerance a data receptor and turn into a neral signal or for in force the receptor respond in neral signal and a this neral signal in fact action potentials not radiant potentials of any kind a propagates a violin factory nerve now this is a nerve that goes from our epithelium all right here behind the forehead no it is well ya n here a through a the thinnest part of our shall an merry refuges the cruberform plate which has perforated it has a lot of holes the nerve goes through those holes and synapses at the first target in the brain a which is the olfactory ball and humans a that forms an interesting a point of sensitivity a because a lot of people lose their sense of smell due to drama a because of that structure a head hip type drama well yes although a you denoted hitting on the front of the head which is where all this real estate is but actually a the more common cause for losing your sense of smell for drama is the back of the head because of what is refuges a contra to injury as your listeners probably know our brain is floating in liquid and c are and freezer spinal fluid inside our skull and when we get hidden the back of the head the brain has this forward and backward movement in the liquid and in the skull it is out of crashes it can crash against the front of the skull which li you also have an contrequindery you also often have frontal damage but what happens is that this generates a sheering motion on the cribriform plate and the olfactory nerve is severed and if it is completely severed it is it is lost forever because my understand is tat the olfactory since re neranscan are among the few central nervous system nerds in adult humans that can regenerate or replenish themselves right sell i again there a few questions o a we o pistol a we will spend any plate sin will ta its completely severed completely then yes you are lost forever ye if it is completely severed because even if you will have regeneration at the basil sell level at the pifilium they will not manage to find their way back a to the ball if if you have partial or something left or something shows up in a short while after the injury then you have a good chance of recovery o because don't row along the trajectory of the other acts on that or pioneering the way for them assuming hm intrantend but socially and and basically the time frame and it is funny i get a lot of females on this all ism not a medical doctor but but i get a lot of males from people with lost their sense of smell because it is very distressing and now more people now this because of bovid that it is very distressing and and basically the rule of thumb is that if you do not get it back within hearty yearn a half you will never to get it back my understanding of the statistics on o factory loss in covet an and an other viral type infections is that afore i had i experience that when i got loved including total and soma for one day and not total it was just there was a remnant of a ability too smell were set or perceive the smell of a lemon and i was huffing as hold as i possibly could i actually there is an over the counter remedy and this is not a pseudo science because there is a number of papers publish about this onpubmet the alfalapoic acid can accelerate the recovery of of a smell ye and and that is something that o it work successfully for me ism not saying that that is the only or rather know if i work successfully for rope you would've recovered anyway you dint through a control that i as no ainialies ye that the leis say two things on this front first the been on the alfulopocacid is ye a his not my well but bemusing your sense of smell is overwhelming you no no i know to it and i think yo may knows esprit a word about the smelling the lemon and this is a it'll take that opportunity that ta sure more information when we smell things it is the result of more a sensory subsystems in the one factory system alone you have several cumosensory sensitive nerves in your new a primary one beyond the olfactory nerve is the trigeneral nerve the fifth cranial nerve the trigeminal nerve has sensory endings in your not in your throat and in your eye it has three branches that is why an onion has smell and burns your eyes and burns in your throat is that a trigeminal yow the tearing of a cutting an online is trigeminal all trigeminal reflects amazing we talk about trigeminal on the contact of headache during a headache epic its a trigeminal reflects the lemon you were smelling may have been a trigeminal sensation o smelling the lemon with my eyes as what your saidwhat no with your nose we let i know with your trigeminal receptors it not your of factor captors am within all faction research for jargon a there is what we refer to his pure of fantasts these are orders that will stimulate your of factory nerve alone they will not influence your trigeminal nerve at all and an example just to get a sense of what that might be would be a a coffee right here a is a rural vacant a vanilla is an known rural fact and these things have no trigeminal activation m as long as we are on this topic and will weave back and forth but ism glad we are on the topic because a tremendous number of people wrote to me during the pandemics continue to about o factory a loss am is the i have heard of this of factory training where whereby if you have a partial or even a complete loss of a primary faction that one is encouraged to smell of a number of different smells a i drop studying activity dependent wiring at the nervous system it makes total sense to me we keeping the on active keeps them alive this is not fire together wire together type i thing by the way that is to quote from parlor shots non donate head folks or me but this is about keeping neurons electrically active the still a factory near on in order to maintain their connections because otherwise they will die of faction is a definite suitor lose it system and that makes total sense and indeed there is very strong evidence for success of of a the training prams more than the alpholopoic acid i an and that is a real thing and and what is cool about that is that you do not need to go and by expensive things although you cannot f course their people ware capitalizing on this commrcialye already but you can just take the from your refrigerator or your or you make up cabinet or whatever and smell them intentionally and constantly and sniff them and and that exposure will help you recover o there is good data on that bi now you made that a point in passing about regeneration in the olfactory system an neither one at one of the cool things sis in all faction you can you can study many things through a faction indeed one of them is is in is our regeneration a because the olfactory neurons are really the only neurons that do that systematically in the adult mammalian brain and whether the human of factory system shows the same level of regeneration as at down in a in other mammals is and was somewhat questionable and ism just bringing that of to share really cool study that was published in neuron i think somewhere round two thousand fourteen a where to address this question i just really the idea of doing that what they what the authors did a was look at in in post moral they looked at levels of seafourteen in in adults were exposed to atomic boy experiments print you have you can actually look at these at these neurons and an time them bison exposure to radiation a and that paper suggested that that there is not as much turn over in the human old factory ball as there is in other mammals a other lines of data suggest otherwise this is kind of debated question as to what extended nurse degeneration you have in in the human of factory system is opposed to other a a mama's but but that was just really fuel paper i think of doing that fascinating a i i to should i finish the the path just o we have we said o to information then chaps is at the olfactory ball from from the he olfactory peculium and the pattern of that snap sing follows what is referred to is the most extreme case of convergence in the familiar a nervous system more specifically what happens is that all the receptors of a given sub type and remembering humans we said we have about the hundred and fifty in the mouse we have about a thousand to hundred probably a all the receptors of one sub type converge to one location in the ball and ow this location is referred to his icalamaraliss or imploraglamarole and and that may be a slight over simplification its in fact tooglamarali there is a mirror sort of a mirror cut line and all the receptors of one sub type will converge to two miraglamerali on the olfactory ball you end of having a to glameralie reflect that one receptor subtype and if and this is is far as the ism giving you now the text book view of of how the system works but then i can all happily share with you things that pose a problem for the textbook view of how things work but the text we view of nothing's work is that every such receptor subtype is responsive to a small sub set of different molecular shapes what sometimes referred to his isotopes the molecular aspects of the ordering each receptors is responsive to a different subset of isotopes let say ten and each isotope will activate a different subset of receptors potential you have the insane common entries of this potentially three hundred fifty dimensional space in the human potentially but then because of this convergence you wend up having on the ball in a way a map reflecting receptor identity let see this coffee a activates receptors of type one three and seven the glomeruli of receptors one three and seven will light up quote quote when i smell the coffee and if you cut take a snapshot of that theoretically would have the map of of coffee an anyone and forth this this is on of the tests which vie of how the system works and and then information goes from the ball to several targets in the brain i mean what is fur to primary factory quarters pyriform quarter and an internal quarters this is on the mental surface of the brain the lower portion of our temporal lobe a an information goes there directly but it also goes directly to timing deal it probably goes directly to the ippotholemis it may go directly to the cerebellum it goes all over the brain son preachment projects widely from there and as far as people understand the map that may exist on the ball a does not exist in the rest of the brain and theunderstanding of of howl cooking occurs in the rest of the brain as is murky commonly one hears that the memories that we have of odors are somehow more robust a than the memories of other perceptional events in our life i i do not know if this is true or not but unpeople will say for instance i can still remember the smell of my grandmother's hands or the smell of cookies in her kitchen at minimum it points to the fact that smell and memory are closely linked and you just mention a direct a in a mufti station but none the less somewhat direct path from the nostrils to the hippocampus a one of the primary an coming centers of jatos en as of the way the touch is it which is a remarkably short pathway considering that for instance i just by example to a some of our listeners a will not be familiar with us but some will that sound waves that a nor transducer into naval signals at the level of the inner ear go through many stations before they arrive at the location in the brainier we make sense of those soundways as voices or music et camera whereas of faction is a more of a direct route am to the to the a memory centers am is there any a just story or real a objective truth to the idea that all factory memories are formed more easily or maintained longer or more robustly than other sorts of memories yes a but first sight i should i should say that ism not an authority on all factory memory it is stop it fact remembered a huge field research and somehow our lab has never really a gone much into that although again the same sunset i happen to talk about before the our eyeshrun whose gan now a faculty it sell of eve ah am ran a study a paper we think we publishing carnally biology called the privilege representation of early of factor is a associations basically there is something about the first time you experience a smell the generates a particularly robust representation more than other century stimuli and and that is what she in fact compared there is something about the first exposure ti smell am in terms of the brain including that that etches it into our a being and and this is an effect that has it has echoes of course in literature i mean in o the the the biggest change this is to bring up the trust effect right the purse effect is when he ate the mandarin and in immediately the taste and smell immediately reminded him ah of of an event in his childhood were it were were the same midline a appeared ah am but but that something very real there there is a lot of research on it a not coming from our works a ism not an authority but it does sound there is something special about all faction am and that does not mean that there is not something special about vision or edition each one has its own a unique lav the last our us it there is something special abound my students make fun of me because the same there is some truth to that that i try to explain everything through the olfactory system mean for me everything is all factory yes through the lends of the nose it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiatics that i need for got health our got is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics an athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it take crime if you would to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road and the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic greenstone calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply of vitemend three k to when i was at berley am i was walking across campus one day and i saw i think students but i saw people on their hands and knees with goggles on gloves on and am i think their mouths were covered to any was covered was covered and they were walking while they were crawling along the ground am and i though this was peculiar but then again its you see berley and the joke is a it to get noticed on the see barely camp as you ought to be naked and on fire i one of the other would not be efficient please not ones expat place e but none the less a paper came out of a few years later describing the results of what turned out to be your experiment that your laboratory was running which was having people follow an odor trail with their nose and u and my understanding is that people can improve their ability to tract sense quite robustly especially if we deprive them a vision and some at a sensation that is touch and some other i sensations may be could just tell us a lowlbit about that study and from m for i think in our audience ism suspecting that many people have a keen keen sense of smell very s i one a family member which is detect any negative in putrid order in the environment but also good odors i exquisitely well nigh i have other family members whose sense of smell is quite poor id love for all those people to learn a bit about what is possible in terms of training up or improving our ability to smell and admit perhaps in the contacts of that study if you will yes tourist before we have ben talking about improving just off the bat humans have a remarkable sense of smell and this is something again in our likely already summon saw we know this this is on news but but to people come from different worlds we have to reiterate this sometimes when i give public lecturers to to nominal faction audiences i reiterate this humans have an utterly remarkable sense of smell to to put that a bit into but of thinks that you could there are tangible to to for example i mercaptains which are added to cooking gas that we smell it because otherwise it wouldn't have a smell that the smell of a s dos not the smell of gas of propane an added to werecaptain ya its me captain the alive lay our detection threshold that is the level at which we can detect it is zero point to parts vermilion ah there is no machine t at can really do that that effectively no gascromatograph nothing now to give you another sense o a making this again really tangible we are working with a tolerant in our lab called estratetra all that our participants can detect when we have it mixed at ten to the negative twelve molar in liquid phase to give you a real sense of that we did the mat if you would take to olympic sized swimming pools and you would pipe it one amount one drop into one pool verses the other you could smell the difference between the pools incrediral that is the detection threshold you have with your nose people have utterly amazing nose okay that is just in terms of its detectionabilities which a are just in a remarkable really up there in the mammalian world we not a bad camel an all faction am and and beyond that we can we can improve okay and and example you're talking about actually started off ah is a lab bet okay we were having a lab picnic i guess i should hear piling because am am your guest from the waterman institute of science in israel but before going back to my home in israel i was a a am faculty t you see berley in the hellenwole's narrow science institute and this study was done during that time and we were on a lad picnic and we were having indeed one of these sort of lab discussions arguments on what humans cannon candy with our sense of smell and and i said that humans could true even track odor a dog and people there said no way and we ran this quick experiment at which avidin of but i do not think we will show it here ah but i actually have a ride the picnic video we have it and a a graduation by the christian salina a brilliant graduations at that time who is now she is now a professor at northwestern an she is really leading the field of avollfachion imaging to day but she was the volunteer and we dragged a chocolate bar across the grass and blindfolded her and checked if she could track the track we made with the chocolate which she did very effectively right and we as lacer at the starting point of the line or i think we did i do not exactly remember what we did on that sort of picnic a trial but i i assume she never practised that in her life before it and yet she she did it really really well and and then this went on as the labret in way that the i said to my metensiy we we have to make this into an experiment put in experimental setting and and and quantify what is going on a and they all said a it would be uninteresting that was the bed and and i told them it would be in nature which is a bet i won in this case your us sing one of cheap three an anal o a was a is general since to her but but a then we turned it into an experiment and and what the experiment was is that we brought in participate naive parts chance no not graduliconcs from our lab a completely deprived them of any other century and put we blocked our eyes we blocked our ears we blocked everything we blocked wit they were wearing heavy gloves a the they consent anything and we generated a a a consistent odor passed in the grass which is what you saw ah we did that by burying twine under the grass and an odor impregnated twine that way we could generate a consistent a odor trail every time was it and at the base of the grass or in the dirt it was buried it was buried under the grass really ye ye while and did not it was buried under the grass and we a conducted aerial photography and a partispance also had the cense or pack that they were wearing where we a measured nasal airflow in each nostril in real time and a they ought we also use something called art k g p s which is away to lay a radial frequency grated over the g p s grid that you have millimeter resolution and space basically am it is used by surveyors mostly am that we could track behavior and we found a few things doing this one is that people could just do this right off the back am the second thing we found that is when we trained them up then within a average of four days a the rat limiting factor became the speed at which they could crawl as fast as you could crawl you could cent track of course you cannot can as fast as a dog can run but you as fast as you can crawl you can cent track and then to to sort of add what made it really interesting from from a a systems norstines perspective is that we asked whether having two nostrils a contributes to this a we built we constructed a annual process if h will a that had two versions one is that t it combined both nostrils into one big nostril centered and the others that it it maintained to separated a nostrils and we compared performance under these two conditions and people performed better a with two nostrils over one centralized nostril titch the flow remain the same your taking advantage of the information the comes from your two separate totally separate nostrils by the way the system i describe before of your ebitilium an ball and an connection to quartics a you have two of those right it is completely uni lateral well almost completely unhederale system there is soever small exceptions to that but bat's o representation on both sides of the brain much in the same way we have two eyes were not a cyclops we can gain depth reception information we can perceive motion better as a consequence and and a number of depth especially story oasis and can locate sound because of the difference between our ears and how had blocks them between emit i a another question about the the mechanics and strategies that you observed because i think there is information about the system the brain as a consequence am were you in a position to measure sniffing frequency and the specific question i have as were people doing something along the lines of a quicksniffing or a i a young long a payroll in zuinhill we did not we guess we were measuring sniffing and recording it and and we have all the data am there was nothing am very remarkable in that data in that study although it may reflect that we did not analyze it carefully enough as well i mean it didn't it was it it was not a major component of our analysis sola we did look at it a to some extent again yer your asking about a paper from quite a few years ago si i may be forgetting parts of it as well am but ism sure if it was a of major component not it it what ever in i decent i was not a major finding oo the sniffing behavior am in the paper although again we in o a sniffing behavior is a huge portion of our our life and lab a and and it is it is taking us to to places and and it is reemerging now in our work were we are doing tons of sniffing work am an i it can sure with you something that that i think we will interest your your listeners and our is is well an and an we think is is really a a one of the most overlook things and injure science a i lot who vote you i invite we to the falling experiments t include one nostril by pressing on it from the side and sniff in and then include the other and sniff in you sense a difference in flow yes cade why that is no in it was the next question on my list o do not feel badly about not knowing why that is a most people do not a but that is a reflection of something refer to is the nasal cycle in fact if you were to do that repeatedly you would find that your high flow nostril and low flow nostril alternate every two and half hours on average in an absolute ways a kind of a sine wave gradual shift to the one and the gradual shift back it can vary it can vary and we do not yet know the rules all the rules but but you have this constant shift from side to side the shift becomes incredibly pronounced in sleep we can measure the power of the difference and and in sleep you have the face shift of powryof ha huge one closes in one opens totally and it turns out that this is linked to a balance in the autonomic nervous system as you yourlissers know we have an autonomic nervous system that has a sympathetic in part sympathetic compose into it and and therein balance or imbalance in many diseases for example and this interplay between the bought it between the sympathetic and part sympathetic nervous system drives the switch from left to right nostril just to remind people sympathetic nervous system has nothing do a sympathy a has everything to do with generating patterns of alertinist is sometimes call the fighter flight system but any pattern of arousal passive negative and then it is balance in a coordinated way or at least in parallel with the parasympathetic nervous system which is sometimes call the rest in digest system but is a associate with all s orts of things the sexual arousal response and a number of other aspects of our physiologist think of it a sea saw of alertness and calm perfect now imagine right imagine imagine you would walk around living your life right half of the time with one eye close this and the other half with one eye closed this and you have this eyecyce all right and that was linked to autonomic arousal i assure you you would go to putted there would be five million papers on the cycle right and the cycle and every disease you can name and what it denotes and what it tells us and what we can do with it you have exactly this marker your walking around the marker on balance in your atomic nervous system and we do nothing with it were in fact now doing a lot with it o was we built we built a wearable device that i is pasted to your body and measures air flying each nostril separately and logs it for twenty four hours and were collecting these twenty four hour recordings were calling at the naval halter we measure with the naval halter and and were finding it is a disease marker i i can i can give you a naval halter measurement is an adult and i can say this is work by tmnoseroka graduate sooner or labor i can we we can tell the difference between a a h d and none ad he adults and we can tell just from the recording we can tell if the adultarnriddleing or not i can i can measure your nail air fluency if you are or not with ad h in if you are or non riddling incredible eve a couple of questions about this is it the case that air flow through one nostril is reflective of a sympathetic nervous system dominance verses part sympathetic som or is it simply the case that this alternating left right nostril periodicity on which you said i think is on the order of about every two hours do and half two and a half its which is to a man me on one side verses the other is that simply reflective of an over all bouncy let let us nay is it the dinginess he saw or is at the tilt of to sea i do not have a good answer i do not have a good answer i mean en i i can give you some of a and i could say to some extent a right nostril more open i is more sympathetic and left nostril more open is more para sympathetic but that that would not be very correct i mere not it here that it it as a yoga argon o be all over the sorry as i had to struck my at dos ersemself on on anything and that the dogs are always saying lot you non because there is this thing i do not do yoga any more abut not for any rowan mama that i where they will have you breath through one nostril or the other and i i probableven asked this question on social media ten thous time are you have go to become public any renumber one of the bogies right now is a re sori we they will come angry with a yoga hats which are not very danger we really since we are interested in this mechanism one of these really to know how to do is is to gain control of it somehow and there is this world out there of yoga who claims to have control over this we said oke let us bring really serious yoga practitioners and see if they can shift their nasal cycle from left to write but by will alone right not by manipulating themselves somehow and and if doeskin will learn from them how they do this and then we might e no use us to to curate g deer or what not right we boasted on all the lists the yoga teachers and have this parade of yoga teachers walking in to our lab this was one of the strange lot of an old o orders and terf it wit a clothing n an on and and we we study i actually no we studied fourteen yoga teachers all fourteen a by you by the conditions of enlistment for this a came in saying that they they a control shifting from left to right a nostril without plugging a osier i a ma by the power of thought on m and how many of fourteen succeeded zero including including one in t as extreme orders wet we have this guy whowewyo know and we are recording and we we ordered coatis really well right and and he is seeing e sing yams witching now and a twitching and your looking at the modern and no it is is witch and and no no yoga teacher that we found a could a wilfully switch i between left and right nostril flow and yet they are they are convinced that they are and have to imagine there not trying to there there is no incentive for them to lie right ne no even opposite i mean on this puts them in an awkward position once the ay i do not know what the deal is but but none of them can do it am given that the alternating flow through one or the other nostrils reflective of the autonomic nervous system has is to and half hour periodicity if i suddenly enter a bout of stress for instance does it switch because that is reflective of the autonomnervs i it at least ism asking this question is not because i think that is necessarily important as it relates to stress but ism try to understand the direction of causality in other words is the as are tuna lateral smelling through a unilateral nostril smelling periodicity that when we named it i could thing of the wrong thing ism sure is that driving the shift in autonomener system or is it merely reflective of this the shift you have you have very concisely now worded aim to of a grants that was probably just rejected but but basically we are trinal answer exactly a that question and we are currently running experiments on that line we have one experiment were a i we are looking i we are exposing participate to pain i we are using a cold water hand exposure it is a realyqual paradise because it it there is huge individual differences we just started this we built the set up just now and you have a lot of meat to work with there because there is a lot of individual differences here e it is cap at three minutes o for safety reasons because you have you have pretisipens putting their hand in in a two degree saltiest water but the they will be partisans will pull it out i ten second nine seconds and then you will have you will have three minutes as well there is lots of lots of a and and aridiantso now ism during pilot data with you i i no to to this might when it when this and of being published it might be the opposite but far it seems that theta have the exposure to cold generates shift in the naval an naval balance autonomic arouse can drive a shift potentially a earlier you were describing the architecture of these am smelling systems and you mention these glamariali was heal factor receptors converge rat in the bulb and then later you mention that the system is unilateral but with a mirror representation on both sides of the brain for those who do not think in terms a our anatomy on what no one was describing is the fact that of of course there are two nostrils and then the bunch of receptors that conversion these camera but you have a mirror representation of that on both sides of the brain and that most of that information is kept on one side of the brain or the other there is not a lot of extensive intermixing at the first order of crossritin the question i have is whether r not you believe ism not asking for data first i just one to no you believe that the alternating nostril airflow phenomenon has anything to do with preferential processing of factory information in terms of right brain left brain with the caviar that any time we hear right brain left brain a we have covered this in a previous episode most of what people here out thereabout right brain left brain emotionality logical stuff is completely wrong completely wrong does not exist is a total fabrication amen we would to abolish that myth but with that aside for et aside rather what are your thoughts on we the information which switch from one side of the brain to the other at all n i do not think i do not think the that the nasal cycle is an all faction story i i i do not think that i that this was shaped by the olfactory system nor do i think this has made your impact on a faction i think the nasal cycle story is a different story about brain function i we have we have the set of pet theory where calling ow the the sniffing brain approach where where basically we think that that nasal inhalation is timing an driving a lot of aspects and patterns of of neural activity and cognitive processing and and this theory it is is all faction inspired in its beginning that is i mean if if you think of the mammalian brain right it is which which evolved from all faction it is sitting there and an all faction because allocation depends on sniffing you have this situation where you have a you have a sniff you have information and then flat nothing right and then you have information an then nothing information processing is is one to one link to nasal inhalation and and we think that that this property evolved to to be manful in brain process in general not only of avollfactory information but of any type of information because the brain evolved in this way in this way that it processes information on inhalation on set a study led by sulphur peril from our our lab a two three years ago a we look at it something completely tonal factory we looked at at vision spacial processing and we compared vision spacial processing on inflation versus exhalation and the brain does is completely different on inhalation versus exaltation your n in that particular task people performed significantly better on inhalation verses exhalation what was the task was in an old factory do not know it is a visa spacial task this is the as were were that the the specifics of the task where am that you see a a shape and you have to determine if it is a shape that cannot cannot exist in the real world some of them were lies ushershapes where were one fascist dozen reach the other fast these impossible figure s maya but but but a structural shapes not not and and to a pure visual spacial task we intensely went for a task that is not considered a ventral temporal task in a factory quartic task in anyway and and people performed much better on inhalation versus exaltation at doing this task was there a most nostrils excluded am version where people were forced to mouth bright yes and in this particular task the also did better on mouth in halation verses mouth exhalation but the difference was not as pronounced as it was with nasal inhalation verses exhalations with bat a you a big proponent of nasal not mouth breathing whenever possible or sure for a many health related reasons of a big fan of the book jaws a epidemic of in by collins o on at stanforis familiar with it and this idea that a people who mouth breathe a experience were cold's more infections of serious kinds it is not good aesthetically or for the dent destitute i never know the teeth the gums aid stuff yes i my i densiisnnicome after radio en toss i the am that not breathing is great for your health relative to mali reside thing its also good for your cognition not only for your your dental health i think that that a newsbreathing shapes cognition and that there are other labs a who who a a are finding the same again a cristinozalana is doing work on this line shape shed major contributions here and and a can lustrum is doing work on this line that there is lots of studies suggesting that am naval inhalation is timing cognitive processing and and modulating it e credible am perhaps not surprising given what you have taught us about the of factory system i mean that these two holes in the front of our face these nostrils i than or a pathway to the brain that i i love to tell people cause i work on the vicinal system my lab that yow your eyes are two pieces of brain extruded from the cranial vault which they are tattle ratings any anyhow and am and then you never look at any one the same way again an but the the a factory ensuring irons are right there at the tops of those caverns that we call nostrils and they are brain ye definitely it is it is the only place for your brain meets the outside world because in your retina they are protected by violent and here here you have neurons in contact with with the world this es actually has been the source for some theories on a potential a rat for forgoer degenerative a a mechanisms as as you may know am loss of the sense of smell is one of the if not the earliest sign of near degenerative disease for example in parkinson's disease there's a a loss in the sense of smell probably ten years before any other symptom a but people have failed to make this a diagnostic tool because it is non specific it is not as if you to come to your doctor and say ism losing my sense of smell and they will say o early sign of parkinsons because you can have many reasons to lose your sense of smell and an and on but but all factory loss again as it is an early sign of her degeneration and there is at least one theory particularly about alters disease suggesting that that alters may be the result of of a a passage that enters the brain through the of factory system o interest it it is it is not of course a a a mainstream or widely accepted theory of any type but but it is it it just highlights this notion that that the nose is a path to our brain i think the non invasive redoubts of potential her degeneration such as i visual task because of the fact that the retinas are part of the brain and loss of nerds in the retina is often associated with other forms of central degeneration easier parkinson et camera as it is little more invade of the what you are describing ism begin to wonder why we do not git a a to factory task every time we go to the doctor that would allow tracking over time because of course as you mention somewhat can lose our sense of smell does not mean there getting alsimeris not necessarily but if the sense of smell was terrific the years before and it is fifty per cent worse than next o that is a really bad time to you that is a bad sign and what you time untying completely non invasive then could be relatively pleasant to i not you as i easily orders you it a first i can answer that right an the reason that that is now happened and that might that that may be changing right now but the reason that has now happened is because all faction has not been effectively digitized its if if you need a generate really precise visual information you can buy a monster for e know a hundred boys that is it the resolute ion of the visual system basically and if you want a generate auditory stimuli really precisely than you can buy an amplifier fer maybe a bit more than under bowman not that much more and you will be at the resolution of the auditory system in our lab we build devices the generate orders a we call him all hectometers which is a misnomer because it do not measure anything but that is what they always been call to we call him all atmometers as well and we have already built at least one all barometer the cost a quarter of a million eureka and it is pathetic right it is it is pathetic it is it is slow it is contaminated it is nowhere near the resolution of your system one of the reasons that is not happened is just the utterly poor control of the stimulus mind you to some except it has happened in that there there are a standard clinical tests of all fraction basically too that sort of control a the world in this respect the older one is is a test call the u site which stands for the university of pennsylvania smell identification test it was developed by richer dowdy and pen and it is a test where you scratch and sniff and and it is a for alternative forced choice tests with forty over and of these forty pages that u page through and you sniff and smell and and a you know it is been normed on gazillions of tests a i ism always amused by it because sis richer body made a hun of money a on the u visited but he needed it because he has a habit he has a last car this every time we buy you beasitees in live i say there is another gallon of gas into richer he raise is nasty it is not not last cargo one lower than that arena some some sort of formula a or formula ford or some he raises a car and that is where all you besides one i always feel good about buying you the piss it's because i know they are going to that good cause but keeping him inning the fast let but but that is one test that is out there and and indeed it as been shown as a dulosis or there is reduced curious item in claimers and parkinsons and and in a host of other diseases and there is a european version called sniffing sticks ah the tomasfumea has developed and ens its was my the same sort of concept of that one is not scratch and sniff its these pens that you open open ins but but those exist but their nod is is conveniences is a is the delivering stimuli invasion an addition and that is why i you do not have what you have just suggested s anotherthing another place when you do not have it which which i think is even more would have been even more manful is is you do not faction is not tested in in newborns right where vision and audition is you there is the thing called can general and some a wrist which is being without the sense of smell from birth supposed congenital h which is a half a per cent of the population it is not a trivial number not total ya but nobody knows if that really is true because he heres an amazing fact wit yes the average age it which can general an ossmea is diagnosed and thesis this is a horrible statistic for me for the way i see the world but what do you think the average age of diagnosis's for congeneralan some five years of age fourteen incredible fourteen most people who are one half of one per cent of the human population presumably ya is a without the sense of smell and does not realize that until they are fourteen years we i do not know when they realized at first but but it is formerly diagnose at fourteen on average which means some of them even later writ and a and a writes a distribution but what am do they suffer yes first of all they they suffer social my and there is a host of of deleterious life events associated with congentleean oman i the dinner u it is it is it is a it is this is work out of a flora cry in germany and amongst the various things that are predicted by anosmia is shorter life span ah but things you ka reduced a social contacts a reduced a romantic social contacts i it is not a good thing and and do they jackal factory bulbs i pressing they have noses and nostrils there is a condition ism aware of were were out children are born without notice it it i very rareyare very rares or orcas on that's it is it is exceedingly rare so they are born with noses and nostrils i and here istle thing right we do not know if they are born with of factory balls u most of them although not all of them but most of them do not have all factory bulbs in adulthood or or i should rephrase that have remnants factory bulbs really shriveled of factory bulbs but nobody can see the cause and effect here before we talk about the rule of the the a requirement for o factory bulbsforal faction a very interesting topic in its own right i i curious as to whether or not their indican system is altered because as will soon talk about there's a lot of signaling through the nose from between individuals that a triggers things everything from the onset of puberty to feelings of romantic attraction attachment these sorts of things is it known whether or not and i should s excuse me for interrupting myself but sans ism interrupting you every five mancewor is will interrupt myself too that we are well aware of the proximity of the of factory system to some of the hypothalamic systems that regulate the release of banana trope's we antral testosterone and estrogen production et camera am are they a hormonal born some are an some arts in all all be specific am there is a condition is common centrum which is hypoguanatic a development in in men and in column centrum a there practically all anosmia tans your question yes there is a direct link and and it materializes in common charm that said not all congenitally anosmia a individuals have common drum and not all but almost all people have commoncindrom a in soma to common centrum a got with a an soma i think o there is a female equivalent of dolmans or i do not remember its name a it is not turn it is not a in the turner centrum family o onshore o and i think it is all associated with anosmia a but ism not confident of that but commons as is associate anosmia a the answer is as yes and and we can may be all all faction and reproduction are are tightly linked and and there tightly linked in all mama's and we are big terrestrial mammals and all fashion reproduction a lion humans as well i yet we will defilade get into that i have a story slash question that it'd the am tell you ask you as a see way to that ism noting of course the that will get back to the requirement for a factory bulbs yes or no feral faction ah and am this relate when i was growing up i group at the and of a street with a a lot of boys of my age who just like twinsets had a lot of alley sisters therefore my sister my older sisters age is fortunate i lot of kids to play with we would hang out each others houses by build jumps and do all is things kidstuff wort stuff get into trouble or what not and oftentimes we would and a believing our articles of clothing at each others houses all the time tea shirts and jackets and my mom was constantly coming in and saying there is all there is is clothes someone left is here i do not know who it was we are all more less the same size and from the as far back as i could remember six seven years old and onward i could pick up a shirt or a jacket smell it and say oh all that is epic is an arts shirt a friend of mine there i gust gave his name work oh that is got mason shirt i i could just smell the shirt and in a conscious way know who it belonged to having never i promise not that i would pretend if i had if i had pretend i had not if i had but having never actually done the exercise of going and taking an smelling my friend intentional right nay in fact if anything i had all the reasons in the world to avoid smell at other young boys in our neighborhood o case so that raises a question of whether or not we are consciously and or subconsciously coming identification of people that we interact with frequently or infrequently in terms of their smell and wore some other aspect of there a chemistry yet eyes ah we are doing that all the time in my view and a lot of this processing almost all of it a is subconscious and i do not know why already already put that out there right i have no idea why why a human nature has has a or or nature or culture or want not has as as push this into the realm of of subconscious and something were unaware of but we do it all the time an an an our lab has lots of studies on this front i one of them you may be familiar with it it had gain some notoriety because it is amusing i is o went we look at human behaviou're a lot we try to look at it through our news a in the way we look at what people are doing we try to think if i was a dog we what would i think of this and and you if you look at dogs right they they have you in when they interact they visibly sniff each other it is very obvious they walk up to each other and they sniff each other i and yet humans do not typically walk up to a stranger and carefully sniff them right i mean it is you we are we are sot of obliged to sniff or our babies that is considered almost somethingyou are supposed to do m and it is not culturally barbuda sniff our loved ones it sot does not seem an odd thing to do but we do not sniff strangers right well or do we we are finding more and more mechanisms where we do this and and the one ism referring to now for one example is we started looking at handshaking handshaking is this really odd behavior and it is not only in the west by the ways some people thinks it is only a western thing it is not it is almost everywhere inland there is really poor understanding of how this behavior evolved where is where did this thing come from if you you if you look for the wikapety aversion right and they will tell you that it is to show that you are not holding a weapon in your hand but there is really no good evidence for that it is a bit the trilling bloodhound receptors story right i mean we try to find at in a wide people say that and they just do and we started looking at people handshaking and and we noticed or it seem to us that we are noticing that now people will shake hands and then go this and those of you i not am no a terms taking his hand and and wiping it on his face pain o not couching nice ins aline ya these things these things that wed all the time after a hand shake well fry wall we do them all the time just period right the base line here is really high and will get to that a second but but but these behaviors that you could easily not notice right and and we we asked whether that is a real thing u and this was a study led by done grooming in our lab at the time and what we did first and and if you want we can line o this was published in e life in one of the nice things about e life is that it has a very effective way to a imbedvidios in the publication if you want we can link this to your system later on the the liven the shown out captions as a link an you to been the other for a platform notify office what we did is is a we we brought in parchaspence to our lab and we sat them in the room a experiment room and and told them the experiment would start soon and they should wait for us there they don't know what they were coming from unbenoentes to them they were ready being videoed of course later on they they had the opportunity to to not agreed us saving the video in which case we would to lead it immediately or or letting us use it for science or some letting us use it for more than sciences for for the video that is now o new life and and we walk into the room and say yo can just wait here a well be right back with you a to sit up our experiment and they would sit there for three minutes and during those three minutes we could later quantifying how much indeed they just by base line how much they touch their nose or their warhead or their chin or how many times their hand a reaches their face and by the way that base line is not low morgen and then three minutes later an experiment would walk into the room and would share a consistent text it would be we are still setting up our equipment in the other room a an also dis wait here and will be right back with you but in the meantime just wait here and the experiment went through this twenty second fixed text and in half of the cases included a handshake this was a new experiment or not the one put them in the room that is the first time they met belowime and they would put out their hand and shake their hand or not again we did all possible interactions intros of gender we matched a male participants with male and female experimenters and female partispents with female and male experimenters and you had handshake in no handshake conditions and then you can quantify that behavior of the hand going to the nose after handshake and there was a remarkable increase in the hand going to the nose after handshake and this is one of the nice cases we the paper include statistics but you do not need static here just look at the video it is unit is unreal the midi was unreal interested the hand goes to the nose now we did a few controls here to verify that this is nor factory behavior one is unbenonsty an to participate we measured nasal airflow and and people not only bring their hand to their nose they sniff it in this is perfectly time they go this a case of their sniffing their hand and an an additional control study we manipulated it we built this little names bond thing of a watch on the experimenter's hand that could admit an odor and the experiment or did not know what odor they were emitting and they could admit either a pleasant or an unpleasant odor and we could drive the self sampling afterwards up or down this was an old factory behavior no doubt about it men were were quite confident tho people in that case people must have been sensing the odor on their own hand because they shake he shook the hand of the of the experimenter pleasant odor and their more frequently bringing that hand to their nose verses unpleasant odor ought that had been introduced to their own hand by the experimenter bit north i think they were sensing the ancient odor that came in with the hand that that choke and then that either drove them to sniff their hands more or less the odor cloud and of the explain and e there's an interesting thing going on here too because people did not only smell the hand that shook they also smelled the other hand and and we think that there is something going on here comparing self to other and we think a lot of self sampling might might reflect that there is on this same line and against t link to your childhood story of a identifying your friends by by smell a study we published is last year by a botherofrebian in our lab am we are in bod came with this a a basic interest and this phenomenon that is loosely referred to his click friendships people you meet and you click right away right you immediately become close friends and this is a phenomena that is poorly described or is poorly described and liliteratures as as an entity and yet anybody will tell you they know what you are talking about right i mean if you tell the somebody y click with bridge away you you become intimate within five minutes right everybody experienced this in their life to some extent and the question is what what was there right what was it was it because you look the same could be was it because you had the same sports team that you liked or is there is something a deeper here and and ideas theory was that that am that similarity in body order may contribute to this that people who smell the same will click in some way and do just that she she actually recruited a am click friends from all over israel she posted all over social media a to identify a pars of friends wo these are our same sex non romantic dials o these our friends men and women a whose friendship started is a click were here this becomes sensitive because it has to be mutual click right later on we discovered there and be one sided clicks somebody is surety clicked with somebody else but the other person there is a name for that in neurology that our a common friend the late ben embarrass taught me which is there is a phrase that neurologist you soggy called sticky these are people that come up to you and and start asking questions and then will not leave you alone they they called sticky el that and if you ask these sticky people am sticky in air quotes as are not physically sticky am they may be what a they could be am what do you think of the part this person they will say their great were really good friends and they have made a unilateral a click friendship and a yes neurologist are talking about you if your if you're one of these urologist a ti o others a an an informal dignustan hod sticky a she she recruited am am click friends and then she am sample their body order an and we are a pool call for this o they are given a odorless champion soap to use for three weeks for something and then they sleep two nights in this teacher a were they have to sleep alone and then we extract the body order from the teacher and s we have a way to extract a method to extract body order and then she she first asked am whether indeed click friends are more similar in their body order than you would expect by chance and she first tested this with with a device machine we call in electronic nose an electronic nose is sot a very poor effort to mack what the mammalian know does basically it is a bunch of censures that respond to air borne molecules in this case senseher's ref to his boxers as a metal oxide covered censers am and she used an electronic nose to sample these body orders and she found that click friends are indeed more similar to each other a then you would expect by chance by random dads and in the s was a significant difference and after she found that a device could do this she had other participants do this she had people smelling the click friends for as nonstick friends and and they judged them as being more similar to each other ah than not now again you might under is this causal or not right because maybe click friends go to the same restaurant together all the time whatever live in the same neighborhood and and that is why they they they smell the same to address causality she recruited total strangers and first smell them with the electronic nose and then engage them in a social interaction something called the mirror game in the mirror game one person moves their hands and the other person's really close to them right here o they can smell each other and has to move their hands with the other person and one one prediction their panned out a but another did not the one that did not she predicted that people would smell more a similar to each other would be better at the mirror game that is they would follow each other better that did not pan out however she then also had the interaction was completely nonverbal they were not out to speak with each other and she did at entire round robin everybody played with everybody else this was an insane experiment to run and she then at the end of the experiment each person rated each other person as to how much they think they would want to be their friends and also in a bunch of ratings how nice they think they are how affectionate they think a bunch of waiting skate all of this was predicted by the electronic nose people who smell more similar to each other think that the other person is more likely to be their friends is more likely to be a nice person et camera et camera we could actually predict friendship using the electronic nose this is not a result of friendship it is it it playsuit the causal elements of building friendship this is to relate to your childhood's story a there is something going t here worst work constantly smelling ourselves constantly this constantly and u if you ane the like the reason ism smiling vain in in your hours or listeners will understand why i am smelling it'll send you a video to link a a in in in inter podcast here we thought of calling tat the fact that people constantly sniff themselves we thought of calling this low effect and lo i sitisomn in america this will not pass that effectively burin in the rest of the normal world a yachting lo is the soccer the national socracoach of the german socrateim i mean i do not know who to be a very famous coach here but teen our sing this is the this is a supersuperfamous a name all round the world where soccer is the primary sport that people watch am and and once people will see this radio they will understand why we thought of calling this low effect a is very graphic ah but but people are constant smelling ourselves they are smelling themselves with their hands there are smelling themselves explicitly people are constantly smelling themselves constantly smelling others a i find this object interesting a and first of all confession i dealing smell myself multiple times per day and everybody does it'll get good and i i am i would do it anyway a a i think i most people i either find my own smell to be neutral to pleasant mi i a occasionally i on i mean to take a shower as long as were talking about smelling oneself and a friendship kinship and its relationship to smell we have to talk about the relationship between smell and romantic attraction and maund my understanding is that if for instance a mouse is given the option to meet with any number of other different mice they will bias their choice toward the mouse that has the immune come position the called em major his compatibility complex with plea amuse diversity the immune system that is most distant from theirs at the the evolutionary argument being that word they to a produce offspring that the array of amungines would be much broader than if they were to select an animal very close o them an in addition to that that one of the most strongly selected against behaviors notes culturally but at the level of eliciting a sense of disgust maybe even from the activity of the hypothalamus is mating with very close kin aka incest because that con potential it we know produces the migrate of mutations in other words whereas you describe the relationship between smell and choice of friends as you o choose people who smell more you minorstanding is that in the context of at choosing romantic partners or sexual partners are both that you choose the person whose odor and therefore immune composition is most different rate the we described the animal literature's correct and there is evidence similar mechanisms in humans our lab has not worked directly on this issue of a of the romantic selection based on odor a there's a bunch of papers a wedding ad fallen in the welkin lab and also porter a a emails he later on a that have have done a lot of this work and find exactly as you say that they a a romantic odorpreferences in humans a our influence by body odor and that this is linked to a me see a a a hysocometibility complex make up of the the portion of arguing that the shapes are in system a to some extent am o to this effect a has been studied and reported on again next naively in mice and also a in in humans am not work that that we have done am the one sort of tangent work we have done an an and like o may be tell you about it relates to to an effect that that it is one of the most remarkable effects and in mammalian social sumo signaling and an also related to to it it is not related to romanticism in anyway or but but but its related to reproduction and indeed in our lob we have not looked at romanticism we have looked at are our looking at reproduction they are not always the same m certainly gan n animal familiar or terrestrial mammalian reproductive behavior is is dominated by by the sense of smell in mammals and here remember initially ewe started off i i noted that their several subsystems in our nose that transducer ortolans an in primarily the the manual factory system the which is cranial er number one and the trigeneral nerve which is cranial number five a most terrestrial mama's have another subsystem referred to as the the a secondary factory system that has a separate sense organ in in the nose this organ is known as the former nasal organ it is a a small pit in the nasal passage of of most terrestrial mama's sometimes it is a described is a communicating pit because sometimes it connects the nasal passage to the roof of the mouth sometimes it come connects both and there is the sense organ with its specific receptor subtypes a dinars vermornazal receptors and a this mum's link to u to us sort of separate portion of the a factory ball not really e man patrigalbotserfrit as the accessories factory ball amend from their directly to the limbic system to the to the portions of the brain the control reproductive behavior an aggressive behavior and and in most a terrestrial mammals this subsystem process's durance there are sometimes referred to his ceremony a o that is in many ways of problematic term but but durance that are intros firms gamete odorancs that are melted by another member of the species to influence o that member of the species and altar behavior or hormonal state and and in some of these personal effects are are utterly remarkable and in my view the most remarkable of all as an effect known as the brush effect ah this was an effect discovered by margarita brace in nineteen fifty nine she was a a brutish a scientist and in the brace effect when you expose a pregnant mouse at an early critical stage of the pregnancy i think up to about day three ah if you expose the pregnant mouse ah to the odor of what is referred to in technical terms is the non stud male that is a male who did not father the pregnancy she will miscarry the pregnancy she will aboard it now that that is an insane decision made by the female hereright because she is invested quite aloud in this right in in in biological terms and in informing this pregnancy and maintaining it and yet she drops it on the basis of an odor a and this effect is remarkably robust and what do i mean by remarkably robes o this will occur on about eighty per cent of exposures nous eight eighty per cent is a hundred per cent in biology right i mean there is nothing that happens it more than beg per cent it is a remarkably remarkably robust effect this this dropping of the pregnancy and we know it is mediated by memo sensation to to not sure and we know in the following way first it is enough to just bring the over of the instead male you do not have to bring the male himself wrights to scan bring bedding from a none male ad that will induce a the brush effect but of course the most telling set of experiments that if in the female mouse you ablate the former a naval organ you just burn the tiny structure in the nose the effect disappears the effect is completely dependent on the former naval organ am and i find this outcry a remarkable fact right i mean i beck because again because of the the extent of of cost hat the the female takes on here ah based on on this information in smell now humans the sort of the going notion in all faction is that humans do not have a functional vomerinazal organ we do not have that a functional organ in our nose now it'll point out we actually do have the pit the the the structure or the outlining structure is there ah but the pit that we have is considered vestigial an nonfunctional what about this thing i learned about at berley ah in inagreato biology class that we have something called jacobson's organ this is the same organ jacobus n organs is the former naval organ ah it is also called jacobson because a i think jacobson was a military physician in the eighteen hundreds in homeland or something and he founded in in in the soldier who as operating on or something that that tattle story comes from something that but but that jacobus an organ is another name for the former nominal organ these are one and the same the sensory organ of the accessories factory system and again the go in notion is that the human jacobson organ or from penis organ is festival it is non functional does that necessarily mean that we do not have these harmony effects now it does not first of all we know that lots of what are considered for immortal effects namely social sumo signing in rodents are mediated by the manual factory system we know that for short i there are several examples for this and mice an rats and rabbits and sone and forth a a these can be made mediated by by the manual factory system and and and all it'll come back to that in second first to finish the brace effect am and and second and and ism going out on a limb here ah but ism willing to take that that a risk i ism for me the jury is still out on human vomeranazal organ am that the decision or that the notion ah that it is non function all relies on about one and a half papers puss more ah looking for the nerve that connects this thing to the brain and failing to find it using staining and on is forth but standing pop more studies in humans are are notoriously complicated am basically know for many reasons one of them is that the material is just always has gone through it is it is not ideally a set as it is when you sacrifice an animal and an and and study it is its tissue am based on on really really posit of studies that fail to find ah this nerve the notion is that the structure is vestigial a inhuman i do not have any evidence that it is function upon you but but ism just not sure that it is n odd but i what we do have a suspicion is that humans may expert e an something similar to bruciffect firstofall humans have an enormous a number ratio of of a of spontaneous miscarriage are they a occurring more often in the first tryster because you mention yes that in the brace effect in the miss in the first three days or falling out pageant which in the male gustation as i recalls about twenty one days in the masseur form at one seventh of total gustation some ism not quick enough to to nor is it important to translate but this will be first tryster yes which is the early most when most miscarriage occurs now he humans have again a huge number of miscarriages and and the numbers all all soon share them with you that they sound odd and the reason they sound odd is because if if you have what is sometimes simply refer to his failed in plantation right this can occur in days one to nobody ever knows one o some papers talk about ninety per cent of all human pregnancies and in miscarriage this is counting a failed in plantation in day on to et camera more conservative studies talk about fifty per cent nobody will argue thirty percent o case of a huge number a huge number of of a human pregnancies and in miscarriage now out of these there's a portion that are are unexplained rights o nobody knows why i mind there are portion that are explained by all sorts of genetic factors developmental factors and son forth but there is also a proportion that are unexplained and and and all ism saying is that there's there's a statistical back drop or setting if you will for something a remnant bruseffect in humans now with that in mind we we approach to group a f we we we enlisted a group of of of they're not really patience and participants in in a study of people who couples who are experiencing hat is referred to is is unexplained repeated pregnancy loss formerly if you have a two consecutive a unexplained miscarriages than a that that is sufficient for the diagnosis of unexplained repeated pregnancy loss however in our cohort of thirty we had couples who experience twelve consecutive unexplained repeated regency losses to the two the two is just the formal all of our covert was twelve five you knows it is an emotional difficult place to be and and these are couples whowhoare losing a their currency for no apparent reason they have gone through all the test that you can imagine of nor genetic incompatibility is in all sorts of issues a clotting a all that all the the known suspects o for frepenancy loss and that the medical establishment remains totally at a loss is to why these princes aren't wholly and we hypothesized that that perhaps here there is something into to a brush type effect obviously scan be the same as a mice but but something a brush effect now of course at that image we could not do anything causal to totes this rip but what we could do is to see a in to seek circumstantial evidence to see if if where there is fire may be their smoke and what we did was we tested a all faction in more specifically the response to to male body order a in in the the couples experiencing am a repeated pregnancy loss and we found a few things first of all if you think of the mechanism is behind the buceeffect the brucine implies that the female has to have a very clear memory of a the bothering male because if she is going to miscarry in response to the godfather she has to know father ndonfather i mean that means that there is a pronounced or factory memory at the moment of meaning o can and in mice this has been very well characterized in and attributed to the arterial factory nucleus a structure in the brain m but you'll have to have this memory in order to make that decision now to address that and hear your going to see that you in your childhood story from before stand out of it as as a skilful is that the first thing we did was just behaviourly test a whither am these women and control women could identify the smell of their a spouse and you might be disappointed or we would all a rally a bit disappointed to learn that control women a very poor at this you would think that that women would be hooded identifying the body order of their spouse they are not are there not far from chance however am the women who experience a repeated princyloss are more than their their double a at their performance level this not a aunt's effect a women who who who w experience repeated a princes can identify their husbands or their spouses a by their body order with much greater acuity than the typical person double a bit more than double and wat an way above thanks y know the i i posses a question what i bent yes with much greater acuity a an double as it is significant a improvement are they much better at detecting any no or no they are not we did the controls and they are not and then am we also measured using atom more we measured their their brain response to a stranger male body order and there an an an this was quite remarkable because we approach this was a full bring analysis without a region of interest and lysis it is not is if you ere a tweaking your statistics to look at one part of the brain you are just looking at the entire brain and the response to male body order in asking dey envoys the are difference between these two groups of participants and there is one huge difference and it was in the hippotholemis and there was a difference in response to stranger male body order a between the two groups am old faction is altered in spontaneous repeated spontaneous appetency loss we do not know this is causal right a but but that was enough for us to approach the ethics committee am to run a causal experiment am and were at the beginning of that now incredible i cannot wait to hear the the results of the it is entertainment it will probalytace years am a few recut because the these are slow experiments to run a recruitment is complicated a but basically were we are blocking am we are blocking smell in in a couples who are trying to maintain a privacy i want to touch on some other a called foreman effects and one thing i heard you say during a talk which i think really captures this wholdissue of are there daimon effects in humans am very nicely as you said whether or not it is a classic for foreman effector whether not its all faction or something else this is most sensory signaling between individuals a the reason this is important me is a few years ago i did a social mediopost about farm effects and animals and some potential farm effects in humans and a couple of the a human a of factions does a more from the the i shall who work on animal models really came after me with a intense sniffing saying ah there is no evidence for human fermonof facts human from organs and i think to day you have beautifully illustrated how regardless of the answer to that humans are contain and remitting chemical signals that influence each others physiology and behavior for sure for sure and and the term firm is a problematic term in any case i mean the term the term was a put forth to describe insect behavior right if if you were given a hard time by the mouse people you could have given and eat them and equally hard time if you were an insect person right because really at the place he term it is is a is accurate is hunts o the first firm that was discovered was bambiccal which is the firm that has the male moth follow the the see trail of the female moth barbican is a sermon a insect firm people will argue that the stuff that people talk about in mice and rats is not fermions and and it all become semantic yet they were line nerdy inside ball let's all semantic i do not it'd in our publications we do not use the term fermion because it would not help me and it would probably only hurt us and we talk about limo signals and humans definitely emit limo signals from their body and these limo signals influence other humans and influence their behavior inn an an that their several examples of this one of them all all point out first which is is thought of the most widely studied and and not mostly for our lab actually i mean that hate flavor of the month for the past ten years in this field is what is refrichis the smell of fear right to a this is probably truth of many mama's and humans a it is true of i we emit a specific body order when we are in a state of fear ah this was first discovered in humans by dense when m out of i think brown not think that is right human submit a particular body order when they are in a state of fear and this body order or influences other humans in effect increasing their autonomic a arousal their sympathetic state am in effect you could say that fear is contagious a bit said the smell of fear is contagious by the way culturally we know for ages that dogs can smell burin humans but actually that was only really showing about a year and a half ago in a study sodas always said but it was not really showing effectively was showing about i were an a half a going study the dogs indeed can smell human fear a and humans can smell human fear several labs starting from penis when and javelin ones and and then in our late and another labs a if if you collect body order from people in a state of fear and collect body order from the same people when they are not in a state of fear a other people can determine which is is the state of feuar not and and this influences their behavior what about the smell of safety or is that simply the absence of the odor corresponding to fear and the reason i asked us is somewhat woven into our a prior discussion about mate choice am again all asked the question in a form of of brief anecdotes a it'll use that i had a friend to a approach here but a well one phenomenon has nothing to do a with me in particular i think this is a common phenomenon is am romantic partners leaving articles of clothing at each others homes now this could have other purposes to mar story but am usually marking territory but also am sent marking territory is very common in the animal kingdom a it is not uncommon a for a romantic partners when one is raveling or away for the other partner to smell their article of clothing in order to bring about positive a connotations have the other partner very uncommon behavior for doing this folks i ever other people are doing this too it raises questions for instance about whether or not the morning period part outbreak up weather by decision by death or by am some other phenomenon that is forced the break up am whether not that morning period has something to do within old factory unlearning a a am and made such and on and on and with all hes insides i wad off for you to be oppostockin well i was go i this i ha t apical in i would love ti was admass going to kill media that you do not wen me tour i you t about as once wen a ice a it there is a story a wen nous e for a i telly an a o an i as the do not really were i really as i was for in fact that have had three incredible scientific meters a undergraduate graduate in postdoc but am for reasons a that are unclear to me am a first one died of suicide the second one cancer at fifty in the third one am pancreatic anger in his early sixties and the last one before he died who is an empty in a common frond of comes and i turned to me and said after you are the common denominator am know that the i had the this no is as as you do r r none the less i would love to does magical in your la that when i was trying to say in that round about ways that this are all really keen observations and good ideas i for sure and and and the is high light again you knew that that we are incredibly of factory animals have and and in your you are even told about the newancs we are very old factory even not in the wants i me i have this when people tell me that we do not use our sense of smelling we do not need it in a that and and i i have to deal with this lot right after heal lot you study vision nobody's tell you that vision is in important right have i visually dependent i do not need a dog to take over mile factory system if i local faction but it'll tell you from having lost my sense of smell or never one day ay rid i was in intense fear i bid into blue i love blueberries a a dry by blueberry eaters or there i just cone to pick them up a girly barren ramekin in my mouth keep them away from me if you do not want the mean but i cannot i almost cannot help myself i bid into a blueberry or a handful of blueberries and they just that was the sensation of little bags of water and i immediately fell a present h it tremendous reef open a sot of a a throw a line that i use in this one when i talk with people you know i i i mean take the two most basic behaviors that sustain us right let us a i give you a choice between a beautiful looking leer cake with with with strawberries and blueberries and and n and with cream but that smells of stage verses some gray brown makes that smells of cinnamon which do you eat a simple the are right you eat the latter right now imagine i offer you a mate choose the the gender of your liking right that looks a green god or goddess right but smells of stage or an ordinary looking individual that smells of in itself who do you choose the latter wrist in the two most basic behaviors we have we follow our nose not our eyes right ten i not always in predictable ways because you offered an extreme example which is the best example but i for instance for reasons i do not know have never the smell of perfume ever in fact i find it aversive but i do i confess i do the smell of certain body orders very much and ism very in particular about that and i know within an instant and a this is a problem for any romantic partner a who likes perfume for me an i know many people perfumes and colones and things that lower and eagerness have also been told am that a by some one that they could not spend time with me because they do not my smell in fact they dislike it and i and fortunately for me there is at least one person on the planet whoa as a whoso e am i completely agree with what you are saying u i can also say that i imprinted on the smell of minable dog mastiff when they raise from the time he was a puppy and i imprinted on i imprinted on his smell immediately and even though to other people he was be dog mastiff after all his small with was rather aversive to me he he smelled delicious right i and a anything it smelled home and he was my best animal for raddling ta and on and on and on write the smell of children as you said the back we had a guest on this pogges to insure your family charges looker a professor colombia has done incredible for in vision a thirstsensin and he and i talked li it about this that there is something in the great of romantic partners that is hopefully a positive not aversive as well as in children he was talking that the smell of his grandchild the bat the nape of their n the back of their neck and how he misses that smell be when he thinks about missing his grandchild or children it is that smell that that that is associate with that filling hex decanal hex decanal yes is at charges a your grand children smell hex decanal yes getteven after me now antis this is a sexy a ran by a ivamisure a who was a graduation in our lap am and and via was interested in aggression she was really into aggression am and actually when she start an an enrich when she start off we keepers to keep a signaling of aggression she actually was going mama clubs and collecting body odors ah and were had all sorts of ideas going and anchischi worked on that quetibit it never went anywhere really and then at the same time we had a colleague of ours a from germany i mean my a college primary a friend a acquaintance i went at conferences am hinds beer am and an am he was studying in his lab a molecule hexadecimal am that was a him signal in mice were in mice it was described as a limo signal that promotes social buffering were social buffering as far as i understand it is not my field but as fir as i understand its basically a feel good together a thing when lots of mice are together they feel good about being in a group and that social buffering and it is promoted by hexadecimal which they omit in their fishes mice and in his work on hexdecanal am and en so beer and his colic sportsmen they they discovered the receptor for this and then they went and discovered that the receptor is very highly conserved u throughout mammalian evolution and therefore they hypothesized that may be a this is a universal mammalian signal now which is unusual because in in limo signaling typicallyten to think of things as being very specie specific but here they hypothesized that may be hexadecimal which promote social buffering in mice may do something in all mama's again because this receptor is very highly conserved o our thirty seven b i think am they he approached us and said look you got a study the stuff in humans right because he knows us is the human people all right i mean we go to these all faction come fences were we are lots of people study mice and and enzebrafish and what not n wether the human group and an eventually he just medic us hex decanal and and we have this thing sitting around and era was not going anywhere with her aggression studies with sweat from human participants and yet she built the entire a powradine to study human aggression they are standard paradises this is a power dime knowing as the tap the taler aggression paradise it'll soon describe it and we said came we have the tea de canal stuff here and it promote social buffering social buffering sounds it would make you less aggressive why do not you run your tap experiment using hexidecanal what is the tap experiment basically what you do is you bring in a participant to lab and you have them a thinking that they are can be playing against another person and in this game and you can you can do something have another person walk into the other room playing on line t connected you can fool them into being quite convince that this is what is happening and they go into their own room and and the initial game they play ism on each round there a they are provided with a sum of money and this is real money thatched will receive at the end of the experiment and by turn each one of them decides how to divide the money up between the two right o they are playing against another person they think but that is actually a computeralgara them hat they are playing against and the computer altar them is is program to be in inside toxic terminology a jerk right that that say the have to dive up a hundred checked which is the israeliccarency the come of the other player would the oke it'll keep ninety six and you get for right and then if you can either accept it or not accepting the neither of you get anything right basically are being shafted by by the other side all the time and this is called the provocation pase you are really getting angry at this person because they are they are really not nice right thither are shafting yon every trial or almost and you play this game an and it goes to its end and then you split you play a second game as far as against the same participant and the second game is a reaction time game a target chose up and the first to press it winds and on every trial where you win if you want you can blast the other parts spent with a loud noise and and it is a really loud noise you are also wearing your finds it is ninety d b and it is it is a screeching horrible sound it is the most punishment that an baby committee will let you an endure on a parliament an experiment unless you are on standard seventy years ago whatever that was now is i i the the classic prepare we place in the i e her t we wen we you can blast the other parts spent with very levels of sound and you have a selection box from something very low to something very high and what is nice about this is it then allows you to quantify aggression because the more volume your blasting the opponent with the more aggressive you are towards your opponent and and you have a measure of aggression again the color aggression paradise obviously invented by color very well validated studied all over a a very standard protocol awe brought in partispence and had them play a the taler of the tap either under exposure to next a decanal or control now exidecanal does not it is it is incredibly difficulty even detect test a decanal but just in case because it is not very its consider a semipholatile it does not have a strong smell but we buried it both the control and the decanal and in a a control order that hid them in a mask and and she ran lots and its and lots and lots of parts spence men and women and it'll first ell you the result with men which is that hexadecimal consistently reduced aggression people were less aggressive under hexadicanal a the effective was was a a quite meaning full and later on we learned because ism no specialist in the world of aggression but compared to effect seen in the aggression world n in research really really strong effects unusually strong hex decanal lower aggression and men and we were quod this is sort of what we were hoping to topee consistent with he hypothesis a and consistent with it seems to do in mice but then we looked at the data from women and hex decanal increased aggression equally significantly is this tout to be something related to maternal protective not getting there you you a got their really fast it took me a year but and and n e i got to it really it all it'll tell you because we remember were reaching the back of the head of your of o a whose was it a grandchildren are otegersto the shall de a one of the kingpins of the new york neuroscience mafia yes a this was really odd to me at that time d i did not have the intuition you just had and i was via this there was some bug here ism in this this it makes no sense to me you know why would something increase aggression in women and decreased aggression in men this is really really strange and and asidocat i want to see this happen again before we go ahead with this she went into the entire experiment again and this time she did within the efemoroi magnet that we we can also a track a brain activity on while this was happening and first of all it replicated again once again a hexadecimal men made men less aggressive and women more aggressive and an and the extent of more than the effect alone the dissociation was remarkable this has it it is almost a comas aldol test i mean you look at the date on the unit unit slope line and all all the men are above a below and all the women are above thou there is a figure in the paper then sh she also looked at the brain date and n this is although our lab does ahunof efemari it is one of the major tools we used to measure a a brain activity ism ism ism quite cognizant of the limitations of efemrin and and this is i think sadly i think the only studying my cry at least where were actually managed to also get a mechanism out of elemi not only an area that is involved in activity and and hers what we saw that hexidecanal alone increased activity quite pronouncedly in an area of the brain known is the left angular wrists now this is an area involved and what referred to a social appraisal that was kind of cool in that a social order activated the social brain not the factory system person and and very pronounced on one hand that was cool but then what was uncool was that it did the same in men and women and this was in contrast to behavior which you do not seeing right i me because you would expect brain activity reflect behavior and it increased activity in the left angerlege iris an both both men and women but then she did to follow up analysis which was look at what is referred to his functional connectivity that is how does this region of the brain talk with the entire brain as it were under hexidecanal verses o control and here the dissociation reemerged powerfully whereby the connectivity from the angular grist was mostly to the classic neral substrates of aggression to the migdella and the temporal pol and the connectivity went in opposite directions in men and women hex decanal increased functional connectivity in men in decreased it in women in a way this is almost saying that the default brain reaction is aggression right the default is to aggress and in men hex decanal increases the control that the left anglatiris is holding over your aggression and in keeping you back and in women it let it room free and they became more aggressive but i was still apostle solo i was convinced this happened twice the email data provided not only a pattern but a mechanism which is unusual and yet i i was telling ye what but it others makes no sense to me and then and then her inside which of course afterwards is ta it is now there is a place where this makes perfect sense and that is if you were a familiar offspring because paternal aggression is often directed at you there is infanticide all over and sadly there's male aggression towards human children as well and maternal aggression is often protective if you are an offspring if you have a molecule that will make your mother more aggressive in your daddy less aggressive both of those are good for you you're winning we remember a recently published paper from a group in japan that looked at the orders emanating from baby heads we now come full circle to circus grandchildren they used a method known as g c as gascomataripu spectrometry a to measure the volatiles from baby heads because baby head odor is a cultural thing across cultures even in japan and we quickly went to that paper and to see if one of the molecules that report is hexidecanal and we were very disappointed that it was not one of the molecules that reported in the paper and we we wrote to the authors who are since then are coauthors a and we said look were studying a the molecule exidecanon we do not senor results and and we were wondering maybe you had some results that you did not public assure some supplementary till or whatever and at this lap which is a hard work s laps ad no no hex decanal a semi volatile which we knew a and our previous paper was not directed to the semivolatile range but we can now do use what is called g c x g c double g s that a is directed at semivoltas and can do this again we just a studied o levin babies and we can we can see if the sis nest society a please do a the bottom line of all this is that hexadecanels the most abundant semivolatiland baby heads it is tons of it coming out baby heats babies again speaking about a humans to pardon amusing of babies are conducting chemical warfare right there there there producing aggression an their fathers or males around them and increasing aggression an their mothers or females around them and both of those things are good for them incredible this is somewhat different than what we are talking about am and yet similar in other ways a because it is a built off of anecdotal evidence mud its anecdotal evidence that you hear all the time and yet when you look in the scientific literature at least by my read the data are not clear maybe even contradictory and that relates to the coordination of menstrual cycles among confused e women were women who are friends the o many women listening to this the maybe some men who are aware of of this effect will say oh ya absolutely when i spend time with my friends or go away camping or even spend a day with them our menstrual cycles become coordinated however my understanding is that the early literature barbarian client correct am discover this phenomenon publish a paper in science as an undergraduate and en seventy one nature amazing nature the paper again one of the three externals and as an underage fantastic discover this describe that and a probably women all over the world who became aware of this one way or another by probably said yes absolutely this gives validation to what we observed hover an overran and yet as subsequent papers have been published this result has been called into question is is there any a final word on whether or not menstrual cycles a become coordinated among women who spend time together and if is there any roll of faction in this a work a sumo sensing through the nostrils on and er mouth a to support this idea ya servo indeed to echo a the background is that this study was conducted by by maltha my flintlock when she was an undergraduate lesbian college a and she noticed that she thought her menstrual cycle and and her inhabitants in her darkroom am am were coordinated in time am and i should say that this comes on the basis of similar or related type affects in prudence no ruin son have a menstrual cycle humans do a be but am there is a an affection ruins refutes the written effect which am resembles a this type of of of effect m and she published indeed that papers an undergraduate n nature nineteen seventy one and to answer your question she published to follow up in nineteen ninety eight also in nature a with then her graduates in chico a stern this is stern and my flintlock nineteen ninety eight and here is what they did they a collected am sweat from done women and deposited it on the upper lip of recipient women this would be a fine experiment for you at least weeks we said you body orders but for many others perhaps it would be daunt in who li as certain body orders from certain individual a i do not i don't think i uniformly all by yours although i do i uniformly not the smell of perfume although i sou just declare by this to the an hear in the hardly commendation of into some of those perfumes i find downright aversive e that a i think the great markets master great nor by ales in the others basic three responses to either bug ya or met some i a true i never heard that a n inter animal behavior rather earn are or to or pause a some are truly a each some many are met zero to date or yum for me now body orders the distribution is shifted it could be any one of those three yum major met just to be clear but they the a yum category is definitely included say for for a so a a seeded the study because right in the original my into study you might suspect other a drivers of the efecteveility six you accept the effect but still there might be other social drivers of the effect the are no body ore writ er might be some dominant women whose dominant in some other way and this might be driving the coronation right here there was no direct link between these women other than body order if the effect re emerged a it would definitely be ana factory effect and what she found is that if she took a sweat from the follicular or the aviator abase of the donors one attended the cycle and recipients and one shorten the cycle in recipients i do not remember which was which but but basically a a definitely denoting a a limo signaling effect a with with the opposing a a effect on duration based on the time it was collected from again published in nature in nineteen ninety eight that is it i i that there is a a quotation i think this is from from ma from from ma ism not sure but but that that a a if something is published in a nature or science that does not necessarily mean it is not true a with that in mind i the findings were since called into question quite widely i one reason is just statistics of picnic events are surprisingly complicated it is tricky it is once you have a cyclic events statistics become tricky and ansoshu maltha took a lot of heat on the statistics of of claiming an effect and i think there was at least one effort of replication that didn't really work out i if you asked me ism on the fence i and but ism stay be in a minority in my field i think a majority in the field is currently negative ism not i and have we have said in lab that we should do a planned replication i we will it is again it is a horrible study to run it is tins of work and in it and you have to run it for really long time a and and a its completely non trivial a but we have gradus now and lab interested in these exact things a rude wise grossence and she is doing similar stuff and i hope we will do that i hope we will try to to replicate this i very interesting result and i think interesting because of its u real world a meaning outside the laboratory of course our experiment analogue but also because feremonaffects and a factory effects in humans seem unique among a nurbiological slash endocrine phenomena because there seems to be many stories that we all have of the smell of our grandmother's hands or the recognizing the sent of of somebody or i knew from the moment that i smelled their breath or a or i just liked their smell kind of thing these a kind of things that that inform the the deep potential for a real biological phenomenon as supposed to the kind of thing o i you nay just throw something out there oxytostan is bonding and and all a sudden that the general public not at no to no fault to their own comes to think that every every aspect of bonding is is oxytocin and every defect in bonding is lack of oxytos and but the the general publicprovides a sort of a rich it is voter for for exploring all these things and in ofttimes they turn out to be true i won't in the congelable act yetnoits it is a very primal system sides its link to the most limbic primal mechanisms in our brain and it drives primal behavior it it is an incredible system i i have a question about a particular study but ism just going a cut up and you will know immediately what i ism chewing up and that is what is the relationship between odors and hormones and in particular crying as i pointed out previously the the out of flavor of the month and inhuman social sumo signaling researches the smell of fer and the the media of the month a sweat writes o am the the few maybe tens of blabs in the world that study a human social sumo signalling all collects sweat and and that is the media ah they look at is it always from the are that for as there are the meaning full differences in arms the sweat fitted from different locations on the body i already know the answer that as i ask it but let you stay above the wast line and am kimono yes it sore below thwart line of a we are biologist after all we we resorts it is funny we we we have were working n a paper on that right now i on the smell of fear ah is we have a nice paradise for a generating fear we throw people out of air planes it is a very effective way to genera can to come to your lab i to the gran e having there we we did not invent that by the way i the first to do that was a and i hope on pronouncing her name correctly i think its mujik pe rude am but madam that is our paradise for generating fear and we started that on our own but a we have since entered into collaboration with the is rally partriper's brigade and we now collect body over from every first time jumper am we we went that path because we everybody else in this field that the holy grail there is is finding the molecules right i mean i you'll have the fear molecules that is banana right because i mean you could think of many reasons why would be a banana but for yen if if you find the molecules youyou can then find find the receptors and when you find the gonna receptors you can then develop walkers and you can imagine a ma am what is the throne for am m switching to he brew it is about midnight now i am am sorry ya warning you don't in capably hon considering never the morning we would never know a again to day from israel he is at mesas circadian inverted as we a ah anxiety a you can imagine developing a naval spray against anxiety right were were you would quell those receptors and kill the response right which rather than going to can path which is through r transmitters that then have effects all over the place you would be getting fear at its force rights o that would be why i would want that and and and we forget out the doing that collecting fear three four or five people a in an experiment you will never be able to do apolitical chemistry on that we now have a w we have a a setting we call fear bank a which now has more than a thousand samples in it were trying to do a analytic on that but but in doing that we wee join that the crowd everybody is doing fear and everybody's doing sweat and in one of our discussions and lab er saying where there is on a be you know or their potentially daffily could be additional bodily media that are our plain to social keep signaling a now many of these you cannot really study you right i mean just to throw it what most terrestrial mama's communicate social information through urine a but starting doing experiments with humans with smelling grand it would be difficult both in o our b and an agreement and and and then we we we i know this is a rare case where we actually hypothesized what we saw to do and need only claim in retrospecthat it was hypothesis ah is is tears on we we started thinking about tears and looking into tears because tears are bodily liquid emotional tiers that that we admit in emotional situations where were these are situations were non verbal communications is critical and key and and tears are liquid that that is puzzling beyond ocular maintenance ran and you know the the most influential text i think till this day and in in emotion researches is drawings book hah the showing of the emotions and man and animals i think is the full name of the book and an entire chapter chapter six is devoted to tears an entire chapter of this book why we with no conclusion why because the book revolves around describing the functional anticidance of emotional expressions for example a showing of the teeth as a sign of aggression writes animals first bit with their teeth and and darn argued the revolution a just a showing the teeth alone became an aggressive sign because it started from biting or what i i find as it is a beautiful example in this work partly done by by madam andiron you at kernel i is is the a emotional expression of disgust disgust which comes from one disgozy a distaste right is spinning something out of your mouth now what what madam show it is is that the musculartrpatterns of activation and the temporal sequence of activation when you experience moral disgust are the same as when you pit of bitter taste out of your mouth writes again there is a functional anticipant spinning something out and through revolution the argument was that it became an expression of emotion and you express disgust just as if you are spinning something out of your mouth even though there in the case of moral disgust there is nothing you are spinning out of your mouth darn systematically went through the expressions of emotions and for each one went to their functional anticipant and explained everything very nicely and then he got stuck with tears right because tears are an obviously emotional expression and he could not find a functional a anticipant he ended up saying that this is an epic phenomena base fly right i i do not what all signs do when he a i blame it nature it but he bothered to write this entire chapter on on on the ocular sort of maintenance common function of tears and sons but but nothing emotional we thought we may be the function is is a chemical signal and and with that in mind we we harvested emotional tears ah which was also an amusing event on its own right because we we a we am we we posted messages on all sorts aboard that that a were seeking am experiment participants who cry with ease now this generated an unfortunate gender by us in our study right because we received t about a hundred women volunteers and about one man and you know i think this is not a problem only and in macho israel right probably anywhere in the west this would having defy in america would be the same he my guess is that there probably men out there who cry easily emotional tears oh am sure there is noting a show well yea that ism saying that cultural thing it is not you unaware not onto come to labia a i cry all the time this has not gone happen ah and then a we we what we did is out for each one of these participants we would ask them as there are particular film event that of that your seen that it makes you cry and and interestingly in these effective criers there is away oh yes the scene and in and i always cry profusely from that that they have early an example of a one of the more commonly fans am it withes am the move the champ the channel dies he is a boxer and he dies and it literally in the hands of his about eight year old son and his son is standing next to his bed and sain champ champ and and he dies right it is o winner motet honorfall the a so e know we are probably the her biology lab with most sad move films on those shells in the world right o a whole costume collection standing as deers on joy a i no no well we are going head of ourselves us if we try to collect them and failed a even people who think they shed tears of draw and laughter their eyes water bit but it is not the same thing with in in in the effective criers wend up screening i innit we collect a full m ell of tears a full tell of tears in about fifteen minutes that is poring ray and that does not happen from laughter that for we have never having that we have never seen that happened from o we grout a a we have we have all these sad films and by one of the amusing things is when we ultimately published this paper and in science a we were forced in retrospect to on actually buy the films right we inured know originally we download dit wear there but you cannot because your be violating a you know our contrary laws right we had to buy purchase all these films t the parts and watch them it is tho we re actually have these and lab divides you know that we actually purchase a but solo a coverage of potential legal fall a no no we did i berereliely s that in yet and and while we can touch on that later but but a so am we took most of these a a volunteers who who come saying they can cry with ease actually do not meet the bill a and out of the bout hundred at lest more women that we screened we ended up with about six who w could really come to lab week after week and porters there is a name for this in cychatry they call it a a narrative distancing some people when they watch a film where some one's getting hit they they they they flinch quite a lot they it is almost as if they are experiencing it it but it worse in the opposite direction to i know some one this a where if they watch a film that some one's experiencing something even mildly positive that they are moved elevate they they can quickly bridge am and it is not always adaptive as you can imagine there is lack of narrative distance in rat ye what one our issue yo can bring up with the centurion of studies ow louis is i do not know if there is something very unique about the donors right and were assuming these are tears and notice is pretty common i think that the numbers i shut a out there about five to eight per cent it is exactly what we got about rancho six till we collected a am tears and and we exposed a participants a to these tears and and we found a few things first of all the tears are completely odorless you cannot detect them at all completely odorless m and yet when you sniff them you have a pronounced a reduction in testosterone a within about twenty minutes half an hour this is men and women smelling manminstears has men daily woman's tears but not perceiving any odor nothing just sniffing them and you have a about a fourteen per cent drop in freetestostron free o case o this is testosterone that is already been liberated from the testes freelance or the we done a few torment that is a either bound or unbound is announce balmy am from six or minding login et camera and it is the active form it is it is a it is subject to very short time seal changes ye and and this is people who we study tistostron which is not me but they tell me this is a really strong effect its it is hards even formochologically get an effect that that fast i yen know inform apology yet years ago on time studying indecent effects of this sort main that is a the tremendous resided a fact and here all point on passing a that ah what one of the concerns we had because of the a effort to run the study is that nobody would ever try to replicate it and to our joy about two years later an independent group from a a south care a owe it ill i do not know at all a replicated the testosterone effect to a t i mean same numbers a it it lowers testosterone and an and then also looked a using em are at the at the a am effect on brain activity and a pronounced a of effect on activity a dampening a lowering of activity under under a arousing state a lowering of activity a both in the hippotholemist am and in the fusiform girls for whatever reason i those are recognitionary amongst other things yes am and we do not know why a but pronounced am and currently am chair growing in our lab is replicating this again and this time a with a stronger behavioral component am and i can share with you a unpublished a data now under review am that is as you would expect given the effect on tistostron perhaps a sniffing tears lowers aggression in meant ah using again the tap the same experiment used by even in the a ex ad economexperiment the tally outer to think of that is the the sadist the titular said the titration n he latest titrate the tailor a egression paradise a no o one the pilgrim experiments of the of the nineteen fifties which post a this was looking at sort of a posthaulacost behavior you not people basically tor in america laboratories thinking they were torturing other people simply because they were told to and a lot of people did that even though most peoplwould report that they would never torturous yea no humans are not a wonderful species or i think it was the the great car young said a we have all things inside of us but am a the the goal is not to experience them all certainly am it is an i credible study and it points again to the the power of of a these limo sensory systems and pathways and obviously there is much here am an i know n tough you want me to to tell about this rononand i guess you contended it out o legal but a this is just in assuring stories about the politics of science and an where is the effect on tistoston was was a replicated by by an independent group am in the original study and in science where we had we it had three components one was the effect on tistostron which was robes the second which was brain activity which was roast and there was a significant but weaker effect on behavior and i do not think we studied the right behavior in retrospect what we looked at then was a readings of arousal associated with pictures and there there was an effect it was significant but it was it was not what carried the story am now there is the lab in homeland a of a guy by the name of hint an probably mispronouncing this but i think it finger boats for the non dutch ye dutch names are always ability of a challenge but and i should say that at being in railway i should go too much on that line but made that lab really did not our original tear story and the reason they did not it is because they the built a career on this notion a including a book with this title that emotional tears are uniquely human now here i should be well i should char us one to one of the things we really liked about that that the a tear result is that partially before we did our work but more afterwards and and we that because usually things usually in our memo signalling work what i told you before about the brace effect we look at what happens om ruins and we see if the same things happening in humans this was a rare case hereafter we did this work a morale's identical effects were discovered rodents a a paper published in nature two years later found that mouse tiers a mouse posters lower aggression an in man adult mice towards them in in a smell dependent we am n n they also actually found the actual component in tears that the tear foreman that lowers aggression rights s youknow this has us thinking of agree it as tears as s as you can think of tears is a chemical blanket in a way that your covering yourself up again with in or to protect against aggression right and and our finding which to me i mean this is consistent with how i think about behavior now i i do not think in a beyond language there are very few things deffenatly sensory things that are uniquely human i i i ad be hard pressed but our finding went as know against there their story right because here were saying now you tears are this cameo violin mechanism all animals and by the way i you know disaster this entire debate about am six months ago there is a paper and can biology the dogs emit emotional tears and and there is ta the dogs admit emotional tears when they reunite with their owners and you were talking before about about a oxytocin i think what they showed there is that not only that but that the the the view seem the tears in the dog influences oxytocin and in the humans i p ism getting this rig oi absolutely my the simian from from the time i brought costellohoma eight weeks old castellan your dog i as my daughter for ye ask w have along i shed the only time i can recall crying i listen i i certainly cried before a many times in my life ah many many times a the only time i ever recall crimes the point where i was not sure that i could keep producing three years but somehow it is when i had to put him down i is this that you known if i talk about too long now's are were on to now it is one of those things a i had i thing it is a healthy see o sure for sure but i recall when he was a puppy thinking this ox stand thing must be real because i can recall being in faculty meetings which you do not r fairly stator not always that interesting but there they could be pretty interesting and some one presenting data and my mind thinking i hope costellos oke what is he doing down in my office is when he was very little and also not meeting to eat not being able to focus on anything else except my attachment to him for about the first two or three weeks that madam then it was easy then i could focus off on other things and i think it i think the dogs perhaps through oxytos and high jack the circuitry that is not tended for child i really do otherwise why would people be ridiculously attached to their dogs me ha nice all the the posts of ever things their dog is the keenest daggers n ever things their children of the cutis g you i well teller s sea i salsa again they even but another nail in that story of a a tears are uniquely human they are not dogs shed emotional tears and and and so that really did not this and they went ahead and and tried to replicate and to your listeners am showing double lo quotations on the replicate only the behavioral part the raiding of arousal i a in women of women a and and fail to replicate that i say now the this was in you staring on how science works and does not work in my in my notion in this case at the time i after they got this accepted in some journal i not a field journal in the journal of memory of something i they contact in me for a a response and i i rod to the office i said look a this is very out to me why do not you come o when why don't we replicate the again together and see if it does not or if it does not work it'll publish it with you that it does not work but i and i said why do not you send over grandson tor the lead author and will do it here and will show them how it is done because they they did it very wrongly in the paper i and they replied that another not of money to send over a grandson to do it i replied saying craal fund the grade soon coming over and all fund the entire study and they stay and and forth and let us do this together and they replied no they are not willing to to do that which anon i do not think it is the way things should work a and and they publish this sort of fail a a behavioral effect and in that paper ism him just sharing the senor that it is not only there there was that successful replication with the the effect on test estrone but there was supposedly tispailed replication on the effect in in behavior i and in i published a a bottle on on that which i do not now if i should have done but i did well i think it is ait is interesting i made at the i think i provided studies are done correctly mean the the positive result almost always trumps the the negative result and yet i think replication is key the promise you point out is that replication is rarely pure replication of the ye i just mud this one is not unrontly but in i published the detail actually they hid something in their data that did partly droplight i asked for the dad and i reanalyzed it and that is what i published in the bottle but this is just sharing on on how signs for ks i i took advice to i it is not that this ism friends with him but at that time i was communicating a bit because we greoundsome board with with the with a dance comment who is no ball a ask in slot right and i asked him how how should i deal with this give me some advice here i was really you know was not emotionally not fun to be in that position and he said do not i do not do not never publish a bottle do not do anything is how can i know i have to do something said not do not because once you do that then people do not go into the details they will not read the details of your about although be well there is a group that says this and there is a group that as that it is unclear well and no i may i i appreciate the your bringing it up to day and i i do appreciate that you published the bottle and that you offered in a very magnetics way to to do a c that is what you then said that is its a commons advice after that was that well if you insist then just publish right a response that you offered them to to come do together they refused and there is nothing in do about that it is a lot a fight sports right people talk a lot of trap although in science i will say this yous all were on the the associolity of science the stay turn you word since is very different tan podcasting your social media or a other fields be is in science peoples generally are very kind to your face and then they you get it in i get it in the back on grant reviews or anonymous reviews am i was on the grants for you panel this morning ism a nice review or meaning i judge things objectively but i i try always a think from the perspective of the gradus tuner author of the of the proposal listen i i think that am science is is a game of of a people who most of them are seeking facts however the the ego is strongly woven into it any anything else i think it was a very magnanimous of you to offer the elaboration ism going to tell this lab whose name i cannot pronounce am please accept the collaboration the we can invite everyone on around table appreciate that you shared that story and i know a number of other people will for a number of reasons i have a couple of more questions am and i realize and thank you by the way for your a for your willingness and stamina because it is probably one i m israel time now and you just arrive o i think a but you are doing a terrifically well i i if you will indulge us just a a touch further there two topics that am i want a touch on in if you want to cover the in shorter thrift that is fine a though do not feel any obligation to am the first one is i think most people are familiar with the scent of food for foods as a signal of the nutrient contents of those fruits am an orange that smells gray tor the smell of something baking it in it it suggest something about the the contents and quality that fruit after all you and i both separately lived in the same apartment in barely above the cheese board which the smell of often to you cheese word i something i will never forget and there's never forget it ism amazing a great i i i do not know if you conveyed that clearly enough to listeners or watchers and the probability all test discovered that we lived in the same we have never met i mean to feet this before and we lived in the me exactly why we are lie friends in a lingering way yes i a loothroug throw t we strong the garboards it had a great floor of that place and a greet won floors in amazing place i live there with my girl friend for a year and a half and then it was a making ice a we will not give out the add for out of respect for the people to live there no a but you check out the cheeseboard if you ever in briskly their hours are weird but as you have to look on line but that there it is unique place with great bread and cheese and some good players of pizza a in any case ism wondering whether or not smell can signal things about the nutrient contents of foods in a way that is divorce from the smell that we are perceiving for instance i could imagine based on what you have told us about smell to day that i i i do not know why i i see i smell a a piece of meat cooking and it smells great to me and i think of it as a that savory and my mouth is watering and i love the smell of this and ism thinking coquet this is proline and fat and i love the taste of stake and a little bit of char but that nature has cooped that to in sure or i should say increase the likelihood that i will invest some other thing that is in stake for that has no odor but whose nutria content is very important me for instance a men ascites it right i mean i meanoacids are essential to life and yet am we do not go round sniffing for a mind acids we go round sniffing for savoring as mama type a a tartan and things of that sort i could imagine a million different examples of this in the same way i could imagine that the scent of somebody that we fall in love with or become romantically attached to or you sexually attracted to is signalling all sorts of things about sure the potential for offspring of a particular means dates that is a long term game but also am something about u a pleasure and safety of a potential interaction what ism asking here is about that whether or not there are subconscious signals that the am olfactory system has a learn to see but learn to seek through am more over signals or that the hypothec iceberg phenomena i do not have a good answer for you although i think it is a really good question u or or or good idea in fact whither whether there is over us o neutral value is a really good idea moreover it is probably good to the extent at somebody probably did it and i should know and do not we have not one anything on that line i do not know i do not know if if the neutrino value of food is systematically included in odor if that is not been done and i will check after a meeting to day than it should be hit is a really good idea an what won the resists is because am the be city crisis in the uses a hugeissue and elsewhere and highly process foods i have a lot of things that are problematic but one of things that they do not have a often is a direct relationship between the scent the taste and the strand the neutrino content a i do not mean macroneutriant sugar fat i accuse me a carbiderates fats in prolines but the the vitamins in microneutrians things that support the microbus whereas foods that are not highly pro us for instance meat or a piece of fruit a contain many micro butyrins that are vital to aspects of our village be wood not go round nothing for robotics it'll tell you one sort of factoid at may support your hypothesis here and that is that there appears to be potential or factory perceptible similarity in metabolic products something that is metabolized from something else as perceptible similarity across those those two things metabolic cascades plain to the coding of o factory space and and that is consistent with the direction your your our implying but again i do not i do not know of a direct test of lava of nutritional value in smell and an again the fact that i do not know does not mean of course that it does not exist in in this case i would suspect that it should exist am in scientific press and and if not there thane companies that have vested interest in this which are many o a briefly she dis dis lease and aneled and amusing anecdote to share with you is that we have received to independent a a pop me no companies who have turned to our lab recently a asking for help a to to bring odor to engineered meat rite that is a growing thing and all these into meats that are no the a to bring it up this this audience is going to be very polerazi along the a on the lines of engineered meat a no not from what you are not promote no not a am agnostic but but a but we have had got two companies turn to us and say looking an we have this great product but it just does not s ell meat help us make it smell me interesting the reason is polarizing is that anything relation nutrition on social media is a total barbed wire top we that ate on nutrition come on here we will have more as i i no nothing others or your say now o noise nothing is not promoting a that he has anyone said whether not he is going to help them out no we were not actually no not because e i just n i did not happen o that they the weather or not those a engineered meats are a young hacker tat is is a personal issue to people in terms of taste whether or not they are better for neutral or worse for you and the planet than given the ingredients that are require that is a a whole world will avoid now i pul but take it'll take that the opportunity that ta to high light something related may be because i on what were to say on the on the scale there is this en it'll take opportunity of misspell another misconception about all faction right there is this common notion that our sense of smell ism is incredibly subjective right and that what you might in the smell i will not in the smell in that we all have our own totally subjective world of all faction i think i know the study your in i tone they're many the cross cultural similar a they're many that that is utterly untrue many not only for my live there are many for many laps a poleaxe clarify for those that as a this ism ye humans are incredibly similar to one another an their all factory perception and this is contrasted with most people think why we s the thismisconception the misconception is there two reasons first of all or for several reasons but to are send out forestall were were attracted by outliers because hat ye it'll tell some body look forexsemple factory pleasantness is highly correlated amongst humans and let us first put this i numbers you will take a a bunch of humans in a bunch of odorancs and have them great pleasantness the correlation across a the humans will be about point eight that is incredibly hot incredibly high what do you think is pleasant i think it you ye now why why is that go against what culturally people think for to reasons first of all were were attracted or or based by outliers but that is particularly that show in fact the resalppet i means to you will tell some what you look people are very similar in their pleasant nessestimates and the sell that cannot be i love cilantro and my girl from hates the smell of cilantro right or in there few classic examples there guava right is another ah a pull arising odors there are few pole rising odors right and and that is true right that is true that half of the population loves the smell of cilantro and half hates it half love's guava half hates it that is jigerwave par pardon however i assure you that you can come to our lab we have about a thousand odors in our lab more we will not smell the thousand right but i assure you take a hundred odors okay from our mixtures and labs right and a we will smell them right and are the hundred odors ninety we will totally green right and in clouding you i mean nobody will say they the smell of fists or face smells and everybody ill say they the smell of rose and flowery smells there will be rare rare exceptions e and the corrlleys about point eight across individuals on ninety of a hundred will fly be in high agreements then five deodorants will be in sort of intermediate agreements and yes there will be the five deodorants that were in total disagreement on but i ask you if we agree on ninety five and disagree on five are we the same wore are we different we are the same there are just outliers to this to this rule and and and one reason is this issue of of outliers attract how we think about things but know we are actually much more similar than than what we think and the second thing that that drives this cultural effect is the luck it is our poor application of language to a faction right in other sensory systems we grow up with we were were we develop with anchors right since you are a little kid your mother shows you a cow and says what does the cow do to rid and we all no mu and what color is this it is well this is kind of an odd black but it is black right or r what color is that it is red right you have these anchors but as you all know the red that ism seeing is not in my the red that your sing we does both know to call that red and since you say red and i say red i think why were seeing the same thing but no one hot seeing the same thing right and in in odor we do not have those anchors right we we do not from childhood our mom does not also what is this smell and what is that is smell right and we do not have these language anchors that make us think that we are perceiving the same think now how can you pontiff that the most important term and in measuring sensory systems is similarity right that is the measure right what can you let say we take ten grants and i have you rate all the party similarities right you end up with forty five numbers right know how similar is one to two one to three one to foreign than to an all the possible pairwise similarities let us a great similarity from one which is totally dis similar a hundred exactly the same right now i have a similarity matrices that describes mandrel's perception of smell right i have based on these tenants that i selected now i can run my similarity matrices and then i can see if the similarity matrices are correlated right and then we have got rid of the issue of names and orders right it does not matter if it'll call this lemon an this orange and you call this sweet potato in this marshall right it does not matter if i think that these two are highly similar and you agree and i think that these two are very different and you agree right we perceive the world in the same way if our similarity mattresses are find right and what is nice about that is at then you can do that for vision addition and all faction in a common group and you can see were were more alike each other or not and we have done that for colorvision all faction and tonal addition of and we are most dissimilar and colorfision oke we are in colorvision the variance is about a hundred per cent making it i defend there is tons of literature on this tons of it tons of it right and and all faction and audition there about the same we are not different were very similar we are just very poor at appreciating this and and mind you not that there is not viability there is very ability and of course the system is malleable as all sensory systems are you can learn to an odor and and that will change you and learn o this an order right but just ye can learn to a sound or justice a sound this does not take away from the hard wired link of a structure to its perception that you can ta thermalabol and and and were we are not very variable where we are actually kind of similar that is a perfect zeguay to the question i have next which is if in general people perceive certain odors similarly you could imagine that odors could be am manufactured cooped et camera in order to elicit richer sensory experiences and drive choice making a that is obvious at the level of the smell of a hot dog stand or freshly baked bread et camera but what ism talking about here and it'd to ask you about as doing this scale and a scientists geeks to say e in silicon in a through computer for a long time now there is been this idea that am there will soon be huge smell not to call out gull is the only search engionduck duck go smell for those of you the din here smell cheugiteer you in a chat we begin and on and on in other words i no vision visual information as sent through a computer interfaces as is auditory information not much attic som at a sensory although it can we are lavishes of you're it is a it it can be done i om but it has not really taken hold am however smell being such a rich source of behavioral and hormonal and other sorts of deep deep information that can drive people into yum major met type decision making a seems in amazing candidate what is your experience with am generating smells in silicon in computers and here folks refer those you that are not catching on to this and and i do not expect that everyone would because what we are really alluding to here am is the idea that you will look at you will a put into a surchengin a blueberry pancakes recipe and that not only will you get photos of those blueberry pancakes and a recipe but you will get the hopefully validated odor of those pancakes and that recipe coming at you in real time through the computer it'll start off answering from a from the the see yo throughout there huge about pray bout five years ago a huge had an ipolfool spoof all right and they put out this video of huge smell okay and it had all these classic sails images of holding up your phone to a rob and generating rob and an and all these things right si fugal is now trying to do that and they just they just a a published i my night i know they have been trying to do it for a while they visited our lab a but they just ought of when public with this that really just about a a month ago or something that that am they have this off shoot start up i think it is called oman or something that that started off with a ridiculous some of money for a start up i do not know tons of money there is a lot of money in that worm ye an guava a to ta digitize a smell and and a and there are other companies that are trying to do this as well am and we have been talking now for quite a while about our our lab's memo signaling work but actually half of our lab is devoted to this question of of a ultimately digitizing smell am and and this is a very very active field of research and and and it'll say am one thing that that dove tales with what you are talking about before in many ways bovid is going to be one of the best things that ever happen to all faction research because suddenly all the world ais a all the world lots of people are are a very cognizant of the importance of smell and smells way up there in people's awareness because of covet and this is driving a renascence of of all faction research and and awareness to all faction to something that is worth paying attention to a and and our lab has been involved in this way in this effort for a long time wherever the initial part of this effort is in fact to develop a set of rules that link over structure to od perception that is the going saying was that until recently at least there was no scientist or perfumer for that matter who could look at the structure of a novel molecular mixture and predict for you how it will smell or a smell something and telliyou what it molecular structure could or should be a in contrast the say o trivial color vision let us ay say know if if if what the wavelength of the light is you moralist know what perceived colors can be of course their exceptions to that and and an abstracts of wishes but as a rule you you'll know or you or the other way round you can generate a wavelength and you would know what cur light a it is going to be perceived am that is an example where the rules linking structure in this case measured by wavelength and perception in this case experienced this color the rules are well known in all fashion we wouldn't half that am until recently am but over the past two years a bunch of labs have really am push this forward a there is a bunch of work a out of lassie vashhall's lab at rockorfeller an undress killer working with lesser am a who wove done a lot of work on this front am also work from job mainland's at lab a at moral am and fair discovery roll was a a graduation in our lab m and and recently in our lab we have had an and hope this does not come across is overly arrogant but we we have had a sort of many break through on this front to call something a many could break through as far from america n an and this is a paper a led by armravia a a from our lab and come snits also a major contribute there a paper published in nature a about a year and a half ago in the height of cove pandemic an nobody really in i will not see nobody but it was not noticed in the way otherwise would have been it was it was published in nature really in a week where the whole world was going bakery over covet m and in this paper we develop an algorithmic framework a were we can predict the perceptible similarity of any two molecular mixtures with very very high accuracy if you give me to monitor mixtures i can predict how similar you will smell them to be ye motet now not only could we predict that but we could design it we can generate a a mixtures with none similarities and that the the result was high lighted and you will appreciate this coming from vision is that using our algorithmic solution we generated of factory meticals we measured mixtures completely non overlapping in the molecular structure but tho smell exactly the same motet now if you would come to a classic perfumer or most classic perfumers and tell them that you can generate two mixtures with zero molecules in common but smell exactly the same they would tell you no and yet we did and and anybody can recreate them this is simple actually am n in the paper we do if fou things we generate a medicare for a chanalnumber five you do not perfumes of this one but but we we we take we generate a chenolumerfive with no component from chenalumber five in it coquet a and we actually have a publicly envelope website it'll give it you for your ling's if you ant that anybody can do this we built i an engine that you can generate these these meticals now once we did that in a way we have generated the the the in for structure for digitizing smell because what again what we what are wat a algrathan predicts are our frame of predicts is similarity but in ay that is enough for you wise an enough we have a map of a four thousand a molecules a for each one we know there are perceived smell now you can make up any mixture you want for me i can project it into that map and measure it is paradise distance from all the points in the map if it falls on lemon than what you generated smells lemon and if it falls you know on tomato than what you generated smells tomato we we now solve that problem we can predict the odor of any molecular mixture we can say how it is going to smell what we can do is then find a set of components which we call odor primaries that can be used to mix any odor that you can perceive and that is what we are working on now m and about month ago this is in collaboration with a lab of a jonathan willies and waxplant an eunuch a sonata willies is an a atmospheric chemist a but he is really good it at using g c names these tools that measure molecules a jonathan willies measured durance in germany transmitted the information to us over ice awe fed that into our rhythmic framework and we created it from a device that miss is primaries and we tried to do four different odorancs in or our proof of concept test a one of them a was rose and we failed at recreating rose we in fact we created something that had a precept but most people perceived it as bubblegum the second one we tried to do is a nice and we failed at recreating a nice and most people said it was cherry which is not very far a it failed the third was gasoline and we were slightly but significantly better than chance at recreating gasoline n a and the fourth with was violets and fifteen of sixteen people said violets the first odor ever transmitted over i pe is violets and we did that last month a of course this is not anything never practical solution a the device a ah the jonathan was using to measure a is a one point five million dollar device bigger than this stable hit i remember when visa are half the audience only we know what that is is yours were this big you or it was all good a ism all good with the with the prediction o is will say down in size and cause i sere do not hold your breath up for this to be under table to morrow and and again even even all we have not hands this very initial proof of concept it does not it is not even yet close to being a paper we are submitting because there is a lots of work to be done ah but we are on round the path ah round the path and fugal probably beat us to it ah they got a lot awe seem pretty doge in the y they have much more resources that the a at this stage and they have there already published a to papers from that effort that are good ah ah if a devil have a lot of dollars and a lot of people a lot of good a nervous science and other biology engineering grandsons an posters ever but but am the real question is are they getting the best people because as you and i both know in science the oftentimes it is small groups of of the very best and most creative people that can a out run an out gun large groups and and here i do not anything against fugal year i i use it all the time i in to a betting man but i would put my my money on fugal on this race but it'll give the it'll try to give them a run for their money very no that was was most s want to see the problem solved regardless of who i gets there first what it'll says you better get going bugle cause no must being is metal and he is roam better better get crack and there we just cost the week ends of ana i broke up the relationships of i on us on ton else gas do you never i remember hearing there was a guy and in our common friend a er a eringsookers lashed that worked a hundred hours a week i was will work one in two hours a week which was not o encase lives it is a it is abundantly clear that you are making progress here and any other and i go to some of their earlier discussions we had and i think we are not just talking about transferring recipes and smells a of o food a gasoline from people watching the the f one race or something but ism thinking dating as ism thinking i you now nowadays everyone knows that when you traveling you want to see your family your grand kids a kids you better to get on face time and see them resume ism then to just hear their oil west i am not being able to smell them it'll tell you more than that iota more than that i mean we are talking now of trying to achieve a the old factory equivalent of zircon nineteen fifty six black and white t like basically right i n am not dreaming lets he of being able to transmit to the difference between a camera or armor low rite but if i can generate something that is vaguely wine that will be an amazing success from my prospective right but jump ahead in your imagination to to for ka order transmission then medical diagnostics is what you want to be talking about because in this is this is a a over extension but you can almost say that every disease will have an order i mean every disease is a specific metabolic process metabolic process have metabolites metabolites have a smell of faction once it is digitized and and high resolution which again in our hands it is not going to be i mean we are talking in my retirement maybe it'll read about this one day fallstill have vision i mean this is not closes but when when all faction digitization is brought to the equivalent of four key a vision and edition that you have now then it will be in medical diagnosis you will have excuse me for the a the imagery but you will have an electronic not in your bathroom each one of us will have in the toilet and it will be doing diagnostics all the time an an that is that is when its can go but again not anywhere in the very close future well it is its certainly an exciting proposition and ism delighted that you and other groups am who are strong or working on it i have really am no my i want to say thank you for your time to day first of all i this was it tremendously interesting conversation and we touched on many things hormone smells the architecture of the old factory system i know that people listening to this a realizing what in to say at anyway what an incredible gift you have given us in i as e as a expert in this field giving us this tour of of the work that you and others who you credit generously i have done to elucidate this incredible system that we call faction cameo sensation also just for the incredibly pioneering work that you have done i i do not have many heroes in science i have heros outside since in a few in science but ism an at i of an in purposely embarrass myself a little bit by saying that from the time i was at barely and i then and saw that experiment being done at people forging a falling sent trails and then when i was at u until i was a junior professor i used that in my teaching slides i in a class that i taught there was sort of the early organs of this podcast in any way and over and over again when your laboratory publish his papers i fin this is superinteresting supercool and i find myself telling everybody about and that is really what i do for a for a living as i i learn and then i blab about it to to the world thank you much for the work that you done in the spirit that you bring to it whatever drives that spirit as the great late embarrass use to say keep going because we are all benefiting tremendously and i and i also just want to say that for people listening to this the the spirit of science is one of as you mention there's complex politics and all these things but it is absolutely clear that you delight in the work you do and ism i delight in in it ism grateful for it ism grateful for your time to day and ism behalf of me and and the many many people listening to this i just one extend it a huge debt of gratitude thank you mu ut so i m this blushing i do not know if this does not come across on h on the radio podcastbat thank you much for very warm words wit e as it you when you work in your lab you do not there is these moments where you someliny discover that somebody is cares a bit about it and those always very rewarding moments because usually you you function without that i man i guess that is one of things you need to be a scientist is to have the the drive to work without that is it comes only rarely there is immense gratitude and appreciation for you and what you do from me and now i know from a a large segment of the world as well a my only request is that you come back and tell us about the next results sometime not to l now well well i i won to catch you live now though you have the power to edit this i guess that is not fair but first you come visit us in israel and and tell us both about the science and the public science work here doing and then it'll come again at a good bargain ran i i than you much pleasure thank you for join me for to day's discussion about old faction and memo sensation with doctor not noble if you to learn more about the work in the some laboratory or read some of the papers described during to day's episode as well as

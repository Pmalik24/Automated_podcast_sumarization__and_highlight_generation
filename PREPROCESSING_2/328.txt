welcome to the supermen latponcence cut science science space to forgive i manderhuberman and a a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine my guess today is doctor michael iceberg doctor michael eisenberg is a medical doctor specializing in neurology and an expert in male sexual function and fertility he is both a cognition who sees patients as well as a research scientist having published over three hundred pure reviewed articles on male sexual function neurology and fertility and he is considered one of the world's foremost experts in male sexual health to day we discuss a broad range of topics important to all men including e reptile dysfunction and function we also discuss prostate health and urinary health we discuss fertility and sperm count we discuss even topics seemingly esoteric such as why penile lengths are actually increasing over time while sperm count seem to be decreasing today you will also learn some very interesting surprises such is the fact that a very very small percentage of reptile dysfunction actually stems from hormone dysfunction rather the vast majority of reptile dis function stems from issues that are either vascular that is related to bloodflow or curl and to day you will learn about a large variety of treatments for erectile dis function doctor eisenburg also dispels a lot of common myths that you hear out there both on the internet and in popular culture that relate to male sexual health and function by the end of to day's episode i assure you that you will have a thorough understanding of what male sexual health is how it relates to other aspects of health and how to think about treating maintaining and improving all aspects of male sexual health fertility and function before we begin i to emphasize at this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consume our information about science and science related tool old to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd tho thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is rock rock makes eye glasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality the company was founded by two all america swimmers from stamford and everything about rock eyeglasses and sunglasses were designed with performance in mind have spent a lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and i can tell you that your original system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly rock understands this and is design eye glasses both for sport and for wearing in casual settings or to work or to dinner that always allow you to see with crystal clarity their eyeglasses are extremely

code superman at checkout to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity have spoken many times before in this podcast about the fact that getting a great night sleep really is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance one of the key things to getting a great night sleep is to make sure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct and that is because in order to fall in stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees with eight sleep you can program the temperature of your sleeping environment in the beginning middle and end of your night in has a number of other features tracking the amount of rapid e moment and slow wave sleep that you get things are essential to really dining in the perfect night sleep for you have been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for well over two years now and it has greatly improved my sleep by fall asleep far more quickly i wake up far less often in the middle of the night and i wake up feeling far more refreshed than i ever did priority using an eightesleep mattress cover if you to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep doc calm slash supermen to save one hundred fifty dollars off their pot three cover eight sleep kelly ships to the u essay canada up select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep doc calm slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor michael isenburg doctor isenburg welcome think you could be her have beenlooking for at to talking to you for a long time because these days we hear a lot about the diminishing quality of sperm which in some way seems to be tacked to the conversation about diminishing quality of environment people intelligence hat there is a lot woven into this statement that sperm quality is declining and some of it i think people assume is related to environmental changes some of it think people assume it are related to changers in behaviors may be less exercise less sunlight who knows holy you will tell us what is really going on but the first question i have is is sperm quality actually declining and regardless what is sperm quality ye great question i think it is very controversial i think is your question alludes to i think we will start by just talking about what sperm quality is and whidesenporm for reproduction as you have covered on the podcastlefor man make seamen and that has superman it and when we are talking clinically about a seamen analysis there is a few things we look at we look at the amount of ejaculate seamen that comes out we look it the sperm how many there are we look at their motility or movement we look at their more files or shape there is some more advance testing that is done in rare cases looking at fragmentation of the nay for example or some new r testlooking in hepigenetic profiles of sperm but essentially these are all markers or fertility fertility in itself as a team sport right it is hard to i it label a man is fertile are not fertile without knowing about has partner a but nevertheless based on different these different parameters we try and quantify how likely man is to be able to achieve a pregnancy the world health organization every decade or booklover the existing literature and defines these different cut points of what is normal or what sub fertile for those levels that sort of the backdrop of what seamen is and how these these tests are done or you now what these tests represent now the question of whether they have declined over time em has been question for a number of years there is a landmark paper in the early nineties y carbon in a group and denmark that showed this temporal decline you overthelast fifty years from that tine point and what the investigators ha done as looked over the literature for studies that reported seamen quality around the world and noted that the quality in the earliest studies like can count of the mid a twentieth century for here and that over time they had sort of decline the more recent studies e now of that study was very controversial there was questions about waiting from different studies putting because there you can imagine these there is not a lot of early studies putting a lot more importance on those rather than some of the later ones and since then there is been many other studies that have that have come out an time and even today it remains very controversial i think i were to say that i believe there is a decline some of my colleagues and friends would be very upset with me i say i do not believe it is all my colleagues and friends would be very upset with me i would say that my opinion really varies based on whose paper have read and have there is some very convincing studies on each side of it the most recently just in the last year there was a reanalysis of tens of thousands of men where they looked o again a host of these studies over the last number of decades all around the globe prior studies you really jo spoke a to om the western demister western countries cause there was more data from that but more recently have gotten a lot of data from africa from avian countries as well and those also support this decline em one of the counter arguments to why were seeing that is just sort of an evolution of techniques over time em that is one of the the sort of the popular em questions about whether there is really a true to clime em i think it is your alluding to why there would be a lined as also unknown and but you sort of label you know perfectly that economist common hypothesis wethers on environmental exposures right a lot of things of changed overcast fifty years and i think chemical exposure certainly one of those and there have been some fairly concern seeing preclinical studies mostly done in animals a that show that exposure to different chemicals dallies em a b pie other things may actually harm reproductive function for men and for women as well and it may be that these chemicals ye that are that were being exposed to as kids and adults or even probably em more sinisterly when were em count of developing in uteri that may be count of the most harmful exposure em but there is also been you known ability epidemic as well and there is a strong link between amen man's reproductive function em and bodyweight and that is also e thought to play a role in some of this too em i think there are in convincing studies but the other i guess aspect o this as that there is variations and seamen quality around the country and around the world there is geographic variation and that is also a sort of a unknown em a explanation you know there could be different fort a genetic compositions of men and there different reproductive potential in that source there could be different in biremental exposures diet exercised life style an there is a famous study em done a number of years ago where they looked at seamen quality among fathers these are men that it achieved a pregnancy and at the first you know prenatal visit they had am the fathers give a seamen sample and this was done four centers around the country i think it one californium there was am one in the modest a there is one in new york they basically found that seaman squalid it was o highest in the urban centers in new york tended to be the highest numbers where it was lower in the modest and the hypothesis was potentially because it was a more rural setting maybe there was passive exposure that had led to these lower numbers but you know another equally plausible explanation may be that different sort of a different population and may be be no that that could explain these differences i think it is it is very important am and i think one of the sort of lacking things and this as there is not really logitunal data one of the greatest things would be if we just started tracking am seaman quality are on the country just we do a cecity inhales a so sees a survey of health in in us if we had a seaman quality on to that that way you could really see how it series around the country and sort of compare to to see over time if there is realities progression you no ant of the only studies to do that in denmark e they've started around you w round two thousand and tract seamen quality among them volunteers it came in when they were conscripted for military service in denmark they were offered the opportunity to participate the study em and some men did and what they found as actually that seaman challie it was fairly uniform over about twenty years when they had data but sort of another very interesting part of that study is that only about a quarter of those men had normal seamen quality am sort of very concerning you knows i guess reassuring that it was not further declining but very concerning and only a quarter of danish men had been a normal seamen quality and they are one of the i think thought leaders in this field i just because of a reproductive crisis there you mention that some of this apparent decline in seeming quality might be related to the fact that the tools to measure seeming quality are getting better and better and that would make sense if for instance one is just looking at total volume more policy the which on shape i should have clarify that a how many forwardly motile sperm there are and then also adding in a very sensitive measure such as a data fragmentation you essentially as the instruments get finer and finer you discover more and more details and if you are a reading quality along a number of different dimensions than it would make sense those who'd tear out into different levels if one were to simply ask four couples who want to get pregnant and assuming that egg quality is not the issue what percentage of failures to achieve successful pregnancy are the consequence of deficient spur deficient in any way and is that number increasing overtime ye i think that is really hey i think when couples think about fertility usually as thought of as a female problem and i think there is a historic reasons for that you know if you look it at in u s when couples do see care for fertility the man is by pass probably a third of the time even though when you look at the reasons for fertility man contributes probehalf of the time to infertility i think there is a half half i think there is a huge need just to understand and evaluate the man and one of the reasons for this i think is that a you know one of the main treatments for infertility in the u s is i b which is very powerful i think one of the greatest marvels of medicine in probably the last quarter century is arability to maxes a spermangg in this in create a life it is really remarkable but because now takes just the single sperm through something called intercede o posing spirminjectionarry connect one egg or one's burn into an egg the bar has gone down dramatically for couples just trying without you know any assistance probablyned twenty to forty million moving sperm but now with these remarkable tennis just need one sperm u and because of that i think a lot of our renovation and research on man fertility is probably gone to the wayside to speak as clinically we just need a few dozen sperm for most couples what about testostroa levels are those also declining we hear this u and when i look at the literature i con fined evidence for that but the question is also whether not the amount of declinintestostro levels as significant in a way that impacts what say fertility but also u vitality in other ways energy mood u sexual health et camera a what is the try with mesotron levels are they indeed declining on average across the mail population in the you asses elsewhere i think there is pretty convincing evidence that that is happening and i think the reason for that again is probably not certain but there have been some pretty nicely do in cohort studies where they we recruited men and that the two thousands the nineties the eighties and you can see that depending on when these men are recruited just matching age for age these testchan levels tend to be lower and then en hands which is gain this sort of logigenal study run by the sexy sea e that is also shown onlooking at testostran levels over red no decades the testochan levels have declined over time there chemical exposures one possible explanation again either in a dull to adolescent life or a under but obese i think as also port of a convincing explanation is were more sedentary we get bigger that is one of the places that testastran can decline i think there is different fit of explanations for that u you knows testostrans produced it is a aromatized an a puerperal tissue you know vatic tissue fat has lot of this romantastes of that converse testosterone to estrogen it necessarily lowers the testosterone level that circulating in our body ism also disinsulating that the testicles or thighs get vigor inflating the testes can also sometimes lower the efficiency of production a little because of heat effects for the hat effects i was going to ask about this later but it'll ask about now since we are tuning my heat effects and i superman testosterone am the heat of course being a not good for am sperm health and testosterone which is have read a mataanalysis i do not know am how high quality it is but am that explained that there is some evidence for i either heat effects or possibly non heat related affects of sulphone you smart phone in the pocket in parring sperm health may be even testosterone levels now you hear this more often and kind of biohacke am i do not know a circles am which ism not a fan the word biohackin am it does it is not clear what it means but it it sounds it means something about taking a short cut using one thing for a purpose it was not intended but it also make sense to me that a smart phone could generate some heat i some radiation that might impair am testicular function and therefor impart sperm quality and or testosterone levels but is there any real solid data that carrying your sulphone in your pocket let us us whom on that the sulphone is on is bad for sperm health or testosterone levels yes o i i think there is not convincing evidence that its gin helps i testostro levels i think that i in a hurt testostro it is not get to hurt ye i should not i to make clear that i think that in terms of production and heat effects you a sperm production is much more sensitive than testosterone production but there have bee e some studies looking it sulphone exposure because again yr'regetting the whether it is heaped whether it sort of the radio frequency waves coming in i think you and deposit sort of different explanations of why that may be harmful there have been some studies that looked early on men that use telephones more or less they had lower seaman quality if they used it more but you can also imagines huge differences in men that do and do not use sulphone you knots it is it is a hard experiments o design but there have been some studies a doing this in nitroso in the laboratories of taking firm in a cup basically and putting a sulphone next to it or not next to it to trying see if that played a roll there's been studies done where they am sort of normalized the the heat they canto put on am a sort of a special stage that it is not heat necessarily maybe its are exposure those studies i think do not show sort of me clinically meaningful change but there have been some studies to say that maybe data fragmentation of firm can go up a little bit if there is close proximity a to a sulphone a i think when patient ask me tat which the common question i get in clinicoviously patients are coming and they want to do we know whatever they can am to try and improve their chances a i think generally think that date of not convincing am but you know it is easy enough certainly to be aware of it you know i think putting a laptop on a describe than in your lap i think for heat exposure is probably the biggest thing to we want minimize about a year and a half ago i did an episode about testator an estrogen where it is manufactured in the man female body et camera and found a very interesting graft in a a text book on a behavior under chronology i got name randy nelson who i happen to know through the field of behavior in the chronology as it is typically studied in animals most of that book centers on animal studies but there is a fraction of the studies that center on human a data and there was a very interesting graft that showed testostral levels as a function of age in males a and as one might expect testosterone levels were on average much higher in eighteens early twenties thirties and there was a progressive decline but what was remarkable to me about that graph is that even when exploring the a scatter plotscasi they showed individual points they did not just show the averages of testosterone levels in men in their fifty sixty seventies eights even nineties there were these outliers these guys who had testosterone levels that were on par with a testosterone levels of men in their thirties but these gas were in their fit sixty seventies eighties even nineties do you observe this clinically do you observe that a men are coming in you now aft who are older than forty and have testosterone levels and presumably free testosterone levels as well a that are still very high i the reason i ask us that i think were alive been told and we presume that testosterone levels decline with age and one would expect some out lies and of course we do not know whether not those guides in their nineties who have the testosterone levels of that match the averages of men in their thirties did not have even greater testosterone levels in their thirties but given that they were sealing out around nine hundred anagrams prodesilyer you had toward the high and normal depending on the scale a in already at age ninety's not hard to imagine that earlier their walking around with o two thousand anagram prodestolier testosterone do you see this are there some is there just a lot of natural variation and testosterone levels of men who walk into the clinic at any age and of course what is special about these individuals that are i o maintaining high normal testosterone levels into their later years gets the great question i think this is such a common question any time we talk about testosterone i think an siege tack about most sort of a clinical tests that we do what is average what is normal we do see great variation i mean i think just your saying i usually let everybody know that you now usually testosterone peaks in a kind of early twenties and intends to go down probably one percent a year for ever but there are people that have burin very very high levels just wearing you know that grab that you describe i certainly have patients you know we screen for testostrn levels inpatient come in with complaints or were worried about that low energy level lo libido some of the symptoms of lotestostron sexual dysfunction and to muse surprise some times these men have seen eight year old that certainly have the highest testosterone level all see over six months why that is i think it is not certain may be asked to do if id think with everything that's probably sort of a bellshape curve and everybody's little bit different but wanders an sensitivity o sensitivity the receptor they make it more efficiently but i have not really noticed gents at least in clinical practice impatience come in they come in with the complaint and even men you know it very high levels they may have some of the same dysfunction men with low levels i think with low levels you can try and treat that and that may be the solution but for men with these what we would consider high levels you know there may be other issues going on me frame the question i was going to ask a little but differently when some one comes in to your clinic and you measure their testostro levels as you mention their likely coming in because they have some issue prostate issue sexual function issue et camera but you do get a read on there it's crude morphology of their body wright you could visibly determine whether not the likely to be beast or not regardless of age earlier you mentioned obesity as a risk factor for lowering testosterone and sperm quality you mention that fat a aromatizes testosterone intestrogen that is at least one mechanism by which that could happen but if you were to just step back and say oke if somebody who walks into my clinic tends to be unless they healthier looking yo know not o be must just put the cut off at what you would presume is best u is there a higher probability that their testostro levels are going to be within normal range conversely when somebody walks in in their obit is do you fully expect their testosterone levels to be subnormal u or are you sometimes seeing beast people walking in with high testosterone u and the reason i masking this is not to create confusion is that i think that everybody out there who's thinking about sperm quality and testosterone levels and this apparent decline the try o fig you knowocae what can we do in order to maintain the health metrics that are going to f course increase fertility but for those that do not wont have kids or already have kids are going to at least maintain or improve vitality is obesity really to thing to avoid is there a not one for one but is their tight correlation between obesity and testostrom levels i would say that you cannot predict i think that sort it would be the take home and i think that more information is always better on i see patients and clinic some patients or walking around you know with everything is totally normal they very health the all the numbers come in at the normal range but sometimes when men look totally normal they talk about taking care of their life they exercising of five seven days a week their testochan levels can be very well even the spite having what we would consider should really give them symptoms m they are able to compensate maybe they have live their whole life and that they do not know what normal is now we get them to cart of normal levels the lot of times they feel better again was tad no idea how they should feel u but i think that that is just sort of important that everybody should be screened i think that testosterone seaman quality there's been shown to even be barometers of health men with lower teetotum levels of higher risk of no heart disease dies mortality the same studies exists for semen quality as well u and again they may have sort of a similar relationship and explanation why that made be but i think it is hard just predict based on appearance what testoshenill be what semen quarto be what testicular functionw'll be without actually getting some objective data and actually if you look at the trend of ten of semen quality to cline over time con to getting back to some of those earlier point you are making if you were to overlay that on the known association between obesity em its effects on semen quality that actually does not explain the whole decline the the reported decline it semen qualities about fifty per cent but if you just if you were to say well what would we expect if we look at u nicks we are able to tract exactly how much fatter we are now then we used to be that actual explains about a ten per cent the clime i think there is thenatour plain something more u and it is not something that you can misidentify my high what are the us and do not as it relates to do not y use the word optimizing it is gotten me into trouble before because ere optimize or optimal suggest that there is an perfect number that one should all attain e if possible but in reality am options a day to anything mat least but what should people avoid in order to yet their sperm quality as high as possible their testosterone level again here i oil have to be careful do not say as high as possible because some people might not want excessive androgen but at the high end of normal perhaps would be the ideal for many people what should people do what should they avoid and here i setting aside any prescription clinical treatments that such as tessosteroan injections or things a cryonic gan atitrope human cuaryoni canatitrope and thinks we can talk about limit later but what should every mail be doing in order to optimize these health parameters yes i think that there are some risk factors that we do start with semen quay we talked about heat i think that is a big one hotubsanas trying avoid those h can a at on sea warmers any time we cannot get this external heat source to the scrotum the testicles are outside the body cause they need to be a little cooler o anything that warms them up can certainly be a problem could i just a briefly interrupt there am task a we have done episodes on sand and some of health benefits of sand a is it sufficient for somebody to bring in a cold pack to the sand and put that their groin i actually suggested that that is actually what i do when i go into the sand a and i have suggested the son pod casts ism not just for people are trying to conceive because it seems heat as you mention is bad for sperm not quite as bad for the stastrone levels but is it also true that heating the tactical too much is generally bad for indecron function and mails and therefore would if one is going to go into a hot sand for twenty minutes or more to essentially cool the scrodolaria you i mean i think the prematigenisis ore sperm production is certainly allow more sensitive whether you can what a thwart the effects of external heat with a cooling pack i think it make sense there are studies that have looked at different ways to cool the scrotum and compareyou a semen quality before and out or and there is some dato that may help a it guess the pens hell longer gan spend in the sand and how cold that pack is gin ta remain ice pack and in the sand for twenty of forty five minutes and his ice packs still cold afterwards yet they actually sell and by the way have no relationship going these companies but they actually sell cold packs that are design to be worn in your short if you go to a it'll go to a russia bony every once a while now i guess ism outing myself yes i have but yes i have a cold pack in my shorts when i go to the russia mania a but a but they have a a sort of an insolation that your the cold the very cold surface is cold enough but it is not right up in contact with the scroll skin because that could get a ism going to make a bad choke and say i can get sticky a that situation you you do not want it get b cold that it actually would stick to the skin and then it could potential damage the skin when you trying remove the cold pay t has a thin insulating mayor and a yah that is especially what it is yo me frost spite to the scrotum is not theoretical could certainly happen you do want to be careful i mean a theory that should be that should be adequate the sort of the no to decrease the risk of that particular effect you knight keep coming back to health how important mates to maintain am adequate firm production because i think he's two very length you never been studies it show that men with more comedian condition obesity hypotension hyperolobedemias these sort of stacked up we see a decline and testicular functions lower testostro labels and lower firm quality i think you know taking the ownership of your your health i think is important as well em lot of times fertility tents to be one of the first touch points that some men have with health care because generally what brings in to the doctor its usually pain or the know kind of a problem you know men are in their twenties and thirties getting ready to start a family or forties in some cases sometimes they have not you have seen a primary caridofrise to some of these things in some this relationship has not been established yet o i think me no thinking about ways to start that i think would be important too and then i know you soft want to talk about testosterone but testosterone his actually a highly common problem that we see and fragility clinics em i would say that you estimate say may be about one and twenty and fertile men are that way because of testosterone i think when people get testostrom different places and hopefully y know whatever proprietor you are getting it from tells you that one of the side effects of this em is lower sperm productions actin ben tested as a contraceptive and with some other here's it can act to be fairly effective we just want to make sure that if men are starting testostro the doing it for the right reason they are doing it safely i think i about testostro an replacement there although i same were talking about before we start recording i i am really on a push now to rename what people call t are t testostr replacement therapy because indeed some people of low testosterone and need it replaced are in dirt but i think what your referring to i ism not mistaken is that there are probably millions of young men and older men taking exogenous toststron injections creams pills pellets you n any number nasal sprays now you know any number of different a routs of delivery of extoginus a testosterone and that a dramatically reduces once's indigenous to stostron production and dramatically reduces one's sperm count and make e even quality may be talk about the solicit later but maybe even can the theirs have been told that it can perhaps introduce a done fragmentation within the remaining viable per swell do i have that crept your saying that that you see one and twenty men have issues with fragility because they are taking testostro their testator levels presumably argon behind and normal or more but they are doing presumably not testostrom replacement therapy but there doing what i call testosterone augmentation there be meaning they were somewhere in the three hundred nine hundred anagrams for dust leader range but decided to starting testosterone anyway and then there their sperm count essentially diminishes to will wore close to it in some cases yet i mean i think there is serious reason thy yo take testosterone i think he was some people have been treated years ago and they do need a replace testosroniuknow but some people do it for orientation i dust you to say testosterone therapy to son your kill the are i that that is better than the t e t which does not how very good oke just testosterone therapy but if you had for example we take a hundred of my infertile patients that come in to see me an client at least five of those men will be infertile because their on testosterone therapy and some of em do having o have that suspicion they say and level with you this is why my levels are pro bale low but a lot of men were not told back you know when they started there i think certainly for reproductive aged man that is in a very important conversation to have u because there can be som other bend ways that we kind of maintains form production i think sperm car preservation is a good option for these men as well or there may be other therapies they can think about just because of reproductovtoxasy whowhat about h c g human cryonic ganatatrop and i hereabout a lot of people go on testosterone therapy who take h c g every other day or typically the dosages that i hereabout because people write t me about the stuff all the time really is one the most commonly ask questions i get many questions about many topics but i would say a fool ten to twenty per cent of them are about penises or cestostra those perfectrigt exactly a number of those guys who are taking testostrom will be prescribed h c g to stimulate sperm production indogenospern production to maintain a healthy sperm presume because they either want to conceive or intending to conceive in the future is that the best line of treatment for maintaining fragility while people are taking testosterone therapy ye it is one the therapies the we use and i think cam more well you are just a logos usually en for those that tat know five hundred to a thousand units every other day is usually iniquity as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our physical health but also our mental health and our connive functioning our memory our ability to learn new things and to focus and we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making sure that we get enough sidemen and minerals from high quality unprocessed or minimum process sources as well as enough robotics and prebodics and fire to support basically all the cellar functions in our body including the got microbic now i most everybody try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods ideally mostly from minimal process or non process foods however one of the challenges that i and many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fiver and robotics that often accompany those fruits and vegetables that is why way back in two thousand in twelve long before i ever had a podcast i started drinking a g one and am delighted the a g one is sponsoring the superman lab podcast the reason i started taking a g one and the reason i still drink a g one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it provides insurance that i get the proper amounts of those vitamins minerals robotics and fiber to insure optimal mental health physical health and performance if you would to try a g one you can go to drink a g one doom slash supermen to claim a special offer there giving away i are travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k two again that is drink a g one doctor slash supermen to claim that special offer if somebody is not taking to stosteron exogenously they gotten there a body fat level down to a point where there not considered o be either hopefully doing some care of vascular exercise each week may be doing sport resume resistance training to em a with the intention of maintaining all around good health stave off you super of vascular carry of vascular issues what ire some of the other do not i been going to assume that smoking cigarettes or raping cigarettes is bad there any studies that look specifically at raping and sperm quality or to stostrone levels em and is there any evidence that i smoking cigarettes is good for tostostron levels er sperm productions ism guessing the answers now i feel nowadays we just say do not smoke em but the date the data who knows may be negative ton helpspurm i have no idea i a it is possible i do not think we have the date on that yet but ye man i think i your point i think lifestou factors are certainly a big one and some of these potentially em youknow can unhappy habits o smoking is certainly something you shall not do there have been lenolots o studies to do link that to lower quality began all the different measures that we look at ism also looking at fertility these men ten to have a longer time to get pregnant i alcohol i think it is another very common question get asked as well and i think for that there is you know i think less of a strong association that we have seen there em youknowthere have been some studies that show that very high levels of alcohol i guess that sort of subjective what some would consider higher or not but when you get above me be twenty drinks a week there have been some effects but you he's a lot of drinking i would think that is lot e but some people do not but yet i did not episode on algal i think anything more than two i know people are gin em o bulk at this but you i think any more than two drinks per week as where you start to see some negative effects on some health parameters but you no ism not a titolersa ye em but when you get to this twenty drink that is when we started to see some effects on seamen quality but the you know the thing about that is usually of these men are drinking twenty there doing other things to smoking there can be other drug use as well it'hard to tease that a but in general that is i think certainly anything in moderation is probably oak young is probably better and that is how i council patience i think you again it is very rare that i see men that are that level but i certainly let hem know what i do em there is some new at to coming out of that we have started to work on looking at if there are different sensitivities to alcohols some east agents have mutation that leads to flushing em and that may put those men at virus when they mix alcohol we may see some slightly lower as from parameters you mean skin flushing because they do not make alcalde hydrogen heave gad ya e and is it i give heard about that in avian cultures is there em antsier population excuse me but is there any evidence that other populations might have slight variance on call dehydrogenase that perhaps maybe they do not lack it alter gather but they have don't know their hypomors for whatever gene makes it'll call the hidrogenatond therefore they do not metabolize it as well and therefore the toxic form of aldol is active in their system longer is the any evidence for that not the get your exactly right i man i think the one that we think about is ye says an cultures where it can be you know depending on another reason i chines limonene pony about forty to fifty per cent o the population has you knomutation the led each tune but other populations i and people of african ancestry there is a a rate mutation i think no count remember the exact percent but think of few percentage points is some a individual o thespanic ancestry askconazy jewfish ancestry in this particular gene there's i mutation not the same one that e stations have but again i think it gets to we mutation where we see sort of negative effects would persist and the hypotheses that begonia go pretend potentially gave some sort of benefit for maybe invexasease or something similar to distinct fibrosis why you in again this mutation would persist in our population if there is not re me no some sort of advantage at to those carrying it but we do see another other men as well i think if it simple question do you flush if you flush then maybe alcohol may have you a more of a a harm than than some one else and then you know fort of getting along the lines i think drug uses also something that we should trying you know were do consultations about cause i can also arguably felt e equality you think it is fair to say that one moderation is best but if somebody had the option to either not drink or drink in moderation that they should not drink would that be even better there any evidence for that i mean it seems nowadays we take the stance that am not smoking at all is better than smoking a little bit i should when i was a stock at stamford from two thousand five yes two thousand five to a end of two thousand ten a you could still smoke on the staffer campus ism not a smoker but there was this collection of i have to be careful what i say here there was a particular group on campus of nostocs and graduate soon that would u that we colonize this area outside the hospital and smoke because that is where you could smoke that was eventually eliminated as a possibility you cannot smoke on safer camp as far as i know but theywould smoke right outside the hospital i shall love the hospital workers would youon't take a cigarette on their break this is very charity y exactly yean in this wist common all over the country right this is not unique to stamford but nowadays you just do not see that because it is not aloud and we hear do not smoke it is terrible for equity and everything every other letter the alpha with i'lcall we tend to hear that if you are going to drink drink in moderation is not clear exactly what number that is but is it possible that zerowile call is better for superman indican health then any alcohol or is that not not a fair assumption i mean i think tit is a good question i think that you point about tobacco is an excellent one cause think any smoking is bad m but all i think we do not have that data for ye and i think it is thwarted harder for me to make that recommendation to patience especially because young people do it for different reasons and if it is not neutrally going to help them all harm them in social situations or other things em ye i used i usually give them the moderation one unless again for them the very high drinkers i do not my talk about that you mention other drug use ism going to assume that u unless prescribed for si postsurgical pain or something that that penna a propenes heroine opiates of any kind a just bad for superman testosterone i think we in probably make that a short discussion right h ye i cannot imagine any of that would be good for reproductive health ye that is trimming there is again you would imagine or maymaybe not but there is not a lot of data on it it be difficult to enrol or may be easy to unroll but a lot of the studies have not been done a but there is limited ones of people and re have a where they have shown these associations with pe no attics or users and lower quality a yon that is a we talked nations what about anabas i did not episode this podcast about anabas and i did highlight some of the medical applications of anabas i also highlighted that very hit s cannabis a may predisposed especially young male to later psychotic episodes there more and more data coming out about that all the time i a got a lot of flack for for saying that but that is my take on the data a and a i know a lot of people use cannabis a recreational a and in a kind of pseudo therapeutic we i say pseuotherapeutic because i think a lot of people used anabas to manage their anxiety and is an alternative to alcohol a for a number of reasons what is the relationship between anabas use and to stostrone and sperm production for i should say sperm quality excuse me yes o this also a very common question a again with wave of legalization across the countravic more and more men and women are exposed to it a again there is data that the more men are exposed to can lead to some harm in terms of per morphology and sperm numbers as well a one of the sort of landmark studies was about twelve hundred men and had found that men that used cannabis daily had significant lower concentration motility morphology compared to those that did not use it a i think that is generally how men are counselled but there is also other data that shows really a nollefact and i think that it it goes in to probably the composition how men are taking it the frequency because the lot of that data not well teased out in a lot of these studies a you know i think i i sometimes struggle with this with patience because some of a m mark taking it for wo know you some what they consider legitimate reasons anxiety'slee pain and if there is not sort of bury convincing evidence that it is going to help and their taking it may be lower than the threshold were i know that there is good davits will cause harm i guess ism i try an to be sort of honest about where we are but i think with a lot of things related a sperm i think a their level of evidence is not great are there any common over the counter medications that can negatively impact sperm quality and oratestostrone things a nonsterdanti inflammatory drugs talanall thadville type stuff a the unit oprofinacy to minified am things of that sort that i and others might not be aware of ism not ism not proving for anything in particular here i just i know that a you a lot of over the counter drugs have a facts that were is simply not aware of ye me i think we probably lee more data but i think currently we think all those are safe ism curious about the pituitary pituitary glad as many the listeners of the spaces or e knows glad that receive signals from the brain am the gland sits near the roof of the mouth a no thing that is fair am and releases critical hormones into the blood stream that control the output of testosterone from the testes as well as output of hormones from other glance am i know a umber of people and playing sports football or rugby er even across or even sacker have read there are date on this their heading the sacker ball quite a lot or marshal arts or they get a head injury at some point and a i certainly hear a lot from people who played these high contact sports and that to their surprise later they have diminished testosterone levels i also work with a number of military groups that talk about this that they leave and may be its from combat related star ass et camera but u they wonder whether or not there is any dramatic head injury or maybe pituitary injury related em temperament to the reproductive access that includes brain pituitary and the testis do you see that em and if somebody played a contaxport in particular contaxport where the head was hid or they were hitting things with their head often u which they have a to her had a t b i that in the reproductive health can be imperil that is fact a fascinating em i have i have not i mean i think youmust interesting i guess what the pituitary does yeuvoveusly covered this before but it does go to a lot of authorities i mean for your listeners that petuitor produces two hormones elate scrutinizing hodmen and effisates logical stimulating hormone which then stimulates the testicle that utilizing torment hormone stimulates the at cells to make testosterone and then the police stimulating hormones estate stimulates sperm production ism both of those are very key in terms of production and interestingly when exogenous testoctron is used it shuts down that acts as we get less of these ganatitropens i else visage em to stimulate the tetanal em and the other sort of reason that form production is lost with exogenous to some refuses it is actuallythe intertestiglar testosterone is much higher than serum levels our serum levels are between three hundred and nine hundred anrstrodeslater on average but in the testicle of pie tenfold higher at least when men are given exogenous testostra and not pruning their own the levels of testaceran the testicle which are necessary for sperm production are much much lower em but its it is interesting this i think em i am not aware of frthatrum dramatic injuries would would do that em that is god to know ism curious about the non and d e coin non chemical a facts on sperm quality and testosterone level here ism thinking about a bunch of new stories you are heard a few years ago about how bicycle seat pressure on the prostrate or maybe was other the portions of the my was a a nervous running to the penis itself am were surrounding areas may this pelvic for related an somehow you will tell us ism sure a was impairing sexual function was it impairing sexual function in anyway by impairing testostro levels cutting off blood flow to the testes a and here perhaps the most importanthing to ask straight off is am is writing a bicycle bad for a male reproductive health unsexual health now these are great questionthies again living in the marry working i the barrio a cycling is very very popular the are questions that i get a lot i think you knew i in general we talked about before anything it is good for your heart taken to be good fertility would diet in exercise maintain good bodysuit and i always try and encourage physical fitness i think that is important but it may be possible that some particular am activities may put mend in more risk i think cycling could be not of him if i but it would there to depend on exactly why we think that may be a problem i guess the theory is heat if you are in the saddle for a long time enough for these prolonged rides that men take on weak ends you know hours a that may be if there is too much heat exposure that may be the mechanism were sperm production would decline there happen some studies that may be five hours a week would be end that may be too much softer above that level is from council shown to be lower your less than that that may be o case when i talk the patients about it a trying dis encouragement not stand up in the saddle to try and again to air things out to try and dissipate heat if enhance the mechanism are i think regarding sexual dysfunction a that is thought to be pressure as you are alluding two the way that saddle is can figured ideally all the pressure is put on our i skill tuberosities are a sawbones that is what ism sitting on now but on the saddle there is i be see count of the rigid not and if there is too much pressure on that that actually squeezes between that is kill tuberosities where you know the main blood load of the penult goes and the main nerve supply is too and if there is compression on this you get this for lack of blood flower a ischemia and yuan get a near practical well if you crush these nerves and that over time can lead the problems you it some patience will say that yo know after is cycle things are nun down there for thirty minutes ism or a day or i do not get erections for that sort of a same mat a time or sometimes men u sort of ride through it em and hopefully things come back in a day or two that is that could be the mechanism there are some saddles that you know hope we'll be a little safer and i think that this sort of first was noted probably around two thousand or and there is a big redesign and turns of saddles on to and make them a little bit more you anatomically correct to try and minimize some of this and there cycle fit that can be done or saddle fit rather that can be done tat some of the cycling shops to try look at your body position look at your size and try in to lying to saddle that is safer em you know it not this does not happen to everybody i would say may be if you were to em serve cyclist may be twenty or thirty per cent of men and women tend to be susceptible to this i think if you are having discomfort an when you cycle whether it be pain numbness or you notice disjunction think certainly you should think about changing saddles or think about changing writing style em you there is other strategies or sometimes used but absolutely something that that everybody should be ware i men to ask this earlier but i seem to recall a study that drew a a correlation between em amount of walking and maybe it was sperm quality but i think as to stocteron levels maybe some other metrics of a malesexual health forgive me ism not recalling the details now is there any evidence that walking more standing more maybe even using a standing dusk is beneficial for a yo calvicflor health blood flow a prostrate health who knows could be any in all those things in some way that is beneficial for sperm quality to stosteron level and or over all malesexual health you i think you knot one of the ways that we can characterized activity is stepson right i think i no have a watch that tells me that something that i look at every day and than a strive for it and it turns out that the more active you are i it is been shown for t o looking it large national data pools across different age ranges that it is associated with testosterone levels being more active i think is very important a that is another thing than everybody can do it o try and improve for testicular function broadly but testosterone specifically and do whether not that can be separated out from the relationship between being more active and less jobs means is something that is independent of of city in other words can we intend divided people to walk more simply on the on the promise of a improve sexual health well in porno your sexual health will be a different one but we can i think there is tessociatis eating testosterone levels and step count a cross different b m i straight out i think whether your have the ideal body whether yuan a few pounds to lose perhaps if you walk more you will see higher levels of testostrom and another question men to ask earlier and than we can a close the hatch on on exocionis testostro n therapelease for the time being may be will come back to it is a assuming that somebody can maintain adequate sperm production through the use of c g or some other autherabe or perhaps they do not care if there still making sperm because they have already had children or they do not care to have children maybe they banksperm in any even assuming that somebody takes testostroon therapy because they were prescribed that a but say in your clone miss use a saner clinical an example and they are happy with the psychological and physical consequences of that and they are comfortable with the trade offs is there any increased risk of a prostate cancer or other forms of cancer and here ism going to assume that this person is keeping there o their lipid levels in check myths you here about some hyprolipidemia with testosterone therapies let us assume that theyreitheire taking a stator their not taking stay and there getting in a cardiovascular exercise that things are in check in terms of dial ahead hello ago b an all that and their testosterone levels are no my normal and their feeling better a and they do not have to worry about sperm production cause it there either maintaining it or it is been banked or they do not care about that is there an increased risk of prostate cancer my understanding is the answers no but what is the real deal does taking testostro an therapy assuming all other things are being held in a in check in a healthy check does it increase the risk of any kind of cancer yet i mean this is a another great question because i think there is a lot of new around testostrn and that is one of them this the origin is that prostate cancers thought to be or is sort of androgen beaten wont of the snowball prize a know can decades ago was awarded because it was found that hen we lowered manstestostron the prostate cancer would regrets dramatically that put that association between testosterone and prostate cancer then the concern began if we were too you no either of place testostro or augmentestostran give a man testosterone is can a alter his risk increases risk i think we have pretty convincing data that that is not the case others lots of original data spanning decades where man is given testosterone it does not change his risk the real isn't for that in sort of seeming contradict this contradiction rating you know prostate cancer a therapy where we lower hastostron where if you give a mantosocion does not change is prostecancer is is not certain but there is this popular model called the saturation model that once there is enough testosterone in the body and its that tends to be a verily low level a that all this sort of the prostate testoston receptors you can of think of is have been filled if you ere to give man more testator does not change anything regarding the post anger prostate growth any of that it is it is safe when were looking at post dancers is not i to just take a brief break and thank one of our sponsors which is element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt sodium magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons now people of course have varying levels of requirements for sodium people with high pretension or prehigh pretension probably should not increase their sodium however many people are surprised to find that by increasing their sodium take they are able to function better cognitively and physically n that is because a lot of people special people are falling low carbohydrate or even moderate carbohydrate and really clean diets oftentimes are excreting a lot of water in electrolytes along with it and simply by increasing their electrolyte intake using element they just feel better and function better i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and certainly i drink element in my water when ism in the sauna and after going in the sand because that cause is quite a lot of sweating if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elements doc come slash superman getting back to prostate health and a normal enervation of the penis an and blood flow to the penis you mention the bike we related issues are there others things that men should do in order to maintain prostrate health stave off prostate diseases and to maintain healthy blood flow and nerd enervation of the penis for obvious reasons and will get am into the specifics of those reasons and in our later discussion yet i mean i think that always can i think of the penis as a user to lose organ that does not mean astral yo have to have see but you n normally beget directions every night that should be maintained and if there is any reason to sort of suspect that that may not be going on a usually in my practice that would be from penises public surgical intervention or something that sometimes we can intervene to try and maintain that you talk him about spontaneous erections during sleep r am and short of assigning a one's partner to a to check frequency in to message what is the a way that men would know that that is happening for you tug about waking up with in erection is that a requisite for knowing that nocturnal erections are occurring well i yet i think you yet hand a come i he got ha good question i think a lot of times you will not know but i think if you have sort of normal response when either by yourself with the partner i think that generally means a the you are going get normal erection i think i guess when i say sit or lose the it does not mean estray the man has to stimulate himself or kind of a make sure that he does have adequate function because usually most of that normal function just occurs peuknow with this nocturnal enow two masons which we all get and i think sometimes men do notice when they wake up at night sometimes in the morning you wake up with then erection men notice that but the apple of that does not mean its not happening at likely is just most people sleep through it which is normal otherwise men would never get any sleep because the happens many many times the night a i think again if you are not having normal function i think that something you should probuously a physician about and then same for yerinaring function i think if it bothers you if there is if you are waking up at nights you have to go to the baths from off and interstream is getting weaker those are all sort of complaints do we hereabout what is often am my understanding is that it is a normal to wake up perhaps once during the night to burin ate a and this is a course assuming ad again forgive me for all the aviates but have done this long enough that if i do not get really glandular about some of this than toast all would if i drank thirty two ounces a fluid right before sleep and ism you're eating three times for night well we are assuming that people are tapering their liquid and take as they approach bed time am and that waking up once may be twice but once in the mill the night to our in ate is normal for somebody let say age i do not know eighteen to forty and maybe from forty to a hundred a that number might be in the a one to two times per night is that about right yet i manic think once the night yet is normal from us men and then i think of thing start to bother you at the uncertainly see somebody but it is hard to get better than once or twice to night afforest men my understanding is that there is a pretty good relationship between the am nocturnal erection and the amount of red sleep rapid eye movement sleep that one is getting that this tend to be more frequent toward morning as the a proportion of rapid eyed movement sleep increases i don't know if that is true enough but i found couple of studies that at least point in that direction not in intended a that raises a a bigger issue that we have not talked about yet which is getting adequate amounts of quality sleep each night and am i think for most people that seven to nine hours i really am which means getting sufficient slave deep sleep as well as rap and i movement sleep but nowadays a lot of people including young people who are not working excessive hours or getting i no four five six hours of sleep per night is there a direct relationship between getting less than sufficient amounts of sleep and sperm quality to stostrone levels and sexual health the o men i think certainly there is reasonable data for seeming quality and there tends to be em no we call in science sort of a usage relationship that it is not sort of veneer sos yet more sleep things are better there is sort of the is is concept of too much sleep and not enough sleep the ideal i think as you pointed out at seventy nine hours and for men that are not getting that seeming qualitants to be lower and then for men getting too much we also see at decline and why that is as e get not certain is beget i through able to get that much sleep maybe there is other things as well that we should look at but em i think not of getting in that ideal sleep out is best for seeming quality and probably for broad toxic it function as well you keep bringing up seeming quality in a way that makes me wonder whether or not is seeing quality of proxy for over all vitality and health or s testosterone level proxy for over all vitality and health am it sounds seeming qualities the the metric that you keep coming back to in a way that have to a room reflects the or your clinical experience in that the the many a papers that you authored in this area i think for people that here seeming quality and who are not interesting conceiving children now or who are which show course cod include people are had children or who do not want children seeming quality sounds something that relates to fertility but is seeming quality something that is a good goal for those who are interested in over all male vitality and health is it is it one of the better metrics of over all a vitality and health why think you it is i think it is an excellent marker for over all health i think there are studies that support it can be measure of how healthy you are i fou look it men with wore health problems that can have lower seaman quality but also if you look at seamen quality just by itself and then you look into the future how these men tend to do if they have higher seaman quality a they tend to live longer me to go to the doctor less lower rates of cancer i think there's a lot of different ways that semen quality may be a good barometer of health a you knows you know why that link exists i think as not is not known but there is lots of theories one is that pry about ten percent of the malgenom is devoted a reproduction a and make sense given them have about twenty four thousand genes in the both that there is a lot of a overlap one gene that plays a role and reproduction may play a role and an the parties ask for system or the meteorological system and if we get the first sort of sign that reproduction is not perfect there may be some other health consequences down the line a another sort of hypothesis is that again sort of going along this line that reproductions one of the first things that we see is that a gestation is sort of very critical to are existence right in perturbations to that system have prolonged a effects at the called sort of development o organ of the dust disease are the barker hypothesis and we know that premature children a hiherisk of cargo accusers was riven studies to show at but we also know that these gestational effects can also a play out on reproductive function too that also may be kind of a link you a sort of early seeding a reproductive function and then that may be the first marker that were going to have for other health effects later one a there also it is at sort of sort of inherent a for a similarities between a reproduction in some other sort of social effects you know kind of one sort of confounding factor when we are looking at some of these studies i talked about looking immortality for exam pile and semen quality is that the sort of factors that necessarily involve reproduction you children and having a partner and having a partner prolongs life am having kids prolonging even the fills kids are killing you if you look at studies men with kids ten to live longer am you know that is another possible explanation but i think we know really sort of this health am link between fertility i think it sort of a powerful one i do think it should be a barometer i think that youkow it should be wen have given lectures on this i call at the six bite line i think of something that we should probably check because if there is you now sort of lower levels that may tell us about something else going on when when men come in for frilly of wagons a lot of time we do diagnose these new medical problems sometimes we diagnosis cancer re alluding to some of the questions eve ask dies and some other you no very significant genetic conditions as well and the first way that we would identify it as reproductive failure because there firm counter you am an other thing it is something i think that it is certain it is very important i think for people to realize a and it would be great i think another am i think advantage to the centers for zest control for example tho to start tracking it would o be a good idea for males in their twenties and thirties to get a spermanalsis is to have a base line i confess ism forty seven now am one thing i wish i ad done in my twenties as to get my a bloadhormon profiles and lipid profiles done when i was in my teens and twenties because it'd have something to compare to m i started doing that in my mid thirties and ism glad i did because i can now compare to my mid thirty levels i start including spermanalysis a bout eight years ago with the intention of freezing superman did that because i was also reading at that time about the increased risk of autism am in offspring of males older than party something hat i really would your take on but am it seems gets inexpensive enough to do a spermanalsis a i think now they people can get a done at home they have man mail gets a though i do not understand how the motility could be maintained if your mailing your sperm back am at room temperature or you getting through the post office now of rooms imaging all these sperm travelling through the the postal service it is out they're out there folks am yet what what re your thought should am should people invest the i think is a couple hundred dollars to get a a spermanalsis more a costly to get the wanna fragmentation than you get up into the low thousands am but if people have the disposable income is a good idea for them to do i may i think it is a worth while tests i think more information as always good am i think sort of one of the same reasons that am you are talking about checking limpid levels or we tell men and women to get bloodpressure checked i think you now getting that sort of early health indicator i think can be important i think you know going back to not knowing exactly why seaman quality is telling us about health what the exact link may be means that if somebody is coming in with a low sperm count er icy the absence firm count it is hard to know exactly how to council that that person other than that may be reproductive difficulties m but i think just ta sort of a marker for reproductive potential i think it is useful and alike you sad i think it is become a lot easier one of the forinnovations in the space am and somebody that is in the reproduce the world i think it is just really great to see for this influx and capital a new company's coming in the trying to just decrease the barrier to you getting a segment as the used to be apt to go to a lab schedule ant appointment sometimes they wold send you to a bath room which can be uncomfortable yous people de you know people do in a bathroom just next de or you trying to collect but they would send them into in a common space ma however bays bout they will not even give them the quiet room with the with the red light which is a right what i hear they do now the some of em to have ilia there are some higher level oh i did not even mean wavidios i just at i think that a o get yes have done this all just at i mean have ben trying to normalize things related to all aspects of mental health is new wealth ye i i decide to frees german basely they sent me to a room that i went to a university based actually was not staffer but different universe and i ye they put the cup through the window they give you the cup they they close the door and they tell you that as long as that red light is on over the door no ones can walk in and then they leave and i think they the assumption now is that a you figure it out one way or another how to provide the sample another put the sample back through the the thing and then one thing the clients really need to work out is that any time you are walking out yet you see the people process in your samples you walk out there is all this this a feigning of of a unanimity but really it is not there i as they see later you great young that they rarely ask you questions on the way out but it is a pretty simple process over all and and i must say that that the data are informative you get they get the volume number motile forward inly motile i did opt for the donna fragmentation data and i just love data i think it is really interesting but again maybe this is a good time to flag this what this set of findings i believe that there seems to be a small but sis silly significant increase in the number of artistic births due to a pregnancies where the male was over forty at the time of of a conception i figured why not free some spermic its relatively inexpensive yes i think paternal ages also something butts increasing in this country over the last forty years or we have seen that the average paternal ages increase from about twenty seven and a half to about thirty one and i should say this is all fathers a big certificate date our birthday is collected a maternal level when a child is born somebody comes in to collect data on the birth they asking all the characteristics of the mother and they also ask characteristics of the father age education virus e region i the country the child was born we do not know we know what number child that was for the father we don't for the mother they do asking i was our first second third et center a child m the father and fortune we just have data the sort of all lump together but over the last again forty years we have seen that increase intrusting overtime last forty years the youngest father was eleven and the olde is eighty eight eleven quite a spanyaw eighty eight goodness unrelated i water i bias do goodness is anatomic data but i even a i have to ask the sorry to a take us on a slight tension but what is the average age of puberty in males in the united states a now yes you asking bags fort a spermary when sperm production begins another a lot of markers of a puberty the olicandavery sexual characters o beard grow deepening a voices here they happen at different rates in different people but ye thank you am at what point a are a young males undergoing puberty a t the level of o that we are talking about here yes it is yet there has been data that were going through puberty a little but earlier now than we used to i but it really drys we don i think it is not am just testostraan ranges between three hundred a night hundred is a wide range for anybody i think for most individuals puberty is probably twelve to kind of fifteen sixteen in general have just give sort of a very wide range when we are going to say that is o cayman some of the day dot basing it on is a when sperm production begins in boys and it is actually not that simple to be able to figure that out because he know we do not generally talk to young boys about how to master y had to collect and then check on that but there is something called first morning boiled drone where we can actually look at that and there have been some studies ton and they see if there are sort of in o nocturnal omissions whether the sperm in there and generally a probably stage around am the earliest o be kind of eleven twelve thirteen but usually most is probably little later may be all refine that puberty and move it a little but later by fourteen to sixteen is when probably about seventy eighty per cent of boys are going to have produced started producing sperm my understanding is that in females puberty is also shifting earlier perhaps at a more dramatic rate than appears to be the case for males well i think there is some data for males too i think a but i get four listeners on a want a have this onslaught of pediatrician seeing kids that haven't pen when boys haven't gone through purity by a certainty i think it still fairly wide let us get back to age of the father and issues autism a what are the data there am an this to me is a practical issue because i think if there is one obvious take away from our discussion to day it is that a males should probably not wait until there trying to conceive in order to assess the reproductive health at the level sperm quality a testosterone levels perhaps but at least sperm quality but am but perhaps men should so be freezing their sperm if in fact conceiving children after forty places their children at far greater resrautism and miner standing is that the rates of autism or somewhere between one and eighty you will hear as high as one in fifty male best but i think it is proudly more one in sixty to eighty is that a right m and that the age of the father is a ristcractor yet i think that this guests in sort of the larger issue a how men sore a received fertility we know that as women ate for till declines but the oldest father ever ninety si the biologic potential certainly persists it i wont to know how long he lived to see how his child grow up w he conceived at ninety six supposedly supposedly a we i is being he did not mean his grandchildren at least not the you grandchild of that child well how long did he live i i well that this is was a man in india it is as head up a famous story but supposedly i he had a child he have that child with him on a their waiting a stop he fell asleep ta child was hidden out let the devote oh e dreadful sort of a horrible end but the wife was also or not not battle but in her fifties case ye well am tragic an an incredible story for separate reasons em coquet it'll get my head around this ninety six year old a a conceiving a child a c a please continue yes people i think her men think that the sort of the m there fertile road is sort of infinite but i think that is very much not the case sos you are alluding to people have looked into risks for older father you know about a hundred years ago as first notice that dwarfism or controplesio was more common and last born children eventually that link was made em and since then other conditions too there these nervous psychiatric conditions are talking about autism as certainly one by poler skitsiphrania people of looked at also linked that with older age less attainment in school failing grads all that has been shown to be a little but more common with older fathers why i think all these exists there can be sort of different explanations em one explanation for the autism association it'll talk about em some of this more genetic or i computational reasons about one thing that some people say is that could be sort of a hereditary trait and it may be that men that displays some sort of artistic characteristic seen a maybe they take a little longer to meet a pardner and it sort of delay child rang maybe that is that is one possible explanation but i think you know there is been a lot of convincing evidence that there can be no real biogenetic changes that occur with age mutational changes that occur with age em i think i read artistic and you would know more being under a scientist that eighty four per cent of the the genes in our body express somewhere in the central nervous system that me much about right ye i to i d want to stamp my name to that a but that sounds about right em its its estimated that every year we ingenerate about two mutations and are u you knows firm dine you can imagine that of forty year all that is going to have twenty year idea forty more mutations i then a twenty enroll that rate does go up and if your disrandom else sprinkling mutations in a venom that they are more likely that sort of manifest and may be near a psychiatric conditions em there are you know date a coveting data that shows that that does occur now again there's millions of base pars in the body these ran mutations likely most of them will not result in anything but there cannot be some meaneeful and for example a countroplasis due to mutation in fire blast to growth factor receptor em and what is interesting is that this condition is not that rare rite based on sort of these rare mutations you would expect this would o cur may be about one and a hundred million but it turns out these these conditions occur in about one and think thirty to fifty thousand or there sort of discrepancy based on for mutational rate that we expect based on age and the rate that we actually see the explanation for this is something called selfish pramatigonial selection what this suggests is that some of these mutations that occurranomly occur in provider ration pathways and it gives the sperm that contain these sort of advantages over there brothers and sisters that do not have them for example and then they out compete the there sperm and there more likely to lead to a child rather hin sort of a random smattering you can act you see that some of these mutations are more common and older men than younger men if you look rescreen for some of these mutations in somebody these pathways em again the longer that were exposed to life there is us more likely to be o different chemical exposures other exposures and people have looked at epigenesis signatures sort of these signatures that em the dictate which genes are going to be express an which are not and there r different patterns between older and younger fathers and why what triggering those is not known but there are differences those could also potentially explain some the risk that we see em you don't used to be that people thought that you are n older father maybe there is a lot of advantages for the kids risks suture you are more resource it i always tell patients t when they come to see me for my correction problems or anything i always say nothing gets better with age right an that is mostly true although they pointed out that em salary often goes up with age and wisdom goes up with age you'll imagine if you are more resource maybe the kidsrgana also have an advantage to that but you know again there is a lot of convincing data that is that is probably not the case em there is even there is one study that i saw that showed that if you look at em our eyes e brains of children just after birth the actual a little smaller for older fathers compared to younger fathers em i think there are some sort of talking about of negro coat of development em some of those e facts an there's also been em studies looking at cancer risk too risk of best cans er prosstey cancer in adult children risk of bulimia or sweetness cancers an children as well i think the more we look the more we find out of these associations with paternal age em i think it some me certain my be aware i think he talking about mitigation strategies i think for education be important for you couples to try it earlier you individuals to try early er to conceive if we think it situational reason i think em certainly freezing sperm i think is is a godoction as well my understanding is that am analysis of done fragmentation in sperm de does not allow for selection a the best sperm on the basis of a done composition am translated to english what i mean is in order to tell whether or not the the dona or mutant in a sperm you have to kill the sperm basically am since am in a given pool of sperm to speak am there will be forward motile nonmotile twitches twitching in place dead sperm am some percentage dead sperm in motile sperms presumably no normal some small percentage hopefully am and that some might have some done fragmentation some might not a is the way to address this am averages it what ism hearing here is that if you have not already had kids or if you want more kids am that you might want to know about your sperm quality i would say you do am and that if you can afford it you might want to take a look a donee fragmentation data am but having done this am what one receives is a chart that goes from red bad to green good and then they put the arrow hopefully in the green zone and then you say oh good ism in the greenstone i do not have fragments done in my sperm but really that is an averaging of all the spurn right right it could be that as you age that some percentage of the sperm have fragmented donee and am if one of those is the one that successfully am wins the egg to speak a fertilizes the egg then that fragmented donee containing sperm is going to propagate that in to your offspring are there an y technologies that can allow men to am select or for or improve the done of therspurn not just the motility i yet with right that sort of the holy grail because i think he pointed out sort of a varying of right the hisenburg and certainly principles that we cannot if we identify which sperm is bad we are nearly gan a destroy it to tell which one is harboring these mutations a would be great but i think we are not there yet i mean one thing that we do do is washsperm we do sort of select the most total sperm we clear out the dead ones a and i think emery all does r pretty good at telling which firm thy think or better but end again we do not have any real objective data to try and understand you know which or harboring something or other but i think if we understood more about this link with age or again other conditions a hopefully proud veal a stop some of this pass through let us get back to the prostate a is incredible gland tell tell us about the prostate i think we hear about the prostate we hereabout prostate cant sir am people might have heard that it is involved in the ejaculatory response it is solve directions it is involved a number of things you give us a i catalogue of things that the prostate does a have you spent low time thinking about this gland what is moon the cooler things that it that i it does that we do not know about a how do we keep it healthy a and what are the consequences of not keeping it healthy yes or the prostate is a gland about the size of a walnut it sits behind the bladder and is involved in reproduction it produces some of the propenes and times that are necessary for sperm to be supported in ye ejaculate to kind of keep the the sperm healthy in the female reproductive tract it functions in reproduction and than base this way after reproduction is done it does not really serve any useful function then it just becomes a problem essentially thou urethra which is where repeat through it connects the flatter end to excess the body a runs right through the prostate and as we aids the prostate does get bigger that sort of a known thing and is the prostate gets bigger it creates sort of more resistance in this pipe and it makes the flatter aft to work harder and that leads to a lot of the symptoms that we have been talking about already he a waking up at night we extreme this neuter a furnace urgently a sometimes feeling your not tempting all the way it is sort of a consequence of the prostrate a r being there in terms of ways that you can keep the prostate healthy i think that there is really nothing that necessarily you can do i think that one thing ice talk tho paces about one these sort of symptoms start is to know some of the triggers i me in you mention drinking a lot before you go to bed if you do not want to wake up at night that is not a good practice see i even anta going to bed you little dehydrated just you can try to last the night a there are some particular drinks or foods attend to be more irritating spicy foods a civic foods those con sometimes irritate the lining of the flatter and make yet to pea a little but more you know caffeine is a piratic a it makes us urinate more and also am i can also irritate the flatter and giveyou that sensation alcohol will do the same thing i think kind of knowing some of those triggers make conto stave off some of the symptoms little of it but get if you enjoy those vices and you are willing to tolerate if that is locate to ism hearing more an more about a practice of people taking logos to dalifill sales a logos meaning in the neighborhood of two point five to five milligrams per day a not necessarily for erectile is function but for prostrate health and was am somewhat surprised to learn that those drugswhoare actually developed first for treatment of prostrate health to increase blood flow to the prostrate am is that true and am is there good reason to a think about taking two point five to five milligrams of todalifill per day simply for maintaining blood flow to the prostrate and thereby maintaining our improving prostrate health i mean certainly can do that it can deftly help with some of these urinary symptoms that we have been talking about looking et posing control trial sort of our hi else all of evidence does show that lotus of to day fill is two and a half the five milligram these daily dosing can help with urinary symptoms i think that not misterelings of preventative measure but for men that are bothered otherwise i think must men probably would not want to take a pill every day but certainly you have some of the symptoms at candefinitly help with the ordinary bother and then the attend benefit is you also alluded to is a can hep with e reptile functions well even at the two point five to five milligram dos interesting year my experience is that therefore lot of peoplewhow love to take pills every day u there seems to be a kind of binary distribution where and here ism just thinking about the male i hear from because i hear from course males in females but u i get a lot of questions about what can i take what can i take what can i take and but as you point out there is also category of of men who seem to not want take anything not wanted measure anything not want to take anything but a specially not take anything and then there is the other group and the other group somewhat surprisingly seem to be the lunk the younger excuse me population maybe grew up in the tube er up or maybe in the ere where sexual health was discussed more openly than it was certainly when i was in college i mean the extent of sexual health discussions at my high school i went to very good high school were it only takes one sperm which does you point out true for envy f but more s better if you are trying to concrete naturally and there were discussions about communication and consent obviously superimportant and then they just con turn to s loose u to learn from our friends and other sources i mean that and family sometimes had the discussions sometimes did not a different families different discussions obviously very very little in formation nowadays i think there is a lot more discussion about these things and the twenty to forty year old male crowd seems to be the crowd theater asking yet what can i take these a also people were getting on to s stern therapy early perhaps without the need i just one a flag that because am i think a i understand quickly am you are seeing a lot of testostran therapy that perhaps people do not need is that right well i think it is me some people probably do need it but i think that before starting it everybody to be aware of all the rests and you have on a high lighted some but testoster on any any medication right is going to have some rest since everybody needs to be aware of what the are and protest storm reproduction is certainly one and if they are not already doing all the other things getting adequate sleeve limiting their aldol and takes not smoke and getting exercise at camera seems that tostostron therapy would not be the primary entry point first work out all the right all the basics i think that is the big difference getting nowadays that what should i take question comes up early when people are not severely doing all the other things that they could do to promote their health anyway this is observation l on my part am you are the one whose clinic they're showing up i to am of question about u t eyes we hear about tizz your inartract infections am in women pretty often am do men get you t eyes if they are getting more than one ut i per year is that abnormal am should a men be a examined for am this flatter you urethra prostate final architecture i know their ways that people can come in i was reading about this prior to this episode at am can unjust a die and then they can die image the whole apparatus is that right l out having to cut anything is very is that worth people doing or s that only under conditions where people are experiencing some some am some vexing issue yet i think that some of those tested only be done if there is a problem but i think a man you are inarytract infection is rare enough that it should be evaluated women have very shorty repress but men have a very long thread it has to go through the entire pink to reathrougho the post i a greater up into the bladder and the way your distract infection what happen one way would be that of black curiactually gets all the way we know back and that is just ow much longer track and if something rare that does happen we look for anatomic causes for that there can be different search issue in the creator for example there can be stones in the bladder there can be stones in the kidney sometimes men are emptying their bladders all the way those those men should be evaluated because there can be some lithology that we can hope we identifying correct let us talk about erectile this function i put out the call for questions and anticipation of this episode and no surprise at least thirty per cent of the questions from males were about erectile this function or a questions about what is normal in terms of libido level of interesting right and we will deal with the first question first but what are the most common causes of reptile dis function are they hormonal in nature i think that is a common belief that if people are experiencing erectile dis function that it is because their tustostro levels are too low hence all the interesting testostroan therapy or are there other say blood flow related pelvic flow related curl brain to to body curl connections that are responsible on guessing it is all of these things how do we parch this and ye wattle us about erectile dis function what you most commonly see what you most commonly do in order to treat it ye erectile is function as you notice sort of the inability to consistently achieve and maintain an erection and it is fairly common of all the conditions i see that steely the number one you look at men over the age of forty over half will have some trouble with erections under age of forty is lobby about fifteen to twenty per cent this very common condition that we see in terms of the etiology it can very a little bit use to think that they were primarily psychogenic a but that was years that was decides ago now we know that most of more organic it is actually a blood flows due the most common conditions just sort of nationally would be the same things that cause blood flow problem anywhere the body blood pressure diesis on actors gross anything that sore can impair blood getting to the end organ a in sometimes the other has been data that trouble with erections can actually predates other more serious you now vascular conditions the blood muscles in the minus the pinaarteries are about one millimeter an the hart in the brain there much larger you knife's much easier to clue a small vessel than a large vessel that is why there have been some studies support that a sort of an early marker for vascular disease a i think looking at those is factors a sort of life style will be city again is another is a common one a entertain disorders actually fairly small it is probably less than ten per cent probably on five per cent or a public cancer treatment is another very common one after you now treatment for postal cancer whether be radio there be our surgical there be flatter cancer am sometimes rest of coerectokina cancer of that treatment also any time were am involving some of the nerves in the the musculature in the pals that can also impact erectile function as well what abut hernia here a that should be separate sometimes if there always say that in medicine you can never say never a but generally if that was getting man of us erectile function would pro be due to maybe some pain sentries can rarely happen during this the early post optative period but the blood supply the nervous supplies is separate you say something very important for people to her am going to highlight it a you said that less than ten per cent of reptile this function is due to a hormonal issue a i soft know w re's time your spending on you too been the internet but that is going to be a shocker for a lot of male out there because much of the discussion round testosterone is around libido in sexual function it is key for people to hear that it is also key for them to know about this other ninety per cent when you say blood flow issue then a what is the common first pass for treatment and again i forgive me for listing us off over and over but we are assuming here that people gotten their body weight down there sleeping enough they are not in busting excessive a call there not smoking or raping not smoking canvas we're doing the edibles although anguish talk about edibles and minibus and indignant effects will do that later doing all the things right avoiding doing the wrong things too often or at least completely we're assuming their going all that correctly their testosterone levels are somewhere in that three hundred to nine hundred centigram pertest leader it range that is typical for the called reference range a in at least in the ask thing t goes up to twelve hundred or may be fourteen hundred and other countries but as other countries to point out but it starts at too now ism just getting but assuming their doing everything correctly and it is not its testosterone issue then if it is a blood flow issue meaning they have not had treatment for sum pelvic cancer what is the first line of treatment yes assuming that life style and all that has been optimize magical treatment has benoptomize there is a lot that we can do i ways tell men as long as they've a penis we can always make it heart o there is there is a tremendous amount insure the are the most popular doctor in your field a the louncyat yet that usually does cinnaheese everybody you see we start with old there be phosphate posphodastres in hibitered there that would be sodenapilla diagram todalical saline venifill tundra averdenfilllebitra would you be willing to talk about some the specific the are you a is the typical thing to put people on this two point five to five milligrams per day low dose or to am give the his doses that are more commonly used a for reptile dis function perse i think it depends we know why we are putting them on and how much sects they have to on average people probably have sects parted sects may be once a week on average one we are looking at men an their count of thirties beyond sometimes it can be a few more times a week than that but if their having sects every day are very often and sometimes a daily dose can be useful but generally most men are on just on demand a cazurgon to fall into that you know may be about a few times a month category that is usury a we start and therefore sort of a titration that cannot be done you can go slightly can a overdoses are lower doses usually start in the middle to the overdoses a and you know we talk about some of the side effects they may have but those probably help sixty to seventy per cent of men a and they work well you known terms of another common questions how to we decide which one were going to start sometimes insurance will tell us which one we are going to do a that is a common one you know all these medications then to be somewhat similar one difference it tends to be the time of onset how quickly they reach peak levels in the body and then also how quickly they are cleared from the body to pailfuls somewhat different in last longer the half life is about twenty hours or it sort of market it is a week end pill some people the idea of that in taking a pill on fridge still having some left on sturdy a but for others we start with with one of the other ones the fact that these drugs to dellfull a also callsialis ferrites el to seals the brand name it o k and viagaros out of brand name it stands for a what is the generic name o we can a feel seldom one a because they are effective in such a large percentage of cases what does that say about the vascular system of all these male tater am having erectile is function but then it is going resolved by these trug treatments is that you n other words somebody comes into your clinic their having this issue you prescribed am one of these drugs they come back and say everything's working great or maybe they do not come back they just young send animal say everything's scrap am but do you need to have a discussion with that person about their over all vascular health because a few minutes ago you told us that the fact that they were not getting erections due to what now appears to be vascular issue a can be resolved for the final tissue but am is it can absolve their other vascular issues or would those people be on the lookout for sleeper of vascular party of vascular disease that can potentially cause things at least as bad as e reptile this function may be worse it absolutely i think they should be screened sometimes on diagnosing and the first doctor that their seeing at a long long time a but otherwise i do encourage in to see a primary care doctor to be screened for blood pressure lipid levels fasting a blood locos all those things again sort of early markers of some of these sometimes are identified sometimes not but i think it is you know i think we kind of talked about set of the ideal patient that perfect byway nothing else is going on but that is as very rare entity usually there something that can be done to be optimize and i do not i try not to be alarmist about this but i do want to encouragement that sort of take ownership of the health was that sometimes can improve am some of these conditions but again we have terrific medications for for men in whom we cannot what are the commonside effects of these trugs there base a dilator they open ut blood muscles we get some off target of fact headache fateful flushing back eggs cramps indigestion nasal congestion those would be the most common before the last superable there was some press about the fact that a lout of the players were taking these drugs at low disagrees before the game presumably to increase blood flood of their muscles and brain as that s that what the rational was i think yet you know another we talked about sort of how cycling may lead to erectile promoter sexual promise er has been some data looking at taking diagram or one of these medications the alias to altho before a ride again to trying increase circulation tho decrease the chance of any of the negative effects of prolonged saddle pressure but sounds just increasing blood flow and lowering blood pressure slightly is just a good thing all around ye tether secretly abautyet cause these medications were originally i think as ore alluding to or developed as a blood pressure treat and this was sort of an amazing off target effects that is turned into a billion dollar industry you mention about ten per cent or less of rectaltis function is due to end crinicius does it sixty to seventy per cent can be resolved with a with these blood flow in dancers i know it is a terribly non a a non clinical non scientific way it describe the aggress a sales to calico a et camera a what about the remaining per centare and are there other treatments that a you you prescribed or or given a in which cases do you need to a resort to a i guess more in evasive reproaches ye another therapy we have as your deathful suppositories you can actually put a medication in the tip of the pianist sent absorbed by the rest of the penis also inject its suppository as a oratory or jell or a jelly ye a it is also abas a dilator sort of the concept is very similar and sometimes that he knows is o a for men tolerated it is a save for partners as well a it can tingle little bit he deftly let men know it case e one of the main medications dos causerie a little bit of a a burn as well why would somebody do this as supposed to taking the piliform of the drugs were just talking about mostly efficacy would be a big one a and this this this can sometimes help where others cannot that is one final injections are another common therapy the efficacy of final injections or obey eighty to ninety per cent again were injecting was a dilators into the penis the idea just opens up blood bustles easier again and o keep erections you can imaginethere the huge psychological burrier to putting an needle in your penis bet is something that the patients are doing for themselves at home or that you are doing is it long lasting is that something you do it the clinic and then they come back every few weeks or no yet this is an condemn treatment we we teach them how to do at the first time i do with us in clinic i really we try and get a erection the last twenty twenty of thirty minute we easily start of the low dose and then they just increase at home until they get ben on erection that last for that amount of time is it injected subcutaneous sir actually into the good miss a the meteor tissue of of the penis that is right into the erectile bodies directly and they the only have them neck one side they do communicate with each other most men that's find it is he small it's very small gage need all about his begazina a few strand i here having been ointment over in opthemology and i have seen injections in to the human eyeball and it is incredible how fast and how painless that procedure is when it is done by the right person nobody should try that at home on their own but when is done by a sealed othemologist is just striking in a her you thing about needle in the eye we know what is worse like the childhood when i writes stockaneedling my pecan thing of anything worse but maybe an injection the pen sounds almost as bad but you are telling me that if patients are prescribed this that they can do this with with limited if any discomfort well it does have a highbrow outright surprised surprise be knowings excited about it you knot guess the mood can sometimes we effected but a lot of couples are very comfortable with it against very affixations the part the man can do it is partner can do it it does work well and i i guess here were sort of sending the the list of a evasiveness i what what is that that the sort of top tear of evasiveness for a frisked of es function then we go in to penguin plants there's actually a cortical proceeded we can do to put a to bice inside the penis that can help men be hard when they want to and that comes in sort of two main forms there is either not inflatable or inflatable the not a floatable sort of a bendable am it is has sort of a metal corps and when men don't on have sex they bended down when they ready for sex the can kind of bend it out is to really just there on demand yes e interesting ye it is very simple to use am sort of the more i guess m for a natural form to be the inflatable when you are not using at its deflated than when eureadity use it it is inflated and you have inflate it with basically a pump that is in the scrotum all this is sort of surgically implanted inside a man all under the skin unless what you are looking for it be very difficult to tell if a man visitor does not having but when he is ready you pumps it up and it moves fluid from a reservoir which used is also also surgically implanted into the penis to get a redirection what is the relationship between psychological arousal an erection as it relates to these technologies i in the way you are describing it sounds purely mechanical it am which ism a nocturnal erections which i suppose people could be having erotic dreams but i do not think that is a a prerequisite for nocturnal or erections at all right am is the idea that if adequate blood flow is achieved then any signal from the brain can initiate a cascade of blood flow that creates the erection or is it the case with some of these treatments that a sounds a blood flow is almost am autonomist right what think a lot of these am yet the blood flow is not adequate and that is what we are having to you knows where to go beyond but generally is to point out there is different stimulation whether it be visual tactile or factory a it sort of start stay cascade that releases near transmitters in the penis that leads to the space dilation naturally and men get erections a few years ago i was reading about am was oppression instalments there as a munch of stuff hitting the market am by the a y i do not suggest et people am get experimental with the stuff i has a her scientist who also am knows a thing about a nerpeptides and er hormones that can impact the hypethral ma ceknoi just i i just cover my eyes in on of am cringe when i think about people in haling they suppress and thinking oh ye o there is a study that is oppression increase of sexual desire or something that am but nowadays ism reading lot more about a really interesting peptide i treatment which i think it is a after a prove prescription drug which is am relates to a a a malanasite stimulating hormone that comes out of the medial pituitary am that is used to increase sexual desire it is prescribed for women am but men are starting to take it a and it seems to have at least from what you read on the internet am a pretty profound impact on libido and on erectile frequency and persistence m is it something that its your using in your clinic a a know what what about these baptizes that people are inhaling and enacting and some of them are taken in oral form but most often i think it is nasal inhaling or am a or it is a a subcutaneous injection yes i those are not ones that that we is in clinic but i think looking a sort of just sexual dysfunction broadly there are a lot of things that we do try and help i an one of things sort of that i kind of relates to that that is it is been a proposed treatment for it is this concept of the late orgasm or delate ejaculation i think everybody's familiar with premature ejaculation i we man ejaculate too quickly i but on the other end of the section there is men that takes a long time to ejaculate and what that is is you sort of define differently but generally most people would say sort of two standardeviations above average on average probing around five minutes or two standard deviations would be can twenty to twenty five minutes of for men to take that long to ejaculate that would be considered delayed or sometimes they do not ejaculate every time that they h no have relations for those i think there is in need for treatment because there is no of to approve thirty for that and that is why i thinking of providers or trying some of these other he know more experimental things there some that we use tost not that one in particular there is also some devices that have been rivalled as well tut it is it is a challenge because the now i certainly really feel for these men e it is one of the pleasures in life we and some of em are never able to have sects a only or s i revealable to orgasm an some are only able to do it very rarely we do on of fer the benefit what about pelvic floor health more generally e the topic of pelvic floor health is something that comes up more often around female reproductive health and neurology were about needles eagles eagles i oh know i is will have to ask him to the turns out keegell keg was a person em who named the exercise after himself with an he did them i do not know but u minorstandigs that keeled or a pelvic floor strengthening exercise and my understanding is that some people experience urinary or sexual dysfunction because of a overly relaxed a ka weak pelvic floor but that some people have the exacting problem because of a viper contracted a ka a overly tense tight strong pelvic floor meaning do not run out ins our doing eagles just are you heard about them they are not good for everybody they might be bad for certain people but what about pelvic floor health i mean should men be paying attention to pubic floor health should men be doing public floor exercises i ma thick it through we key that you say that as not everything hereabout is good and i think it is not good for the right persons there are certainly men that i see that have very no just a lot attention lot of anxiety sometimes these men you now urinate every hour i mean there is other things than you can just tell their sort of her e wound up and i think for that man one of the issues you count of allude to as he prolines relax more pelvic floor physical therapy can still benefit because there are some just different feed back exercise that could be done to help with relaxations any er allows officers dualists a lot of different providers around the region that can help with some of these a legal exercise though it can be usefulinor for example for a mi prostate canso rehabilitation some of these men forward trying to canto rebuild some of the strength or maintained or improve continents in these men we do want a strengthen some of these muscles that they can tor creator replace what was lost when the prostrate was removed i think for the right man they can be useful but yet it could be a dangerous tool in the wrong hands and you mention that if you want to learn more about pelvic floortherapy vacant contact their local neurologist and find a good pelvic floor good male pelvic floor specialist do they tend to specialize male female they usually a pretty much gender sexagnostic they usually are able to help all and a forgive me for a asking for in a bridge tenotomy lessen here but could you describe the pelvic floor muscles and how they relate to the flatter prostrate yourethropenus anatomy that you talked about before cause i have the picture of the flatter youreathrou prostrate penis in my brain i know by a life experience where the testes and screw to more relatives all that but it now in try to figure out a out to the pelvic floor bunch of muscles that that are attach to the pelvis but how do they interact with those a with those organs yet you questions they sit beneath the sort in the geraniums o the area between the scrotum and the anus and a beyond too they basically support all the structures there they supports the base of the penis the prostates the flatter the rectum and there the can keep man you know adequate tension to keep a l the structures up they relax when u no different functions are necessary they very important for ejaculation i mean a some people think that they count of trigger some of the orgasmic response as well am you know some times men will have in pain in that are in the partner area can transmit to other parts of the body the scrotum you know one of that one cause of scrotal pain and there can be many can sometimes in public floor disjunction i think you n again pespulifor therapy can be useful for a sort of a consolation of symptoms against some urinary symptoms as well i think for some patients it can be helpful but i again the if if get thinks two tense i back can sometimes be harmful presumably these public floritherapis also help people achieve a more relax public flourish that is what they need exact got it going to some of the questions that came back to me when i solicited for questions and in suspicion of this episode several not a few a let us say couple dozen people asked about split your in stream is that a signature of prostrate overgrowth is that a a urethral issue is it perfectly normal a ism assuming here they mean a split stream of your in that does not unify at any point the towing about a consistently split your instreme and for those who you do not know i am talking about or talking about a your instreme that is ice to your instremes and we are assuming one yourethro opening cause i hit the literature on this and am there is a case of a failure to fully fuse thong urethral doc during development where pop som i assuming small fraction of male have a you rather opening on the base of the minus and at the tip of the penis what's rule that out as a impossibility for now but now that it is on the table what percentage of male have that a to urethral openings well hypospadios mat you're describing where the the actual meatus is not at the tip but its mantis along the aproximliorethroug or you know even further down somethings in the scrotum pro about one percentile's and usually it is recognize it birth and oftentimes it surgically corrected cause better to prepared early rather than later o k ruling that out em what is the cause of split your in dreaming is it am a signature of a larger issue one of the reasons we your in sort of am from an evolutionary stamp my rites to you knew basically deposit sort of a convenient time our ways and we do not want to get at everywhere we do not want sort of label ourselves am with smell of pourings it will be easier for predators to to bold identify so just similar to to day we everything to get in the toilet without creating a masts any time there is turbulent flow m it you'd certainly count signal in in issue it could be like rethroshites ore pointing out a prostatic issue inadequate speed of getting er an aldimietus quietly should see physician to get evaluated because there is likelysome issue that can be improved the most popular question i received from males however was about perhaps no surprise peanut life you are an expert in this actually m not just because here a neurologist mail reproductive health expert wat am you publish a study recently on the changing friends in final length a tell us about that study have many questions about am the methodology because am i have to assume the stint involve self report it those were excluded ya task am lying was excluded a thin facetious here but a how was this study done i ma pretty incredible study am and the results are i do not knife there surprising or not a i first i thought oh this is surprising but the results were only surprising and light of what you were tight earlier about sperm in tustostro notice i think a it'll let you diatribe the study now rather than than giving people the punch line here yes i mean that worship was that we were looking at we wanted no average length for another project that we were doing and you know going down the rabbit hole this has been reported for decades there is different reasons that people have reported in lengthen t sometimes they do it i just on volunteers against sort of get the average lengths of different populations sometimes it is done preen prosurgically to try and understand what changes would occur a we just sort of cold the literature found data on fifty five thousand men all over the world a and want as yet there is a a sort of a time pattern with that and similar t your hypothesis we assume based on all the other data that we would likely see a decline whether it be no chemical and biremenal exposure but if nothing else if we are getting bigger the function a pink length should decline because the superpubic fat pad will get a little a bigger and will con o lose pink length with that and much to our surprise the superpevic ascus me of being the pat of fat directly over the pink r and you know i fact gets bigger that will necessarily compromise pen length but you alluded ti we found his actually opposite that a the penises were getting getting longer with time how it is measured measure differently one of our inclusion writer was that all the studies had have measured fort of in and office sort of in a clinical setting whether it be a a cognition or whether be a researcher that actually did it there is different ways you can measure penis you can just do a stretch length you cant o stretch it up as much as you can and then you sort of a ruler to measure how long it is again from sleep as you can get the pubic bone ideally up to the tip of the a the glans or the abase hearts wo at hes describe hes talking bout measuring from the top no in the bottom beef not u last questions about this measuring from the top not from the bottom no cheating a time at stretching the iris wait is flaccid presumably and then measuring from essentially contact with a location that is contact with the pubic bone to the the tip right o that that length was recorded in fifty thousand men well yew that was one and that we also looked at erecting and there is different ways that an erection can be achieved sort of an a clinical studying one as you could ask the man to stimulate himself and then measure that was some of the studies and then the other method we have lured too earlier as you can inject the man with the medicine to give the erection and then measure it and did fifty thousand men participate in that aspect of the study it was less now that was that think that was about probe ten to fifteen thousand men i have to wonder whether not it is easy or difficult for people to recruit subjects for these studies i do not know i could see it going both ways yes some of the studies actually had a tremendous number had about fifteen thousand men some individual studies contributed that and actually interesting after we published that there were some men that volunteered for the next study to be measured ism sure you will hear from some of them after this up tissue what was the major finding the major finally wanted to do as just give normal to data we found that it varied around the world based on different regions m the averages lengths varied a little bit but generally on average am erect peen us is privateer about five tor six inches somewhere in that neighborhood that was fine of to take homey o was the average the average directly id you publish the full distributions ah we didn't not this we were were were our plan was actually to make a follow on study we can show everybody i guess probablythey were interested where they con it fell on the ground but it was fairly as normally distributed yet i would think that despite the u the wide availability of pornography that that the distributions the scatter plots of all the data would be interesting to men for the same reason that the testosterone by function of age data publish h as a scattered plot in that textbook e referred to earlier i her interesting because am the scatter plot distributions pic a point a other take always that one can be in their seventies and have testostro levels equivalent to a male and healthy man in his thirties that one can be in their thirds and have testostro levels that er twice as much or half as much as as h match cohort this kind of thing a think that there is value in that a what what other take always a arrived with the data from the finest length study that perhaps we did not we didn't here about my what d what do you find most interesting about about the data wellthat there was any change over time you notices a prettily short a study was pry about no thirty years or but we did find the pink length has been increasing over time a that was just sort a fascinating that we would've sort of in such a short interval of time tat their be change number one but that we old see a lengthening number two you know again similar to the concerns a rose for these youknowerelse will be short period of time where you would see changes in seamen quality you know suggest something sinister it it is unlikely to be genetic change because that would take centuries probably i certainly several generations of the fact that this happen quickly a was just surprising a this brings to mind some of work that i was involved in years ago am when i was a master sudden i studied a early organizing effects of hormones on a the brain embody and a mi's sure this has been up dated a since that but am my recollection is that a during embryonic development males a are exposed to a certain amount of hydro sestostron not testostrom soul dihadre testostrom which organizes the brain male as they used to say now the the the verbiage around tat would probably be a obit different but the ideas that a man els are born a with final tissue of course but then it during puberty that the same hormone did testosterone then exerts an activating effects on the generals and the generals grow during puberty minus length increases assuming that the study that you did was on males a postpuberty it assuming it was am then it would imply that some things changing about the levels or the signaling relate to dihadratistostron a how could that happen do we have any ideas about what might be happening i mean this is the opposite of environmental undergrad disruptor preventing sperm from being as you n ow high quality and numerous as they could be or for er environmental factors either in uteri or posturer am suppressing testostro levels here were ti m by the opposite if it were tie a jihad testostro levels presumably being higher in males over the last thirty years and thereby longer penises right i mean tat there is different conjectures that you could make about why this could happen the merit could be you may be endercran destructing chemicals you knowing uteri some early exposure that some of the mothers had to conihandroganic effects during the man programming window the mayhap less o some longer lengths a another hypothesis we had as that if males are going through puberty earlier the earlier one goes through puberty the longer length tends to be maybe that provides sort of this lend to earlier puberty tends to be longer but potentially means longer duration exposure to diagratistostron longer penises yet you may be surprised in to know you mite not be surprised to know that there is a a sub culture on line i know because they contacted me an anticipation of this piso hum of am post pubertal males who take a commination of dihadratistastron and low levels of growthhormon in e forts to try and increase their final length and that the am ones taking dihydrotistosran they are not taking our do their taking things mandrel on am which very closely medics the structure of d h t a they report a some success am fortunately they did not send me pictures am otherwise it would i amorino them to you for your next study am but this stuff is happening a a in postpubrdol man am it it all rests on this dihydrotistostron hypothesis a just a point of interest a i soft know physiological my does not make sense but that would work as your twenty up post pubertal an him less there doing other things unit some sort of stretching exercises or called joking but ye i would not recommend that thank you that was the response i was looking for a that community will be listening with em a open ears do not do it as owns were talking about d h t hydro tistostron am it is only fair to discuss the drugs that many people take to suppress tihydrotestostron in hopes to keep or grow their hair things finasteride do astride m some maybe many not all people who take these trugs particularly in oral form experience a sexual dysfunction issues am and other issues related to suppressing d h t that said my understanding is that these drugs are also quite useful maybe even life saving in some cases for staving off certain forms of prostate cancer what re your thoughts about finasteride de astride do you see people coming into your clinic who are having sexual dysfunction or other types of issues because of their heir or attempt to maintain or grow their hair issues and am equally important is that we talk about called postfinasteride centrum i got a lo of questions about posts phinastrite centrum because it'll describe it in a couple of minutes it sounds pretty devastating for these people's loves em and it'll explain why it is devastating for them e in a moment but yet what about finasteride you astride in these drugs that are effectually dead tea blockers em it levels if they get too hide indeed can gantries the hair logical cause people lose their hair typically a front or in the back cross called crown or whatever you a widows peak a a or everywhere in some cases u it also use his hairgrowth on the back beard growth as we understand but then people go and take these drugs to try and maintain a grow their hair and oftentimes they have erectile this function or other issues is that surprising too i think the men that we see these em these side effects are are tend to be no younger men in their twenties thirties and forties and they take it as your pointing out for hair loss before was hefty a prove for that indication of these finasteride was you now they did randomize control trials to look em and one of the other things that will talk about two as is reproductive effects they did know lots of studies to see if there were changes in seamen quality for men on finasteri adverse of loseibo and there were some very subtle changes but a sort of in postmarked now we see these patients and clinic em everybody to enroll in these studies had normal functions i think that sort of important to understand and oboe my that is not life right the people come in with sort of different base lines and different amounts of reserve and we now know that there is probably people that are a lot more sensitive to these medications than others and there is some men that drop their firm counts dramatically and usually if we are we stop these medications their firm counts can recover you no use us fromatagenic cycles probity about two to three months usually and may be three to six months we usually see recovery for most men but similarly for you no sexual function i certainly have a number patients the due complain of libido erectile function this postfinasteride centrum i in the mechanisms i think ore less certain because measuring tastosra levels which we do sometimes if allergens or low or even if undersea seem to be in the maybe normal range or low normal range will trying increase testosterone through a variety of means testosterone clomophine sometimes will give you at help some men but not all i think the exact mechanism of what is going on here what is changing i think em he we need more more understanding about the exact sort of pap of physiology i no you tor aura chemically it seems a pretty serious trait off to either maintain grow hair or lose sexual function i mean not talk about d h t and some of these side effects have finastri dutastride on u previous episodes and ism not a cognition but my encouragement is always for people to approach these drugs with with a real level of seriousness if not caution the postphinastride centrum was described in these on lying questions as seemingly permanent even though people had ceased to take finastride or utastrote in other words they were taking the stop they i not know how they felt while they were on it but they stop taking it and the sexual dysfunction issues u do not seem to be resolving am does that mean they should go see a you ore another a man you are florist reproductive healthspoe specialist you i mean often times they do for these complaints they start to notice it when there on the medication than when they usually through on mine research con o learn about this potential entity sometimes they discontinue now some men do have resolution when they stop but there is this permanence and some handful of men i mean t they have done you am are imaging to try and understand sort of yo moral atomically or functionally what exactly going on i think they're lot of unknowns about it but it can be n a permanent or som they come in you known they see me in clinic erect all this function low libido and then we go down all the the host of treatmentsthat we talked about nova options that we talked about i gain we have resolution and som but there are some that seem treatment refractory yikes that is my only response i mean permanent effects a on sexual health in it as a consequence of an attempt to maintain one's hair i mean this square a in all seriousness it it just sounds something that a people need to think very seriously about because it as i understand there is nothing that can predict whether or not some one will have postpinastride centrum might right and i did am a bit of reading on this a within the scientific journals as well there is not a lot of information as you point out as it is a fairly recent phenomenon an that highline a different issue this may be the first time in history where young males a taking phinastride in do astride and that might be the cause of the postphinastride centrum right i think you alluded to this earlier i these drugs have proven to be very beneficial for older men treating prostate issues exactly right this is it postphinastrite centrum a i think a false under the category of medical conditions that a you know a few years ago we we'll hear the same about a chronic fatigue centrum even fire malta not long ago was considered one of these ways at all a psychosomatic issue not wed now clearly know that is not the case for five or milch by the way a but i can recall at time not that long ago when people a in the medical profession catlike ah ye this ion this a real thing but postphinastrte centrum sounds certainly real for the people there a suffering from it exactly ow i gain well the reason i spending much time on this as that a i get a lot of questions about it and they're clearly a lot of young males who take phinastwrter do astride or thinking of doing that a for cosmetic reasons and i think they should be aware of the potentially serum consequences ow but you did say earlier that if some one has a penis you can get it hard a all is not lost even for these postphinastride century inside cut holds that a a you mention clomaphine am could youexplain what clomaphine is and what it is used for am because again a we want this discussion to be centered around the real science the real medicine am but there is a growing kind of sub community of people out there who are sayingoke testosterone therapy can causes the sperm am suppressive issues and perhaps some other issues am but doing nothing might not be adoption for somebody who wants to increase there whatever libido other aspects of of androgen function am and there are a growing number of people out there who are taking clomaphine only in order to presumably increase testostrom but minorchine is that it would impact the estrogen pathways whatwhat is clomaphine a what your thoughts about people using clomaphine am scoff label a simply to increase androgen sketchy to me for reasons related to changes in nurse circuits am but you will tell us outworks now will think you for including the awful bell disclosure any time i talk about this i always have to say say that but clomaphine as the selects of estrin receptor modulator basically at blocks estrogen and from our earlier discussions of how the pituitary works the sort of an elaborate feebacklute between the pituitary and the gonads demand the testes and what happens is you know offstage elates these ganaditropan stimulate do testicle to make sermon testosterone testosterone perfectly converted estrogen and that feeds back on the hypothalamus to stop that gain you do not get an over production by blocking the estrogen receptor at the level the butterier of the hypothalamus you'll stop that and the idea behind blocking tat as the will get more production of effasage elates more of these drivers you get more testostro yet higher stimulation n of the tetanal you know the hope is that for fertility that sometimes it can improve sperm production too and there is some limited at that can help but i think it is your alluding to its sort of a way take is augment a body's own production of testostrom it certainly does that i think there's no question that testostian levels do rise i think that the reason that does not always help is because not every problem is solved by testosterone we cant a talked about someone in this o this discussion but also that you upended some estrogenic signaling as well and by blocking that you kw even partially court also some partial agonists effects of a clomophine as well it may limit it and turns out that estrogen siglos important for a lot of things is portent for bone health but sexual health too its important for libido that may be partially blunting some of the hope for benefits of testostr have found that men tend to be happier on testostrom than some of these other forms and that could be a possible explanation but one of the advantage of clulmophine if we are thinking about this is a treatment for low testostrom hyproganatism is that it does not have the same toxic effects on sperm production by maintaining the body's own production of testostrom by maintaining production of effs age plage will continue to get sperm production for this reproductive aged man that has low testostro and symptomatic o testostrom you know low to lean a low energy level extra mood sleep problems i can be a worth while treatment and it it does help a lot of men a but not everybody have always been curious why if the goal is to increase sperm production that the most common treatment is h see human chronic ganadatropen because as you mention early aluminizing harmony and envisage logical stimulating harmony a are deployed from the pituitary and travel to the testes where they stimulate a testosterone production and sperm production but is the effisate specifically that encourages sperm production why would not a a man whose taking maybe's a sacterom therapy or who perhaps just once increased sperm counting quality take fash instead of human cryonic at atop an which is more or less a proxy for utilizing homo that is a really good question and what offstage does lake he said as stimulates sperm production it seems could be a much more logical treatment and actually and randomize will so control trials it does do that one o the was not it does do that oil it is beneficial and we should we should give it more but one of the reason that we do not is cost it is rarely covered by insurance and c g a month of that is in a hundred o dollars let us say three to five hundred dollars but a month a sort of therapeutic postage us probably two to three thousand dollars that cost is really limiting it takes two to thee months to make a sperm a men often have to be would have to be honored for several months but there is reasonable data that would help and it does make lot more sense that that should be given as adjuvant there with testanstran rather g g a but g does work sort of everyone is surprise it does actually help a but i agree there is sort of a contradiction there if the price came down it does not be no this another awfullyable medication o for that indication a it would be it it could be worth while one hodman that we have not discussed is prolactin aim familiar with prolactin from a variety of perspectives but a ways think of a dopamean and prolactin is kind of a c saw relationship dope means up prolactin down do not me is elevated with sectoral desire spectral activity just ejaculation prolactin goes up sets perhaps the refractory period on erection ejaculation for some period time then dopey comes back up but this kind of thing and i realize that is far to simplistic that prolactin is doing many things in the brain and body besides that but how often do you see hyperoprolactinmias am do not of plural polemics is a a is clinically correct but a elevated levels o prolactin that are cousin problems a for men am what are some of the tell tell signs of that a and this it'd to use as a seaway to talking about a some bisexual dysfunction that is commonly discussed around the use of excess prize and other other drugs to treat depression and and mental health issues that sometimes create a endocrine and or sexual health issues yes prolactin am is sometimes we its i diagnose is hyeroplecnemias o diagnosis make not bat many times i would say less than one percent of the patients that we see will end of having that but usually it is a handful of times a year cause we we see a lot of patients am typically that to tell tells sort of symptoms would be no ones of low testosterone that is a common one but you know in my practice i see it a lot with no very low sperm production have diagnose several prolactin creating tumors and the manifestation of that was an the wasn't getting pregnant we check a sperm count was very low that mandates a check of testosron which is also very low and then that leads to a place in which is very high and then that that was diagnose it is something i think to be aware of but i do not know that there is not usually a lot of symptoms and sorry going to a cognition when your having sexual dysfunction symptoms lotestostrone or fertility problems will usually yo know be able to diagnostic its present are there any other hormones in the am in the galaxy of sexual health related hormones that a fall into a you know common clinical practice a free a i check escargot as well i think that is another one is again because the relationship with obesity i think that can be important sometimes there is too much oromadizatien and sometimes a that can be a problem i think you just we talked about normal enteron signal's important i think too much can be bad there are some men will refuse manifestations at ti a manifest as ganicomacity in some cases mail best tissue mil breast tissue yo as i was am told a was at that the a mail breast tissue as sort of e the appendix it is there but it is not very interesting writ is wright yet everybody has some and we just do not want the growth to get out o control could you tell us about one of the world's most difficult to pronounce words which is vericasil is yes vericasill it is a very common condition why about fifteen per cent of all men have it and it is a very common cause of in fertility you look it all the etiologies it can be thirty to forty per cent basic what i is as dilated veins in the scrotum i obvious to we need veins to get blood out of the testicles i ut sometimes it can be a little larger than average and there s sort of e normal for the thermal regulations of the veins a get too big its thought to warm up the testicle the other thought is that it does not adequately clear some of the metabolites i exactly the path physiologist somewhat debated but i think those probe contribute i and it something that everybody should be evaluated for if your concerned about fertility i again we see it very commonly given the fact that a lot of men habit about one and seven men have it it does not always cause a rob it may be about twenty to twenty five per cent of the time it does we'll manifest with low sperm counts we see sometimes discomfort ache you worse the end o the day than the beginning or tot activity any time blood can pool sometimes it stretches in some men feel that and then it kids sometimes it can lead to we either stunted testicular growth or shrinkage of the testicle m it is also thought to be a progressive legion to the longer man has it the more damage it can do usually manifest around puberty in general i it is not a concern for everybody but i think certainly of couples or having difficult to conceiving having discomfort in the area and you have one it is the discussion you should have about peonies disease yes a peonies is a scarring of the penis which leads to curvature or deformity the way erection's work is everything swells and you can imagine tat there is a scar tissue it does not swell symmetrically you get a curvature deviation sometimes you can get an hour glass or sort of a banding i you look it up on the inter now you can see a host of diner m deformities that men yet it drive present about five ten percent of men it is very common sometimes it could be from injury from o a a pen fracture or other be know sort of less severe form of injury to the penis sometimes men have described hitting it on different things potential that could could lead to it i sometimes it can manifest after am a postal cans or surgery or other kind of surgeries which can for to stun the penis or o injure some of the nerves of the penis m that is ant other condition we see commonly m you know obviously can lead to bother in erections are not straight that can just yo know cause a psychological bother to men can also physically make it difficult for a man to have sex m sometimes it can limit certain positions that is another common complain we see u i think it something that men should be aware of there is now wearing is campaigns now there is an hefty approved medicine for it a colagenasors iaflexs which is a medicine that is all scar tissue that is one of the treatments we have for it there is also you know different devices sort of stretching devices or we trying just mechanically remodel the penis to allow it to be a little but straighter u and then there is also surgical options to there is a lot we can do always tell men again long that penis we can make it we can make hard but we can also make it straight ism wondering why in the study about penis length a testicular size and volume was not also measured and and that is something hat we have not disgust what is the relationship between testicular size and volume and some of the other parameters were been talking about and maybe this is also a good time to highlight any kind of morphological signals that a would warrant people coming to the clinic a symmetry in tactical size for instance a changes in testicular size em obviously a size lump a they taught us in a high school less a a warning sign of potential testicular tumor or cancer a yo we you really talk about testacals yes i think that yet kind being aware you no the average size of m a tetanal for man is about for about a walnut puts about sixteen to twenty c cease i he used if you are get a measure at it be about for o born a half centimeters and longest axis to give your listeners or hours at some idea i if it changes certainly let people know if you feel anything let people know although am are you know national guide lines on screening practices recommends against regular testicular self examine interestingly because i think the concern is that it leads to more anxiety than cancers that it would diagnose but i think you n always tell men no one knows yous robin better than use of you identify problem you should bring it to attention you now the clastic appearance or the way that test is canter manifests of firm painless mass that you cold of feel coming from the tetanal am find interesting that am at least as i understand women are encouraged to do regular self exams of their breasts for for lumps o but you are telling me that men are actually discourage from doing regular exams of their testicles for lumps that could cancer at feels a m unfair a symmetry it tell as have been cancer i mean both both seem very important oh yet you i think there is no question i was stern very by us ye i was trying to say it is you did not have to oh yet ye onto get trouble wit you l as a is i at any one to get cancer i me not am i you want a dog to get cancer am ism surprised that they discourage self ex am but is it because men are getting it wrong they are coming into the clinic thinking they have testicular cancer and then most of the time they do not i think that is the concern that the number of cancers the or diagnosperses he false m the false lumps at they identic i just lead to more anxiety and i have not actually you causing more harm than good i think it is the concern but am yet it was a surprising recommendation when it came down usually patience ask about it i certainly do not discourage them from doing these exams and i have we certainly identified cancers through that means before i saw the episode of yare where the god was having trouble breathing when he was an elite runner and turned out he had testicular cancer and he had overlooked the lump on his testis also amen continued himself screen burnout numerous times say we have talked about the potential benefit of getting a blood test for hormone profiles limpid profiles and other things as well as a sperm analysis my understanding is that one can only do that if they have the disposable income to elect to do that through some commercial on line service u but is there any way that am patience who have insurance can a approach their physician in a way that this would be covered by insurance i do not want to get you into any trouble here but it is it is always such a shame it is such a shame when we are talking about something that is really am pervasively related to health as is sexual heal through productive health and people are not aware of a potential problem in the presenter in the future that could have been mitigated simply because they did not get a blood test we are do something as simple as a a aspermanalysis we cannot be a presumptuous in sang you to two hundred dollars or a thousand dollars in a big deal of me for people that is a huge steal am it is prohibitive u for many people how can people get the stuff asset should they talk to the primary care physician should they call it neurologist what is the best approach i think both are good strategies i think insurance is becoming a lot more open to covering om in fertility at least testing sometimes treatment as well i think a lot of insurance was covered that now can sometimes we check amen and allies for other face or issues but i think that you get as more of this date it gets out i think it is more recognition how important the male is i think we will get i sort of more being and coverage obviously women have the automatic feedback of oboe try cycle to they kind of now and there is a problem they can bring that to the attention but men do not have that feedback without some of the testing yet we probably should have mentioned this earlier forgive me a a this was on me to mention that i when we talk about sperm qualiume we sort of shifted back and forth to seamen quality it is possible to have normal seamen volume and have very low sperm count right he we are not talking bout the total amount of ejaculate perse we are talking about the density of forwardly motile healthy non liana fragment it sperm in that seamen right in other words it is not sufficient to just assume because a you can ejaculate that your sperm er healthy that is exactly right you i mane i think you know about fifteen per cent of men have low seamen quality whether be concentration movement shape bout one per cent of men have no sperm in the ejaculate and that something sometimes that new idea about the only way don know would be t actually to a formal test well ism encouraging people to get these parameters assist and i making that statement because it is very clear based on everything that love told us to day that sperm quality and hormone levels are just o important ism not just for sexual health but for your binary health and for reflecting prostate health and other aspects of whole body health and an ism sexual health relates directly to mental health i know i we did not talk much about the psychogenic issues but the to go hand in hand exam on o thank you much for coming here today and sharing much knowledge with us mi these really are the issues that males think about and wonder about and i have questions about and they do to varying degrees depending on wear the at in life but think especially for younger men who are hearing this i who are not at the point where they want to conceive it is really important to start thinking about these issues for all a the reasons you mention i think these issues are really important for women to know about as well just as it is important for men to understand a female reproductive health and and to not just improve communication but this after all is at the heart of the the presents and proliferation of our species thanks for taking care of the male half and and thanks for doing the work you do it is incredible the large skill studies the the more detailed the studies the on smaller populations the you ask the questions that it seems many people are just afraid to ask and any get rid in there and n come out with the the really rigorous data in answer thank you much for what you do i more think you think you are hitting men reproductively thank you for joining me for to day's discussion with doctor michael iceberg to learn

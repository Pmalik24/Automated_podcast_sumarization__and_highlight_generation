last night cent come as well as a bunch of other foreign countries warrant america millions struck at targets in remain they struck the soothes the soothes are a rag tag group of terrors who have taken over a large swath of remain after a massive civil war between the soothes and the sauries over control of the country the agrarians been funding the soothes for years and years and years will get into the history of what exactly happened with the soothes suffice it to say the reason that all of this is happening right now is because the soothes decided that they were going to try to acid as an uranium proxy arm and generate support four iron by attacking israel and then by more largely attacking shipping in the red sea now shooting off a few rockets or missiles at israel to get down by america ships or by the sauries that releten't have much an impact on world opinion our on the world at large but attacking ships in the red sea absolutely does according two cent come the soothes have carried out at least twenty seven attacks on commercial ships since mid nonmember between remember sixteenth in canary forth according to the western journal us navy said it had shot down sixty one missiles and drones fifteen hundred commercial vessels had safely cross the red sea but the biggest problem with the hubbub in the red sea and in the babel manful straight which is where huge percentage of the world's oil supplies travel through and a huge per cent of shipping generally travels through that straight shipping is down dramatically according to sea and beset just a couple of days ago rates for freight travelling from aria to northern rope more than double to above four thousand dollars perform foot equivalent unit its container aria mediterranean prices claimed to over five thousand one hundred dollars percontainer some carriers had announced rates above six thousand dollars perform foot container your talking bat in some cases a doubling of cost race from avion a north america east coast have prison by fifty five per cent westcost prices clime sixty three per cent few the supply can botemixs creed by bovid basically this group of pirates in an attempt to generate support fort iron among the arab street in the middle east they have basically created massive cost four america and western consumers and they have shot down large swaths of world trade now ye have right ninety per cent reduction year over year in traffic through the red sea from the prior year while all of this drove last night an allied attack on certain resources in demand controlled by the soothes it was a telegraphed punch meaning this entire exercise was designed to deter the soothes not designed to actually kill or destabilize the soothes who in fact as a say our terrors group that governs a large swath of part of remain the reason to telegraph the attack is to allow banians to get their military forces out of the way as not to promote in that provoke some sort of escalation with iron more directly because of corse on has lost o forces on the ground helping out the soothes in common according to the walls journal that ours ledcolishion lunch more than a dozen strikes on toothy rebel targets in common two days after the ebony rebel force to fight an ultimate him to halt its attacks on ships transiting the red sea with a brag of missiles drones those strikes were conducted by the united states andbrish forces the re supported by australia bahrain canada and the netherlands now the sauries they said that they were concerned about the escalation butletsto be real about this bahrain works very closely with the sorties brain would not have joined this coalition or allowed it to air space to be used for an attack this without the go ahead of the sorties the coalition strikes early fridge morning local time targeted made our systems air defend systems sturgeon launch sites for one way attack unmanned aerial systems cruse missiles and ballistic missiles said us central command a u a submarine several destroyers an job fighters part of the uses white d island our aircraft carriers stripe group took part according to a us defense official wo the officials reported explosions in the capital of yamen which is called sand and the provinces of hodadasada damar and elsewhere they claim the on the america finish brutish aggression a gainstyammon israel did not take part in these attacks thill obviously israel does have aircraft that are capable of taking part in attacks this son a host the soothes missile in centuries attack on vessels were launch from the port of data according to shipping executives present bi an immediately issued statement had these targeted strikes are clear message the united states in our partners will not tolerate attacks on our personal or allow hostile asked are to impanel freedom of navigation in one of the world's most critical commercial routes and will not hesitates to direct further measure to protect a people and the free flow of international comers as necessary meanwhile the brits prime minister she soon said the royal air for participated in the strikes also because quote the united kingdom will always stand up for freedom of navigation and the free flow of trade for brutish tipple jet fighters targeted toothy drone base in north western common and in airfield used to launch cruse missiles over the red s what early indications are that the soothes ability to threaten merchantshipping has taken a blow the soothes of corse say there not going tore detour because the way this works in the middle east is that you have easily terrorist groups that provoke airresponsefrom an overwhelming power they get their aside absolutely kicked and then they claim the just because they survive they one that what is currently going on the gosh strip compass provokes a gigantic is daily military response the largest is rally military response to any attack since nineteen seventy three and the get their asses absolutely handed to them and most of their fighters killed an most their leadership killed and then if they are breathing at the end of it they claim victory the soothes are playing the same game it is it is really honestly cowardly sort of stuff fossa all been omer a toothy official told the walstertural this is a brutal aggression i love this it is brutal egression honestogod if america and its allies once commit duo what brutal aggression against the soothes at this i would not be alive to talk about it to the we undoubtedly pay its price will mot waver in our stands to support the palistinian people regardless of the cost after the coalition strikes the us had not seen any direct retaliatory action directed toward us are other polish members in the reds and again the strikes came with a lot of warning one week ago the us written key allies it issued an ultimatum sang stop it and then they did not stop it and then on ears day biding convent his natural securityteene to discuss the options and then despite collision warning the soothes fired in antishopbalistic missile that fell into the water within sit of commercial vessel now the soothes new that the united states and italics were going to strike all of these targets and they'd relocated some of their weapons and equipment and fortified others the question is whether this is going to detour further action from the soothes the answer is probably not when you telegraph punches this it is very unlikely if that is going t convinced the soothes to stop what they are doing the allies for their part they put for ad a statement explaining what they were doing hes a joint statement from the governments of the united states australia to harden vellum candida denmark germany italy japan netherlands new zealand republic of care sing for and the united kingdom to recognizing the broad contents as expressed by forty four countries around the world on remember nineteenth twenty twenty three as well as the statement by the yuan security council on remember first a twenty twenty three condemning who the attacks against commercial vessels transiting the red a in light of on going attar including a significant oscillation of the pasture targeting commercial vessels with missile small boats and attempted hi jacking we hereby reiterate the following and warn the who the against further attacks i get to more on this in just one second first a few decades ago private citizens used to be mostly that private the internal has now changed everything thing about everything

attacks say the allies in the red c are legal unacceptable propounding de stabilizing there is no lawful justification for intentionally targeting civilian shipping and naval vessels attacks on vessels including commercial vessels using unmanned aerial vehicle small boats and misses including the first use of antishibolistic missile against such vessels are directs threat to the freedom of navigation that serves as the bedrock of global trade in one of the world's most critical waterways hes attacks threaten innocent lives from all over the world and constitute it significant international problem that demands collective action nearly fifteen per cent of all global seaborne trade passes through the red a including eight per cent of global grain trade twelve per cent of seaborne traded t oil eight per cent of the world's liquified natural castrate international shipping companies continue to reran the vessels around the cape of good hope adding significant cost and weeks of delate to the livery of goods an ultimately jeopardizing the movement of critical food fuel an humanitarian assistance throughout the world but our message now be clear say the alley we call for the immediate and of these illegal attacks and release upon lawfully detained vessels and crews the who these will bear the responsibility of the consequences should they continue to threat en lives the global economy and the free fly of commerce in the regions o critical waterways remain committed to the international rules bay storteranar determined to hold marine acts accountable for unlawful seizures and attacks now part of this is directed at the soothes part of it is directed at ran because ran actually did sense another ship just yesterday and part of this is directed ta china because china obviously has a very large interest in a tisanes election that is about to happen over there the tisanes election all the parties involved are not interested in reunifying with china but their some parties there are little bit more appeasement oriented tor china the reason the united states cares about this is because was am sea is the largest sophisticated microchip producer on planet earth their sophisticated microchips are in all t america military ten ninety two percent of unsophisticated microchips on planet earth the super conductors those are created in titan right now there is a military refusal by titan to give that sort of technology to the chines is one of the reason the chines militaries significantly less sophisticated and developed than the united states military word those microchips be made available to the chines not only would if facilitate invasion of titan t would also directly threaten the united states because suddenly the military capacity of the chines would be radically increased what is happening right here is if the cheeses look an they see that global shipping could be threatened by again a group of poverty stricken pirates in yeomen then they would take to themselves oke what sort of damage can we do with a weak wast in the titan tray were a huge percentage of the world's trade is located in the south china sea an what exactly could we do they could project erratically to the straight to malockwere nearly one hundred percent of local trade has to pas through china is looking on and they are seeing whether western weakness would allow again for a bunch of not in safely well equip pirates terra to hold up all of global trade and double supply can prices and sos very important that the west did something about this just on a practical level now on the moral level the who these is for the worst people on planted earth in legitimately evil awful group the who these are bezonian proxy group ran as we have explained is a terror sponsor it has its tentacles all over the middle east it has a tentacles in rock obviously where the have had significant impact on the government of rock they their tentacles in stereo are their allied with basher sad they have their tentacles in lebanon where they effectively control the government the ahisballock they have their tentacles in camass thrave their tentacles in palistonian is lemiccehad and they've their tentacles with the soothes thus tentacles are all over the middle east now one of big problems that are on historically has had is that ran is sheep and a huge percentage oath middle east is sound and because of that there is not a lot of solidarity between the she and the sun the reality is that whatever the hatred is for the jewfish state in the medalist the hatred for israel that is mostly aside show between the ongoing wars the have been happening between she and sure over the course of pass several decades amultipol for grabs and persons have been killed in a variety of wars since the nineteen eighties than anything that happened with regard to the news and all the hatred of the jaws does is it allows for the possibility of some sort of cross cultural communication between shit and sun in the middle east and that what the who these are trying to jurenathere trying to rally support to the uranium side in any sort of she sound conflict by hiding with the palistinians because one of the things that is happen is that the palistinians being incredibly radicalized population that literally no arab state will take in not only will no arab statestake in the palistinians arab stateshave expelled the palistinians before in the aftermath of the golf war two hundred of three hundred thousand palistinies worksfell throw coat because they sided with seldom who shine in his war against coat in the first gulf war none of the arb states are interested in taking in the palistinian population and the commoners went over torn and they work to deal where on became one of their chief suppliers and it turns out that the sounistates they have no interest in working with the palstonians g and very radicalized populations thee stabilized virtually every recipe they have come into contact with by the way this we you are seen jordan right now issuing these very loud statements because they are deeply afraid of their own population seventy per cent of jordan is palistinian and they are faith that their kingdom will be overthrown this told not be the first time they ad feared this his thin the early nineteen seventies jordan expelled tens of shamans of palistinians because of threats of over throwing the regime in what was called black softener the basic idea here is that if you are iron and you are seeking to by legitimacy with the arab street you polarize the region around the palistinians because what you say is look all these arab states hey will not make piece of the israel they can side against us but the real enemy is the den the real enemy is the ads and if we all remember that there may be will not have any abrahamicuords and iron of course hates the abrahamiquorts because it makes them a more minor player in the middle east tot creates in overwhelming coalition of force that exists around its borders that is the whole purpose the comasitac it is why the emote who these are now involved in it in a fight that really has nothing to do with them because again this it all being directed from above by iron llget'st more in this in just one second first balance of nature fruits and veggies

worst people in the world their literal slogan i can you not sick on their bumper stickers or something if they had bumper stickers on their goats they are their literal slogan is quote ala who car death to america death to israel cursed be the news victory to slams little long and does not rhyme but a pretty much side it all it's very strong slogan the rally hiding the ball there but it turns out that their hatred is not chest against america and israel and the sudan their hatred also is for their own children because apparently about one third of the entire toothy military force is under age they use child soldiers regularly bathe way not rarity francs to use child soldiers in the aronoroc war the cranial regime famously gave golden keys two kids and anthem out to the battle field the keys were supposed to unlock the gates of heaven is they real thing that happening the aronoroch war by the commas us child soldiers all the time westerners do not understand how people wore non western fight they do not understand this but this a reality in the mideleast it is a reality in afghanistan by the way remember recently we talked with this kenned s a green bray terms nothing more dangerous than an eleven year old with an a ay and an if if you are westerner what are you have been talking bat a living role with an a k but when you actually recruit children into your army that is what you get the soothes havebeen doing this for years according to vena news tyemmens toothy rebels are still recruiting children into their military ranks to fight in the countries grinding civil war by the ay hundred of thousands people been killed in the civil war once again demonstrating the world does not give any leaps at all about dad muscle long as other museums are killing them zero leaps none zip zilch two who the officials told the a p the rebels recruited several hundred children including those as young as ten over the passtumonts they've been deploy to front lines as part of a build up a force is taking place during a can broke or truce tho you and doing monument to work this back in tune of twenty twenty two the soothes have used what they call saercamps tot eliminate the religious ideology and to re croup boys to fight by the commands exactly the same thing in the gosestrip exactly the same thing s when you see by the way statistics from the gossip put out by commas says how many women and children are killed the designation of children meaning in the west would be anyone under the age of eighteen that includes a bunch of people who are in fact compass operatives because they start them real young in the gods does mean everyone is being killed obviously is a member of comas or compass operative but israel is being very very meticulous about who they are killing and a lot of the people that they are killing unfortunately are in fact miners whoa been recruited into the ranks of terrors groups by terra because tears do not have your moral standards they thinktat your morality is stupid they take advantage of it the lemony conflict of course erupted in two thousand fourteen that is when the soothes descended from their northern oncliv and they took send and a sooty led coalition enter the war in early twenty fifteen and this brings up exactly what jobidon did ay what is happening right now the quite the only question is to western strikes on the soothes is whether those are sufficient to detour the who the from continuing there piratical activity in the red sea another babel mound straight now all the talk not iron getting directly involved in the war or escalating into a larger war with the united states the be the dumbesthing iron ever did the way that the baronial moles are thinking right now is where about five minutes from developing a nuclear weapon at which point were untouchable why would we get in a shooting war with t most powerful military force in the history of the world that be the dumbest thing they've did right now a lot of what is going on is trying to uphold the credibility of their supposed commitment to commons an they made a commitment to comas the demon a bahamas commons ten succeeded beyond its wildestreams on o bomber seventh there get their asses absolutely handed s them in the gossistrip and what you see is aronians other around other proxies cisbalaw the hoo this you are seeing then do these start of low level attacks a against israel and it to allies in the region in an attempt to establish credibility with the arab street or the muslin street en that what that is but they do not want to provoke a general war i mean again if iron provoke general war would be the worst thing they ever did by the way unlike a rock during their rock war there certainly people o wanted arise up against an om who sales regime the biggest problem with on is the march see which is a generalize terrors group that is the that is the baronial revolutionary guard could their giant army but the actual population iron significantly more moderate and significantly more modernized than the population of a roc for example again none of thesis ha case that we should get into a war the iron the pointers that iron does not want us to get into war with on which is why were on to back them down the only question is whether the actions of jobidon by effectively and hitting empty buildings it's going tore enough to back the who the off or whether the united states an it is allege gan have to escalate this thing far enough that the who these actually backdoor are began have to threaten to destroy the other in order to back them down all of this by the way could have ben prevented all this god we been rented an in fact none of this happen while for a temple don a trumplass precedent why we will ay bees because jobidin is a weakling on forge policy weakness on foreign policy breeds a egression a egression reeds response this the typical pattern in western florin policy the west has will go tanto we do not want anything to do it this or dits get a move out and then something in guess have happens that hurts america interests an than america pass to respond if america response harshly enough suddenly enough sometimes the water s school but if america does not respond harshly enough that breeds a response by the other side americaskd aplite that is the problem the question here is whether this particular response will be enough to back the who the down i somehow doubted will get's more on this in just one second first let us say that you have an amazing producer say

made a good form policy decision that is about right that is about right undo a couple flashbacks here back in twenty twenty you will recall that donate trump authorized the killing of an cranial terror official am casemsilymony he was one of the mast or mind to petty much all of iron's terror wings all around the globe and he travel to a rocks who was not inside iron and who was killed an arch and jobidon who is rung for president to the time gave this response to the killing off cossemsoly money which again was a way for the trumped ministration to tell the aronians stop facilitating terror if you keep facilitfacilitating terror you never know your head might be in a different place from your body to morrow morning when a comes to up but your was robin's response of the time not whom does not have en the make it clear does not have the authority to go to war with the ran without congressional congressional authorization without working wit congress it is not optional it is it a optional part of his cob president notification o congress about the need exercise for powers can not be satisfied and two hundred eighty characters unless and no president should ever take the united states to war without securing the for consent of the america people to first all the is idiotic when he said to the killing o casemsolmony was not taking america to war in iron and as we will see this is now common talking point against the united states end its allies insuring freedom of shipping in the red sea but this was bison's angle on on from the very beginning and in fact one of the very first things that decide administration did when they entered office one of the very first things in the first month of his ad ministration is the d listed the who the as a global terrorist organization a going to pas dot orgy this is february six teeth twenty twenty one the bid administration officially lifted the designation of the uranium back clothes in hemin as a global terrorist organization that announcement came within a largereview of the of relationship with sauturebit you remember the jobidin came ant offices ripping the sorties and praising muranians at worked out amazing in the iddlelies slow crap for this dolt on canary eleventh twenty twenty one the trump administration opposed that terrorism sanctions on the soothes as a group this emery sedan reporting to limitary human terrain fallowed they proudly exempted eight groups to agriculture medicine et camera but the washington to we expert class think tankers journalists the hill democratic operatives always considered anything true did illegitimate they said they were going diverse course robot valley who that hired operatives who literally answered to the cranial regime was put in charge of america upon policy tony blink at his first press availability the secretary state on canary twenty eighth twenty twenty one he was asked which trumped ministration policies from the last several months ho was going to prioritize reversing he said that getting rid of sanctions on the soothes was quote the priority he said quit the soothes control territory i bell contains about eighty percent of emits population we wont make sure that any of these steps including the designation do not are what as already and incredibly difficult task even more difficult that is the provision of humanitarinate to the people of yeoman cay then began officials suspended terrorism sanctions on the soothes canary twenty fifth they announced revoking them february fifth within days the soothes started watching make murders of mine civilians an attacking sabuarabia then they said they they tried to but their way out of it buteventually they just release the terrorism designation on february sixteenth it s that was a move that was made overtly by the began administration whitewash a thing they wanted to do meanwhile you recall joining took a very antisouty position with regard to yeomen because push by his left the idea was that backing the studies in their war against the soothes was more trouble than it was worth and the way to create a humanitarian peace in the middle east was not to low the sales to continue to fight the soothes the hobbies by the way literally in slave people they brought back slavery ism not getting you that is a real thing they did an jordan at this time he was too busy worrying about mean hammed been salmon was the crown prince of saduarabia this is back on february fourth twenty twenty one reals stupid up war de diplomacy and the war in yeomen war which is created humane territory toting catastrophe the swore has tin in t underscore commitment i all mercy sporifesvoperat warned including element urbsils that worked own amazing it turns out that deranging the sorties in the face of the hobbies that worked out great you mean appeasement of terrorism doesn't work there is a shock meanwhile say bide ministration trying to force israel to a piece terrace in the politician authority me it is unbelievably stupid all this is unbelievably stupid and entirely preventable the muff in the mdeleast is very s simple power is the operative concept if you do not have it you will loose weakness appeasement is showing your neck and that is what jobidon did the white house showed its neck to the soothes and the hoo thees decided t take a bite meanwhile ran continues to ask palate according to the walstreturnal the eonian navy said it had seized an oil tanker off the coast of oman that has been at the center of dispute between t thoron and washington raising the stakes as a you us led coalition watch strikes on rebel targatinaman ironbark who the rebels from hemin have repeatedly targeted the waterways of course apparently baron's navy identified the boarded tanker as a green managed ship called saint colas the tanker was impounded in retaliation for the theft of oil by the america regime according to the cranial army moranian stadia showed eonian commandos landing on the whipstock from the military helicopter notes a little but more complex because that particular vessel which was use to be known as the swizreshon it is charters played guilty to charges filed an you court that it actually carried sanctioned cranial oil the company was fined it is baronial oil cargo was seized the vessels have idle off the cost of techs for months because federal prosecutors were trying to figure out who exactly would be willing to off load the oil eventually the justice department eventually contracted help to fulfil its forfeiture action but secure the annals in former you officials said the case suggested u s efforts to detour cranial aggression were failing a spokes person for the eonian mission at the u ens had quote the eonian army seizure of the oil tanker is not constitute a hi jacking rather it is a lawful undertaking sanction by a court order and is in response to the theft a saran's very own oil some again what is going tore enough to push iron off the ball is the big question meanwhile the left is just mad about this because the left is fully on the side of the worst people on earth literally the worst people on earth there are no worse people than the soothes there truly o comes and the soothes the same commas iris and the soothes effectively the same these a the some different agenditems but in terms of the level of evil no distinction what soever the you times says that this leads to the possibility of a broader conflict the broader conflict was already there i noticed when all the prices started up came they shut down in actual shipping hub i love then your times it is not brought conflict when the withies are shutting down global shipping n everybody has to proud around the cape of good hope that is not that's non a problem the problem is when you try to stop them from doing that is it it again e even the much of anti israel sentiment is extremist anti western untie america sentiment much of it is if america defends itself that is the offensive that is going to lead escalation of israel defense itself that is the that is the big problem here everybody is world about the escalation meanwhile democrats the more radical democrats they of course are jumping in and saying it is illegal we cannot we cannot have this we have let the soothes do this thing recon who again i know to nice enoghgi but this is ridiculous he says the president needs to come to congress before launching a strike against the soothes anyemman when involving us in another middle's conflict that is article one of the constitution no it isn't no it is not in the president does have the power to respond in a tacsinareoes and in war time sinareoes and under the war power to act he then has to inform congress within sixty days of what he is doing and ten congress is the ability to stop what he is doing within sixty days that is the actual legal regime that applies here the president does have inherent power to take immediate military action without informing congress is is not a declaration of war on thehoothes fired a few missiles at a few empty factories is what exactly happen representative valahoil of dragon treated the same thing quit these air strikes have not been authorized by congress the constitution is clear congress is the sole authority to authorize military involvement in oversees conflicts but no a again that is wrong the war powers act governed er the present has forty hours when from congress in congress has been duly informed meanwhile promiligiapalsas this is unacceptable violation of the constitution article one requires military action be authorized by congress i love that all of the exact same members of congress who said that jobidon had the inherent authority to cancel a trillion dollars in student loved at that jobidon have the inherent ability to mandate that eighty million america take a vaccine that brackobama had the inherent power to simply pardon millions of illegal immigrants through proctorial discretion under dacha these same people are if the president in fires a a missile has a camel in the ask he better inform us its violation article one that is that it's the most important thing i asked the feeble axis is that is not what the constitution says that is not i'msari it is not the president does have some inherent war making power the extent of that ware making power is to find by the war powers act as the supreme court has already ruled multiple tons a now again much of this is not about even what is going on with on there's an access that has formed it is wrong and china and russia and north care is sort of power of it but nobody cares by northcoria but that it that is the acts the acids and runs to acts them men the actively work with one another a on gets nuclear technology from russia iron ships drones to russia china is getting oil from iron and russia and that that is the as that has formed what is more important is the again displays of weakness ten to lead to more aggression in global politics that is just the way this works right now there is an election going on in titan and one of the questions is gun to be just how appeasement oriented is the government the new government of titan going to be it is ti won our shipping military recto china china program ka we ought we wanted we do noted to invade or anything iran entire article in political called if they really want to take ti won back what can we do and the even elections ti on see voters tic to choice between appeasement and resistant why exactly with the peace china because their afraid the west is not on an come to their defense is the real answer and honestly under jobidne why would they believe the west is going to come to their defense i know the jobiton has tried to restore some level of credibility completely lost bring a cannistan the united states made a twenty year commitments to tens of thousands of america allies in afghanistan people actively worked with the america government made commitment to tens of millions of people that the talisman would not remain in control of the government and then they left all of those people to be ruled by the worst people on earth again the tarlatan the ho the of a peace if this is not the work together but they have the same general view of the world despite religious differences it they the the bidminstration tried for restored deterrents by providing aid in you crane and to certain extent they did the question is weather it was enough is that enough to stop china from doing what it must now again here is my out the box prediction for how the rest of this year goes if jobidon continues to trail dona trump in the poles if we get to tune jury again the tune trumpets de hominy if we get to tune jury and donate trump is up in the poles by four or five points nationally and leading in the swing states i think china will make a movement i want and the time on see i think no this betas the time on ease are thinking to themselves o ka if the assist going come to our defense in what exactly are we supposed to do congress recently rejected of coursethey bide administration proposal going to politico to send more than a hundred billion dollars in age to you crane israel and titan that legislation failed a procedural vote according to angel conga eight tones america clean energy advocate she used to say that if china stepped in and try to shut down the time on straits the united state would step in and she says that she is on sure now sure when a time when see person comes to me an says you see what they did to u crate in courage them to stand up in fight russia and then when things dongle of their abandon i find a very difficult have a god come back to that there is not really about you cranoedes about afghanistan is about the music commitments in a rock it is about the fact that the united states population generally does not have the will for long occupations or work which is fine but you cannot get involved in those things in the first place if your not count get involves in those things you have to involve yourself in preventative measures that you do not actually have to engage in the long standing set of occupations and wars that the united states engaged in for the first twenty years of the new ammonium and just one second we will get to more on form policy because again you us militaries in catastrophic shape under jobidon truly catastrophic shape first it is a signature razor from germ's razors gas it is right here behold a razor the precision five get one hands plus one blade cartridge git for only fourteen ninety nine as you can see it is magnificent it is crafted with luxurious tanks in handle five willed steel plates a precision tremor for a close smooth shave round heroines and hardtoreach places remember the precision five is no ordinary razor it is a sword in the battle for beliefs to banners wave into a new economy a precision instrument to force well companies to earn backup dollar and stop denigrating your values it is also still armor all give you great shave the precision five starts at fourteen ninety nine the price this old is never been easier to stop giving your money to will corporations who hate your got train over two hundred thousand just mess who ditch their work racers and switched on over to terms there is never bee a better time an never to jerky's razors i come to day meanwhile i the midst of all this case the army's recruitment happerits continued to be complete disaster area according to bright part i come the army's recruiting of white soldiers in twenty twenty three had drop by almost half in the last five years according to report that dramatic decline has consider with a push by the her is to incrusts recruitment of more diverse population according to that report that decline of whit recruits as also coincided with the army missing its target of sixty five thousand recruits in twenty twenty three by ten thousand again the the kind of army strategy which seems to be promotion of diversity above actual military capacity it is kind of am an amazing thing in the fact is that dis proportionately the military draws from conservative areas of the united states promoting the individual sexual exploration of your recruits is probably not the thing that is going to draw people to the america military meanwhile join of course is taken a a rather weak position on form policy and its led to all of these conflicts when a comes to the economy by the way the economy continues not to be jobidon's friend according to the waster journal in elation edged up in remember a reminder of the pressure still facing consumers in flatirons cool down from the historic hies of last three years keeps the federal reserve on tract to tolerates steadylater this month but it is not clearly an an of cutting all of those interest rates an jobidon really needs the interest rates cut if you wants to see some sort of artificial economic boom before the election economic stagnation by the ways the recipe for the next few years in the united states the consumer price ideas increase three point four per cent from a year earlier in remember that acceleration from nonmembers three point one per cent vans chosen elation is not fully beaten by the way when he say not fully be nine stand the we got used crazy numbers nine per cent in elation were near and a large part of that was because a supply chenshocks ism but normally the inflacierat is supposed to be two per cent they are missing that you per sent by a large margin when it is coming in hot at three point four per cent and when for inflation is at three point nine per cent and by the way you now's going to exacerbate all that supply chenshocks it is on to exacerbate all of that meanwhile join trying to happy y talk his way through the series jobidon's top economic adviser well braver since donor hoiden is fighting for consumers which his where con consumers are just getting shall act if you run down in flexion fro thin creditor widen cam into offs overall the a fleeing is u thevntin for i her cent tho do ta be thirty porters at else cut titis a twenty then per cent what cure me ti turmerics or feeling tit every day when the vain us path a the present method is very much hes a fighting for america can summer is fighting to lower cot om by spending more money by facilitating massive disruptions in the supply chon with sapient meanwhile speaking of other massive disruptions the america way f life and one hic is promise for jobidon is that he c could have run as ha moderate and governed as ha moderate he cold have done those things he did not do those things he ran for the primaries as h moderate than he shifted to his left for the general figuring he beat dona true and then he governed as somebody of the left wing of his party and now he has held hostage by the left wing of his party is particular iron border policy again what is amazing right now is that jobidon could fix many probes with his administration if he would just acknowledge that the border needs to be closed remember there is a bill waiting to be passed then involves massive funding for you crane that would get you crane for probably another year of fighting off russia egression there is a bill that provide fourteen billion dollars an aide to israel is r could finish the job with come ass and also push off his ballot in their north that same bill provides defense aid two tigon to prevent the possibility and to turn the possibility of a chines blockade or invasion of the island all jobidon has to do to get that it is to citify the boarder that is all he has to do and he is saying no he is saying no and all of those problems continue to metastasize all of them you crane come of hi won and the boarder all continue to metastasize why because job section wants to stop the first or he knows that foreign cars is not good for his reelect efforts but he will mot give of on the open boarder it is an amazing and why because his own base it large soon down base have taken the ideological position that people have a right to come to the united states that is literally position that is being taken by many members of his own caucus to represent of promilogiapo a wild left progressive crazy cooky person she says the bite has been too heavy handed on the southern border i mean i i do not know what to say to that have been to the southern border that is just a we he is been too heavy handed on the southern border men the board patrol has already been turned into bellmen for a legal emigrants that is exactly what is happen on the southern border we will have all sorts of contact homing out about this and in the near future all the fireman and what is going on s a deep dive into the boarder it is a disaster area down there but the only i guess promilgiapologist mad that the board patrol agents and bringing fizzy drinks for the illegal emigums that that is the only thing i can think of that she is talking about here there is much fer on going going on that it is difficult to know exactly where to start but let me say this first the birdman ministration is informing emigration laws in fact the administration has been heavy handed an recent months that i have serious concerns about how they are conducting order enforcement out of their mind out of their damned minds heavy handed by what metric by what metric we went through the stats a little but earlier this week by the stats at least two point for million people v entered the country illegally at least across the southern border in the last year can that in fiscal your twenty twenty three that is insane want but but tit is too heavy hands began if jobidon chooses to allow his campaign to be held hostage by these people he is going to lose you deserves to lose which is why republicans should probably get out of his way are do not first real politics do not get in the way of your opponent when he is making a mistake it is why all the fights that are happening right now about budgeting and all versus let us be real about this the serious rivers of federal debts are not all the discretionary programs that are currently being greened in whatever budget deal myth johns cuts with the democrats o of it i think to bad deal also you have democratic sent and democratic president let us be real about this what re publican's need what the country needs more than anything else is jo bison out of office and democrats not in control in the senate if you get in the way of that you are going tend up with more democratic governments in order to actually effectuate your agenda you have to whole power you cannot just told some of the power you have to hold enough power to be able to do what you want to do this is why now i have nothing but sympathy for people are very upset wit the deal that might johns is about to cut with regard to the continuing funding of the government but this notion they're going to used him because you are mad at him now you yes at mccarthick is you are mat him maybe the incensed structure is that he is don to have to cut that deal because what is the alternative going into permanent government shut down anther's some people in the base who might want that when yous explain if that happens jobidon is the president or another for years meanwhile jobidon is to obviously ailing and this also has not impact and how form policy is con ducted it has a feeling it is it is a there is a pervasive feeling this ad ministration is not in control that is completely out of control now what was always fun about the trumpadministration is trump himself felt he was not in control but it felt theadministration was in control why because dona true was the rhetorical face of his own administration but is rhetoric very often did not matches policy it is why by the way you are seeing emerging caps inside the republican coalition on wide variety of ideological wishes because trump talked in one way than his administration did something different a dona trump talk an isolationist but then his administration was pretty hawkish donate trump for example was big into the idea of say america subsidies in terrify but his ad ministration actually facilitated for the most part free trade deals and non subsidies i to toll lot of what his administration did is not the stuff the donetrum talked about it is there is always a feeling with trump that leave fine he is treating something now but at least i know at least i know that the economy is good and pieces breaking to the idle east and we do not have an ongoing s supply can crisis in the red see anywhere to superiorly about china invading ti one and all like that is how feel with jobidon number one he cannot actually speak any more every time he speaks as i said before it took watching uniquely and a cross volcano on a trope yofrejust waiting for him to fall down that is the real reason you are watching is because you want to know where you were the moment that jobidon collapse and mean it really is sad it is not good for the country's not good for jobidon it is rely sad and beyond that cannot speak and his administration is out of controls he is to a secretary defensible completely wall for week no problem his got a secretary of transportation whose who goes completely wall for two months no problem who that hells in control over there it certainly is not jobidon how much is it not cordon they are now trotting out jill to basically say you should have sympathy for my aged husband yesterday jobidon did the rounds talking bout how jobidon's age was an asset if his age were an asset do not you thin he would be jobidon in this interview and not doctor job the greatest doctor of all who can heal your hart attack with an education paper here we go your husband is any one at the end of the second term he deity six as his life partner forty six years is there a part of you that is worried about his age an help can he do it he can do it and i see job every day i see him out h travelling around this country i see his finger i see his energy i see his passion every single day to those who say i cannot not for job is too old what is a i say his age is an asset a is wise yes he is whish as wisdom as experience he knows every leader on the world stage he is liked history he knows history he is tactful in his decisions he is the right man or the right person for the job at this moment in history i mean just as he lived through the pallponnetian for does not mean that he is sent ties any more he isn't t aches he knows every world leader he does not even know who is in the room he thinks dead people are alive in rooms that he goes in to he doesn't know the names of the members of his own cabinet he doesn't know where he is half the time which is we again that video last week of jobidon giving what was essentially his kick off campaigns speech over a valley forge and jobidon charging up there a night nurse trying to drag him back to bed because she is wandering the halls and made p in a corner somewhere means an amazing midi she literally charges of man she is shes fast her that she you same bolt off that line he finishes that speech she is up there ban a shot and she grabs him and she tries to trot him back but not before he whispers back to megrophon i know about about and then she drags him off the stage thing vaudeville act seer lie a big old cane rip just tat zips him off the tach and were suppose to believe that things are going well and then job has to assure us that we do not know how hard job works e maybe we not know hhardjo works because he calls a lid every afternoon at two p ms who can go down the local denies for the earlybirdspecial and i think what people do not see is how hard jo works every single day that he gets up thinking what he can do for the america people oh is that is that what he gets up doing again have said before an ins true join must be the happiest person in the world because every morning he wakes up in somebody tells he's president it must be just incredible in any case all this means the he is an an awful lot trouble by the way one the ways that he is an awful lot of trouble an astonishing column to day from bet sevens brettstevens is about as largely from critic as is possible to be restevens is not as from fain i believe he voted against him in bout twenty sixteen and twenty's twenty he is a conservative and from the for policy been antrums of social policy he writ a column for the ne york times to day and here is what it says quote the case for trump by some one who wants him to lose the entire column is about od things were better when trump as president it is true it is a true thing is barring a political miracle or an act of god it is overwhelmingly likely the deal trample again be the republican parties hominy for president lord help us what should those of us f of consistently opposed him do you cannot defeat an opponent if you re fuse to understand makes him formidable too many people as specially progressives file to think deeply about the enduring sources of his appeal since illspen the coming your strenuously opposing his candidacy let me here make the best case for trump that i can he says begin with fundamentals trump got three big things right arguably the singamost important get political fact of the century is the mas migration of people from south to north an east to less training tectonic demographic cultural economic and ultimately political shifts trump understood the from the start of his presidential candidacy in twenty fifteen many of trumps opponents refused to see virtually unchecked migration as a problem for the west at all only now as the consequence of jobidon's lack magical approach to mass migration have become depressingly obvious on the side walking and shelters and public schools of liberal cities new york and chico are trumps open ts on this issue beginning to see the point the second big thing trump got right was about the broad direction of the country trump rode a wave of pessimism to the white house pessimism his detractors did not share because he was speaking about and two in america that either did not see or understood only as caricature but just as with this year when liberally leads insist things are going well a overwhelming man sorites america said they are not trumps on flattering view captured the mood of the country finally there is the question of institutions that are supposed to represent i partial expertise from he lea universities and mediate to the centers for disease control and prevention in the of be trumps to tractors including me often argued his demagogry and mendacity did a lots needlessly diminish trust in these vital institutions but we should be more honest with ourselves in hid nit those institutions it did their own work an squandering through partisan ship or n capitals the esteem in which they had once been widely held absolutely right and then he says another lot of readers and is the her times cursing yes but what about canary six would batelection denihalism and the threat to democracy but s important ut stretch one's mind a little says bet sevens and try to understand why many voters are impress about the end of democracy argument for one thing haven't they heard a before and with the same apocalyptic intensity in twenty sixteen trump was frequently compared to bend mousolian other dictators including by me says bet sevens the comparison might have been more persuasive if trumps presidency had been replete with jailed an a fascinated political opponents rigor cancel elections a muzzled or captured press and trump stilling still holding office to day but none of that is true many cancan pile republicans regard the canary six the fault on the capital as a disgrace and the lost point of from presidency but they also believe it was not much an insurrection as was an ugly temperate from by trump and is most rabid supporters which never he a chance of succeeding an america version of laemerputent he simply is not as it is the twenty twenty four election will not hinge on questions of democracy but of delivery whit candidate will do more for voters and hearing you got a problem this vibe sevens he is right he is right this stomach probe with jobidons presidency is that he is a bad presidents he is bad at the presidential and all these legal attacks on trump i do not think they an i damage in they're already baked into the cate every out sized idiotic statement by the left abmho donate trump is going to disappear of the gaze helps that when will by goldbrick says this he ting is really hurts trump heres will be goldbrick saying that when dona trump becomes present he is going to disappear of the gaze which you are you kitting me are'kittng me in twenty sixteen he held the gave pride flag while is campaigning dona trump as social con worry your we o cat killing the gelid what in the word these people are out of the mind i wen a ma on ta wan i let ta man dictate who stereo tells you i echo apple from to take all the vocalist i take a the a folks i a wo we a round and ti superior the the wat you not bolt for tarot or maybe the decision is between somebody who says wild an crazy things and i as great the lot of the thing but naturally did the president kind o well and somebody who sucks at the presidential maybe it is that can i do not know that three four of that four years out from canary six twenty twenty one you can continue to run on thus i just do not know i can i keep jeoffreys speaker of the house in waiting n the the minorities minority leader i keep jeoffreys he says that the house re publicans are the party of insurrection and impeachment are not people getting board with us is not is tired and old this week has once again revealed than extreme mama republicans have several interest in doing anything productive that is design to benefit the america people house republicans or the party of insurrection impeachment an illegitimate investigations nothing more nothing less insurrection

welcome to the hubermenlad guest series where i and an expert guys disgust science an science as tools in i man drew supermen and a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day march the third episode and our four episode series about mental health with doctor pal canty to days episode deals with the topic of healthy relationships how to define what a healthy relationship is and how to achieve healthy relationships of all kinds including romantic relationships interpersonal relationships at work friendships with family and of course with one self this episode builds on the framework of the psychology of self and mental health that was established in the first and second episodes of this series however even if you did not listen to the first or second episode in this series today's episode will still contain a lot of information in protocols that you will find valuable for improving your relationships that said if you have the opportunity to listen to the first and second episodes in this series i think you will find those to be tremendously beneficial at any point during to day's episode doctor cant discusses what makes for a successful relationship of any kind as well as tools to improve those relationships he discusses various types of bonds including healthy bonds and trombones not just in the contacts of romantic relationship but in the contacts of all types of relationships we also discuss different challenges that people face in relationships including abusive relationships and we discuss the role of power dynamics anxiety and boundaries in relationships both from the perspective of unhealthy relationships but more importantly from the understanding and protocols to cultivate healthy relationships while there is an abundance of opinions and information out there on the internet these days about relationships both healthy and unhealthy to day's discussion approaches the topic of relationships through an entirely different lends which is the lends of the self in terms of one's conscious and subconscious mind and how multiple conscious and subconscious minds through different individuals interact with one another in ways that we can see and ways that we cannot see and all of that framed within the actionable steps that any of us can take to improve our relationship to ourself and to others before we begin it'd to emphasis that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science in since related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is better help better help offers professional therapy with the license therapist carried out all on line have been doing therapy for more than thirty years wile i confess that initially i was forced to do that therapy as a condition for being let back into high school over time i learned that therapy is a tremendously valuable practice in fact i consider doing regular weekly therapy as just as important as doing regular physical exercise in order to improve one's health the beauty of better help is that it makes it extremely easy to find a therapist that is excellent for you and we can defend an excellent therapist o somebody who is going to give you a lot of support but in an objective way as well as somebody with whom you can have excellent report and that can help you arrive at positively transformation insights that you would not have otherwise had and with better help they make it convenient that its match to your schedule and the other aspects of your life if you to try better help go to better help dot calm slash superman to get ten percent off your first month again that is better help h l p dot come slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by waking up waking up is a meditation at that offers dozens of guided meditation sessions mindfulness trainings yoganedrocessions and more by now there is an abundance of data showing that even short daily meditations can greatly improve our mood reduce anxiety improve our ability to focus and can improve our memory and while there are many different forms of meditation most people find it difficult to find and stick to a meditation practice in a way that is most beneficial for them the waking up at makes it extremely easy to learn how to meditate and to carry out your daily meditation practice in a way that is going to be most effective and efficient for you it includes a variety of different types of meditations of different duration as well as things yogenedra which place the brain anybody into a sort of pseudo sleep that allows you to emerge feeling incredibly mentally refresh in fact the science around yogenedra is really impressive showing that after a yogenedra session levels of dopamine in certain areas of the brain are enhanced by up to sixty per cent which places the brain embody into a state of enhanced readiness for mental work and for physical work another thing i really about the waking up a is that it provides a thirty day introduction course for those of you that have not meditated before or getting back to a meditation practise that is fantastic or if you are somebody who's already a skilled and regular meditator waking up has more advanced meditations and yogeneger sessions for you as well if you to try the waking up a you can go to waking up doc calm slash superman and access a free thirty day trial again that is waking up doc calm slash superman and now for my discussion about mental health with doctor pal coati doctor coati welcome back thank you happy to be to day we are going to discuss relationships and that will often focus on romantic relationships but also relationships between friends between family members and inevitably the relationship to see which is what we really focused on in episode one and to of this series episode one being a all the things that go in to a healthy self and how to understand what is unhealthy and healthy in all of us and make adjustments to the unhealthy aspects of our unconscious and conscious through really specific proactive behaviors and patterns of thought really a road map to these ideals that we call mental health and understanding of the self to day we want to talk about relationships from the perspective of of course how people relate but i have a feeling it is going to have something to do with or perhaps almost everything to do with a relate ship to understanding ourselves or first gesso just to make sure that we are all on the same page regardless of whether not people have seen episodes one and two and certainly people do not need to have seen were listen to episodes one and two of the series in order to understand today's discussion could you please tell us what is a healthy person and how can we ask ourselves the sorts of questions that allow us to determined whether not we are healthy and where to look in terms of making adjustments if we want to be healthier than we already are which i have to believe almost everybody if not everybody certainly wants to be the healthiest and best expression of themselves that they can do the most for themselves and for others in the world the the lynch pin of it all it is the agency and gratitude as verbs that is the top of the mountain there is a lot of climbing we do to get to the top of the mountain once ore over the top of the mountain then things are in a better place and even though they are two words a agency is of course a word gratitude is a word but it does not mean that there separate concepts approaching the world through the lends of agency and gratitude thought of as one thing because they come together and they come together as verbs that is what we are aiming for right because that is the thing that we can work towards if you think about what comes underneath of that it takes us back to the the two pillars and the the ten cupboards and if we are looking in there enough we we are minding what is in my unconscious mind i might not be aware of let me generate some curiosity about my defense mechanisms and my character structure and think about what salient inside of me if we are doing all of that then what we are we are doing were building empowerment rebuilding humility and then ultimately the expression of all of the is the agency and gratitude and it is something that we cannot have enough of as it what is the best amount of that the most that is possible i because we are going to engage in the world in the healthiest way because agency and gratitude does it mean we are happy about everything right if there is something negative and we can change that then we do not feel happy about that we we the sense of gratitude in me makes me more likely to feel that i can change that right or to take the chance of trying to change that and then the agency part of that concept can come more to the foreign i can make the change it is not about bliss right it is not about for givingself and others for all sorts of things and not working to make better it is about being in the world and being as aware as i can possibly be including being aware that there are things ism not aware of right sos o to having a healthy respect and an orientation to the world that values truth and values understanding and exploration if we do all of that than we reach the top of the mountain through the agency and gratitude and then what builds upon that or what comes from that is the the peace the contentment the delight the generative drive being strengthen that all comes together and then the aggressive or we say aggressive cause that is a traditional term the aggressive we the assertive right the assertiveness or assertion drive however what whatever were we ant a put to that that drive exists in us in a way that subserves the generative drive the same thing with the pleasure drive in us its exists in us but its observing the generative drive than all those good things come together and they come together to help us be as healthy as we can and to stay healthy right including when tribulation or difficulties come our way that we stay as best we can in the agency and gratitude as verbs and again there is nothing theoretical about this it is a way to live and and there are a lot of people who live some of their lives or parts of their lives through that right and we can aspire to it and we can work towards it and if we are the best that we can be then we are going to be in our relationships the best we can be i thing about it you and i have a relationship we know each other we are working together if i can bring my best self to you to thinking about you to understanding you if i can bring the agency and the gratitude then ism going to do right but you in i metalize this idea of thinking about what is going on inside of you ism going to bring the best of all of that and then because we have a relationship there is also in us there is o me there is a you there is something that happens between us that is the relationship that is the us and i will also bring my best self to that thing that is no longer just me or just you but that is not us and that applies to all relationships you can apply that to seeking health in every single relationship in our lives what you are saying really speaks to the importance of people taking a real look at themselves you know which is not necessarily an inventory of self in the typical sense that were used to hearing it but rather through this lens or map of the self that was spelled out and episodes not in to and cancer those that are just joining the series now of the map as we are referring to it is a baubles a down lovable peri f in the shown out captions people want to get that it is completely your cost you just go there an accessed or disputed on a screen printed out whatever whatever you you certainly do not need to do that because here again we are talking about the corps elements of that map which understand correctly arrive eventually at set of verb states it were calling agency and gratitude those are not separate as you pointed out they work together you described is it on top of the geyser a and i i really that the a lot of things going on but then it all uplifts to something right in if we are doing it in the right way in in the diligent way then it is a geyser and w hat it is lifting up on top of it is the agency in gratitude i love you you put those words to and i think it captures it really profoundly will the stuff the guises up perhaps deserves a bit of our attention m just for a few moments am you described these two pillars they i described as quivering up to agency and gratitude in the in the best circumstances but the best circumstances we want to mind ourselves and everybody are attainable by looking at what is in those pillars a those two pillars are the structure of self are really understanding something about the structure of self that includes some understanding of the unconscious mind some understanding of the conscious mind defense mechanisms character structure and self that was all reviewed and described in episodes one into as well as the functions of self which more of the verb states the expressions of the structure of self self awareness in the first of those defense mechanisms in action and here am it'd be remiss if i did not tell myself and everybody else again that defense mechanisms are not always bad there can be healthy defense my cither can protect us in very valuable ways and then this notion of salients what we pay attention to yen what sorts of scripts are going on in our head about ourselves and others what are we paying attention to how are we interpreting those in our head and to others and in most importantly perhaps to ourselves and then our actual behaviors ut what are we doing from the time we wake up until the time we go to sleep at night and then our strivings our sense of hopefulness or perhaps lack of strivings and there i reminded also that nobody does all of these things perfectly all the time we all have elements within us that perhaps are not serving to geyser up into agency an gratitude as well as they could but that all of us have the capacity to look at these two pillars and these a ten things that were just listed off as you describe them as cupboards that we look into and examine and think about and that if we can do that with a skilled cognition yourself or another psychaterous or psychologist terrific but even if we do not have access to that that we can examine within us what is and is not serving to guys up into agency an gratitude we can bring any issue of self to those two pillars and the ten cupboards within them any issue myself why because that is what it is right in the sense phatic it is is t us what is inside of me i have an unconscious mind i have a conscious mind i have a defensive structure i have a character structure i have a self that is what it is right in all the functions that you mention they are all going on within that structure of self they are manifesting themselves that is what it is when we are being right in the active way of the verb being that is what it is which is why we can bring to it any issue of self even though of course there is tremendous complexity there the million things that go on in a second underneath the surface in the unconscious mind and our defensive structures and had to see them butte are human beings we are complicated right that is okay because we have methods of understanding we have methods of inquiry and we can use those methods to make things better and that is how we make the geyser as strong as it can be wheelie maybe some maybe some some of the waters running countercurrent in in the oke we let us try and have things go all in the same direction but we do not need things to be perfect for for the guys are to spring up and the agency and gratitude to then be uplifted upon it everybody has one of these maps as i understand it and therefore any time we are talking about relationships romantic relationships are otherwise we are talking about the intersection or overlap of those maps in some way maybe even the energy and the out worth of those maps becomes its own map i think we will get to the since om it later yes when i and most people hear the word relationships and pretty her romantic relationships i make a couple of automatic assumptions a first of all after assume that people are either in a relationship or out of a relationship there is probably a third category out there of plurals and other things but will keep it relatively simple and most people i assume when they search for or enter or entered a relationship they thought about whether or not they had a resonance with the person whether not there was ta intellectual or mutual interest resonance ore a physical resonance a maybe something about family history common goals et camera a that is typically what people think about and then a perhaps if people have a bit more of a psychological understanding or their a reading some inapoppsychology books these days some of which are are pretty good a they might understand something about themselves are the other person being a bit more anxious or a bit more relax you will hear things anxious attached secure attached things that of that sort if we could just step back from all of that for a moment and examine it through the lends of the maps as your describing them which exist in all of us and that really are the map to being the best version of ourselves if we look at relationships in terms of lists of where where people went to school if they went to school of the are the parents marry or divorce do they have aroma that there whereof or not aware of these kinds of things i guess we could call those and here i am borrowing language that you used earlier off camera i want acknowledge that a you points of compatibility i think that seems a reasonable place to start i do people want the same thing if you if you could i could you talk little bit about points of to potability in relationship and how those show up for better for worse when you encounter people in the clinical setting yet when you see a rule somebody who in a relationship that is really working for them and its healthy verses if therein relationship worth really unhealthy presume there is some knowledge about points of compatibility but ism guessing that is not always into give i think the place we start there it is acknowledging what we can know and what we cannot know this idea that therefore levels of emerging where were things that a e lower level come together and create something that is knew we see this throughout science from someatomic particles all the way through to culture i some one could know theoretically we lots and lots and lots about you and lots and lots and lots about me but they do not know about us right they soft know how we interact they do not know if we have shared interest what we talk about it they they do not know that no one knows that we do not know that about the combination of people we cannot know it in advance but we we often believe that we can which then leads to a lot of false metrics of trying to figure things out when we are looking for compatibility the thought he's very basic tangible things room an romance for example if there is someone who absolutely wants have a family and there is some one who absolutely does not want have a family look that would be a reason for those two people to not choose one another right there are there are these factors but but the factors ore all resents very evident and very concrete it if we go if we go beyond that we can we can see the obvious right then what we are looking for is really a compatibility of generative drives i and then that it tells you can these people then get along looking know maybe one of them is from one side of the world and the others from the other side of the world or once in a count and than the other is i musician and it does not mean that out they are built not to get along or that if they are doing the same thing there built two get along or if there they went to college in the same place when he went to college r verse is not going to college bat there is much there that we we try to build a story on and then what we do as we miss the forest for the trees right and the trees i think are the factors that do not matter get let us think about the factors that do matter press once have a family of the person does not that is relevant but the the trees that mislead us might be did they've the same level of education a did they have the same family structure growing up are parents still together a what do they enjoyer they creative or scientific or whatever creatively scientific way we we could look at all that but i think then we are making a bunch of trees that mislead us if you say to these people come at the world through how much agency and gratitude is there guiding them hat how high is the top of that guise how high as it uplifting that how strong is the generative drive if we match people upon that then we see oh those people got along and those people did not and then the other all the other factors ceremony right in things that we cannot understand or reflective first impression we could let things develop honoring the truth of what we cannot know that when you put two people together you get something that is different then the sum of both people right it is not an overlap of maps right it is a new map right and the map is informed by things that a that are on each individuals map but what we are looking for are maps that do not have very significant a am differences around just clear concrete things right but once we get beyond that the maps can energize in all sorts of beautiful and unpredictable ways it and if both are are coming from the perspective of a generative do give that is at the forefront great you put those maps together and see what happens maybe nothing happens o cay those people do not go out on a second date you new may be something happens but it does not develop in certain ways look are those people dated than stopdating this happens all the time i but we set the odds in our favor that the generative drive in each that is at the forefront means that their maps can energize in ways that can then be beautiful and ways that can may be bring to both people that which which they want and i think there is a simplicity to that that i think if we honor it can be very very helpful whether its romance is friendships of looking at what the truth of it is instead of the factors that we try and gain a false sense of security if were were using them to select upon you mention several times the generative drive i fully would to learn more about that and spend some time there in the context of relationships but just to drill a little bit further into what we have all heard often and you touch upon a few of these seems a around points of compatibility but also were a sometimes we can a respond to the wrong things when thinking about compatibility again refrain this mainly in the context of hypothetical romantic relationships but certainly it retains to other sorts of relationships things a is one person educated a within advance degree in is and is the other person also we tend to assume that people who are a are somehow a better match than people who are not the sort of it implicit assumption that is often made not always or that a if two people really love music that they will enjoy music together and therefore some of the hole is greater than either of its parts and then and i think those things are utterly irrelevant interesting and i want to hear more about this because i think that m if you think about a which ism sure you do not but dating as for instance like what is listed out there or am first or second dates which consist of learning a list of it about somebody in what they are doing and maybe even a bit about their history and and am may be an activity a and certainly an attentional awareness to how the other person is behaving in the contacts of different things a waiter or waiters and how they treating people and and you and and then you here about things am what are the a this is not son in from oh right the the love languages people at what is their love languages it is gifts who are a acts of physical am a touch or or acts of service or something i met some one recently and she told me a my love language is all of them which i thing is the most honest answer right e is sure there is probably some waiting around what people value more or less and in the absence of the things they value the most i it would probably feel bit deprivation am in any relationship but as ism describing all this in realizing more and more yes all of that matters anxious to tach secure attach love language is et camera but it really does not get to the heart of the matter a it really does not get to this as you are describing this generative drive in individuals and whether not those match up well along the points of compatibility wet he other persons generative drive and i have not run a a controlled study for this but the best evidence i have is that they're fortunately are many people out there who are in happy healthy relationships but they're many many many people who are not either because they cannot find them or they are in them and they are not healthy were they are not happy et camera if you could elaborate a bit more on the generative drive gan reminding us what the nature of that is we cover the habit an episodes wanted to but what what the nature of that is and and some different ways that that is expressed and how that a shows up in healthy relationship ye i think we really disapprove the idea that that some of these these factors i think are superficial in the contact of whether people are going to be compatible doe not superficial things but they are not german right the say y you think about music ran that two people are contemplating romance right and they both really music well that could go very very well lets say they both have strong generative drive that e that those pillars are pretty healthy and the guys of the agency and gratitude is writing upon it and they can find piece in them in themselves ism they are strongly generative then they could become interested in the music the other person likes is not there king to be a complete overlap right even if people generally the same thing but the say they different things i just liking music or even liking the same music there's still difference right the person has to go beyond themselves right and say look ism interested and what you think even about the music we both right what factors do you like there place is of of learning and of growth for both and you could see how both liking music whether it is the same or different music that sounds great right we could also see how that can not be great right if if the generative drive is too low and the aggression drive is too high right then ism going to think i music my music better than yours you don't wrist or you don repeople then start they tho thou fragment t right even though they have the same interest or if the pleasure drive is too high then they think i won listen to my music not yours i it's familiar with it instead of ay ism interested in that music because because you are interested in it and ism interested in you right which leads us to the second parlor say of some one who really has no interest in music and some one who does well there can be an openness of saying if ism interested in this person and this person is really interested in music lie well that i have some interest in it right a one o learn something about i wont experience some of it with the other person and and let say that person and find say that is not my thing is not the thing we connect on then why would that be the end of the world wen ate people one person goes to concert the other does not right we we we try and find these points of commonality because i think we get over reductionists and then we think oh he's ones of factors that we will identify and what they do is they obscure us from the primary factor which is the generative drive which of course will then induce open mindedness centralization if i do not music and you do instead of saying what he music for i need of friendship with somebody likes music you think he that is interesting if ism interested in you as a friend and have respect for you in what you think then why would i not have some interest in what you're interested in solutes idea of compatibility revolves around the health in each person it does not revolve around factors that are anything but tithe concrete logistical factors that would just keep two people apart i love the idea that healthy relationships center round the factors that really matter within the self and in particular the generative drive and i and i love the example of ism some one being able to be curious about somebodyease interests about their partners interests even though they might not share those am from the standpoint of agency and gratitude because the agency component there is really key i think that a lot of people feel as if they are not really good it something are really knowledgeable about something then it is not for them right which is the opposite of having agency and gratitude because gratitude is closely tied to humility they how could we know everything i can recut certain things and not others the way you describe it includes a aspects of openness of humility but also the agency city empowerment of ism to learn more than pro ps you know we could enjoy more of that together u perhaps not i i think a this is what ism sensing and ism also sensing that am the words mind minded people a has much more to do with their generative drives and how those match up i suppose to the activities that they prefer engaging in and the sorts of foods they or the movies they and a which make sense at some level but i think it is still a counter intuitive for for a lot of us who just cone o reflectively they go they the same things or maybe it maybe even they met at work because they the same type of work am they to live in a certain area the country and therefore by proximity they met and this raises all sorts of a interesting ideas perhaps about am the statistics of what we see right two musicians together we therefore assume that musicians a belong together or two scientists together i know loads of scientist scientist couples or scientists physician couples and a but of course the numbers are screwed because they were working n environments where it increase the probability they would interact this is actually a vote for on mandating and some sense because it breaks through all those am sometimes even geographical barriers but certainly that the the traditional barriers of culture right right if you think about who were talking about relationship i would my relationships to last as long as possible right that means now we are talking about my lifespan and my healthspan right that is then becomes part of that discussion of course we are very interested in lifespan and healthspan and we see people do much much better when they are interconnected in the world around them when there's still learning new things what we know that is true that people often will tail you lose o trail off off what they are learning whether its its music its literature its the world around us young relatively early in our life span but the person whose interconnected learning new things i h as much greater probability of living longer and living healthier right think what is that about it is about a generative drive right it is about it have learn a lot of things over the course of my life and ism eighty years old now and great that there is more to learn right and lethal is what you see it makes me think of a woman is around ninety years old in an my practices is always learning new things she superinterested in things and ism always struck about how we she seems much younger right and and there that is not just a selection by us lisle i just happen to see that in that person like she has the factors that re dispose to aging in the way that is healthiest and happiest it really comes own the root of all of it in ourselves in our relationships in the quality of them over time and how long we get to have them we arises from a generative drive and that is the thing that makes us than in defended right and let us us find interest in things about other people that are different from the things in us which also comes about naturally i think it is interesting that we have the sort of bias likes that musicians belong together why there familiar with the same things right i guess they have the same interest same thing with scientists but then a lot of people different foods rightly i love different ethnic foods why cause it is different right it is it is an appreciation of difference i do not want to eat just i did growing up and many many many people are that that is an appreciation of difference of diversity sometimes will kind of harness thatimal look at animals say oh that is present in us but for whatever reason we become very reductionist about relationships and now we are trying to match based upon sameness right and sameness is is not the point of it an mean there even thoughts right about people than in some way seeking difference right and may be fairemonds are telling as like i i know very little about that but i certainly know that the striving for sameness does it make good things happen in relationship see have been doing this for over twenty years and i do not see that the alleged factors of sameness matter again unless there's concrete if this person is absolutely con to live in north america and that persons absolutely con t live in south america let us not potentially put them together but once we get away from almost that level of concreteness let us look for something different and then everything else it simplifies t the higher we go up the latter the more simple things get if you are looking at the pillar's structure of function of self you are creating the agency and gratitude than would you looking for you looking for partner match in generative drive i want a it i wont mind to be strong and i see that it is strong in this person they create in a way i i do sins they go garden regenerative together right that could be supercompatible because we are looking at the one factor that really matters id to take a brief break and acknowledge one of our sponsors a g one a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that meets all of your foundational nutrition needs i started taking a g one way back in two thousand an twelfth some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast the reason i started taking a g one and the reason i still take a g one once or generally twice per day is that it is the easiest way for me to insure that ism getting all of the vitamins minerals robotics and fire that i need in my diet now of course it is essential to get proper nutrition from whole foods but most people including myself find it hard to get enough servings o fruits and vegetables each day and especially to get enough prebiotics and robotics to insure got health as you may know your got contains trillions of little microbioda the called up microbyom which establishes critical connections with other organs of your body to enhance brain health as well as to support our immune system and other aspects that relate to mental and physical health one of the most common questions i get is if you were to take just one supplement which supplement would that be in my answer is always g one because by taking g one ism able to ensure that ism getting all of the vitamins minerals and robotics that i need to enhance my mental health physical health and performance if you would to try g one they will to drink g one dot calm slash hubormen to claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d three k to again that is drink g one dot all slash hubormen to claim the special offer realizing that most of what i and everyone else has heard about relationships is complete nonsense i really mean that i mean it has occur to be before because have experienced both that the phrases absence makes the heart grow fonder and out of sight out of mind are in direct contradiction with one another they are both true depends on the circumstances and theelknowshy it could right youalso hear opposites attract but they do not stay together right you here similarity ore the important thing is to find one similar to you that that were that there's one person right that is rife i mean these are if we really think about it crazy right notions yes but they drive a lot of what peopledrunklouterly anxious right they drive and rig they drive bad choices they drive a situations and then create a sense of guilt and shame and inadequacy we mislead ourselves by not going to the basics of what is actually true lie an we look at myself make myself as healthy as i can be riotous if ism healthy all recognize a lack of health in the other rights it also protects us against bad relationships and if in an t make myself healthy which we are describing how that looks would not i want some one who also once to make themselves healthier at least if we are gan a lie let us let us a lie around making both of of ourselves healthier absolutely and we are going to go deeper into how to look into the map of self and how that relates to relationship a rally a more as we go along the a discussion you have mentioned several times however about generative drive and that it really is the definition of minded in some sense and you also mentioned aggressive drives and pleasure drives themes that we touched on again and episodes anted to but listening to those episodes is certainly not necessary to digest what we are talking about today could you go a little bit deeper into the generative drive flush out for us what that is a i think generative i think generator i think energy a i hear aggression or aggressive drive i think as i think most people do a friction may be even conflict maybe physical conflict may be verbal conflict but i know it is some of that perhaps but a whole lot more and then pleasure drive and pleasure a some people think bliss some people think a delight a some people a probably have all sorts of specific things they think of with respect to pleasure you just flush those out for u little bit more cause it i think those are going to serve as a cornerstones of to days discussion sure the drives in in this case the generative drive tat of exist within us and what they do is there defining potential i right now one could argue if we just pause for a couple seconds were not doing anything generative in those seconds i but then we resume doing something that we believe is generative i tithe time were pausing that some we cusec to look at that as as a drive within us to to to make new learning i to understand things we did not understand before to spread a sense of goodness i it resides in us in a way that is determined by a whole bunch of different factors everything else that determined within us there is a nature and a nurture component some aspect of it or what are the genetics that came down to us what a formative experiences but we can go in and altar that if we see the drive as a set of potentials in that moment we pause there is a set of potentials within us potential of where we can take our thoughts our actions are reflections are decisions that is the drive within us and it exists within us in a way that we could localize now if we think enough about get how much of a generative drive is their in a person how much is that person looking to the to to make a better life for themselves or better world around them and how do they feel about themselves fertility to do that how generative are they or how shut down or demoralized or envious we can in a sense localize that and again the localization as these genetic and nurture components to it but we can then go and influence that and that is the that is the importance if the drive is a set of potentials a set of possibilities than that drive is one and the same pervaded with however we want a to to to describe that with the agency and gratitude cause the agency and gratitude is sot of the operative former that that is the verb right it is the drive actually driving something right feel a strong generative drive than agency and gratitude are leading the decisions the reflections are coming through that the aggression within us or again that is the the this the historical word as we say aggression assertion promote productiveness right all of this inside of us and our drive for pleasure for gratification that all is then is in us but its subserving the generative drive meaning the generative drive that set of potentials and possibilities is dominant which of course make sense with agency and gratitude those active verbs being what is most active right an then we are also gin to feel at times an hopefully at a lot of times that set of peacefulness that maid's of contentment the sense of delight rand what you are describing when your you of doing the potcasting your in it all these good things are happening to you write there is a strong generative drive in you that set of potentials are being actualized through the verbs of agency and gratitude you are doing it all right then and as you are doing it you have a sense of peace and contentment as you are enacting all of it and then that makes you healthier reenforces the generative drive it protects you against the next sling or arrow of outrageous fortune that will come your way rat you become more self knowledgeable more you become stronger t and and ultimately that is what were looking like that is the state of goodness and i believe that if you look historically what is it that we are seeking we can put many words to it and were it were choosing to put these words to it and i think that this is the structure because i think the science the history the clinical experience the phenomenology i think it all tells us this we can put different words to it but what we are looking at when we are looking at truth and how to get to the happiness quote quote that that people have sought through the ages my think we know enough now we have learned enough that we can say oh this is what it looks and it fits the arbiter of of all truth which is as you get further up the hierarchy it gets simpler that is true about humans what is going on in my unconsciousness is very very complicated but if that summing to as we get higher up to ism approaching the world with the lot of agency and gratitude that is a lot simpler and that is what can be common among us which is why if my pillars are very different from your pillars and what we have struggled against each is very different and what we may still have to work against is very different we can be extremely compatible as friends because are we are we working on ourselves are we fostering the generative drive we are coming at the world in that way and agency and gratitude that is the similarity right between us that matters and ultimately we are looking at the potential that every moment we are building the potential in us for what comes at the next momentwhich is why we are describing the overlap the point of commonality that really matters that that matters we are putting a label to it rig ms that it is the generative drive but it is also that k we both comet the world through agency and gratitude know if two people are accessing compatibility but if we are looking at something to nest that under and what seems most logical is the set of potentials within us that we are building and altering each moment and then as i alter it in this moment b it is altered and hat effects my next moment right if i do something that is just kind of thoughtless to somebody because ism in a am in a bad mood right then what am mi doing on projecting out my aggression of doing something that easily makes me less than right and then ism going to feel lesson the next moment whether that moment is about mere is about someone else the drives are the potentials in us but we are actively working on them determining them changing them each moment ism well on board the idea that the i the typical herrings let us call them the idiosyncratic parings of musician with musician in many cases but you'll sometimes very verbal person with quieter person you introvert with extravert or introvert withintrover that all of that takes jacket or it perhaps even backbackeat perhaps it even is out of the vehicle compared to the critical importance of generative drive i when we think about generative drives in individuals you beautifully described what a generative drive is and how it shows up in individuals when thinking about generative drives in romantic real ationships however because generative drive can be expressed to varying degrees does one often see that or do you think that a matching of sort of levels of generative drives is what fosters the best relationships in other words let us say somebody has a pretty high pleasure drive m but not u very strong aggressive also also call productiveness drive and maybe they there they watch a lot on not flies a lot on not flies but there are not even the sort of persons really excited about the shows and telling you about them cause here is a version of watching a lot on afflicts where the person is i real interest in learning and knowing maybe even there thinking about writing a writing something poetry or book or or the bringing some of that to their life right i mentioned that way because watching not flicks is in bad per say wright it is not anti generative is the it an escape or is it generative is a person thinking about what they arguing to bothering to write that book or are they just trying to come you and at the end of five hours in front of the tell of vision they do not know what those five hours where it there is no intrinsic value judgment based upon a lot of things that we may intrinsic value we make value judgments about you have to look at who is the person what is the context are they being generative or not yes some of the movies shows that have watching relationships became the the points of connection around but at least to me tremendously interesting discussions on hikes that we took the next day and and reflections on our own relationship and work in life and ism glad that you point out that there is nothing intrinsically valuable or or invaluable about something not flies or even intrinsically passive about doing writ something sitting round or r even reading books for that matter there is a passive version of reading great books also people forget that it is hard to read a great book can not learn something i guess that is what they call great books but but there is aversion of that i know many people helve want a less the book i read the book an one a check it off i do not know what was in it people do that that is not generative should we consider nothing of level or expression of generative drives as am perhaps the what we are all seeking in seeking relationship to that and do you think that people tend to pair up a naturally peru with people that have a similar level of generative drive or if they do not do you think it leads to problems i think that by enlarge people do not that it is not the thing that were thinking about and looking for in ourselves or others and i absolutely believe that it makes problems and let us take a loot do not look it makes promise do not look right it next sent bite the fact that we are not basing it upon generative drive it does indeed i think make many many many many many and in fact countless problems and i would take as an example think about the idea of a tramabond i dramabond is not a bad thing a sounds a strong statement because the way that i hear tramabond used is is a bad thing but it does not have to be let us take a look at it imagine that you have what people call a tramabon and if you have two people who let just what will make up a situation i theytheythey are functioning in the world around them but they each have had some very significant drama that is creating issues in them lets say they are avoidance issues person does not feel safe or comfortable in the world around them they get invited to places that they to go but they do not go i they want to go to the must and see something really new and cool there but there might be a crowd i mean this happens right fence that you have two people who both have this in them it could be because the drama is similar the drama could be night and day i but they each have this in them they could bond around that drama in a way it that worsens the drama that is why people think negatively of a tramabond right i if the case is that the tramabon is not a good thing for these two people o say why is that it is not because both of them have had drama and both of them are impacted by drama and both of them are impacted by drama in similar ways it is not that it is that the drives are not in a healthy place and the gratification of the generative drive and the pleasure drives are not high enough let us imagine the generative drive is could be relatively low in in each of these people and one or the other or they could have a naturally high drive that is being forded right there is something that is out of balance where the drive is the the ability to express the drive right is there enough agency right if there is not let us say one person is really really shut down that person cannot stand their job right look cate something is shutting that person down the generative drive wishes greater expression they go back and look at themselves you can bring that into line right but something is ut of balance at the time that the pleasure drive may be low or it may be high but it may not be gratified it may be that that person loves museums and wants to go to the museum but cannot find that gratification right that is a possibility the aggression or assertion drive would be on the low end right but it could be higher maybe that person felt safer right that drive within them has a lot of latitude in it may be it could move her right but something is out of balance in the drives and in their expression right that is the problem to let us look at the other side where a tramabond is a great thing right each of the people in the example as drama and they recognize it in themselves and they understand how it makes things harder for them and and then that they're communicating that how it makes it hard in the other rag maybe there is a lot of overlap i in social avoid and and sensibownability but maybe there things that are different in one person verses the other then they can come together and say look that that is the goal of life i i would to be as healthy as i can be in working on myself you are to be as healthy as you can be we want to be as healthy as we can be and if we are healthy we also help each of us be healthy maybe those two people neither of which they would ever go to the must on their own because the drama inside of them is at a point it has not been worked through or it is at a place where they just simply feel too vulnerable but together they can go to the must and then the bond around drama helps them be healthy the drives are in a better place because they are able to recognize hay their things going on in me that i to be different and better and you recognize that two and we can talk about it with one another ray they are in a healthier place and then from that healthier place they build greater health much of what we hear about in terms of a friction points in relationship centers round it seems communication or lack of communication and as you are describing the role of the generative drive an healthy relationship it seems to me that it ties back in every way to agency and gratitude and agency being such a critical element of communication because wherever you have identified that okay there is a potential problem here a people with high generative drive in these examples seem to be capable of self inquiry asking the other person questions that bring bring them closer together and to a deeper understanding of the self i ease this because one thing that is often overheard or that have overheard of course have siblings and friends or are om and ill place us in the the way that have most typically heard it but ism sure it exists anotherways too c is ism i in that the conversation my head is one where a woman is saying you note that there was somebody i orating somebody and thine he is he is clueless i wish that he would just do this thing sometimes the are acts of chivalry maybe its flowers or vacations but more often than not it is it is i a a request or a complaint about a lack of productiveness yew this is also what matches up to the a very pan statements that you hear oh there is no real men these days or they're no real men left or this kind of thing the also hear it in the reverse right you hear men making pan statements about women and here were doing this in the context of heterosexual parings but of course it could all work just all well an concern writes it is exactly at all work i in the contexts of homosexual parings to you hear those sorts of things and it sounds a lack of communication you know k maybe one person needs to be better at asking for there needs to be met maybe the other person needs to develop more of an awareness of what the the person needs of course we all seem to kind of intrinsically wish that ism things which just happen for us without the the need to request them or ask for them but ism realizing again that all of that is is distracting commotion because that is not really what is going on what what is really going on it seems is that the engine behind communication the engine behind curiosity a desire to learn and know and create something from that learning and knowing in the relationship the generative drive is really what is the issue ere the lack of generative drive in any of those conversations it seems one could circle back to that an o we well some one's not asking the right questions and therefore not doing the right things because they are they do not either have a sense of agents or they do not have gratitude for the situation therein including their own ability to do that right when you hear people are not showing up for the relationship they are not showing up or she is n not showing up work again what is make the panstaymen go in the other direction that that somebody just wants a lot of attention right they just need an excess amount of attention will not let me do my own thing but also wants me to work and be successful again these are stereotypes but all of that seems very distracting however all of it seems far simpler if we push it through this filter of general drives and whether not its being expressed yes yes i i think maybe the best example of this because it is highly charged is imagine that the pleasure drive through the lets of sex and sexuality i imagine that people are in a paring there inner relationship process f how they got they were taking people in a relationship and one has a a sex drive with which means an interesting sex and maybe a proclivities for diversity of sexual experience that say if we just forsake of this example we put on a one to ten scale that that person is a to of now s at the other person in the gan being the greatest yes i right a in sis tell me right that person is a to now let us say the partner is an eight of there is a big mismatch there you think how does that normally go the two stays a two the eight stays in eight and thinks do not go well right it crates friction in the relationship at a minimum it blows ha relationship apart at a maximum the person who is a too feels inadequate often it means not always right but but this how the often goes person is a two feels inadequate as the person who is an either wants either more or different to right and the person is at visit to doesn't now that person feels bad and they me full bad about themselves or resentful of the person with the higher sex drive the person on the higher level feels now resentful of the person the lower level or may be they feel the something wrong with them because their sex rives too high or they have an interest that that the other person does not have annoy they start labelling themselves this happens all the me and it does not change most of the time and the problems are enormous look i let us see how could that look how would that look with really high generative drives and therefore the ability to think about sell to think about others and to think about us of the situation write the two people together i they be able to talk about it en ways that would not be faulting of the other and would acknowledge what is inside of them the person with the lower drive could sayouknow it just the thing does not strike me as more interesting do not think about it whet they could talk about all of that the person who wishes more or wishes different could talk about that too writing could talk about what they feel inside there is a frustration of that just the person with the lower sex drive could talk about how frustrating it feels to feel pressure it right what are they developing there tantalizing make they're thinking about each others emotional states and and they are coming at each others through agency and gratitude ism grateful for you rooms ye the revere example is these people are partners and their happy with their partnership all mi got ism grateful i found you it they would each feel that way ism grateful year in my life this happens too right and then from that ones the two is not going to become in ate the aid is not going to become at too right but in general in situations this there can be somewhere in the middle right and let let us say the too you do not besausethey look in get out of my comforts son a little bit why do not most people try that cause they feel embarrassed they feel self conscious you they they do not want to try new things or trying one of people get clothes down because there's such shame around sexuality do you take people on any spectrum of sexuality and you will find shame not in every person but across whatever population we are looking at because it is emotionally charge let us say in a loving carrying relation ship that person feels the freedom insides that to maybe i could enjoy secs a little more little more often a little me invite that person thinks about somebody who is at it too and then move that to a different place a little bit more or maybe even a lot more depending and then the person who is at the higher level you not it the eight does not need another eight right in order to say in relationship but but something may be more than a too right and then let us say they come into the middle and then the person who is in right realizes look i love you and you love me and in you you at of your comforts own right in order to do this in an lone is more fond for both of us what it is locate my higher sex rive all deal with that that maybe just making it up i would to do it three times we were doing it to too look at it that that is fine both sides can live with it but it is not freebase sic well they can live with its number one they can live with it number too it is better it is better right the two at one point was thinking a anything more than a too as i cannot do that ray is shut down on the eight is one anything less than an eight now that in the middle in the relationship is closer that is real that happens what is it relying upon it is relying upon the generative drive have the opened the ability to communicate maybe the person who is an eight say has a sexual proclivity there embarrassed about that happens all the time too but in the sense of acceptance myself an an the belief in the the strength of the relationship in the acceptance o the other n people can broach thinks most people who fee i could never broach that it is not something bazar or dangers it is not something that in a relationship that is that is defined by the generative drive the other person is likely to reject let us the find our relationships through the generative drive and let us cultivate itself and others the most generative drive if somehow pertness a person a in person be here case does not matter who is the eight and who the too has cultivar it id more of a generative drive then maybe that person could give more to the other before that person can give back to them why have these i think is completely nonsensical ideas about mutuality wright the idea that even in a situation that supposed to be defined by love right and in a friendship is a form of love right friendship ism a collaborative i endeavor rightly lie these t they have they have some affection in that right friendship can have love and often does unless they the love of of romance that there is supposed to be some equality right they o the idea that will longing to give something i want you to give something you it is not good if one person is always doing the giving things are out of balance but it is very healthy to be able to say if i can give something in your not in the place to give something lame tour give something to you right people do not always or maybe do not often depend on how we want look at it give to others with a sense of freedom it and you do not owe me anything either right why because it comes from love it comes from the abundance the the the access of goodness in me coming through the the the agency that i feel the gratitude that i feel and then what is more likely your much more likely the other person right to to auto file i can go a little more you feel stronger you feel in power making some one feel worse or saying i can give you something but you owe me something back right even if that is tacit rig will give i an give you this now but you kind of know that the other person can end of doing the laundry for two monsters unlike this no o get when i just give something right your giving goodness and then the other person actually gets the goodness and they are more likely to find it within themselves right to to then come a little out of their comforts own develop at you move their generative drive a little bit forward gifts given to others with no expectation of return a gives of abundance their gifts that arise from the generative d rive and they make us more generative think about the opposite what often happens each prison makes the other feel guilty it i oh udispresl wants you want much n look there you are again people feel terrible about that or other you do not want any sags to distal that the other prison feels terrible that is why the two stays the two in the eight says the eight i but it does not have to be that way and it is also not that if both and up in the middles if both are five that that is some compromised position that implies less no that is the compromised position that makes more it'd to take a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor eight sleep eight sleep makes smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity have spoken many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the fact that getting a quality night sleep on a regular basis is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well everything goes better and when we are not sleeping well or enough everything in terms of mental health physical health and performance gets far worse very quickly one of the anythings to getting a great night sleep as to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that is because in order to fall and stay deeply asleep you need your door body temperature to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed you need your door body temperature to increase by about one to three degrees that all becomes very easy when using and it sleep mattress cover because it allows you to program the temperature of your sleeping environment at the beginning middle and towards the end of your night when you wake up i started sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover over two years ago and it immediately and persistently improve the quality and depth of my sleep and as a consequence i wake up feeling far more refreshed i have enhanced mood focus an alertness throughout the day if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dock calm slash huberment to save up to a hundred fifty dollars off their ad three cover eight sleep currently ships in the u a canada u k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep dock calm slash superman based on my understanding of the generative drive the aggressive also recalling the productiveness drive in the pleasure drive and the important we of the generative drive been greater than the aggressive or pleasure drives i can also see the potential problem of having two eights along the ti show desire scale or two nines a or two tends and i should have observed a lot of examples of this a for instance if there but say two nines the both people nine ow ten on the on the a joy an a sort of proclivity for sax adventurous ex et camera the very high on the pleasure scale perhaps even much that they do not pay attention to where one person does not pay attention to the critical need for points of compatibility to be met the desire to some day have a family have known couples this they are together for a long time they seem to really enjoy one another i know nothing of their sex lives but there just seems to be a very strong attachment around certain forms of pleasure that they both enjoy engaging in says coulée a activities or travel i been here we were saying your in to of tenon on on the sex scale but in many of those cases there is one person saying but i will not have a family some day and they are just not into that or perhaps even but he will not leave his wife there that involved in something that feels really good they are matching along some set pleasure drive but completely overlooking the larger goals of one or both people i end ism in it here i pointed to an instance of infidelity that is its own it issues with morals et camera but you see this a lot the people really orienting towards what feels good and who feels good to be with and that of course is healthy but that is not the entire picture would you say that what ism describing is an example of where the pleasure drive has overcome the generative drive because in the case of somebody wanting a family and the other person already having one and being unwilling to leave that one or the other person not wanting a family a that the generative drive of the the person who a who wants a family is is not being respected it is ore its being undermine by this excess desire for pleasure they are just drawn into the moment and the the amazing week ends and their but this person's incredible and their durras magic and a i cannot tell you how many times that friends say that a yo they are they admire the person therewith but they know the relationship cannot work because of all these other underlying issue right right right right this its interesting we both over estimate and under estimate what say love can do right yeses all love can do anything no if i spill that glass loves not can put the water back in it right if i must live in north america and my partner must live in south america we are not been to be a right we say these things in a very wishful way love will overcome everything as has never come back right or maybe it does in the right circumstances think about if the generative drive is very very high right in both people both people have say a strong need to live in a certain place they cannot find a compromised position maybe they live half the or north america and half in south america but why because in that situation the love between them the which which is the generative drive in the relationship right what does that mean the first person has to have a strong generative drive be healthy understand that even though i need to live in north america right does not disactually mean that they releasing to live in north america right have to be able to see beyond myself and what is that mean to the person i love who needs to live on the other side of the world if the other person can do that too then in the relationship right which is a new entity right it emerges from one person an the other you can know everything about one person everything about the other you do not know about the two of them together i the two of them together are and us and if that us has a strong generative drive which it can if if each person has a strong generative drive they can bring to the state of emergence of the us the generative drive and that is the retire abetter relationships as thy the love between them and they can find a way through the idea that love cures all things at which of finding what is that actually mean right it does not mean we have a lot of pleasure together right or we a lot of the same things that is not what that means and people can very very much love one another but not be aware of the limitations inside of them right because maybe there other things going on in that a childhood aroma they love one another but they cannot get out of their comforts own enough right the plants if we make ourselves as healthy as we can be and then too selves come together that er making themselves as healthy as they can be and us between them really can fit that definition of of love and do anything but we have to defend that in the right way in a way that honors the truth which again is not a higher degree of complexity it is actually more simple you give an example of a romantic relationship where one person has a strong sex drive in the other a weaker drive and then we talked about an example aware both people have a essential high sex drive and where that cold potentially be beneficial assuming that the generative drive is also high in both of them and we also explored a little bit of how it can be bad for relationship if it exceeds the generative drive what about the aggressive proactive this drive how does that show up in romantic parents you know if one person has a high productiveness ay a aggressive drive and the other person does not an what does that look an and do you see that often in your clinical practice sure she if this make sense maybe we look at that example of the person who is a two and the person who is anadem on the on the sex drive scale right it say of the person who is a too who is trying to to raise that right has a strong generative drive what is that mean the person thinks what i think i can do this i can set myself about that i see it it will make my relationship better big i gong to give to try that is the generative drive in action the pleasure drive the person may look at that and sailor maybe this can be more fun for me relic has not been that fun for me if have a low pleasure drive could i start enjoying this more and than maybe that moves up right we maybe have a higher pleasure die but it is not been gratified ta have n it would be open and honest let me see if i can make that better then what is active what what the person is doing is then going to the aggressive or assertive proactive wrist to that drive and going to the potential in that drive and mining some of what is in it light ya how i can to do that ism going to bring myself to bear right and that is not an easy thing it is not that person then all of a sudden decides to be more sexual right there hight to be a lot of communication between the two people a lot of discussion of what what setting might be best for that what helps the person feel understood o feel more comfortable there is a lot then to do there and the person may even meed to go back to the pillars right use the person may feel woe i do not think i can do that right in then it is that is not good i want to do that right what is it that i cannot do there is a realization there and then maybe the person who is an aid because they are well connected gets it o k you cannot do that let me support you right in whatever way what while you are figuring that out cause they're both generative they want a figure that out will the o sorry to interrupt when you say go back to the pillars you mean go back to exploring the structure of themselves and the function of themselves yes that they can for instance get some inside in to what sorts of defense mechanisms might be in place rum what they paying attention to or their behaviors be even healths related behaviors they could be impacting their sex drive but but maybe even things that om resided at a deeper level the unconscious mind talking to somebody till they make a connection around a sham or or or some story that they have integrated into their thinking at a subconscious level right right just an example the i see a lot it is avoidance where get not always but let us say the person with who is the too on the sex drive scale who finds i cannot do it i while i can just cannot bring myself to do it right and then they go back and they explore this happens at this happens a lot were there is avoidance and then we get curious about the avoidance lieciecause the persons i just i something just i do not want to do that i o case there is avoidance we identify avoidance well identify that its not healthy because the person does actually want to do that cause it is it is good for the relationship and it could be good for them too and then maybe we start looking at unconscious mind right or conscious mind right and maybe we do not find cause it is it is easy now if i said oh there is a major drama that the person has not process sometimes it is that but a lot of times it is not that maybe that person just never learned to feel comfortable with sexuality or maybe the way that they experience or or attractive to sexuality was disparaged or denigrated right thou thou they had some bad feeling about it cause a society in the culture told them that or maybethey ad a couple bad experiences where they were treated in a certain way and then it is i locate that person comes by that honestly there is not a major drama there in fact unfortunately there is a drama that is almost predictable from the way or society has been structured person can go look at that like right i never never learned how to do this how to be comfortable with this or i know i learned that ism not good at it or i i learned that no one will enjoy it with me but but that is not true this these ere situation not in lakeside of a loving relationship right now that person is able to bring that knowledge to bear whether it came from the unconscious mind or the conscious mind and then that is how you work to start shifting things that was then this is now right it is not then when say the person say in high school had a sexuality that others did not approve of and made them feel bad will guess what it is not then and that is unfortunate it is wrong it is unjust work an honor and validate all that that is but we are also can a look at that that was then this is now and you get to behave differently now you are adult now and it dons cat to choose the relationship and you chose a good relationship right this is the kind of thing they pink that can get that person to the point where they can go back up through now what happens at the end of it the guise is stronger there is more agency tears more of a sense of gratitude right why because the person can attach themselves more to ism lucky to have this person as oppose to damn it i wish that person did not have a higher sex drive right the prisoners and they feel better about themselves instead of what is wrong with me that i do not have a higher sex drive right they said to wish to other person at a lower sex driver whish they had a higher sex die that is not grateful ism grateful i am who i am and that have any sex drive at all ut ungrateful for this other person now through through that right that change right they can go back and better access the assertion the they're proactive drive the aggressive drive whatever we want a call it because they have taken away they have gone and work through the barrier to it then they are able to be a little more out of their comforts own and the the other person meets them there right and and they start having this this now this healthy thing between them where the us that is them the love between them gets better right and then where they find themselves that is how they get to the five which is not a compromise between eight and two that satisfies neither it is a compromise between eight and two that is way better for both and for the relationship ism curious about common herrings that you observe in the clinical sending i and not to focus on the bad but if there are common earrings that rarely lead to a good outcome i think its worth us learning about those i simply because there common and they lead to a bad outcome and a a discussion of this sort could potentially help people void such earrings or at least recognize that there in such parents and i realize of course because of the way that re framing things during the series that any time we talk about a parring were really talking about two maps coming together forming a new and somewhat independent map that represents the relationship i have to assume that many people in the world have maps that are very very healthy and there probably even those rare individuals that do not need to go into those cupboards that reside with in structure myself and function myself and do any work but a smut for those we there just listening o not watching as oms our smiling as som saying that because i do not actually believe any per such perse than exists i think all of us even the healthiest among us could be even healthier and express more generative drive an more positivity for ourselves and for the world we to do that host it is it is a is life is lo and point to that that is beautiful we can do that for ever as long as we are here and should i do believe which is one of the reasons for having this discussion actinon the less i i have to imagine that there are also a lot of people out there perhaps most people who still have a lot of work to do and those words a lot perhaps that are in bold faced capital underline high lighted letters right and as a consequence we see relationships in the world that are not healthy what are some of those common unhealthy parings i think it is worth spending at least a bit of time on this yeyefor as we talk about this i think that we should make to somewhat simplified but hopefully helpful distinction right there people who are coming at coupling from primarily health right and again this is not to criticize people who are not coming at it from primarily health why we we all want to get to where were coming at anything and everything from primarily health and there a lot of the problems are those simple things why cant believe it did not work out i play the trumpet and he plays the clarinet is no that was not a real set of factors that is why i did not work attic it is more in that realm its not always just that that kind of stuff as a big factor right when we look in the other realm where were there is a sign significantly problematic mental health issues right which which people come by honestly but need to face if life is going to get better right there are too common paradises there now in their way more than two ways this can happen but am in a high light too that we see a lot and may be more than anything else in in the clinical setting the first gets called repetition compulsion right but do not be very very clear i do not believe that there is any such thing is a repetition compulsion a compulsion is something that one cannot control t what is going on inside the person is very very complicated when they are making decisions that lead to repeating a cycle and those are things that can change right do not have to be compulsive people are often struck by why a person is in the same bad relationship seemingly that they have always been in but with a a different name on the other person right than people will say this it is that persons forth abuse of relationship in a row and it seems to be just the same person with a different name that people say that a lot they say that about themselves this say that about others and it is very very baffling you mean you people have often been in my office very upset about that realizing the repeating and they do not know in it is frightening and no you can get a lot of a fear and movability from that but there is a way of understanding it that because are are the telymbic system right the emotional parts of our minds do not care about the clock in the calendar i drama impacts we compacts the whole brain but drama impacts the limbic system it creates strong negative emotion that then stays with us regardless of time it does not care about time imagine now a person gets in relationship and the relationship starts to become abuser i mean it is easy to say that and then move on to something else what is that for that person what is that feel when that person who they may have seen as a protector of friend i it it is now cursing at them denigrating them pushing them hitting the an it is terrifying it is horrible i it is a deep impact the dramatic impact on the person and a lot of the time most of the time all drama it triggers shame i drama triggers shame in us if the drama is strong enough it changes us as we move forward in the world and then we are different in a way that makes the past very immediate in the present what the person that is trying to do and there is been a lots of thought about this over the years in the fields trying to understand this and i think in many ways doing a good job of understanding this that the quid in quote repetition compulsion is the the drive and i do not mean drive were say thatcher is a push inside the person to try and make that right it with the idea that if that person can be in that situation again right and i do not meaning the exact situation when some one raises a hand to them but they can navigate a relationship is they thought it was a good idea the first time do not want to feel that was a very bad idea am going to make it right and and i going o be get and i on to behold right because the person is driven by fear and movability in the shame of the drama right then they are trying to make it right because because the limbic system does not care about the clock or the calender if you can make it right now you make it right in the past right as that system does not care about the passage driven by drama thin the persons trying to figure out something that is different to trying to choose that person behave in the relationship they are trying to make things different but they have selected for a dramatically high pretest probability of the same thing happening again which is why you if i could count the number of times that some one has said to me oh you are not cant help me especially at the beginning of the there is no way you can help me right my last outlive relationships were totally terrible i there is no way there is no hope people have said that to me one has last three the last five last nine and i will say back if you tell me seven different stories of relationships with seven pretty different people several different relationships as they evolved in the same really bad outcome it'll agree with you but you are not going to tell me that and that is why there is hope and no one has ever told me seven different stories a i feel while uterus cannot do it right no and again even if there were seven ism saying sane for exaggeration right but there are but their are not right is what is it the same thing seven times that is what it is because the person is repeating it if they can understand the what and the why where they selecting how were they selecting someone what is going on in side of them we go back to the structure of self the function myself we address what is there then that absolutely can change and then what will we talk about as that person then goes out to find another relationship even if they said they never never never would again neither making the decision to go out tit is a what relationship we you looking for your second you're the first one seven times no harm no for but you can navigate the second because they are in a different place they are coming through agency and gratitude instead of denigrating themselves if you are what is wrong with me what is long with everybody else e ism here right even though some bad things have happened to me look at whale i can bring myself to bear i can go out there and try and find some one i can see with clear vision now there is agency there is gratitude and then that person can go out and find relationship number too its a really good one in the example you gave its very powerful and also very extreme your an abusive relationship were some one is you sadly getting hit or screamed at you oftentimes it seems people lend up an repeated unsuccessful hearings meaning unhappy hearings of am i someone who very strongly assert if maybe we would say how he strong aggressive drive a some people might even call them a nrsassist a that phrase is thrown around a lot these days i manages is gas lighting projection these phrase are thrown round all the time i think with a frankly very little understanding or of what they actually mean unless they are coming from a a qualified cognition is it the case that somewhat passive or am submissive people are drawn to narcissist or nurses as drawn to submissive people think these questions ring in a lot of people's mines if i could clarify something that think i may be could to set in a clear way you point it to that the example i gave was it was a very strong n an extreme one i as a physician i think i naturally gravitate to the extreme circumstances because they are e ones that bring the great it risk but were we are talking to people in those settings but but most people are not in those extreme settings but that extreme serves as a model for how things that are less extreme can happen when i think right worth sitting here talking to every one across the spectrum and most relationships that are not going well thank goodness are not going to be that extreme withe repeated patterns on can to be that extreme but it is just as important to pay attention to a pattern where one person really is doctor more deferential than they would to be to the other than is comfortable to them and there seeking some one ultimately who is just a little bit more asserted and you know that is not some disaster but it cannot go well over time where that person slowly cause of say more and more of themselves and and there can be that repeated pattern you hear people say yet i was a pretty good or pretty equal at the beginning but then i just id less and less to say or evertor know then more and more i became the whole relationship right it is no less important when it is less dramatic right because the relationships of goes in a wrong way when it is more dramatic there's more risk of course but most people are going to be in the less dramatic but but but superimportant catagoand i think it is important to to point that to point that out to how much of what were talking about is nested on people's deep perhaps understandable desire to just make sure that the other person does not bereave mi cannot tell you how many times i have heard about or observed relationships that from the outside it seemed really unhealthy but it also occurred to me that people are doing things on both sides of the relationship that in sure that the other person does not leave i am not telling about a physical trapping of some one in the environment i should telling about the opposite i tie about somebody going against their better judgment and doing things for the other person or against themselves or both perhaps even in the contacts of what looks healthy family doing excessive amount of of a raising of children or excessive amount of of work a to support the family simply to ensure that the other person does not leave right right here again we can look across the spectrum i before this you talk about relationship the can be very unhealthy a narsicistic person and how can those relationships develop it is important that we we touch on that an the contexts of this because that sort of the extreme example people who are narsicistic meaning a nrsicistic character structure and ow we are getting into the realm of significant psychiatric problems and people who are narsicistic are exploitive it their bottomless pit of need arising from inability and yes they can be helped and some one out there thinks ism narcissistic than not try to be negative or being you can get help and you can be better that is the whole point of what you and i are talking about here people can change but but some one whose coming at the world through an archaistic character structure is exploitive of the other and then can say survey a room and find that person whose at drama such at that persons can be desperate not to leave a relationship and then they can exploit that person and often behave in awful ways and the other person will not leave now ism giving an example is not the case that case that way every o every single time but that is the dominant that is he dominant picture if you have anarsicistic person and who is at person more likely to pare with and than sense give inability the the desire for the other person not to leave and that person would habitat than significant problems in themselves a potentially instead of a pathological level of narcissism a pathological level of dependence for example we are in the realm than of of real problems and again real problem can be treated and real problems can be improved that is why we have clinical care but it can also serve as a model for seeing the ways that are that are less dramatic right there are many people who through the desire for the other person not to leave and we could call that attachment an security right and and may be if we leave away the stereo tight version of it right the person does not feel securely attached to the other person right and and somewhere inside of them they have learned that if they're more pleasing right if they give up little part to themselves that person will not leave right it might be because that is why their mother did not leave their father when they think about it it might be that is why their father left their mother because the mother would not do that right whatever it may be or it may be their own prior life experience or who know something they read but forgot i mean usually it something more saying it not always but they have internalize something that leads too a compromise thyself now again all that is not what attachment an security is right attachment an security is just feeling some insecurity about the attachment for example i feel attachment an security about just about everything right have had the experience of of sudden very painful losses happening right have attachment an security in the sense that am worried right i get at it anxious about people going away and and i can in a want over control i but i recognizes inside myself i try and do my best the say i do not want that to make me unhealthy i want to recognize it i want a find some happy medium where i honor that in me but do not get carried away with it to the point where i trying over control and then i push my relationships away right i say that because there is such a contrast between that kind of attachment in security which can involve over control right and the kind of attachment n security that can involve compromise themselves and we want to be very very careful on o be careful what is a trombone and what is it mean we want to be careful what is attachment an security a d what does it mean a certain kind of attachment and security can lead a person to make progressive compromises of self that are not good and healthy for them ism curious about some of these unhealthy relationships from the other side meaning from the side of the person who is let us hope not but in some cases exploited or who is being taken advantage of or in this scenario of anarchistic person or an abusive person is the one who is taking the abuse often it seems the victim in that scenario will be truly stock in that situation they cannot leave for financial reasons or kids or o their own internal workings the psychological machinery has them locked in to that in some way and it is that locked in by psychological machinery that ism interested in and i think a lot of people are interested in because from the outside we just look at that say why does not the person lea who not be just leave but clearly there is something about that situation that quote quote works for them and my work for them i do not mean that it is adaptive clearly it is maladaptive but that works for them the possibility i raised earlier perhaps as relevant here you maybe it works for them because they know that the narcissist get some sort of internal reward for engaging this kind of dynamic and therefore will not leave and the other person not leaving is of more value to them than feeling safe even it is a training one form of safety for another or perhaps the the victim as recalling them in this scenario is somebody who you don't feels a great sense of reward by serving somebody more powerful than them ut this raises all sorts of interesting questions perhaps about power dynamics as well which i certainly have questions about but what are some examples of the internal workings of such a person that reside within those bins of structure of self or f unction of self that would put some one into that sort of situation and lead them to stay in that kind of situation well any situation that if it is as you say working for a person which at times you know we see that from the outside because they things continue to go along if thins continue to go forward but it that only works for someone if they do not have the understanding the empowerment that we would wish for any one in everyone to have what is going on inside leads that person to feel a sense of i an inability to change you know whether they cannot see their way out of it or they they kind it could but could never navigate to it and that there's there is a problem there if that is working for someone right beats we are talking bout something that is exexploitiv right that is abusive regardless of how's abusive and i think i believe that can only happen in the context of being demoralized it or the circumstances of being disemboweled righting of someone just cannot go ten feet from home their situations of of outrageous amounts of oppression right of a person where where the personage is can not choose differently and than their situations where were we as stewards of all of us were the government may intervene for example ideally right that someone would come in o help that person but boring that kind of outlier a person would only be in that situation in the context of being demoralized and that demoralization would come from to low a drive for assertion being proactive aggression that that drive it is realization is to low and if we give people the understanding and we give them the help the means they do not have to stay in abusive situations we see this in situations where our society will intervene or omehote helpful intervene some person or entity will intervene and help a person help that person to understand what is going on inside of them that leads them to feel that things cannot be better they cannot do better er the they are not worth better or whatever that may be and help them defined the empowerment to then navigate themselves out of the situation and and here again i think it is not just agency but it is agency plus gratitude including gratitude for having a self that could leave a situation when people are in situations that no we talk what people as beaten down it is it is it is a way to kind of capture what i think that feels and how much suffering there is in those situations to to to be in that place and cannot have the agency to get out of it than the person is not feeling a sense of gratitude for self right they feel bad about self that there is nothing to be grateful for i and there is much to be grateful for righting we could go through any person in a situation that and we could list wonderful things about that person adaptive things about that person kind things about that person diligent things there are things that in every person that if the person cannot see that they cannot attach to that they cannot have the agency and gratitude than they stay in a situation that is really defined by the agency and gratitude and therefore that aggressive assertion proactive drive being expressed at such a low level i can see how a healthy relationship could exist in relative isolation your not complete isolation and here agent um referring to her thinking about romantic relationship gut you a healthy romantic relationship could exist in relative isolation i a few friends of some contact with family members or in great c inactivity with friends and family in neighbors et camera and still be a really great romantic relations can also see how the sorts of relationships that we happen to be focussing on at this moment which are this unhealthy dynamics are made far worse by lack of inactivity to outsiders in fact a previous guest on this podcast was avid bus who professor of evolutionary psychology down o the rickets us ousting and he talked about some of his research into the dark tread these are narsassistin maccaviliand sometimes also sociopathic individuals how that plays out in romantic relationships and m it is a terrible thing but in an important thing to understand am given the unfortunate frequency that that occurs but one of the things that i re remember clearly from that discussion with a avid bus was that even when there is not sociopath the or a strong desire to destroy the other that in these sorts of relationships there is often an attempt to isolate the person i first by isolating them from their family ism also from friends and to workers but all with the goal of convincing that person that no one else would want them has a way to make them quote on quote voluntarily stay in other words to undermine their their sense of safety to ramp up their sense of anxiety except in the presence of that individual i and now i am remembering that now because i man us were talking about why would not somebody just leave why would not they just tape into that agency and gratitude a it is clear that the the oppressor in this kind of relationship i has a real incentive to try and undermine agency and gratitude because of course with those they would be revealed for what they are in the person would feel enable to leave i taking us back once again to the critical need to cultivate agency and gratitude not just in unhealthy but uncertainly in healthy relationships i man i think the the principle here is that darkness always favors the oppressor the oppressor wishes for darkness you an isolate that person right because when people see that things are better for some one else they realize things can be better it when people are told by someone that they are worth while or there funny or their pretty or their smart to whatever the case then b they may take that inside it and they may take inside oh my maybe i am know ism handsome in smart maybe or they they are thinking about that their very basic concepts that that a low person to entertain new i waste to look at themselves it the person whose oppressing wants that person to live in darkness they do not want then the see that there can be better they do not want them to be directly told that they're better than how things are and that same darkness on the outside say the lights are out around the relationship is the goal of the oppressor on the inside again the pressor may know this and be doing it consciously but often this gets played out and unconscious ways the constant denegation of some one a person is not saying inside geisha's trying to reduce their the agency their aggressive drive really down to zero right but that is what they are doing somewhere inside there is a knowing of that even if it is an unconscious knowing and than what the impact of that kind of abuse over time is a lower and lower and lower ability to bring ones self to bear less proactive aggressive assertive a lower sense of agency and gratitude that that is really the definition of being demoralized and and that kind of abuse is always promoting demoralization because demoralization is the darkness on the inside it just as envy is too right demoralization is a form of darkness on the inside envy is no less dark envy may be a lot more active right but in both case is there is no knowledge there is no growth there is no wisdom there is no learning i there the states of darkness and and what can happen in a way that is we tragic to think about as you often can have an an abuser an oppressor who is living in total darkness inside a living through the lends of envy and then you can have a person who is being oppressed who is being exploited who is living in darkness but there living in the darkness of demoralization and nous tit is a very sad thing to say to imagine and has been a very very sad thing to see is if if you do clinical psychiatry for long enough you see a lot of this and it does not have to be this way never the people who ere oppressing habit within them the majority of time to make things better and we do see that i took care of a man a long time ago who had been terribly abusive to his family and is was always unclear to me it ad happened years before that that he just understood and gan i never understood what happened that that he he got it and the man really made change can yet i do not know what the circumstance was that made that motivation i he went back and looked at himself and he went back and looked at how his father oppressed and terrorized the family and how he just did it with automatically right because what it was rooted in his own fear of inability and he is going to lose his family and not be a man any more unless he oppresses them he recognized all of it in him and he had changed it dramatically he would removed himself from the family system and when i got to know him it was years later and he was reintegrating back in to the system because there had been such prolonged change and he had communicated to the family his understanding myself it is not impossible even someone who is abusing oppressing coming through a narstacistic character structure the there is no therapeutic nihilism here right things can change in things can change in the oppressor which is not excusing that right that mean a person who doing things is is morally culpable right that they often a criminally legally culpable that is all true just as the ability to change is true and then the person we think about more commonly in the situation of course is ha person who's being oppressed and there can be change there too but ta problem is how hard it can be that the impact of the isolation right and also the dearth of resources to really help people sent actual true story of a woman who i believed with all my heart could get out of the sickly abuse of situation she was in if she had a carburetor a carburetor right should car the carding function she would a place to go right thar others would not know thathat she was there and the problem was just few hundred dollars to change the carbonades that there is no place to go there is no resource as areas a society do not help people now it may be that some one help that woman and got her carburetor and she drove away right it shows how we can bring ourselves to bear as a society to offer people help which sometimes is the life line the person needs and anyone may be that person it really needs a safe house or something very dramatic or they need a carburetor to get away from being terrorize but a lot of times is just community support structures right good structures around people incommunicy communities that can offer them support in situations that may be less dramatic opportunities for interconnection which sometimes people can find through social values or thou religiously affiliated venues but the idea that communities support systems on all levels make a huge difference hatchet is how there is another level right beyond the relationship right is the society it is the culture right and that is how we on that next level of emergence beyond the individual relationships can foster goodness can foster health in each in every one of us how does some of these same dynamics play out in non romantic relationships for instance in the work place a i was weaned in academic laboratories what is most familiar to me or gosh unfortunately numerous examples where people working in laboratories not the same as mine cause i'vebeen very fortunate have amazing a benevolent mentors dorky and a outrageous at times but a benevolent none the less but others around me have been in laboratories where for instance the the work load was just ridiculously high the demand far exceeded what any person could do and if somebody had a god forbid a cold or a children it was near impossible to impossible that they could meet the standard there am or a stress dynamics ins a pressure cooker dynamics that a made it what any one would call a toxic environment ah you see this also in affirms you see it in companies you see it in families you see it in a friendship circles rite em and how many movies are about teens a he oppressing one another through bulling and ridicule and am and practical jokes that are anything but funny right that are downright destructive get and on and on and often the victims in these cases if it is not a hollywoud move a feel as if that is their only choice because a to leave is to essential have no other options right it is not that that is the only option is to stay it is that to leave as essentially to leave science am because these people in positions of power have the louder voice they have the megaphone they write the letters o recommendation a the law terms people talk a in as i unit school this out in a long form question ism realizing i cannot think of a single exception as long as there are going to be people interacting and people talking about their interactions and people in positions of power this sort of dynamic is going to take ploce about any time you have a closed system without accountability you just rolling the dice for that kind of oppression we need accountability think about theoretically what should have happened there right there should be higher order accountability right whether it is in a company or university or wherever it may be there should be higher order accountability that is reasonable and rational it is not then acting in a top down way that would be over controlling right telling exactly what you cannot cannot say or what you cannot cannot do and it so as is is too much rigidity that can be enacted top down but that the problem runs both ways if there is no accountability from the bottom up then that person is just simply stock right why because the system we have put into place has failed right and this is where were were talking now about not just individual relationship to two people relationships but now we start talking about systems of people and systems of people or another level of emergence with with a personality to speak an environment all their own you can know everything there is to know about each person in the system you do not know about the system but what you do know is that accountability is necessary i mean probably if we added up all the examples in history no we we would have to talk about them over a thousand years i mean how many examples do we have that close systems without accountability are just rolling the dice they breed oppression this is this is true at i have been at several different places i i have not try to implicate is any one place verses another but i was part of a medical treatment team this is a hierarchical medical treatment team of o be seven people who never take one pending upon the circumstances where there was physical abuse going on i the to patient team this as true and and ism not ism not saying this in some exaggerated manner where somebody brushed up too close to some one and they slipped no hurting some one on the treatment team too different people who are being hurt by some one senior this is united major university in a clinical setting i it is not again thatsop is that is the be all an enroll but you think about the alleged a sophistication of the people in the sister the alleged empowerment of the people in the situation which did not put a stop to that we need to have accountability the accountability has to be reasonable it does not mean over control but it does not mean under control either and if that person is being overworked as you described with no way of winning or harm don a on a medical team and there is no way that that that person can change that the system has failed that person and fail them dramatically and guess who suffers every one does right that person suppers i and the science that is being done or the medical care that is being provided is important to all of us any one could be the patient who who is being taken care of by the team where one person is hurting a couple of the others you think that medical cares can be optimized is the science gang to be optimized that were utilizing to try and make our our lives better live longer be in less pain what is happening there is envy that person who oppressing other people is driven by envy whether it is a narsocistic character structure that acts almost exclusively through envy or it is envy that is in this person's life in this way or not not another way is it matter right what is going on there is envy and envy is nothing but destructive r the generative drive is nothing but productive envy is nothing but destructive could you remind for people that perhaps may not have heard episodes one in too yet that envy is ism perhaps not just a desire to be somebody else that envy in the contexts that were discussing heres is something i quite possibly different there is a varying lexicon which light is important to define it cause i think people learn it in different ways have heard it talked about in different ways to define that there is a difference between jealousy and envy and we could choose different words but this is the way i learned it that is been most impactful where jealousy is is xenon right it is the idea that if i see that you have something that i do not then i think oh it maybe i could work harder and get that thing right or if i cannot have that thing maybe it is a person is younger right of i cannot make myself younger then i can think toque to three lends of gratitude was is that the only thing about me right i cannot think of anything good about myself right other than maybe i could be younger and m if if you come at that through the lends of health it is it is coquet right it can serve to motivate people to i try harder work harder take a look at themselves and be more accepting of who they are and what there is circumstances in life and and what kind of control they can a an act in what kind they cannot it is oke it envy is different i envy comes at that problem from the perspective that bringing down the other person right is just as effective as bringing up the self that is why envy is destructive some one who might see another a person and they envy them their youth right they envy they want that and they want to bring that person down right use i cannot make myself younger but the they be i cannot make that person older either but they can do other things to them right they can sexually harass them maybe they can make terrible jokes that are really insulting and humiliating maybe right t re all sorts of things a person can do to bring down some one else in be an action of envy is destructive and and i truly believe this that people who who come at the world very strongly through envy by enlarge an our cubistic character structure this is a small percentage of the population but that small percentage does most of the damage on earth i it is a strong thing to say but when i think about o studying political science and thinking about history and learning medicine and learning about a cherry and sociology and really trying to look at the world and and and thinking what what drives a person on a medical team who is gotten to be a senior physician to physically hurt doctors lower on the hierarchy envy it that person feels terrible about themselves in it is being destructive to those people same thing that same thing is at work in the lad the same thing is at work when people start work of destruction that just simply harm other people and we can see no other sense of it that from the individual setting all the way up to the world setting we see the destruction of envy and we also see it inside of us because a person who's enacting envy in the world around them is never there is no chance of happiness that hence the i hate idea of a bottomless pit right whatever you get let us ay an envious person who wants more money i want have more money than anybody right i want everyone to have less money than me right that the they come at the world through the lends of greed when they get more money how long does that make them happy right this does it mean money is bad or having money is that it just means if you are coming at the world through the lends of envy right in that lends a specifically focussed on money than you will be a greedy person who is never satisfied even if you have ten trillion dollars it is never good it takes away from that person any possibility of happiness and if you see people would work with people with the narsacistic character structure there can be a sense of a very brief happiness in the moment i am happy because i realize i have something some one else doesn't ism happy because ism thinking of myself and even though i feel very insecure and vulnerable inside i have a whole set of defense mechanisms that let me turn those tables round and and then feel good about myself in a way that places me above others whatever is going on in that person it may bring some very brief gratification in the moment but that is not happiness hence the need for the gratification over and over and over again narsecistic people are the least secure most diffident people on earth they just have a phenomenally healthy defensive structure that comes about in order to try and protect them that leads them to go to the opposite some of uts called a reaction formation going to the very opposite denial avoidance rationalization projection very unhealthy defenses that then leads that person to protect themselves from any help while they are frantically trying to gain some goodness that makes them feel good for put second and then disappears forever hence the tremendous predilection for destruction how to you and how should we think about power dynamics in relationships perhaps starting with romantic relationships have heard it said before that there is always power dynamics and relationships of all kinds i do not if that is true or not but have heard that and have also heard that that's particularly salient in romantic relationships independent of whether or not it is a homosexual or had or sexual relationship that there is always to some extent or another one leader and one follower a this is a a interesting perhaps a a controversial idea but have heard it enough times that i want to know more about it sure power dynamics was very important but also something we tend to be over reductions about me this idea thing that that there always a leader and there is always a follower every single relationship right that is true on balance what we tend to be reductionists ad then what we do is we miss the real power dynamics that are going on just i had said in a previous episode the think my mathminer has helped me the most like all life right i think a power dynamics course that i took as an undergraduate in political science has helped me the most as a psychiatrist took it long before medical school because that class taught me much about power dynamics i thought it was going to be about over power who has power over whom and tells whom to do what right but what i learned is much of power dynamics are cover they are under the surface for example to the things that are not sad something that was called at the time at least the issue of the non issue right where there is an issue between two people this person never takes out the barber's that person always takes out the garters that person is resentful about it both of them know but the person who always does it cannot say because if they say the pest person will punish them in some other way right by not taking out the garb's than the place smells that person goes to work and the person is at home as to take it out right that is one example of the issue of the non issue other examples are where some one is looking and smiling and and being really nice to some one who they know is gents physically harm them if they bring to light that they are actually not happy and do not feel good about that person right from the dramatic to the nondramatic unstated power dynamics are going on all over the place and there in every single relationship and unless the person is in relationship with some one else under both comatose i us only one of them asked be come mitts right there power dynamics going on but it it does it mean that there unhealthy right use the there are always power dynamics then what are we looking for and an there lot of things we could look for but we could talk about really too primary things one is look for the non obvious and too is the given take the first even in our own relationships because it is it is interesting how many people will say talk about the power dynamics in their relationship they are not always saying you are the power dynamics in my relationship but they are telling me about them and they are telling me about the things that are over right now somewhere inside of them they know that they cannot really raise issue a beer see or will be some retribution whether it is small or large or they might even know everything's dopey and that person is happy but they know ism not giving them room to say thatched are not happy and that could just mean enough they say they are not happy then i i'llcome home a couple hours late the next day and that personwill feel some attachment and security because of that and there all sorts of ways this can play out but since much of power dynamics are a unstated or cover kind the iceberg of conscious and unconscious as an iceberg ore power dynamics to think about including in one's own relationships whether it is a neighbor it is a friend it is a work relationship or most charged it is romance what is really going on between us what is really going on between us i might not looking to tell myself lies right i know that i may not be able to understand all of it but let me stop and think baud it and people if you ask people to stop and do that they can say yet it is really not of or because sometimes they do not know that it is there or they do not want to know that it is there and and the ferity work is trying to guide them to this immense power disparity maybe in the relationship when they are presenting know everything is equal to good good support of relationship you are that allot and of course it is not always that there is something bad under the surface but a lot of times there is an even something mildly bad is not of and calls problems and sometimes there is something very bad look for the non obvious and then the second is that given take is a is a very good sign of health is a very good sign of also if a person a kind of s we that there is given take and it might be that something as simple as i could chooses where we goo to dinner a now sometimes one sometimes the other depends who has a stronger feeling or it may be that person always decides will be goo to dinner but the other persons o cay with it right and that person always decides what move they want the o the other person right the idea that there is given take and then in periods of time where where one person may be in a more difficult place one person has a big indicant loss right or an injury or in illness than you see that that ships a little bit one person is giving more right but then ultimately the idea is that is from the outside right if one person is giving more to the other there is a generosity of spirit in both the giving and the accepting right that leads them to then be stronger together even when k people say well they are in balances in some way if you just look at what is going on day to day but in a healthy relationship with high generative drive the periods of in balance strengthen the relationship a you see thus with friends where to people of pretty equal friendship and and then one person as something difficult happens and the other person is there for them what is true on the other side of that they're better friends right and it is also why we often want to be interconnected en we are healthy what is something bad happens to both of them right it is good to be interconnected in friends and family can be supportive to us the idea that given take is healthy i think is is very central just looking for evidence as often if i do not understand what is going on in the relationship may be is early in the therapy or just been kind of opaquer i cannot figure it out ism looking for is there given take because another to think o ka more likely than not things you're healthy if i see and imbalance whether the person knows it or not of thinking more likely than not it is unhealthy and then they are just clues along the pathway of of of my efforts to understand the non obvious piece is really intriguing as is the given take and i really appreciate the brought up the given take because that is a very concrete place we can all look and ask ourselves even if people are not hin romantic relationships what is the given taken a given friendship and as you mention earlier it does not have to be scripted one for one one for one em maybe balances out over time or maybe it does not i mean i had friendships that if a lasted many decades even where i can honestly say ism always the person to reach out to the other person but when they connect they can act with such a depth of attention that i do not feel any deprivation whatsoever in fact i do not think of ever considered that ism the person that always reaches out until to day as o does not bother me whatsoever i feel infinitely rewarded in the relationship its generative i feels generative it does not haugh to be equal however one wants a defend equal but it has to be mutual you are getting in your feeling goodness from he relationship is the other person lo et that is good that is coming from that high generative place and when we really lets tat we push that concept forward to where we want to be living not some pie in the sky right but agency and gratitude as fears the generative drive is is very strongly express and the other drives are subserving to generative drive then we get to the place where we really see it is true that it is better to give than to receive the happiest people i see are the people who are giving now of course it feels great to receive but it feels better to give because there is a goodness in the self in the giving and i remember seeing this is a child and being too young to understand it but has a little kid i liked getting things r and as a little kid i liked getting things more than i liked giving that is of say when your little kid but what i did observe is that my maternal grandmother who is very sweet and loving and and caring she loved giving i you give her presents and we did and she likes she really getting presents she loved giving it there is an excess of goodness and then as i got older and i learned more who she had been in the community and how she had been to people and and i could see and now through the lens that there was such goodness in her i think she is real for me she is the shining model of goodness that i internalize as i aspire to be better then i think i want to be that i i am more generative as i try and think more about giving than receiving it is ism not trying to say ism some noble person or on being ascetic ism think that is a good way for us all to feel right where some one a very very successful person that that i a consult is in my life right who who talked about how he always makes inside of himself the best understanding what is going on between him and another person whether it is a very big financial dear its about power or it is personal and then gives a little bit always where have we edit up let me give a little bit right and and there is a person is very very successful we are very happy right but yet i would argue the goodness in him is why he is successful and happy is not that he is successful and therefore he is happy right it is what is inside him that fosters both of those good things and he could be just as happy without that the big success may be would not maybe he was not a minded to do that and and he grows a nice garden he could be equally happy but the point is the goodness himself to to to be able to do that right to feel good about doing that i feel better about giving that than i would have at receiving that that is pretty stark right something given to the other that i would have gotten right now and were in maybe a negotiation to give it feels better than to have it ism sure there are many people thinking about individuals who are highly successful who are not givers who are takers i do think those examples of takers of som calling them a arable lot of attention but i know at least withinscience and the other domains of life have been and that there are far more successful people who are also givers i even to a great extent and of course that does not mean that they are giving to the point of an inability to give further or to take care of themselves the giving is part of taking care of themselves but it is part of this general of cycle it is it is not one thing it is not a tit for tat it is it is it is part of something that makes them feel good makes others feel good i it is it sort of anti transactional and as we are talking about the self and inter relations betweenselves in these different relationship contacts to day that is word transactional keeps coming to mind i and what ism ware of as you are describing what healthy selves and healthy relationships look is that it runs counter it to pretty much everything that have heard and that we hear in the world about relationships and about the relationship to self meaning it is not transactional it is really about a cycle i for using this word generative over and over and a in it is specific contacts to day i soft want tit rob that word for for a different purpose but ism imagining a sort of upward spiral i in my mind or perhaps only is that is really the a circle of life that just keeps growing bigger and bigger d bigger i may we could talk lo bit about this notion of relationships being transactional mites such a loaded word i but have a close friend who is married with more than a few children who you do not told me the other day i i realize that it is all kind of transactional they are extracting from me and ism extracting from them and it is benevolent cause it is all good and and i i thought i this is really this is really dreadful the a no one wants to think that the closest relationships in their lives are transactional and he was coming to that conclusion i i disagreed with them and i do not know where that all sets for him right now but may we could talk about that the transactional verses nontransactional aspects of relationship because we all want things that is perfectly healthy i believe we all experience disappointment and pleasure and relief and u sometimes made your disappointment pleasure relief et camera but what is the roll of transaction in relationships and h t how to psychiatry how to you and how should we think about that oh we often get confused because there are transactions in every relationship but that does not mean that every relationship is transactional right if we think about what transactions are we can think of the kind of the stereo typical way it can also be like here is the transaction it'll do the dishes and you wash the clothes it or forinsens it'll make the money and the other person will race the children right right there are transactions right but that does not mean that the be all an end all of it are sot of hard hearted calculated transactions and transactions also occur in less obvious but equally important ways right another way that transactions occur is right now ism putting something out there right some saying something right an then at a point i stop and ism waiting for you to put something out there then i take in what you said and we are doing something that in that sense is transactional ism waiting for you to give me something i take it in i process that i give something back out to you but that is not the be all an end all of it there are transactions whether it is the whose can wash dishes who going to do the clothe or it is what o i put out there that you take in what you put out there that i take in that there is something greater than something beyond the transactional and there is some controversy to this a thought that that that that there really are historical thought in the field that there are just aggressive and pleasure drives in us and that everything is transactional now again we do not really have a way of disproving that i meaner not can be some equation that disproves that but i think it is entirely disproven by human experience and there is many and i could tuna we could we could talk about in infant number of resources to consider this but just imagine the writings of evicted frank and that and the writings and the theories around human interactions and and psychological theories that have come of it to think that everything is just transactional it is a denial of the humanness in all of us that i think he just brought to the for strongly but again there could be nearly infinite infinite resources throughout human history that say the were not entirely transactional it is not just aggression and pleasure but there is something more going on here there is learning that feels good for the sake of learning there is kindness that feels good for the sake of kindness there is giving that feels good because giving feels good this is going on in us it is going on when we are loving children for example or loving animals there is something inside of us that is not just transactional and that is why it i think what we are talking about is is if it is truth it should all hang together right he must all hang together and an this is why there is an just right over top of each individual that is in relationship right this is why you can know everything about me you in know everything about you and you can know nothing about our friendship right absolutely nothing right because it is something different right and if it were all just transactional there would be nothing different right and i think our experience as human beings right i know that to be true because i just know that i do not always feel selfish about things it right maybe sometimes i do and i do something nice cause it will make me look look it we are all human right but i know that there is good feeling from others towards me at times that is just about the good feeling i know that there is that from me towards others that t rolls us yes there is something other than just the i there is the we of dads right of relationships no matter whether there work family friendship relationship and then there the levels beyond that that are larger he's right the we of groups if i understand correctly it can be the case that one person makes the majority or all the income for family the other person raise thachildren takes care of the majority the home and of course there is a transaction there a set of transactions but that it is in service to something larger that really is not transactional ism at just feeling your words here but if i were to expand on that it just to make sure i understand that the nontransactional thing that emerges from that is a generative because it is a family right it is a family that every one might extract growth and pleasure and meaning from om and just because the roles are divided as such it does not necessarily mean that the relationship is defined as transactional in in the sense that it is in less than it could be right right right if you if you think about what is really being transacted say one person is out in the world and is making an income the other person is a taking care of the family and taking care of the home what is being transacted well the person who is making the money is sharing the money right is in that sense transacting some of the money to the other person you get to have some of it too gout have some of the benefit from stand the person who is at home who is taking care of the family in the home sent you get to have some of that too right you get to come the children are taking care of right the home is taking care f both are transacting something to the other right eking that is truth of it right if you look at what is really going on there hon person getting benefit of money they didn't earn the other persons getting benefits have child cure they did not do or pay for right is a having for child care there sharing resources right yes that is we but is that it i are these two robots right one is the money making robot an the other is the child cure robot that is not what is going on right tattle way we want to invasion that if we have two healthy people with generative drives is they love one another they are creating something better than they could create on their own in fact they have created children right they have created a home together and they're nurturing that family together that is generative and because it is generative it can also be flexible let us say the person who is at home ti need to do some things outside the house right er let us say the person who is out working thinks fell overwhelmed and i let to switch to a better job that jobs half time i but one to be i can behalf in the house right this is where people can come together right in the same way we talk about the two and an aid on the sex drive or sexuality scale where people then can find compromises right and if one really wants to stay out of the home all the time but the person in the home wants to leave the home will they find a way that that works right because they care for one another that the generative spirit that is in them individually and as a couple let us them nurture that and one is not interested in oppressing the other ism no and love my job you stay at home or ism staying at home you stay out there let us let us think about things let's let us communicate right that is how the generative drive not only i makes that also right the five is not the compromised position between the eight and the two the five is atom right here the transactional aspects are also because of the generative aspects of what comes of it far more then either of those people could make on their own i mean women say is not obvious may be one makes ex amounted dollars each could make half acts that is nan what we are talking about neither of them can create that family on their own it seems that much of what we are talking about relies on yet t the hall marks the that we always hear make up good relationships of all kinds romantic and otherwise things alike communication listening generosity we all the stuff that we all know that we should bring to relationship and hopefully are getting from relationships and that if we are not that we should probably request from others an in in a polite ways can i it connect ness have one word for that kindergarten right think about that we learn that in kindergarten what you are describing is simple right that is why it is high up on the this what the guilders pushing up is high up from the two pillars right because what you are talking bat is simple generosity of spirit giving rather than taking right blinking to others letting things go feeling good about yourself even if you fall down right we learn this in kindegard s we must somewhere inside of us really value it right but then we let it go we make things overly complex and o this this idea that in many ways we should go back to kindergarten right because there is a purity there right children in an age where they can learn that we bring a nice kind of learning to them and nurturing to them and we can bring it to ourselves too that we simplify that which is become overly complex right we simplify because aroma makes complexity have not just make one's way in the world it it is complicated right things it more and more complicated and we lose the simple roots of goodness or the goodness of simplicity right and we can come back to that my i could not resist when you said oh these are k simple bare these basic things right rat that is the point of it because that is where agency and gratitude and the generative i that is where they live in simplicity ism glad you mention kindergarten it brought me back to am images of kindergarten were yeas far as i can remember now the all the critical components of a great generative environment adults who really cared about us fortunately they were am snacktime with oranges of nurse food i was native in the afternoon that these things are all things that ism exercise explore avian pig home on the week ends this guinea pig i think they actually i think the we several guinea pigs but they retrying to convinces all the same guinea ah because they would allow one family to take home the guinea peach we can sometimes i think it did not work out quite well but anyway that the guinea pig was a pervasive features you learn to take care of things and in all seriousness now that i step back from it there is nothing more generative it seems then a kinder garden classroom in wasn't or we should say a healthy kindergarten class from environment it is all about support of others and but if we go to the pillars a the structure of self on the function of self and surely there is a lot going on at home too but think about what salient it is learning a messages of self u self confidence in stilling those it is behaviors that are based on strivings and hopefulness tit is all the good things yes all the good things and as i was thinking about communication and all these good things that clearly a guintergarden is a wonderful templet for in all seriousness i thing is amazing templet ism thing about what gets in the way and of course drama can get in the way and we should talk about that more but it seems to me that one of the things that gets in the way of asking for what we want of hearing requests of us in the way that is going to bring about the most generative goodness is anxiety it is you tired from a long day and one mentions yo we we have to take the trash out you i was at work all day then that kind of thing or earlier talking bout the issue of the non issue arms of powerdynamics that well let us just say have had the experience before in relationship of feeling if i make a request or i have a contocok complaint about something that the other person is going to be upset about the fact that they did not do something well that is to me three days of just the diminished happiness for everybody i an just ass not down right when we hear the word anxiety i think we often about the person quaking about public speaking or getting in the circuits in the brain high jack that we are only designed for sabre r to tigers but anxiety seems to serve both a very important functional role in modern life that has nothing to do with physical threat but it also seems to be the feature that if not kept in check if we cannot regulate our own anxiety am realizing there is no way that we are going to be in position to ask for what we need in what we want to hear what is needed of us and what others want in other words anxiety seems a major barrier to the generative drive i think the the place to start is if you show me a person who has no anxiety it'll show you a manic i we all have anxiety in us member is is just a word rid what are we what are we getting at were getting at a sense of tension i er a sense of disquiet inside of us that that we would to so we to ease if we could i it is not helpful or healthy if we are very very low levels of that i because then our strivings a certainly in the suffer right is not a lot of motivation i to to to go make change in the world change in our lives i we have too little of that tension that does not go well and and would that maps to a lo a assuredness aggression proactive drive as of there other ways that can show itself but it maps very clearly i think to that and that is not good for us on the other end of the specter were much more concerned with the other end of the spectral because a lot of anxiety feels very very bad bandit feels very bad right now i are or high levels of anxiety they narrow our cogninispectrom they narrow or ability to think about what is going on around us to think about ourselves the idea with anxiety is to recognize that we all have it and and we call it anxiety we can call attention call whatever we we want to but we want that to be in in a healthy place i which which comes of course back to the self that if my levels of anxiety are very high and therefore it is causing problems in my relationship maybe ism ism always asking my partner f roque or that happens a likely or bouquet or you happy why or because is a lot of anxiety an me the first place that goes to look at myself we could say oh i have attachment in security that is a stating the obvious right were a sergeant drop but a very common one i nowadays says i think is new in the course of human history is i that the reaching the tugging the line phenomena you test somebody you thing about them you do not hear back and then attention starts to mount and then ism depending on the contact you may either be concerned about the person or even suspicious about what the person is up to him inhere its very contextual right and i depends on the history of both individuals and that relationship but then the person will reach back eventually and it either will bring relief or relief with some resent where were you what happened i this is very very common i i much in fact that i have come to learn and talking to others and this is that the classic you know i have a friend who but really i others who are in the landscape of looking for relationship and there are people i know well who go through a lot of effort to set and intermittent scandal of response that can not give the other person a sense that they always respond wish short latency because indeed sometimes they they will be able to do that and sometimes they will not what their base trying to as make sure that the person does not theactually trying to take care of the other person in addition to themselves because i think we come to expect a certain latency of response with certain individuals and if we do not here act with that particular latency of response our own anxiety starts to pick up and i can be quite damaging to a relationship in particular to the generative drives within us because in that time that were stressed were not tending to other things including things that we could do for the relationship that were worried abet me out seen and swingers right with the present leaves a message and then an lives the whole relationship in his own mind and breaks up with the person and they never actually spoke right that that there is the anxiety run wild and of course i remember that was very very popular in that came out why cause it resinated we know with the insecurities we feel and now with the ability to feel those insecurities in a much more immediate way that present intakes me back right that there is a lot more of that inside of us which really points to if you are able to identify that you are that you are anxious too anxious for comfort which again if one looks inside or even listens maybe to what others have said or reflected there a lot of data especially introspection to be able to identify that right the next question is always why right let us go look at that maybe that person is been anxious their whole life right maybe the they just a wrong tense all the time e night sometimes a little bit of medicine the connajust pulls that down personal that for fifty years life is better than side effects sometimes that might be the case right sometimes the person's anxiety can are throughout childhood and maybe that is because there were difficult things or dramatic things that happen maybe there is nothing that but maybe the person was very good it engaging in the world and then felt more and more pressures upon themselves and know one ever did anything wrong and they only been rewarded right but regardless look at the anxiety in yourself go back to those pillars right and one might discover for example maybe the the anxiety ism feeling is attributable to the other person am i feeling anxious because ism intimidated right my feeling anxious because i know that if i do not behave in a certain way now the next time there is a group meeting there will be some sparky joke ma it about me anxiety sometimes it's the self sometimes its out a lot a by a l logical component sometimes got a lot of psychological component sometimes both right sometimes it is the environment sometimes it is the other right the other person look at why because that is how we learn right like what what is going on inside of me where is that level of anxiety how does it not feel comfortable what actually is it how is it changing how behaving how might it be changing he my responding to it what we doing were going back to to the look in those tan cabinets and figure out why which we can do right the vast majority at times between ourselves in the use of others either professionally or non professionally we can go understand the anxiety or the lack of anxiety why am i not motivated right me let us a case with a lot of people who feel demoralized they do not fee it can get anywhere in the world right the world's a bad place and now on how you can to make your way in the world thy start feeling nihilistic or now they feel there is the apt boll is against them even in a generational capacity right and now they feel demoralized and and the tension inside is soothed by thinks maybe that is the person was overusing the thing that soothes right they could go look at i ways kind of motivated and did well sports or the well in this was interested in that right what is going on that is how person could identify for example being demoralized that process of inquiry gives us the information that we can use in the service of change and the change while not achieved a hundred percent of the time the change for the better is predictable if it is arising from a place of understanding ism very curious about frames of mind in relationship in particular how being in our own experience say anxious because someone has not responded to us and really paying attention to the anxiety and drilling in to it and asking ourselves why my anxious and undo i deserve to be anxious is t about years about them whether not that is valid pursuit or whether or not casting on the other person and thing to imagine you will what is going on in their head that they might be doing this or that they seem to do something repeatedly this of course relates to much more than just the scenario of waiting for a text message and feeling anxious may i think much of how we come into relationship its of all kinds i know romantic certainly but a family relationships are in and around the tendency to switch back and forth sometimes seemingly at random between our own experience and what am i feeling what am i experiencing and then thinking about the other what is what are they thinking what are they experiencing him and this is everything to do with human dynamics great i i i would think that it is near impossible for the typical person to just live life through their own a frame and lends and never pay attention at all to what others might be thinking even force is the most exploit of extractive narcosis social path presumably is thinking about who in the room is going to be their target because of how that person might be feeling of course on the benevolent side people who want to do a positive general of things in the world are probably thing about am who do aline with am who who has a common goals that they might want to work with or be with romantically that could help then and the other person generate what is this thing that we do a what is it called and and how does it work ut to place ourselves in the mind of others and what rolls does it serve and what goals does it undercut when we have this think the first thing to say is that everything follows the same simple pattern i i start with thinking about me i if ism anxious why my anxious was going inside of me then i think about you are you anxious too or maybe ism not anxious but i notice that you are i there is the thought about the give was i cannot think in a clear headed way about you unless have thought about me right as if ism really really anxious then how mice was under an and trying get an idea of where you are at right then where do we arrive we arrive at the magic bridge of the us i that is what connects us whether the us is a friendship its a professional relationship it is romance it there is the bridge of the us because it is not just how ere when am i anxious how r when are you anxious what are things when were together it maybe hat maybe ism anxious when were together and or what is that tension about your anion were together and you know maybe that is for reasons we could talk about and make guess maybe there is some insecurity in one of us or maybe the other persons behaving in a certain way that is not making he send person feel good right we we can then come together and see how does us impact the level of anxiety and how do we then take away from the us being stronger to think about we talk about the trombone trombone can be enacted in he negative way it can be enacted in a positive way and those two people who can go to the must together who cannot go to the museums separately right they are living in the magic bridge of the us right they are both at the museum but neither can go to the must right neither can go to the must but both can go to the must and then they take away stronger selves from that right that is at that is a reenforcing experience is positive right it builds the generative drive it builds confidence right that the person wheat they were asserted and that was gratified in a good way and they felt pleasure right when we look at the us it is about us in the moment right but it is also about how two people are impacting one another in the rest of their lives and this of course this is more important the closer the relationship this is very important for example in close friendships or family relationships and i think this is of extreme importance in relationships may these teethe two people who presumably are the closest to one another on earth a shared us t ad that promotes understanding and bolsters a s else of agency and gratitude and posters the generative drive that is great for both people when they are not in the us when one goes one way and one goes the other because that happens all the time in relationships too righter beg to work at different places or we most are ourselves outside of relationships if we see what the magic bridge other relationship can be we we can look there for problems why am i anxious why are you anxious why are we anxious why you only anxious e were we and not we can look for all that and we should i but we can also even more powerfully look for the good there how can our shared bond whatever it may be be better for both of us and what stronger incentive could there be than to do that in relationships right romantic relationships the ones that are closest us if they are not romantic they could be french whatever or closest relationships are through the most important vehicles to speak to better health and happiness to get into that place of peace and contentment and delight right the us is very very powerful in fact even more more powerful than the i and h you when thinking about the us and trying to understand why somebody that we know and are in relationship with is behaving the way they are or might be feeling or claiming they feel the way that they are how useful do you think it is for us to put ourselves in their shoes i can't think of all sorts of ways in which this could be beneficial i can also of all sorts of ways in which it would be focussing off the self an our own experience in ways that might be defensive of voidance or deny all right the it'll come clean timing there been plenty of times in relationship where i get fixated on why some one is the way they are behaved the way they did and more often than not by ticking a setback and thinking about why my reaction to that is the way it is i do not solve the got problem but i get a lot further along in terms of ism quelling my own anxiety and finding a path forward right right right well centralization which is the ability to discern feeling states intention states in self and others bet you what we are looking for others right the ability to understand feeling states what is going on inside of you intention what are your intentions right that should only be good right because because if we are seeing it through a clear lends meaning a lends that is not based by some problem a defense mechanism of rationalization for example or projection right if we are seen clearly we are learning about the other i and the learning is is never bad right knowledge truth is good if we learn about the other by and that sense putting ourselves in their shoes then we gain information but it is the health in us that that it is crucial to what we do with that information right one person it is a put put themselves in the other persons shoes and and things it look i that pars i can see the person responding in is sassy pretty calm an pretty calm about something it maybe that is just a good thing may be there some intention going on and that persons maintaining they are cool and that persons can be really helpful in navigating an argument or disagreement to some some really positive and point right if a person sees clearly i see i look i see that you can see that you are calm and i also see that your you are transfigure things out and the thingsthat you're saying or positive you are disagreeing with me but bell you do not seem to mean ill right then i can see you know what i think you are calm is good right because ism getting a little bit upset and you are not you you and i see that there is a benevolence in you maybe you'll guide us to the place that maybe i cannot right but but think about if there is not a clear lends inside of me right if i have i defense system that leads me to externalize responsibility that leaves me to project there leave me do also to things that are not healthy now i might think while your calm because you use do not care about me right i means tho thing of the same exact thing right now in the example were giving the person in your position is being really benign and benevolent but it happens all the time where that is misconstrued it is not that is not that the insight that person is calm i sextet or calm it is that there is a definite in the centralization the person's not fully understanding their intention right that is coming through then gets distorted right something about defense mechanisms they can be they can be clearer they can let light through in this beautiful way that has fidelity ere they can be very distorting that the thought if ism discerning that you are benevolent and you you seem to be trying to solve the problem for us but i take in and house do not care about me in your trying to put one over on me if if have assisted accurately but that but it comes on the other end in a way that is change right that is because there is a lack of clarity there is distortion inside of me right then if ism really working on myself ism in the best place i can be ism going to be better at tantalizing about you and me right even if i say what we are having a disagreement i i know i tend to get a little defensive song an be a little bias to see what is in you in a it can a negative way rights what a my seeing i go a you are pretty calm maybe you do not care now i i know i can think that right but i on your trying and when i some our problem i conmagine when that goes on inside of a person which sometimes goes on consciously or goes on unconsciously or some mixture it is powerful right the persons were of their own state which helps them to beware the state of the others the other and then the information they are getting comes through with fidelity and now all of a sudden instead of may be hogan to blow things up now malting with you in solving our problem because i see clearly about you and me and that is going on all the time it might well it is complicated ha lot o back and forth right they're millions of things going on every said second in our unconscious mind that is throwing all this up to the conscious mind it is doing things rapidly that is going on all the time in us whether we want to acknowledge it or not and we we choose not to acknowledge it at our own peril because then we are not going to those to pillars and their ten cupboards we are not going to the structure of self the function of self and what comprises those two pillars to look for what is going on right we me understand better and even if things are going well the can always as youyou said not that long ago we can understand ourselves better the stronger i am the more generative drive there is in me the less defensiveness the more the agency in the gratitude the more unarmed for et whatever difficult thing comes my way if there is a conflict with someone whether there should be or there should not be maybe some one's being really aggressive and i gat a con to say some things and try encounter that right i can be able to discern one from another ism long to be more effective in both right i just set myself up for success and if ism setting me up for success than ism also setting you up for success if you are some one i have a relationship with no matter what it is and then ultimately ism setting the we right ththethe magical bridge of us ism setting that up for success too and that is how you see and these levels of emergence that on if you understand everything about you and understand everything about me and and let us say person understands we have a generative drive you do not really know what our relationship is going to be let to you think i best can be a good one right and then what would we then than contribute say to a broader culture a group of people panthers is ten people bunch of friends getting together we would contribute goodness at that next level which is then the culture of the larger group in hearing your description of centralization miss ability for all of us to get into the mind of another an n to i trying toimagin motivations and states that would explain the another right it an o myself under yet that seems a natural reflex that is that is healthy and it seems to surface most often in em as the consequence of negative interactions right on something did not go right in we can of explorer was not them was at me was at something that happened before you know what else is going on with this person as a way to try and arrive at some sort of safely generative understanding but it seems to me there is also great value in entailing about others under conditions on which things are going well that one can potentially makethings or encourage things to go even better in future interactions with a first thing i was is i think the reflex is most often not tantalizing that the reflex is most often not tantalizing right because the reflex is often come from a position of not feeling safe right there is some conflict i do not i don't do not feel good right to some conflict people and we ought not get very defensive very quickly whether we show it on the outside or we start partitioning inside and that the problems come not from tantalizing but they come from not tantalizing right an and not being aware the difference was then i conclude i know it is going on in you and i do not right because i do not know what is going on in me right i think you are being aggressive really ism feeling kind of defensive on feeling vocable and then ism ism getting aggressive right but i cannot handle thatbecause i do not wan to be aggressive progressive right there is such a difference between say coming at a self other conflict from the perspective of say not entailing but thinking that you are verse is tantalizing there is a difference between is it me i know it cannot be is it you it must be right and that is how a lot of that goes and then of course what is the date that is gathered the date that is gathered supports that a a think that as wars i think of happened or was upon this little conflicts an friendships and in relationships the key about tantalizing is that is not what it is tantalizing it goes this is it me is it you is it us how us to get at out let us figure it out together right it is it is not it is not defensive it is not aggressive it is not projecting it is it is it is really actually seeing and what if it is me i want to be aware of it and say yallicke wo i get up on the wrong side of the belly look in ma just i am sorry right or if i might we hat i know that you are being aggressive and it normally would not be on silicle con me just get away from is it let the bet the person i care about come down come back later or if it is us is really something between us and lets sorted outline the information that allows the healthy right the agency and gratitude decisions is always there through tantalizing the danger is when we are not tantalizing but we think we are got it in keeping with thinking about others and what is going on with them tantalizing that is anything about what is going on with ourselves and the exploration of the cupboards under the pillars of structure of self function of self and our desire for all that to guise up into agency and gratitude one thing that we hear about much these days and generally i think it is good that people are talking about them are boundaries i you have cross my boundary or i am setting boundary and a have certainly a imbedded the the message in my head that in order for certain relationships to be at their most loving in my life sometimes the boundaries require very little frequency of communication but that does not mean the relationships are not on going a what are your thoughts on boundaries and how should we think about boundaries for sake of healthy relationships healthy boundaries always start inside and then once we have them squared away inside we can project them outward i the same as is everything works right it starts with the serve and then it includes the other let say you took an example of a friend who is just a little too presumptuous right the kind of person you would rather knock on your door but who just opens the door and comes in that that that kind of think and you the persona to and there is a lot of residence and yo not a lose the friendship and then less imagine what could happen here it is not the only thing that can happen but a a a thought experiment right the person made them question themselves is there is something wrong with me use i do not w this person coming in my front door is is that just me and mi being feared about that or o the person kind of stop and think about that and they can take stock myself and they can arrive at an answer right for themselves look that person may conclude that young what people om as close to as this person come in my front door at that is one right i it i doing to set a boundary there right is that is possible right more often what the person concludes is no i do not really want that i i do out she want this person to knock a list an that is of not something wrong with me it is not that on being a her is something being a bad friend right cause what i they saying you might other preparing for what the other person could say bueno the they countering what there testing out to themselves that mean him a bad friend no right that that kind of thinks hay they known and they understand and then they an thyme the right to set the boundary right look it is my house i try and be generous but i said wont people coming in the door you come to some conclusion that setting the boundary is of and you are squared away with it inside then you communicate the boundary outward right and you sit how do i want to communicate that saying hymen do not come in the front door any more that is not good right now the friendship is really on the rocks right but to say to some one something i i i care about you and i trust you and i know you feel the same way about me but just makes me nervous young people just come in the door do you mind the as it relic if you please not knock on the door now thing how that is been done it is accurate right to what is going on inside the person to how the person wants to communicate with the other then you have the highest likelihood of effectiveness right and the person also in that sense has sort of he clean conscience it to speak that lets them take an information back let us say the other person hopefully has a high journalize drive and all the good things we are talking about could say oh no ism sorry i didn't a idea mean to make you feel uncomfortable i kinds automatically do that or you i always do that my brother's house and is close by or whatever the person is saying no worries coquet everything is fine right but let us say that person does get mad right now i oh it is going on in this person right is that i nowt what your doing as you seeing signs of unhealthy in the the person and it maybe that wo that is not healthy with the person but i other aspects of the friendship and that seems kind of strange to syncrasy then you might decide t i want to keep this friendships start locking the door the person has to knock or you might think coquets this is at my seeing something here that is about lack of consideration right it is about selfishness that altematly maybe bad envy i can walk into your house and ruin your privacy wen i can walk jets to make you feel anxious i i feel entitled to do like looks a kind of thing this will coming through the lends of envy ten you start thinking about that and and maybe not always of course sometimes you find a friend who can do the right thing sometimes you find a friend who cannot and you can still make the friendship work sometimes you find a person who is not a friend right and you see that is how everything is with this person you now is there is no us there is no us right and and that is that is how people can leave relationships that that estimably are exploitive in one way or another weather it is a friendship it is a romance the if a person really understands there is me to you the magical bridge of us and then wait there is no magical bridge of us i feel that there's a magical bridge of us but the other per and does it there is immense power of understanding and then of appropriate self care and self protection over and over again not just strange to day's episode but in the previous two episodes it seems that getting squared away with oneself or at least one's own internal processes to some degree right gaining some inside as to were the negative or even positive emotion within us is arising when we are in relationship to any one or anything it is seems key s think the foundation of it yet you do not youyou said your getting to the maximum amount of agency and gratitude is the goal really and that is done by cycling back through the cupboards that reside under structure of self and function of self and asking questions about oneself and and really unless we are train psychiatrist you none of us really should be doing that for the other person it seems or this it is really our each and all of our own responsibility to do for ourselves but that it serves others in many positive ways right right t centralization greece is the progress of all things good right because it is about actual understanding feeling states intentions but i have to first metalize about me before i mental about you away of putting this would be if ism thinking about you before ism thinking about me among fools errand i you have to start with himself and to try and attain clarity myself or to realize that you cannot rightly that that it is its a very important new once if i know that say there is drama in me about a certain thing and i know that i responding ways ere sometimes my motions get high and i cannot quite ye i cannot quite think through it all right which can happen to me with with references or or something that is encompassing a certain kind of drama i want to be aware of that rice to is it idea of not only being aware of what about yourself but being aware that their things you do not know about yourself if i know enough to know that a certain kind of interaction about a certain kind of drama really sets me to place where ism not able to metalize i i normally would be right of a absurd of flying blind right then good for me to know that because i do not know what that is doing to me is the last time to make conclusion let us say ism in that state let us him in that state because of something that just happened right and now we have some sort of conflict right than for me to realize that what was going on to me ism bringing to this a lack of clarity because ism it's really activated ri'venessince the anxiety the tension in me has been raised in the negative emotion that reflective negative affect feeling emotion has been raised in me and then i realize i do not know house can ago if we interact about it now because i cannot rely on me can we talk about this later the same way if you recognize the other that person whose usually rationals i was all worked up recognize that any other right and may that person does not realize that they still on to interact any say can we let us lies revisit this n we both kind of cocoon and collected it centralization greases the wheels of all progress but anything else has to be deployed in in a way that works and the way that works is i start with me and i go to you and then i go to us ism fully on board the start with me then to the other and then to us model it makes total sense of fact much that ism string you build an image of my mind where first is a kind of a rule which has it you now it starts with self understanding and thoughtful structure at inquiry along the lines of the map that was laid out an episodes one in to of the series an that we have been alluding to numerous times to day ness and then there is a second line or or or r use that have got written on this imaginary piece of paper in my mind were any time i default to thinking about another without first going to my own map and exploring what is going on with me that my own map starts to become blurry unloving access to it in it potentially could disappear ism just creating this in my own mind as a way to ism crate a little bit if i think how rings i i li then i i really go there first paints the picture yes and that the purpose in having such at a an image in my mind that access to the self and understanding a self's potential drifting way is because i for me there is a third line in the rule rule set that ism imagining which is that the less understanding we have of our own map and internal process the more likely i am where we all are to just latch on to an unhealthy map another unhealthy map yes have to eve t all the directions of our own unhealthy map right which leads us to someone else is on healthy map and then we latch on to it you said yet absolutely yes now that is i because it is still active even of its blurry or if it is obscured from my awareness and a drifting away i am try to guide myself with my broken compass i run into some one else with a broken compass now we are both wandering right be aware if the compass is not working the way we wanted to can we go look at that can we can we make the map healthy make the map accurate make the map guide us towards what we want because then we will find other people who have worked on their own maps that way absolutely at you known often i hereabout and frankly have experience that this feeling oh it is just a matter of finding somebody who is healthy right and then things will be much easier and much better and surely that has to be the case and surely there have to be instances where people have a interaction with somebody that leads to a relationship with somebody and the other person is much healthier and and whatever drama we come to the relationship with is best supported or better supported than it would be if we were with somebody exploitive or who is a truly damaged at it in some way who basely had a map this really unless he screwed up but that they had not explored needle ours or they ne a lot door i do not see that very often i detallan see people who at least from my outside read seem to have healthy maps or or doing regular exploration of their maps and there for healthy who knows i do not know what they do with their with their time in every domain life but once again we come back to this importance of understanding what is in those cupboards what is in those pillars as a not just important it critical step in understanding and building ourselves in positive ways and as i said once or twice before in the series but am going to say it again and ism sure again and again before we conclude the series is that what attractive about this map is that it it sets a very clear and simple set of ideals not as surly simple to attain and as you said it takes time but agency has that is gratitude empowerment humility leading up to peace contentment and delight all as action states not as passive states to just basin and you known and disappear and this notion of the the generative drive and and by now and in this episode ism sure people are well on board the understanding that the generative drive is not just about going out an doing things it is about doing things in service to in an a way that supports learning knowing creating not just of others and in the world but incus yes i i love i love the the map i mini because you can almost see the map changing y as the person i imagine the person is busying away in the cupboards there is a lot to work on in this cupboard in they're busing away in they're doing the work and we can see the map changing that path that look a really good path actually goes through a swamp wan see the swamp on the mat now it appears on the map that other path that look as a little circuitous has a good path right may be a harder path that is a little circuitous but look where it leads i the map becomes clear as we do the work on ourselves yes and also the understanding that you have laid out for fussier really helps avoid a lot of the common pitfalls that are associated with your sticky language and sticky for good reason i mean what stickier and more interesting for people that are interested in themselves in relationship than things boundaries or or labels anxious attach or secure attach and ism not being disparaging of those labels but ism realizing those are just labels right that they do not define action items and specific lines of inquiry to get us back in to ourself understanding over and over not as a full time job right we all have to live our lives but as a way actually to be more leaned into life in the outside old that those labels defend people no better than the numerical diagnoses an the psychiatric taxonomy book that we glorify labels are not understanding numbers are not understanding they can help taxonomies are good sometimes labels let us categorize things but labels are not a substitute for understanding numbers are not a substitute for understanding if we look at ourselves we get real understanding and that is what makes the difference that is what bolsters agency gratitude all those good things clear centralization greasing wills of progress more the generative drive getting stronger we really can find goodness and often do and n that is why i think everything we are talking bat is very hopeful et it acknowledges there is complexity their pitfalls right there all sorts of things to it that wet to be aware of and to beware of but that does not mean that ultimately it is not positive that we are not speaking to whatever it is hailing you that thing can be better ism grateful that your sharing your knowledge and experience surround all o this with us and that you have laid out said oh clear and logical and

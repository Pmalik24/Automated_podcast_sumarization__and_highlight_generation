america life a mini glass i show to day in three acts three very dramatic as actually starting lets us get rest to it starting with this one from jack hit his a t is got an epic novel with pot twists and unforeseen danger and bazaar coincidences and unlikely heroes and even more unlikely bad guys here is jack during new york city's great crime wave of the nineteen eighties getting an apartment was simple all you had to do was commit a crime we we had heard from a friend of a friend that if we went down and gave key money that is to say one month's rent going fee a two this superintendent that is to say bob ah that we would be able to get an apartment this is my friend cabin he and i got our apartments in the same building on ninety night street and the early eights by bribing the same superintendent a got name bob these were old beat up flags the screaming radiators and war floors and exposed pipes a city engineer once inspected the building and declared that it was six stories of dust held up by a hundred years of paint these were our first new york apartments we were there to start our lives new york was all romance and everything was outsize and outrages the buildings in the town our ambition the night light and as we quickly discovered our super bob all sorts of things about him were truly spectacular for example the way he repaired our apartments here is chis another tenant in the building after we got burglaries bob put in safety gats for the fire escape which key well did that nobody could get in but you could not get out in a fire it was nobody o them he told us the they wereininstalling sliding revolving doors which we got he never explained what those were but i do remember i thinking to myself how can he say there sliding revolving doors but he said it was such a totally street face bob's work habits were a thing of wonder i remember one time bob showed up with his assistant an generally talented guy name smiley mi sink was backed up and bob started pouring this heavy black liquid from a gallant jug into the standing water smithy started backing up and with experiences my guide i started backing up too one cup said yelled just one cup shut up bob explained and he emptied the entire jag into the water there were nasty rumblings hot chemical reactions were happening somewhere in the walls i was very scared and suddenly the doors below the sankwuere kept my cleaning stuff they blew open with an explosion and this unspeakable oily sledge poured out across the kitchen floor bob was much more than just a bad handy man very early on i began to perceive bob's talents as e fabulist ah it was no really painful to go down and pay the rent every he to give it to him which meant you had to stand there and listened to ten fifteen twenty minutes of completely insane stories ah a big running theme was bob's importance in the world in general and particularly in brazil i deaf remember his cattleman stories this is and another tenant during those early days and now married to chis he had seven cattleradches four cattle ranches he owned in brazil and he seven vineyards he had not italy it might have been seven cattle ranches in brazil and four vineyards in italy if if you actually took him if after he left the room he thought about what he said you think why is he living here because he s skin ow li basically a cane ye oi e village people which doesn't welcome him he claimed that there was a a class in the constitution of brazil that ah gave him immunity from any any prosecution whatsoever and that fact he could he could as he put it a go in kill thy president of the percent estate and he would still be immune from sou of course bob been bob had an explanation for how he went from being a south america cattle barren to a new york city super he had had two hard attacks ah and his doctor had had had this is an actionfol an actual stor is doctor had proscribed that he i gain a lot of weight and and and moved to america probably the first time medical history that that that enormous waking was prescribed for a hear condition in his own way bob united the building all of us the elderly black business man the porter pecan grandmother the handsome bomb immigrant me the southerner exile we all had our favored bob stories we all did our own impersonations of bob it was impossible not to try to out bob whoever was talking with an even more outlandish bob story of your own we collected in traded bob stories comparing versions analyzing his technique he was remarkably unease by any show of skepticism o hes story ah there was the story you how a he had once hung a bag a acid from the roof of the building to chase away the various honest men who would and in those stay often common and now congregate by the by the edge but a corner of his building on the bob its poly hung a bag of acid from the to that dripped down settling on i have no idea how you hang a back o fast how you get the acid in the bag and but at up there ah that is a that no no small feat in itself but of course the best parties bob is telling us this story at the very same time that you could lean out of the office where hes talking and see the three or four homesguies sitting sitting on the corner anyway apparently comquictly unscarred or bothered by dripping acid the other story that have always found really captured just late all of bobs scene for me as when am ut every kitchen in this building has these funny circular florescent bulb's very a specialized light bulbs they are also in the hallways ain on the first floor and mine after ten years of noble service only burnt out and i looked at it my thou u where do you buy one of those side trotted on down to bob's office one morning and i said bob the light bulb in my kitchen as burned out and ism just wondering do do i buy that and replace it in if slower you by them or ordeal just replace that for me and of course he went into this total bob tar his i yes that is right you lime take something mister do not tried to steal one of the late bulbs in the holly i know what you are thinking but have boogie trapped them and if you climb up there and you try to take the big cubit will blow up and shoot the glass in your eyes and you will be blind for all time yea where is than i the that demean that i have to by the bullyself the very opposite of bob was allay the landlord if bob was larger than life allay was smack in the metal the average percentile he had a family he lived in white plans ad met his wife doing business with a was completely routine experience if it was a tole it to be fixed you'd make sure the crew got there on time and got down even in our biggest blow out he was always reasonable civilly than one time things get old test when allay started neglecting the old porter recon folks in the building i become friendly with one grandmother who showed me her tub full of green stagnant bathwater allay and i had some tense words and i and some others e and held meetings to start a rent strike but in the end allay gracefully withdrew and we all went back to normal business back to bob the inscrutable endless mystery that was to fast forward to nineteen eighty nine had been in my apartment eight years i had to steady job and i was walking to work one morning somewhere along the way i saw the daily news blaring the latest tabloid crime story headline terror landlord i look closer and realized it was allay my allay the landlord the nice my whose kids i knew the story was incredible he had been arrested for murder firing hidden to kill his brother in law rather cats in nineteen eighty and as the story got out it quickly became clear that bob was the one who would rate allay out allay was found guilty and sent once to twenty five years to life in prison where he remains to day more time pass i got into apartment in the west village then i got married had children and later moved to another state where allay bob became memories proof that i had lived in new york back wen crack was king and the moderates top two thousand a year in the late nineties almost to decade after had last seen bother allay i was working on an investigated piece about money laundering and a source at the treasure department a suggest that i called this really smart prosecutor in new york named john mascot i rang him up and started just yack in the way you do i asked him if he would handled financial crime glad and he was quick to say that he would worked homicide new york back in the eighties during the crime way end crack was king and the murdered top two thousand a year yet i said i lived there too i told him i was acting involved to one of those table stories mine involving a landlord and hired contract killers to murder's brother in law and then gets ratted out by the super there was a peculiar pass on the found than mascot said allay stern lest ninety ninth street om the god who put him behind bars right away of course we started talking about bob i told him the lightbulb story mascot had a good laugh and then i went on and the way we residence of ninety nine street can do and finally got to the one about bob claiming that he had a special exemption from the brazilin constitution and could murder any one in brazil again there was that odd mascot pass and then he said yes the thing is that on kind of true i asked him oh well you were in the military what were you were you assigned of the military police here is john mascot describing bob's testimony on the witness stand and what was your job my job was to locate interrogate n next cute politically unreliable persons get out of year o bob had been in the death squat in brazil and he was asked do you kill any people there yes more than one yes was more than bi i do not know out he mean you do not know well if you shoot somebody at long range in the go down you do not know the deter it comes the point when you realize that beneath all the fanciful stories that usually is he substantial mat of truth he said he came north for his hell and perhaps to protect his heart the was thinking that high impact led poisoning apparently a number o and he was in his twenties when he was in the dethsquad and he realized at one point that substantial number of people in his squad were dead a violent causes which would be consistent either with there being suicide and the risks they took or boy with somebody having a list of the names where they were located some one whose relatives had been this handle he decided that leaving was good for his health anal those crazy bob stories we swab for years who would have thought that the truth about bob would be just as crazy the cording to mascot not only had bob been in a squad but he had been a see figure in the murder of all's brother in law bob was crucial and securing the talents of the two hidden named mammy feet an crazy job and according to the court documents bob was in the boiler room with some of his crew when news of the hit came down they celebrated with martian rosy and things really got going when a portable radio just happened to felt out that queen song the one an n on to the death an on on no on bat the defeat the hit was just one of numerous crimes brilliant crimes really that bob and fallen pulled off from that little office the turns out that when it comes to crime bob was incredibly confident he and alien set up dumb construction companies they defrauded the state with counterfeit charges to force out one tenant they rewired the electrical outlets to high voltage lines to fry all the apartment appliances my favorite was their natural scam they put fat cones out on the street and actually jack hammered through the assault to a working gasman they buy passed the meters and in time eliminated more than eight hundred thous and bowers of alien's gasps on top of all this bob help the prosecution snare fallen bob tapped alien's phones bob wore a wire and in court transcripts allay commonly ways the relative merits of buying off some people first as having them killed and this is what really comes across when you talk to mascot just how wrong all of us were at sizing up bob and fallen when we had twenty two hundred homicides in new york as supposed to fewer than five hundred what were on for this year you had a lot of people talking about killing people there was a certain rationality and cold bloodiness about this murder that was just plain different i just bob testified under oath at trial i watched him when he was being cross examined and i something ill ever forget defense council asked him ti you torture men or women and he said my specialty was men and the way he said it my bloodiest that ten degrees colder and there was just absolute on the the court room everyone was persuaded that he meant how did bob former brazilin squat officer rat out fallen bob think o old tips to report the murder tips right we the one eight undrednumber what the local crime reporting it seven tips soever yet he he calls that and then he goes and make makes an appointment and meets wit the major case squad what but drove him to turn allay in allay and his family had discussed selling the building and moving to florid and in the course of that allay ad discussed having the president in the vice president of the tenant's association murdered and bob figured that allay was going to have these two guides walked and bland bob what year s is this was nineteen eighty eight i only only bring ten tough because them there was a there was an at one point there was ay a rent strike that was going to be put together in my building and i was the tenant leader of that i mean was that the men problem that allay was a upset about was thous another restring allay might have actually tried to get me walked ultimately bob when into the police station and admitted his own role in a murder and thought he was going to prison because his perception at the time was that allay would cause these murders to take place and he protected himself by writing plan at first bob turning states evidence basically save my life or the life of lieutenant organizers that was bistort mom m i found bob i reached him on the phone and we had a nice chat he remembers me as the tall blowgun on the first for he wanted to talk to me for the story but his lawyer told him not to day forever and then bob suggested that i not bother to call back i wanted to ask him about the cattle ranches and being written into the constitution and give those stories a fresh lesson knowing what i know now and of course i wanted to know whether i was the one who was going to get wack i was not the only tenant organizer in the building at the time but it'll never get that answer now all i have as another bob story full of details i cannot confirm but delicious that i cannot wait to go back to my one bowels and tell it to them this is the one of the lawyers talking to bob during the trial when you began your testimony on direct yesterday you told us about your military experience in brazil bloc tor christen man live in queens now i read to them the court transcripts that john mascot had told me about i was it more than ten more phantom o it it is on did you torture both men and women my specialty was men wholly i o scalene i this is the testimony young this is in i me it is under oath i you have taken it to a whole new level so oh i know does make you go to go back and rethink the whole pattern o exchanges you had with him i never coming like i never said to myself the some reality to who disguise says he is i mean i used to get furious to him but to think oh i was talking to i a murdering torturer family ting with us yet now it is its different level of toy no you instead of just being some mask it is he is a professional i i feel ism sitting your maze now that we went start sire are always a logically tortured b i mean we this this good one been very horrible story or to supers looking much it does not surprise me in away again here is cabin i man it sike e don talk i to but the finality of evil he strikes me as on these no one these pecan am time characters who who would a in certain contacts to completely awful disgusting things and then if remove from them in putting the some more peaceful you no banal surrounding would a settled back in toupee a windy ya a windy superintending the of a building he am it we was in of interesting that after this was all over after he d testified in plan was put away am of course plans a daughters i believe then on the buildings of course bob lost his his free apartment in his a his superior position and et was almost he kind of deflected e nobody had to talk to him any more he would walk around it wasalmost pathetic he would walk up down the block and say high and people would you don't just coming go by not to him go by a and and then after a short time after this he just was not around any more he was gone an at si and am no idea re went to where is he anyway that you find out an o at he is an elevator inspector in the your city a ago god ere all in trouble now n found allay also at his web side plan stern out tat he is been appealing his conviction for over fifteen years he makes the case that he is innocent his argument is at the entire story of mammy feet and crazy job and the explanation of the brother in law's murder and all the rest of it is her say a grandiose fiction in other words plan is saying he can top us all that he is the victim a the most outlandish bob story ever to jack he ad en nawlivs in new haven in a house where he is his own super he is out of the to hose to the nobody a word when hin podcast uncivil if you've not heard it seriously give it to try his frankly defending a new podcast it is been many years since we first reported this story an twenty fourteen allay stern which reach from prison bob as far as we can tell is no longer an elevator inspector for the city of new york john mascot as now practicing criminal law in man hate coming out a superbest a crash that is in a minute from chico baba radio when our programmed continues is america life mir go ass he took an a pregomichos a theme bring you a variety if different kinds of stories on that theme todaysho the super we have arrived at tat too of our shell at too superduper we now move from a story about an east just super to a stray bout westcut super from alit slumber josh lives in a punish courtyard building in loss angels a city in which even apartment buildings act the tantivy the slimy melons place lot of kind of communal activity and sort of presiding above it is the super is not really a super you would have in may be a larger building or a larger city it is he is a a larger said of these alike i i guess lie well i can at a dense even that he is whatever to say am but is tho he does not have a tool bed and show up in fixed things but hell sort of call the guy who does that and he takes the rant and and a he is kind of a solitary guy for the most part he sees sort of lines to spend on time reading himself he just come hangs out up there in the building fashion the rest of the tenants in the building liked their super who will call have hung out with him tat the time of this story have was going through hemotherapy for leukemia an occasionally he would called different residents to ask for help what things when christian he contacted josh he calls an he says a this really feared thing happened and am i i came over to his apartment he had am this orchid that was sitting on the table next to him and he said well i had this i had this visitor and am it was a very strange visit and he started to tell me that a couple months ago an between in between kematherpy treatments he would had two kamotheraby treatments and he was out somewhere and he was in his bland cruiser i thing he has and he was at this gas station and he sees this woman a pulls up in a big black escalade and a she is on the opposite side of the pumps is him she was an older woman but he said very elegant and a attractive in the elegant older womanly and she had fancy clothes and furs and i think she he mentioned that she had espedrils on and a am and she was and she was in this black escalate she would seem to be classy or something a or well off and there standing the at the pumps and they start chatting she initiates a conversation with him and their getting on very well and then told me that she said something about him being bald which was from the chemotherapy and she said are you baled from the memo therapy a or are you just bawled because you think it sexy something that and am here was not offended by that he thought it was it was kind of this a romantic repartee or something and am and the she gives him a card and the card was sort of an old style card de visit that just had her name it was not a business card that had a company or information on it it was just sort of a calling card that you used to leave at the door of count vronsky's estate he stop by or something and a he remembered thinking that that was kind of a a a classy touch and and didos a very mysterious and then he gave her a his information and they party ways until christian two months after their first meeting at the as station when the mysterious lady called out of the blue she asked how have was and he told her about his recent health problems an infection from the hemotherapy had turned serious and he would spent a couple of weeks in a hospital and your coma that is terrible the lady said is there anything can do can i come by an visit have said yes and she woulderived that morning dressed in the same elegant manner as at the gas station bearing the or et which have now had in this table and they sat in chat it somehow the topic of fate came up and that was the point what she said i know this is kind of weird time but i actually have something i wanted to share with you and he says what is that and she says that she was abroad with a this group of investors who had developed this really interesting investment opportunity and she says i know that this is a weird time but i i this is very exciting i feel i should just let you in on this investment opportunity right now she was you knows will surprise than but he said out all right what we know what is the investment opportunity and the and she said well have on involves with this very canny group of investors and it seems that they have located this snow man that can bench press four hundred pounds we yes i said i then ism asking o ka with the well what do you mean it what in have a nowt is hardly exactly bigger out what the proper poll of question is cause it s the said will a what it is it is the abominable snowman is now o now she said its of tolly normal snow man wat it carpet now and that call for the high sand ta an a top hat everything it is just that the snow man can bench press four hundred pounds and then but i ism saying will w in but what what is the what is the ness opportune is the running ahead on for what ism in ununderstan and they said no see what happened is the investors they have got all worked out they they a they are going to put together variety show with the snow man has the lead fact and then they are going to take the snow man show on tour and the investment opportunity is the geographic territorial rights to the show a sow it when the show goes to different states you you get to reap to rewards if you have bought in to the to the rights to the show the woman said that she had already she got in on the ground floor with this thing he and she got californium and neat i the west he said that the united states was all snapped out but now indonesia is wide open and for we the variety show snaring the wait left things snowman the way lifting snow man ye the price for indonesia territorial rights to the to the show at to the snow man show we are not cheap it was thirty thousand dollars or something lot but i do not understand that was thine if you actually discovered a snow man that had somehow become animated it seems the last sort of thing that you do is then just i tor variety shwa know what right i was what was asking i said will listen way hold on a second is not there going to be there is be lot more important things happening than publicity for your variety show it was the whole world is going to change science will have to readjust everything it is sever own all the various theologians of the hooligan have to deal with the news animated snow man worlds right it'd have to really sort o lost things out just even the basic questions who did the snow man roll himself up in three balls and find to carrot knows and how do the investors find the snowman that is the other thing that i was ribs celli whet they driving round the woods and they just saw this snowman lifting logs and they the high find each other in said all right were center variety show they are in a in a caravan o blacks of turbans with their cigars we we d d it the weird thing was even though have found the story of a weight lifting so man just as preposterous as joshdit he seems somehow persuaded by this mysterious woman he said was hard to explain but he felt he would knower his entire life and he looked at differently now anyway he said something about how after when you get cancer or something that a serious illness you just start to reevaluate things you a what might have seemed risky beforehand a is not now and meou said i minded just felt ah maybe there was a reason to take a risk maybe there is a reason i met the women of the shell station and maybe this is a kind of a risk to take and then that spastically when he said i wrote er check for thirty thousand dollars on milk it what did you think i was alarmed and i was worried that it was a come and obviously it am but i kind actually was a little bit convinced by his whole theory thinking maybe maybe is not bad right thinking in a danger i sort of his money and right if that is how he is going to you know sort of embrace the life after cancer then i to say a i kind of felt i i had to accept that over the next year jock told the weight lifting snowman story to everybody he could he loved it and his audiences seemed to love it too at one point he decided with date's consent to write it up for magazine humor section the final step in publishing it was to have it fact checked and the magazine called have he called me and said the the magazines fact checkers called and a i told them what i ha what i best about to tell you which is that i actually made that whole story up and twas no lady with the card hard to visit or espidrils prefers of the snow and did you ask him why he just thought that it would be a story that would amuse me and he was absolutely car i guess he had no idea how successfully the story was going to appeal to me and i man i kind foot it i may i the i did you live to be me know in your middle ages and you've con and never took any risks and and things get tolly the prospective refocuses ah in such a way that weight lifting snow man it makes as much sense as anything else i don't it you cannot it that that that he created a world in which it made sense to spend thirty thousand dollars i waiting on eating sone ye y in in in were since you were the con ye that was that me know was it was a double reverse reveal at the end of some move were i would have been writing some check for a million dollars at the end right beaus somehow i got sucked into the whole thing been i it to you wanted o bad i think part of what i love about it an maybe you you too as is just through the image that there of the snow man this stick armed carretnis snow man actually just lying on a not a on a on a weight bench in the middle of the sierran mud well also bench pressing and particular is you requires a bench i still t understand if they that say they found the snowman in the woods then did he have his own bench was it made out of snow i is you he was not doing squats ousplimber pocking with jashbearman hes gs out foe spot casting company him with media the home of reply all an have he a in nod an many f the so as jock has been a regular contributor to our so and these daisies proud from now apple tide serious little america which comes out next month can hunter was the super who made up that story about no man and who had real town for telling outrageous and ridiculous stories i there's no hes hid say this he died a few years ago i then please release me that is release me we change the names of the people in the story to protect the tenants in solved sometimes somebody tells you your future and you do not one to believe it you cannot believe it when tennis was twenty one he became the super of this apartment buying that his dad on he big hundred unitbuilding in what was once a rough neighborhood and his dad gave him this warning father is on super to super about the tenants they will make a good person bad you will maybe you

a lot of things man to man tennis mean while was just out o college his dad it script and sacrifice to put in through catholic schools all the way from elementary up to his undergraduate degree his mam it is parangs was split up his mama always been a about catholic communion every day and all that step the the results taught venison school about being a good person he took it to heart you do not want of the things go to the ledger universities as they want you to be better wit et for others you soft not that everything i did i tried to you do not live up to that high s standarcause i know i i could not but the was thatlay the back of my head which brings us to our story at first the superior went great people tennis e got christian cards and families in the building but there's this one couple the liven the building from us twenty years since back when his dad firs bought the place there were long turn sent they were good tenants there were nice people you only be getting those i was not too much bad you could say about him an you dak them yet a dead o her he live below them e shall he them literally live right below you are freshfrom your high school i live with my father a that i live belong too for yer and i saw them and they knew who i was i me and even before that ben before high school in olwewer little is would be run around playing in the courtyard hang from the trees but yet i me let the ere they were regular picture but everything for this couple changed when they're daughter time the woman critter job go to school the you are all other savings into that but ye had trouble with the classes could make the gray n things just kept coming down hill from there she started drinking they got behind onontheir man you's she drop off a check to me and then i a day later or two days later she would call me and say a end you deposed that chaetnows like knowing him do poset well could you her up that check and let me it'll give you another check you know forget about that check and then you always turn of that check as shed bring down lar check in then in that check would bods and do i you li think they got like maybe four thousand dollars in the whole i was they were they were behind four thousand hours an six months six months yet they would ben to half your yet wow yen ye is as yon dad we i kick the people to and i i get rid of hem and you madam was very reluctant to do that he was work with work bout working it him now why all he knew that her husband had a good job and he knew that that they had money come at in and that that you could get money out of a basically i was i did not realize i ask it becomes test of you the problem was not tam cause they have got them to a the problem is you yes i behind yes o it is how good are you at tennis wanted to do right by his dad he wanted to do a good job remember he had never had a job before i he was still living with his mob and now he was in charge of his dad's business what he came to this couple he was just smiling around he was not exactly sure how to get money out of them but he decided he was on to do it and he remembered his yes would teachers you now i thought myself u it was not my job to you to eases people through this or get them through it but i know that if i was in that situation if i was down on my luck that i would want somebody to cut me that break her cot me that slap he sat down and he created a payment plan for them if you indeed books every pay check but he was incredibly hard to make them stick to it the had excuses they could not do it he sat them down again and he made hip can agreement and this time they put it in writing and then after month upon month of struggle i took over a year they finally paid it all back you knot done things were o came for a while but slowly but surely started falling back into their own ways and basely what i think it was was on the aldol basically i remember vividly that she would come down to the long

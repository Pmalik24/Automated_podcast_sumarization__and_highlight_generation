a quick warning there are curse words that are on beeped today's episode of the show if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our weight this america life dot work from do e beat us chico if this america life on contajoffy want sitting in friar glad have been talking a people lately about their jobs something is going on with jobs right now people are leaving that they want to leave them where we do our jobs is changing what we do and have been especially interested in people who are designated essential workers i think for the stay at home types people me our jobs changed in very obvious ways but for people who continued to go to work in person the jobs changed too but those changes were sometimes last visible for example carry been he is a carpenter work pe the near city department of education fixing things in schools spring last year when all the schools shut down for covet carry was inter what that meant for him until he heard not he should still come in report to work well the felt that the deem to essential kind of founded h little comic on the beginning that doors creaks for years that floors are es all see to days in ardency towards essential sally see was a doctor or grocery store worker most of word is repairing floors doors ah dealings sitter down bottoms for a part he is a favorite set of test on money morning if you get a sign doors are you a ardors or is there one ta e really lake i would not say these a favorite my favorite is when the building has not elevator because you have get doors on the with floor of e building and you have get a carry doors o was mentally couple hundred pounds up and then back him carry is practical in this way carney's been a carpenter for thirty five years he is us wo volunteer fire fetter iris tots about as kids flat he is going to work and there getting a lot done because there is no kids around with the bovid schools empty things we getting pain ted things were getting fix have never seen schools of good and then aril couple weeks after the schools closes carry goes in for his team meeting where they tell every one what they're working on next a it was i believe e at thirsty or fridge afternoon i bosses we have get a project coming up next week an we an store to build coffins he repeated it we will be building coffins for the city of new york nobody ins shop believe do i in a get build coffins and he produced ta set a plans and showed him to us an a were can start next week money morning care goes to work and we had to go to a high school a into a chimnasium that was set up as a rudimentary shop a with hay scogymnasium lake but basketball lines on the floor can it yes we all get up there an there was actually a photo type of what we had to build standing an example coffin yes actually have a picture well they showed you that prototype yes it is a simple box standing on its end where a person's feet would be and it is open the cover is not attached yet it is just leaning against the bad in the background you can see a score board abaskebol that and a championship banner e baby plywood in two by for box i built some strange things over the years but at near built coffin a melic very quickly the him became a workshop they set up cut stations and assembly stations electricians my men town tough ventilation ban thorn all the to ut n about ten carpenters got to work and we start o bring in drafts supplywet which as fifty sheets at a time and we had six draft supply would and two drafts of to by fords and they did not give us an end or but we were just told this is your job for now we started and we ran through all the material got more material ran tor that got more material my god they really need this many mad i ask carried did they know where the coffins were going no did the carpenters talk about what the boxes were for no we just kept working we would get up to about a hundred and fifty until we had a very large stack of him was almost a wall across the gem from one end to the other ready put a hundred and fifty coffins and a hay school get straight across the bask willcort from one end to the other wake locked on top of yes we would stack him about five or six high until we got pallets in the we placed ten on a pale shrink rap i and i would take a fork left and back him in to the elevator i drive him out on to the street and up the street through the school yard down the next street unto the back of a tractor trail and getting honked at for a forklift ta gust ho slow there hanging at you where you ere driving the coffins yes and in three weeks of doing it not one person in neighborhood ever asked a question what those or what areyou doing do you we waiting for somebody to ask you i found a bazar that nobody asked it maybe nobody made the connection or maybe nobody wanted to make the connection it just seems people were going about their lives and until the final load where e one i who spoke punish only walks past me he just says mortal and makes sort of a slicing motion across is back and i just said see and he shook his head and just walked away in the and carrystean belt four hundred and fifteen coffin the are carpenters and others cops too altogether they built fourteen hundred has i been tagging to people about their jobs people and moth different job that were deemed a tench nobody's lot seventeen months i we very regularly find myself facing something that i had no idea that happened what wend yet do keep o know that that happens it was not for public knowledge i think nobody knew how to handle it ism sure the schools did not want ay were building coffins over here sat something on the highlight but now the things are waiting and a right you can cantle let that out ether's the sort of part of what we and about what just happened is that lake there were people who hat to do things that that just normally are never off of in your job and it wasn't a war and but lake if it was a war and after a war you go her wat happen yet this is how many people doe this is how many plains we built to trucks we whatever were the fact that somebody built coffins and i gold men in the brooks yes there is going to be an a counting the it will be the weird stats that come out of somewhere and this is one of the stranger ones four hundred and fifteen coffins market down that happened a year and a half ago we ask more than fifty million america to continue going to work because they had essential jobs and they did nurses and doctors and also mail carriers and waitresses and construction workers child car workers garbage collectors all worked through this once in the century emergency and now we canty use to it were focus on what is next but do we even know what just happened an remember calling to check in on someone early in the pandemic she works in customs at the air port and she told me they had not got any people e yet and they were nervous they all sit right next to each other in desks in this office they took cardboard boxes and put them up between their desk and then they cut holes in the boxes they could talk to each other i had the same feeling hearing that as they did with the coffins do people know that happened should not we be marking that in some way four hundred and fifteen coffins that happens an twenty two jerry rigged cardboard partitions in ja of k air port that happened too to day so it'd to attempt to do a kind of accounting not of how many people died or how many are unemployed but a different kind of national accounting of all the smaller private women that unfolded an people's jobs all across the country main arizona a michigan york city specifically essential workers we are gong to hear the stories only they now moments that change the way people thought about their jobs change the choices they will make next and we will affect the economy in ways we are only just beginning to see that is to day so stay with us because today so is a kind of audit each act name will include an number our first number for our ledger here is the number three this act is called three bottles of joy that will make sens in a second years a small thing you would have no way of knowing was happening underground during the pandemic station agents in new york city's subway system the people who sit in booths an sell you tickets or give you directions they were going to work every day but most o the public stopped writing the trains i got really quiet down there and as the weeks went on station agents began bringing items from home into their boots to sit with them during the day bibles spiritual prisms lo self that play mes look at you map month louis the a station agent for the empty a near city trains it she saw workers bringing in all sorts of things into their boots at don't point we was being the bottles of joy tot we a had them see a joy sore the displashings o a if you see were joy you look at is go not make you sea month says we needed that made us feel less alone over time the bottles of joy they started to be a marker for mania of how their work was changing month's job is to be lunch relief for other station agent that means she travels to a station the agent on duty goes on lunch and month sits in their boots for thirty minutes than travels to the next station she sees the inside of a lot of boots and months and observer black women cat eye glasses she can talk to any one in she does she goes from south fairy station to rector chambers she gets a ball from the corner store at ten thirty a ms she eats it for six minutes by the window as she narrates the traffic at the fourweight intersection outside with an eye on the unmarked cop car that is always park there waiting she says four or five tickets daily if people cut the an you could cut the light full always every day then its underground month waves me into the sub way through the gay come on ye with the empty lady i we we wo i a an the ay my march twenty twenty when the pandemic shut down near city month brought word of the virus from booth to booth at one booth the agent would say do you think we should be wearing masks and at the next booth oh i heard were not supposed to management does not want a scaring the customers another booth what customers month says all the agents at every booth were talking about the disappearing customers es lowly we was lie day get a say he we want done the tote t station dow to but yes ratio days we had to be he was sick yes i i we felt the little meet we go li we a o ay out about us o would he on we grateful to have a job we'll get ye a ye i quite quite a not a lot even is meeting people o but i a just lie uneasiness it was we was codein to work to we sit you fell lie you were coming to work to get sick yes and they did transit workers began to get sick in large numbers and they began to die in large numbers first subway conductor and a bus driver then a track worker the empty suffered more coma deaths than any other agency in her city one hundred and seventy one deaths bovid was surging and near city was the epicenter it was a plague struck this one specific agency a bus driver i spoke is told me when you lose some one in the transit sister you notice because what transit is is a time sceddul that train pulls out at four thirty one every day that bus passes with the same busdriver at eight twenty two every morning that person by chips from the same venting machine in the break room at exactly five twelve when someone dies their absence is immediately visible month told me she fell suddenly work was a battle and she was a soldier trying to say alive a lot of transit workers felt this way but they are not soldiers i would ask people how do you make that switch how does a person go from driving a train every day to going into work thinking you might die doing this job the we i go begat my line an my capital i would on be a cristopher guns alas tries o the number seven train he is a conductor suddenly an essential conductor which he spoke about he was being conscripted into an army just as the war was heating up i yo kept looking at my can mut to go the big boy everybody at work wit getting i and i yet we an i to a gain worry when it would time to go back to work i an wnglebact i w you thinking about i o i all my mama lad i told or to mog at what but we got to go er on akin the you do not ye you other takin the lord all win how cam o to it make you reset bat to bet little word morrow yen you given me the hold thing we recarefol were you bad e a a very body you i o i me of to getting on me from ma bit in you i in o in a hell a it in mi o yo my will cries said as mim told him no now do it now while we are on the on and then she waited until she could hear him taking his fitments and no o a worry and a him o i to you you not to the color you are mi been fir very i contain happen everything that have mi return or bout it oh i you what you would worry and i to have the calmer down it you you told her your may beneficiary that was your way of coming her town well if you tell in me old con which yo blind on their point yen o it would carry but replevin i you'll very leave one o talk o tor o thou you o motif i yo ha the man up going orectic but he want you mania told me it was around this time when you would hear about people dying daily that station agents started bringing in the bottles of joy dish into their boots the transit workers wore essential but there were also alone station agents are supposed to be the eyes and ears of the subway system but there were few people transit took away cash purchases fear of transmission subbwayfairs were all taken on machines mania was by herself sitting in the booths looking at all the hopeful items people brought in the bottles of joy just hanging on until we got to the other side and now here we are kind of at the other side is there another side things have definitely changed under ground they are better but mania's job is not the same the people have not returns they're not writing the trains before and the cash has not returned either station agents still are not allowed to take cash purchases take thine the we sit to we not suppose it be on our towns now suppose to be wearing an e the also a transit memos we have no customs we is that think the in we we e soldiers sit here they do not to no at lake at by queens tala yer does it make you not want do the job any more it make me fix i on able to sully do without tie to yo say more about that what you mean by that what id a biggest sans coming dow here what is to business how busy less the money the come watery with a customers they go into word how ma peopleper an most us to for you do not feel a people person any more i job feel a people posed i is feel people not map and the old was feel that especially because recently the emptied has proposed eliminating her position the position of lunch relief for station agents the union sued and the emptied back down but looking forward without cash purchases the job of a station agent does seem much less essential that if mania survived the war only to be lead off in peacetime i asked her recently if the bottles of joy are still in the booths she said now people took him away you are not allowed to bring us her stuff into the booth you can get away with it before when we were left alone down there a to monist job changed pretty dramatically and with he did not but most jobs did not actually change that much in fact one of the strangest aspects of working through the pandemic for a lot of people was how much did not change in their jobs that is the case with this next story morgen a add another number to our list if you picture our ledger here we have got four hundred and fifteen coffins three battles of joy i feel the next number here should have stars drawn around it or something sparkle pen aspirational stars a goal's list the number is twenty five i too is called the twenty five dollar tip e took shelly or tease i decade in the restauround business to work up to a twenty five dollar tip she started when she was fifteen years old got her first job as a cashier at a five guys in phoenix and shall walks in bobby ready to go her nick name growing up is smile and you can hear it in her voice i remember i was at orientation and i really one to make friends i memberlic turning to a man being what i school do you go to he o looked at me melt i thirty five it was just a big realization that am the youngest person here o and it shows shall describes herself as in all in tight person and she threw herself into restaurants all through college her twenties there was five guys than a french beast a summit shop a food good and eventually fine dining where she finally got her first twenty five dollar tip which was huge she was only making nine dollars an hour shall picked up on the routines of each place she worked easily she lives a routine and she loved restaurants shall got rude customers all the time people would say things better body her personality how much she was checking on the table i remember i iced or brunches a lot i was the brunch girl and brunch made good money but brunch coin till it is intimidating and i remember we were running out of forks we were running out lo forks and i i think about this all the time i think i put some spoons on a table a very picky picky brunch table because they were getting something that they could eventually eat it with a spoon but they probably should have actual roll lips with a fork and a knife in a napkin and remember i came back to collect them because we needed them it'd give them actual pullups and woman slap my hand away to we need this and i was ism giving you roll ups actual silver were and she look at her friend she lowlife this girl and she ruled her eyes and continued to talk to the woman a and it was it was just la girl minder that i am not human to her have never been a person to her ism just a some one out look her world that does not deserve to be treated lie human being shall got it this too was routine it came along with the twenty five dollar tips i mean among the servers no one would be shops to hear that it is very common and i felt worth it to you ye i would just think that i got her money i got paid i she just another person but i do not have to think about after this and at the end of ma shift i be able to go home i be able to hug my girl friend it became li at disassociation this is not me this is just this person who as serving and you are to take how this money to om the money she homed to this skill to this associate she could shake off whatever was thrown at her shall e would collect the cash from the table and move on the mayor a phoenix declared a state of emergency on march seventeenth twenty twenty valley's rest around clothes briefly but soon after rest around were declared essential services an arizona and reopened for take out and deliver but shaley hung back her dad was sick recovering for my hart attack and er mam is a nerves who was treating patience with covet shaley was too scared she told me she did not want to apply for in employment because she is porter reeking and she just had a since that that kind of thing never happened for people her by may rest around in airs own it were serving people in person and shaley had to go back she was still very nervous i was double masking before it was even a thin i bought fix glosses to protect my eyes i was i would only really take a my master drink water and i would only drink water in the bath room wore i was along like that the only time i would her get it an that now that was a long shifts i was really scared meanwhile she still had her routine she was doing all the thing she would done thousands of times before welcome the customer explain the specials carry the plates deliver the drinks and i was just kind of waiting for that should thing to happen i would have people ask me pulled on your mask i was she how much tip you pull down your mask i want to see how much to tip you yes we they would did once see how pretty i was before they tip me was that a thing that happened frequently the people would ask you to pull down your mask ye that happen probably about every week pull don your masks a mature smiling pulled down your mask i or why why are we for mas why did you have to for mask ah it was always belt either why am i worry what or can i see your face i can know that your smiling so i count ow your smiling i could know of your pretty but she tit is ad who gives a fuck f in pretty i u serve you your food ism sure that was not the first time that you were customers were assessing the way that you wok but did it feel different to have it stated bobby ya i am ism four foot nine ism very short and i have very big breast for my frame you know it is unavoidable ism very small i have big boobs and usually no ism really cut it is easy to have per just understand that people are going to be checking me out mum i would have comments before but i think when the epidemic it it was i hit harder because i they wanted to me too risk my safety that they could see if i was cut something i heard from a at of people i talked to about working through a pandemic people in all sorts of jabs they said they felt they were in a move that one of the strangest parts was how much did not change it was uncanny the way would since fiction is uncanny it looks normal life but something big is off and the parts of the jab that have not change just make the parts that feel off stand out even more si was serving a hardly night and i was a really busy shift i was outside and i was serving this couple and they really needy that was not very where sad abethaentli thins we u n bank you being ad body for food and drink but at the on the shift the gentleman it was a gentleman an his wife elder gentleman's wife and he ask me too pull down my mask he could see if the bottom part of my face was as cases a top and i said i could not and then when i said i could not he said that because he could not plus on my face he was forced to focus on my breast we and i his is siting men across him and i looked at her for any sort of response and she justconn't give me a blanket stare in return he said it almost matter of fatly he was well if i cannot look at your face i forced to look at your breast and i was and it was just just it was just disgusting it jussucked which us great all see now ism i think mostly during the pandemic my self worth was low i felt really disposable ah obviously being objectified all the time because half my face was covered up and i tried to make it work but i was not adjusting the way my congress were and i felt really disposable and ah i i just felt another person who was justice to get sick and it would be another stay had you felt that way before ism never felt that way before it was the pandemic and missing your life and not feeling though come order is your she mas any more because it really did not seel any one's taking as seriously as me and then i start questioning if i this crazy person and i stared questioning my anxiety and the my anxiety got worse and the anxiety in anger that high but i felt i was not adjusting the way my cobras arrested i feel people who had to work during the pandemic i dope it this disassociation and i could not ah i could it separate it why could not she shall my spent much time on this question why could not she disassoci i she don for years when a customers raped her hand or yelled or talked about her body her to workers were going out to carryyokee afterward her customers were out with friends and family catching up i remember one time a woman had a commit card and she she left it for me and i said thinks were making things feel normal et look a smile face and i was live it i was things ware not normal this is not normal i must see my life to serve you marguerite and it is not normal i do not want a contribute to this fantasy that a pandemic is not happening right now that is really interesting she was she was trying to gave you a compliment ya knewjingerja ism i understand that i it was coming from a kind place but thousands of people are dying right down the road at the hospital and ism here serving you marguerite because i have to because i have to live and it it was just e it such an intense moment for me of realization that this is what ism here to do ism here a great a fancy that things are not as bad as they are and they are what is essential about restaurants sure they provide jobs food but set of grocery stores this was a heart crisis doctors nurses sir essential but what is essential about an evasion fusion place and down town phoenix all these things we suddenly stared tackling essential services this was not some long held agreed upon category we just me all this up very recently and even then i was pretty random there was federal guidance on what services should be essential but most takes did not follow the guidance thither came up with their own lists of essential services or they had no guidance if you had a liquor store in pennsylvania you were not essential but in new jersey you were construction workers that was a controversial one in a number of states essential or not essential and then there are the ones that have a particularly local flavor flower shops they were essential and delftware and in arizona gulf courses essential also restaurants shells restaurant was open in millions of restaurant workers performed their normal daily routines through a pandemic why what essential service did they provide was this it restaurants were a central because they help make things feel normal once shelly thought about her job this way she was to continue doing all the thing she would always done she was essential that other people could feel normal it was too much for her the treat off she would been making in her head twenty five dollar tips in exchange for some long hours some crap from customers that that off fell apart she did not want to be paid for the fantasy any more a few weeks later a coworker was exposed to bovid and shelly walked out of the restaurant ah that never wat back oh that was the end for you ye ye shelly got on employment then picked up some film jobs went back to school for film she told me now she does not think she could ever go back to serve even after the pandemic do you feel the actual job changed or do you think it is that you changed did the has it become uglier was it always ugly ye i think that i changed more than the job changed there is always been a certain amount of ugly that is been the restaurant as that especially ye sexual resting always in there feral reasons always in there but it was i seeing it for the first time was new eyes ah is all lock goes kindness and cut to see and it was constant ye at most the people put on bovid goggles on and wearing the covigoggles they started to see their job differently the call somemach of differently with my bovid cool goggles for sure ah that is what made it really ugly for me there is the image i have in my mind hearing shelly talk about where she is that right now i picture all the governors and mayors and council members sitting down to make their list of essential services hospitals grocery stores restaurants gulf courses and i picture shelly doing the same she is making her own list of all the things she considers essential her life her health her self worth and she is crossing off and ate at the very bottom of her list at twenty five dollar tip coming up quitters and the people who love them that is in a minute from chico public radio when our program continues it is this america life ism condo jiffy was sitting in for iron glass this wee show we are talking to essential workers about what happened inside their jobs over the last year and a half things nobody else knows and we are marking these experiences down four p eternity that as we move into the bright and quickly darkening fucker we will do with a shared understanding of what we have just been through far we have four hundred fifteen coffins three bottles of joy and a twenty five dollar tip we gingko be adding more to that list and we will we what happens when people take stock one by one and wind up making some choices they never expected to make that is what the second half of the shows about quitters and the people they quit on e record number of people are quitting their jobs and they are all quitting on miss jordan rossignal that is of feels to her anyway which brings as to our next act teacher number four miss organ's child development enter in northern main has lost twenty three teachers since the pandemic began twenty three most years miss jordan told me herself maybe one or two teachers leave that is our next number for our ledger twenty three twenty three disappearing teachers miss jordan says the first teacher she left right away march twenty twenty she was scared of jerry kids then another went in aril a third in may they left for other jobs and then in tune miss jordan says was teacher number for and ha a banana wad w handed out the bath eater ever had and the poor ever i could tell er hours about hernia finding good teachers and then keeping them this has always been a problem in early childhood education it is one of those arias that was already a bruise and the panda came in just stomped on it till the bone was broken too for miss jordan teacher number four xenia bel that felt the break she cannot get over it and she is not joking about how mush time she can spend lamenting this particular loss cent's ideas were fresh she tells me her discipline was fair her lesson plans were thought out she was reliable she was a fun can worker i would in meeting will we have that way thou they o pay your boy i want you to have mania void where they could be farm but there boy with happy in the morning when you drop off your child we want to hear would morn my friend what kind a voice for people doing gut o for i died out to get it to o i cry to fort we have the peanut in the patheward short come on your bike o that no would morning my see girl but morning friend he tit the calm down method cut father other get bad and they an ne lit of madam ism and they are pals at they wanted bit or hit or run away and he the told them to blow up a balloon and they would put their hands over their head while taking a deep breath and they would hold it there a balloon over their head and they would slowly let the arrow and they would go and they would that by them fell if he made a little balloon corner is what she called it end they they will do it fill all the they even my own daughter moral morrow i need to three balloon and he will take her three day breath an he really them and their call o ye i fifth he have the gift she have the gift anything anything lake you cannot peak it the what i mean when miss jordan conceived of her early childhood sinner in her home town babies begin tor garden she could picture it in her mind but she says it was not until xenia showed up a couple years ago and she got to see her in a real class room thought's when miss jordan felt this scan a work senate told me for her when she walked into miss doorman sinner twenty one years old she was nervous in a way she had not been before because she felt this is it this is the job i actually care about adorn mess it out and she did love the job but then went forty i in cobia what i feel o for a little while a lot of bar a ye do wasn't coming a e i i would nerve are we you ta mark the cool younotl in mighty motor old be ye know getting pan for a little while i her not there we get the lot of on ferny there was the time the owner miss jordan asked everyone to hold off on getting paid and their peaches came in late and the time xenia was pretty sure her pack came from miss organ's personal bank account xenia began to feel wait is there no cushion in this business she never really thought about the business side of things before but once she started to she served to have some doubts when a friend posted about a job at the local harder store xenia applied then she had to tell miss jordan thou she came to my office o shut the door an idea that was bat would shut the do this is miss jordan again ne o she did not a cry i he i i was offer a job that was the first hive ever cried with tho one gave their noted i blow it we sure crying o ye it the get i cry i cry i cannot a i be if i cannot far to work here this is obvious but deserve saying anyway many of the people we call essential workers do not make a lot of money there overwhelmingly low wage workers about half the people in this country who make less than fifteen dollars an hour work an fields we now call essential you can be the very best at running the grill or cleaning the office building or managing rude customers at the restaurant you can be the star teacher teach her number four sonic and s still only make an average of eleven or twelve dollars an hour and no help care miss jordan barely makes enough from tuition to cover her expenses but she is reluctant to rase rats on families because she knows many parents cant for to pay and she knows from experience that if she goes to high families aregoingto pull their kids altogether when chenaia talked to miss jordan and when she talked to me about leaving her job she could not bring herself to see the word quit she told miss jordan i have to get done i knew that she was you to try you knowhow everything to so payee more i but i knew that everything she was trying to do possibly was it going to work out in the end just be i she could she really couldn't e for to do that an and then you knew that i and i knew the n i and i understood miss jordan did do all those things she pleaded will far something out just give me more time and she tried to technique that i think is maybe only applicable in a small town when cheap said where she was going miss jordan shook her head i would i at our hated e told her ad ye i would i love you and and i want you to be happy but you to hate id and i know the not i that older of it in i it he will not love you to way i of you pay that li i do not i know and i i allée thought of a it tat t ted that cent last and miss jordan waited for her to return i it it it it t i in the early child careworn there were two somewhat distinct phases of the pandemic there is the beginning in which e child careener lost money even as their work became labelled essential and then there is this moment now where what was already a chronic problem of teach her turn over has become much worse because the industry cannot commit places mark whom demo radar misery stor chains proper cat making money over the pandemic amazon made record profits child care centers did not teachers are living for jobs at amazon or drunken donate or grocery stores that can pay them more and sometimes give them health benefits a woman in oho who owns a child careen are told me even the amusement parts can pay better than we can write now o men to ago when miss jordan lost genie teach her number four of twenty three she allowed a thought that has been sitting uncomfortably to the forefront ever since what if i can never keep some one xenia but if no one ever believes this is valuable i feel unconfully trying to prove my felt that what ism doing it it important i have a college three education people do not no people do not know what we do how could it caught the lot aren't you i jut coloring and eating got they shall day with them e no who i make a eating plant for everything bathroom in fa up to the footage program there to many regulation that we have to follow a there a tgaduel there a meal plant there training that my that have to to we run that a school only different is that there is no public funny frat why is it that essential workers happen to be some of the lowest paid workers in the country how could a job that is valuable be paid little there is some standard explanations you will here many essential jobs do not require extra credentials or a lot of education there is a lot of available labor to do these jobs in other words they are low paid because they are quoted low skilled jobs but also one thing that unites this broad category of low paid essential jobs and almost everyone you have heard from in this how is not the kind of work there doing but who is doing it black people the ten people emigrants women and all the people who cover more than one of those categories many five per cent of child care workers are women women genie miss jordan and many women of color almost half of child care workers a people of color the field is much more recall and linguistically diverse than keep through twelve teachers and the people in it make much less money the pandemic gave child care and a fossil stamp of essentialness in this singular moment in history when it is more clear than it has ever been and may ever be again that schools and child care are essential to the functioning of literally everything but miss town's work and the people doing that work may never be valued enough for her to secure more funding or for her to get xenia back amiss torningenaia live in a town of eight thousand people when xenia laugh she went all the way to a job across the street she parks in the same spot she did when she worked at miss jordan misstordn told me i see her all the time she came by every day afterword prefer wake over there and

it important but at pit or doing they hear they git that you cannot eat it could kill me to watcher we a this that it not what a gifted a er packet one thing economists will say about economic moments this when a lot of people are quitting their jobs they will say it's a good thing high quits numbers equals optimism people are going back to school they are going for that dream job people feel secure enough to look around a little for what they really wanted do this is obviously not an example of that this is an example of a market that does not work this is an example of the talented person whose drawn to a job that is essential which he is not doing because it does not pay enough back forth there are people who are quitting who are happy about it there are people who are mad confused by what they want of course there istle whole range one thing i found interesting is that for many people there was often one moment that set things in motion for them a while back some symbol of something just being off in their job and then it is these symbols just sat next to them for months and of haunting them until they could not deal any more they found themselves doing something they never plan to do sometimes that was quitting but there were some other reproaches as well for our last story i when i tell you about some of those symbols and then what happened next our last number also are biggest number in the whole show twelve million act for twelve million thinking meals this one i heard about from a guy in flip michigan my name mat can out a and they a he o let is sixty one years old he is a black man wakes up every morning at for am walks to work mac donates opens the stor cook sausage eggs pancakes he is in e back on his own sometimes for many hours he doesn't mind he enjoys working alone when he is at home let willspend a lot of time helping out neighbors removing snow cutting grass he enjoys that too although he did mention he is a person who some times has a hard time saying no when i ask let what the pandemic was for him that is what he started telling me about how last spring mac donates began offering free food beg mac muffins war tout the the comma well li wold it been good boy a i welt o who me ho that a work ten homos to o meet see makes wo to over oersoosoerers like to us ore remember this he really is watching a bunch of these commercials it'd somehow forgotten how completely everyone threw themselves in to breathlessly praising e central workers two words most of us had never heard use together before all of a sudden they were everywhere it is we invented this category of worker to think them wo be proudly edit us like to u of ego all toss anyway let saw that commercial and was oh that will be meat serving you w li old old we been greedy be b that mot or tout o ye knave an an in work o fry i people from hat till her i yo no ta cay we got the fool now i thought fleet was sharing this as a moment of pride being part of this but now this moment handing out free think meals it was the start of something for him we toe be to of with you into i did on a taught you o we here working ta you won i make the fool give i o e body we could not go o were a get to o free you were not getting the freeload that was for the essential workers you have for a tit e work were not you guise e mental workers yet o why you gone to a would to t f the her tic donates gave away twelve million think male to front line workers after two weeks they stopped but not without putting out one more commercial it is none ti o an of to think you it was o on to her y business went back to normal but fleet kept returning to the experience in his mind how much did that cost all of a sudden they have much money for that they pul given it you e see food way you got a that it the wait ye the dot if of you o ta body too take o mite money i in make a differ yo won o you making a riff it a other people what would feel ignore you worker o i did not a unit bin tat i get that w foot wont end a year old of being the come o wit that idea we do not talk to lot about the sharifalders for mac donates the being corporation and also about the franchised owner the people who own his mac donates and about a dozen or other stores she says he barely saw them during the pandemic the her ups they rarely came to the store he would always noticed it but handing out the think male for health care workers he noticed it more you got o o ye li lot ye not yon appreciate you get told or to you don't to fix preciarige you yo we tie you'll to work tat

peek to i make you say i thought thought was such a fitting way to describe something ad heard from a lot of people who worked through the pandemic a feeling that while they had no choice to come to work the people who were making all the choices if they had to work how much how much they get paid how safe they would be those people appeared completely indifferent calls even a relative who will not speak to you a server at a pet restaurant texts rashly beaker told me the owner used to come in all the time and then he vanished he did he likely stop coming to the ristra he merely just went away let seen in his like there less new tan not to tat wens in e pastor he merely disappeared when he showed back up month later they were all relieve to have some one in charge to answer their questions but i do remember one being that really struck a a nerve with me plays that he changed hes be a cold to a corset and i remember that sonny struck a germane betas i i your paying is manual wage and you want people tho coming on time is ta ah but you are easy hear you hade the luxury yet not coming in and you have the ably to go changer to get get a bring new cark that was the moment when i is were things just set in for let it was the twelve million thinking malls that was the symbol for him now glowing me on it put all the other parts of his job in a less acceptable light for ashes it was the covet for imply ataman donates and californium perhaps it was when they raise concerns about the lack of pep and they say their bosses told them to use coffee filters and doggy divers for masks for a guys met outside an amazon ware house it was when he says he was fire four times for having covet four times this was a thing apparently at amazon people would tell their bosses they had covet or they got exposed loved and then they get fired later they would hear it was any charmistake and they were welcome to appeal get their job back but not always the weeks or sometimes months of lost wages and for alley's manager at the peat o place a woman named sears morals the covet pissed era but the real sign for her was when the restaurant cut back her hours and she became eligible for unemployed a how can i we make more noon employment than my actual job i mean how n i mean how can it be portable that tiki for all that him on employment i for yell making what to men o we con oman twenty fine thank how and what lesson did you take from that not your pot member care any these things just sat near by as they did their jobs nagging a covet being fired four times seven twenty five an hour let at mac donates he was handing out those thinking meals more than a year ago he still mat about it he is not about a lot of things but they never got hazard pay sic pay pay time off health care the owner operator of let's mac donates says he showed his appreciation by raising wages during the pandemic but fetors wage is another thing the just makes him angry he went from eleven dollars to twelve dollars an hour he wants more but the one thing let talked about more than any other was the fact that the franchisowner and the people who work with him did not come by or when they did they did not appeared to actually see them do not recur ho get told conto wet not ay when say coming to bel he lot bi yo not o er as it interesting because i feel appreciating essential workers is the one thing that we did do most places did not pay hazard pay or higher wages or else care but their was much thank you e mental workers we appreciate you in causing for you and commercials but non of that felt anything to you e no not really a litter all we do wen you cut e body of i the ha how you do will bet ye you did not one and at you wanted your actual human boss to come and say thank you

i yearn walk to the boggart fleet does not want quit the mac donates is close to his house he his no transportation he can walk to work he likes the people he works with some of them is worked with for many years and he likes the work he does not want to change he wants the job to change he wants it to be less thankless to pall many of the industries we deemed essential now seem to be in some sort of chaos restaurants are open now but not for dinner because there is not enough staff healthcare workers are quitting their jabs collection officials are bailing and school superintendents from america three largest school systems have all quit and things that never really worked that great before seem to be truly breaking down i called at blue the other day to change of reservation and the recording said the current we time is two hundred ninety nine minutes some food chains are actually rasing wages chipolata olive garden me donates is raising wages at its corporate stores the small share of actual mcdonald stories but still support for later unions is the highest it is been in years every week or lately i see a picture on line posted outside a store or restaurant announcing that no one works there any more this one scotch tape to the door that reads a mention tho play customers we are overworked under staff and under appreciate it almost the entire staff and management have walked out of here until further notice or another we are closed and definitely because dollar general does not pale living wage or treat their employs with respect have never seen anything it each sign it seems a whole group of employes just spontaneously and collectively decided they were done but something happened at some point before ow some shift started with say a corvette or with twelve million thinking meals one sign postedonomac donates drive through many reads we are short staff these be patient with the staff that did show up no one wants to work any more or another also from a different macdonalds with a different perspective it reads we are closed because i am quitting and i hate this job people quit jobs for all sorts of reasons and there are lot of people debating we many a doing a rate now id to just make sure this one possibility is on the table alongside all the others that a good number of people worked through a life threatening pandemic feeling unseen by the very people who were supposed to care for them feeling as let did they have a relative who will not speak to them my favorite sign is from a denies in north carotid it reads we all quit closed an

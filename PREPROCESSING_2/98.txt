heaven ma earthy is used from his position as speaker of the house by the republican circular firing squad trumps civil fraud trout continues and criminality's friends across america major cities i venture of this is the bench vino show tons show ponsfrom express we plan do you lie or bye sister being seen and sold to advertisers no meaneither get express we plan right out express we plans i coup flashes what if i told you that the got had pretty much every systemic advantage going into twenty twenty for they d deeply unpopular presidents of the united states the prove ratings in the high thirties low forties of a presidents of the united states the provalratings on the economy in the thirties or twenties what if i told you that the got had not economic edge on the issues that is their biggest since nineteen ninety one hell what if i told you that going into the election there is a very solid shot that jo beans economic policies were going to drive america erectly intersession what all of those things are true all of those things are true and yet somehow republicans have come up with a bran new strategy this strategy is to join in idiocrasides move from the two thousands join in the idiocrasy show a my balls this is their actual strategies us to kick themselves over and over in the balls until they went i cannot see any other strategy here i i do not know why its happening it makes no sense to me it is incredibly frustrating because i would to see jordan note president of the united states it'd to see democrats not make policy for the united states i thucsure men to to be the sent majority leader and yet since republican victory in twenty sixteen republicans have lost something eleven governorships republicans have lost something twenty plus holicetes republicans have moved from a majority to minority in the senate all in the face o wildly unpopular democrat policies the democratic party has moved to the radical left they continue to juror all the policies of the radical left the america people do not them on any of the issues and yet democrats keep getting elected and the question becomes why why would that be well may be the reason for that is because republicans are strategically en apt maybe it is because republicans have essentially decided that protest votes are more important than actual votes maybe they have decided that dowsing themselves in gasoline and setting a match is is probably the best strategy i not it strategy four other than may be feeling good for a brief moment in time becasif we show frustration to our leadership class then for sure well get a new leadership class and then some body all centers wait pollen the intensive structures exactly the same an homes sol says very frequently with regard to politics that people big mistake when it comes to politics is believing that the problem with the politicians is the politicians rather than the incentive structure that creates the politicians and that is exactly correct republicans have now replaced in the last few years paulrianat speaker of the house on banner a speaker of the house now cevmacarthea speaker the house what is changed seriously what is changed what what magical new things have happened from the replacement of any of the people a speaker of the use now i was not a banner fan i did not want banner to be speaker f the house have of was fir to conciliatory tor baracobama i thought cauline was fine i out come mac earthy was fine what apparently we ten to be operating under the wild delusion that if we simply replace one speaker wit another speaker and leave the intents of structure exactly the same then everything will be yo better things will change that is not how any of this works the invent give structure right now in the house f representative just take the latest example because yesterday cam earthy was outset is speaker of the house for no reason i can discern by eight republicans who join with all democrats to use mac earthy which means that ninety six percents of the republican caucus voted in favor of cemmicarthy and micarthy is no longer thespeaker because o the at house republican who decided that my charity had to go for a reason that no one can actually discern or specify the invent of structure right now unfortunately for a huge number of people is gat famous run for a higher office win or lose does not really matter clean up pick up some checks start a pack spartan on profit move in to a different aerial of your career this is a different incense of structure the use to be when parties were more powerful that they actually have the ability to punish their members now that was bad in some ways because it meant the party leadership actually mattered an awful lot because the party leadership could decide the direction of the party and because of that the party structure was weakened well the result of that is that there is a massive collective action problem whereby a few people can hold hostage the enough republican caucus for no reason that any one can can explain yen in order to really understand how dumb all of this is what you have to understand is that even mac earthy was by pretty much any measure the most conservative speaker the republicans have had since new gingridch the he achieved actual winds against jobidon the last continuing resolution that the people who ousted him are very angry about he proposed a better one two weeks ago that they that thy scuttled they said was not good enough and s they scuttled it and he had to pass a continuing resolution and even then he stripped out funding for the cranewor and somehow he is the vagi and this is not that cemmicrthy the most amazing politician fall time he that he he would be the greatest speaker in history it is he got no replacement e got no strategy this all grand standing nonsense there is no purpose to it what winds are you are you attempting t i said this during the original speakership fight back in canary chippy was one of the people who may be considered for the speakership slot if he wants it you know we any one in the world would want that job is a horrible job it is the second worsjob in a america behind donates from personal lawyer i i do not understand what chippy did not want this not we but indicate chippy back in canary he said i want certain concessions from a earthy and then he got them and then he said o cemicarthy should should be speaker that is a plan but this is not a plan this is just people ranting and raving again this is liberty mankind can gressional version is real running for no reason into a brick wall and then declaring victory as they bleed it is it is an amazing thing against to truly understand how done this he oust understand how unable democrats are and to understand a vulnerable democrats are letthim give you just the economic situation in the united states right now stocks tumbled on tuesday accord we mean be see as treasury yields he their highest levels since two thousand seven raising concern higher interstates would freeze the housing market and tip the economy intercession the dabjones in austral average drop four hundred and thirty one points that is the worst day since march the dawn is now in the red for the year the ten year treasury yield touch four points eight per cents that is the highest level in sixteen years the bench mark yield has surged in the past month as the federal reserve pledge to keep interest rats at a higher level for longer the thirty year treasury yield hat four point nine two five per cent that is also the highest since two thousand seven which means the money is now rushing out of stocks and back into bonds but it also means that who people are expecting then in flection could be baked into the economy that is the only reason the interest racer can be stuck this high market watch has an entire article to day talking about how government bond yields are ripping through

to win back the senate the map senate the senate main in two thousand twenty for favors re publicans there in very good position win back to presidency naturally why not distract the america people

after the passage of the continuing resolution as a clean continue resolution the only takes some forty five days into the future there is more room for negotiation but don machetes decided that he would had enough of speaker monarchy now the predict for this rose back an canary because my earthy had basically pledged that any one at any time could bring what would be a no confidence vote a vote to remove mom earthy and what that men is that anybody at any time could make national headline to become an international political figure by going up against monarchy for good reason or bad and make who just waiting for his opportunity what that men for machetes and for some of the people who surround him is scuttle a better continue resolution a couple of weeks ago then a new continuing resolution goes forward my earthy has to passim because otherwise we been going to a government shut down with no prospect of actually passing a bill because gates is already suggested you will not sit support really another build anything that that tactfully passible in the sennit control by democrats and then mandates says how democarthy work with democrats on this bill after helping scuttle a republican only built how dare you work with democrats ism going to file motion to vacate the chair and then he along with seven other republicans votes with the entire democratically is to get redemocarthy just to get the logicize machetes is very very angry that majority of republicans voted with some democrats to pass a continue resolution that only happen because machetes and his crew decided not to not for a republican only version of the continue resolution a couple of weeks ago and now he and his friends voted with all democrats in order to oustmocarthy such bad decide with democrats very very a is have unless you are ousting your own speaker as a hell's strategy and makes no sense unless what you actually believes that this has nothing to do with strengthening the republican caucus or making the housework conservative it make sense of what you believe is that is really about grand standing and getting headlines in raising money in sending out text messages then it makes some sense and that is what america optics is be come about it is all about an pensive structures again to go back to sold this is all about intensive structures youvolivan is a really god political forest he is sent for quite a while than one the big problems right dow n the modern rub is that our political class are insensitive to use congress and political power as a platform for other things it used to be that the institution of congress shaped you you went in you learned how the game was played how the sausage was made and then you participated in that process now you going to congress and basically your job is to comments on everything that is going on and to grand stand for people back home and to not get anything done ans norm not getting things done is not whether those things are good or bad but the incentive right now it is a simply yellow things and then get a cable hit and then portrayed yourself is he most conservative guy in the room here is haw went down yesterday yesterday magnates move the canst mac earthy there is laughter on the housefloore mostly from democrats were i cannon's believe the republicans are going this what in the whose this even a thing that is happening right now here was at gates moving against mac earth yesterday for what purpose heres a gentlemen for newjersy seek recognition and here you laying cam his quick lash fat radiates cap back when marine was speaker the opposed ousting paulryan and here is radiates speaking on fox news of the time if we take pal ride off the field right now instead of being able to finish strong in the hundred fifteenth congress we will shatter into a bunch of factions fighting against each other for power we got enough of thou of washingtot already pal in can be a caretaker of the speaker ship we can have a leadership election we can go into the midterm strong hat it'll think the pushing about early if you have what a go it ha as how is mandates in twenty eighteen gay have me that long and am what changed the answer what changed is pretty much nothing except that radiates realize t t forget a lot more credit among a certain group of people for shouting and round thing at the wind and and making moves this then you would for you know actually getting things done in congress again ism all four people o trying to exact more conservative concessions whom the speaker o the use that is fine but there were no concessions actually attempted or exacted here speageran earthy it had a choice you had to basically bring up e motion to table the motion to table if it d succeeded would have stopped the motion to vacate motion to table what ever lie presumably on some democrats democrats light what ism not ism not con kill you but i do not have to save you this the bat man prospective from batman against which is you is this a problem of your own making why would i possibly save you now is that good fates of course not i mean democrats know that they are likely to get somebody in that republican seat next time who is a who is probably going to be the had of another weak cacao going to be very difficult to negotiate with because again want it is is too fractures the rules of the caucus do not make for the ability to consolidate policy m my earthy had had basically work with them in good fate on couple of issues but they do not car i an why should they care ism not con put this tine democrats ya if you ware f you sure on whether foot and democrats were busy ousting ha keep jeffreys and you are the speaker of the house i would be saying the re publicans on to save them i do not blame democrats were doing what democrats have let re publicans for voting with entirely democrats in order to outgrown speaker for no reason again that makes any sens my earthy instead call the not the motion to table fail the vote went forward and in the end the high re publicans who voted along with all democrats to oust mac earthy from the speakership were represented to any big of arizona who is a wild and crazy character can buck of coverage how birches o tenners e can of airs on a bob good of virgin nancy mates it south caroling a at rosendale of montane and do again it is it is a making because their complaints were were sort of vague to say the least bob good got up into the speaker fought through fifteen lots in canary to become speaker bout is only willing to fight through one failed sear before surrendering to the democrats on sturdy we need a speaker will fight for something anything besides just stranger becoming speaker what of would you suggest and the an there is never an answer to this understand mandates does not now who the helmsman become speaker inside has an alternative plan he is a dog that caught car what they the do not know what that hells happening next every single person they re suggesting for place my farther speaker supported my earthy for speaker that is him jordan from oho that is that is chippy from texts all these people voted from my earthy for speaker and opposed to this motion what is this exactly wo at really is is then act of personal pick and also now personal political benefit for packages and when the intensives are not alone wit the starsartlinewhen you are personal political benefits run directly against the interest of the party at large or the movement at large the intensive structure right now says the gang always be rogue actors who are able to do this sort of thing it is a problem well get to the actual break down on how this happened in just one at moment first baseball season

force to bring to the floor according to the deal that he had made with these republicans the motion to vacate the chair and cere is my earthy defending himself is that gets plan this all long here was yesterday no if i counted how a the solittl other tot t tho it wit got atoll tell if you explain the e why man what o therande do not her why a a ta ti thin mat has plan this all on tin mate what we transpired know would tat it if if weren't shad that on tot a i thoroughly believe it is the right decisions see open went open to make sure i military's still paid or border agents is still paid at that makes a chapel and would make upon whether i should be speak to to that fight the with well it turned out that it was not blog he was assuming a ma know he my earthy he was assuming that in the end even the rogue actors would have enough we have enough wherewithal to assume that voting entirely with democrats was he bad look and that they would come back into the full and he was wrong it turns out that the personal insentience did not a line with the rest of the republican incentives for present of the cacao takes how the other ninety six percent of the caucus my earthy said keeping the government open was the right decision because we had no alternatives that the build that i tried to advance was opposed by the say people trying to keek me out of speakership now i had a lot of republicans that won me to do it i never did it the many and i get no we really do not get along but i thought the institution was too important and thought that was too personal which he know at the end of the day keeping government open and paying our troops was the right decision i stand by that decision and then the day if have to lose my job fort be it but i get o fight for the america public and all continue t fight and as you will see people in there publican canvas from the right tide the harks left side of the canvas supported my earthy in retaining the speakerships to representing least to tannic who is a very grumpy congresswomen from new york which he is more on the left wing of the re publican hawk is yesterday she said in understand why were going out from my canthi whats to deal here cabin my earthy is a happy warrior he is tireless he passed that uniquely america grit under cabin speakership that lasted fifteen rounds of ha never giving up this republican majority has exceeded all expectations we reopen the people's house we passed the strongest borders security bill in our nation's history we passed an energy plan to unlike america enemy dominants we passed fence bills to support our troops under cabin's leadership he is brought hundreds and hundreds of by partisan members of congress to israel our greatest ally he elected the most diverse class of republicans ever with the largest number of republican women ever in america history this boy from baker field he cares deeply about his constituents his country and the america plonking taste fan he is on the left wing of the republican party then got homes masses who is very much on the right wing o the re publican party extremely stringent with regard to spending an here is massy support of mac earth yesterday is the only member who serving here who took every chance to vote against speaker painter and vote against speaker rive i can tell you that this chamber has run has been run better more cons relatively and more transparently under mister my earthy then any other speaker that i have served under as a member of the rules committee what what a three what a three conservative who were place there out of trust the speaker gave us o blocking position by putting three of us on there to keep an i on the rules committee comake sure the process with fair and even i can tell you it is ban fair an even not a doctor voting against the speaker to day get it only et republicans vote against the speaker but it'll take is a few to throw the rest to the house in two chaos and well get

the top o the page and enter a coat chipping to get started o gat what exactly was mandates his argument while was not t at he sating wit trump on this trump wanted my earthy to be speaker it wasn't hat hes siding with the ripping o the party on this ship boy homes masses they wanted my earthy to be speaker by the way you are not talk about disloyalty and america politic about the fact t my earthy has been incredibly loyal to for example present and trump and trumpets nowhere to be found in any of this just completely absent not weighing in with gates not waging in with anybody just he took up to a breather on this one meanwhile gates gets up and he assails mac earthy e give a speech of sailing him again he did not convince anybody but he did have enough of the ape would have enough of the hand of on unaligned cakes to to top him on the basis of whatever this is here is gates the prom on my friend from this a argument is that many of the bills he reference to having pass or not law we are on a fast track to an omnibus bill and it is if o colts to chant ten o over site when house policies having even sent ti to pin at a hunter bi to targumake the argument that over side is the reason to continue when it sort of looks failure theater failyour theater you's not failure theater about you apposed the say about the failure theater of what if we what if we propose a bill in congress to cot all spending and then we ended to a democraticsenante and democratic president and then if you do not not fort is because your insufficiently conservative yous a not failure theater this is failure theater and in this renown ant her failure neuter failure it is stupid failure again it is rammingyourself in the face of the brick it is dumb i of a then he wouldn't gates by the way fingers trashmiccarthy he then trashed all of his republican colleagues as well my college says wee pass the strongest border bills in history will guess li look at the border right now the did not use sufficient leverage an ta get limit or in any other thing actually get results on the border the borders o disaster really something i do nothing your gotta be campaigning on that you fix the borer and what it comes to how those rased money i take no lecture on asking patriotic america to way and contribute to this fight for those who would grovel and bend me for the lobbyists and special interests who own our leadership what i touch wo all you want who hold out this town and a bard against the future of our futureeneration this is the fault e all this ti t really s hard unholy or ones the has tor chenishetitopy i that is such stupid every element of this assumes that you are moron every single element of sumsiismoron the house passes a very strong border bill and the it turns out you know controls the senate democrat you knows the president a democrat you think any those things become on of course not and the he is i hell did not become law did it that is yourfault how is it possibly their fault they did their part they pass to bill and then it goes nowhere because know negotiation took place because of people magnates own understand that argument then he is main the case hell all fund races however a won i can take lecturers on people who are bought on pay for you are literally fund raising off of doing a thing that does not move the ball ford for conservatives one inch not one centimeter you are making money off of that you are fun raising off of that and then he is doing the the pathetic time are calls all of his colleagues corrupt but dis i just such if you fall for this grift it is a grift if you fall for this grift man have got a have got a beat up tour copy from nineteen sixty eight to sell you for five hundred thousand dollars made you will take that to because this is a grift to aye there is nothing else happening here other than a graft i can tell because there are two hundred and twenty two republicans in the house of representatives and two hundred and fourteen of them voted together and eight of them voted with demography to do enough i this is not about moccarthy this about the idea that you can make money and he can make a in the republican party right now by losing and pretending that you are winning and fighting the establishment whatever that means there have been establish me politicians ism just wondering is this chipbroy want is homes many an establishment politician who the hell are you talking about who are you even talking about bean in ain't tic lectures from mat gate ism fiscal our responsibility it i noticed i noticed that mandate was a big backer and continues to be a big and dormer of a presidential candidate who refuses to touch entitlements on principle virtually all debt in the united states is driven by entitlement programs s again he is just assuming your more on he is a cumin that when he shouts about spending an how he wants to lower it the you are going to ignore the fact that his in worse candidates who spend seven trillion dollars more money than any person in the history of america and has told never to cut settlements when he talks about how he is get a raise money and he is not con take lecture from anybody else raising money i should points out here at this point the given my earthy for all the people are saying about him even my earthy aline packs spent millions of dollars supporting various members of the campus that ended up ousting him his majority committed contribute contributed ten thousand dollars each to the campaigns of mat rosandale nancy makes antinberchat in last election cycle give five grandeach to like crane and bob good the majority committee sings to rete grand each to victorious starts warrant davidson they were all in favor a voting to vacate my earthy in the first place again this is is is just it it is it is such it is obvious that there is a group of republicans in power and in the media who think you are an idiot and are to can tell you the truth on any of these matters because they believe that if they just tell you that somebody is insufficiently conservative then that is enough there's have to prove the case there have to provide the evidence then if to gravid his strategy bet an n this this sort of theater pure purism where ism the most pure because i say that we should we should spend no money on these things does not matter if it goes nowhere doesn't matter if we get up losing elections but have been pure that is not how any of this workout i guess it is how this works if if if people celebrate bad onus and that gates is celebrating to day he got his win i do not what he can get for his win but h got is win people of call thy nan offices people say terms to your better the lord is to the better o you i to to it is the benefit of this country that we have a better speaker of the house than heaven my carththe even my earthy could not keep his word he made an agreement and canary regarding the way washington would work and he violated thou agreement we are thirty three trillion dollars on that we are facing two point to trillion dollaranual deposits we far a d polarization global that we will crush america working class america even my earthy is a feature of the swamp he has risen to power by collecting special an trust money and real distributing that money in exchange for favors we are breaking the fever now well this is breaking the fever again i to yer are you willing to destruction settlements you are about i to point you trillion dollar neffisit every year what is driving it man areyouling talk about that really i if wouldyoulike say something about thou two the candidate who you've indorse for presidents of the united states h in principal sensible not do anythingabout it again all the people wore complaining about spending i remember them complaining when there is a republican president of the united states and when there is re publican senate it son my when the can make hag gates after all this is over he treated the fight is not over now we must elect to speaker it'll get any suggestions who is out the who wants the job and now every body in congress turns into homersimpson backing into the bushes every single person in congress cause this is a job man if you have to deal with this caucus and this caucus is fractions than the very first sine that one of them can make in a nice miss an be see appearance and clear buck from a tax message that your speakership is in danger why would any one want that job it is a terrible job we my earthy did issue a closing statement as he left the speakership position her is what he had to say no let us be fair and it is wrong it you ever say they're not conservatives they voted against one the greatest cut in history that congress has ever voted for two tulip they voted against work requirements they voted against me pe re for they voted against border security they voted against got they do not get to say their conservative because there angry and their chaotic that is not the party i belong to the party of pagan was if you believed in your principles that you could govern in a conservative way they are not conservatives and they do not have the right to have the title is am he is not wrong about any of that ism gotten to know some passpeakers of the house inside the from gingridch to than to my earthy and lemme tell you when you have no power over your own caucus you do not have power that is it you democrats know this seem sport nancyplose you was able to feels fer power with tremendous authority because the democrats at least understand that in the end you vote with your party and the reason you vote with your party is to get things done young advance the ball the sort of three radical nonsense is counter productive that tweet is telling the fight is not over now we have to elect to speaker oke who who who is your preferred candidate who is the bast who is the person who you desperately want to be this part because lemme tell you if you think that his chippy chippy yesterday was blasting packages about him jordan wot people love him yore alectim jor break my from oho good representative

winning the appearance of winning is not winning shouting to walls is not winning hoping easily on yourself letting matches in winning why is carry running for senate nails on a why is that a thing that is happening cart carrylake just ran for governor vars on and lost to a wet dish magnum cations she she under performed dramatically how she would have per formed again arizona very much your is a state that should be red arizona until very recently had two red senators and a red governor in of duty now it has to blue senators any blue governor why keep dominating people who lost to not first thought she is already the governor i mean how can she be both the senate r and the governor at the same time in its it is quite a making what is what is the plan for victory what is the plan for victory and doubling down on stuff is not a plan for victory i don't understand you not else is not a plan for victory whet else not plant victory distracting from jobidin being a horrifyingly bad president that the re publican party seems bound in german to distract from that by having a primary to many candidates in ate him scout continues to run in absolutely quickie a campaign there is no reason for m to be in the campaign an the said before if one have a true interesting fight inside the republican party over who's best poise to take on jobidon he need to get rid of some of these candidates him scout i the guys there is no reason he should e on the stage him shot he is not breaking wind let along three present the poles according to politico timscott is struggling to break though an i in now vampire but a top sampan advisers privately lobbying doters to stick with him until the primary reaches his homestate of south caroling that is absurd he is not on a wind south caroling he is notion running out running nickel clean south caroling he is not o down trump in south caroling what we will get he is just a bunch of candidate staying in until south caroling trample wind by default and maybe that is what you want but that does not seem a we it nominating process to me in terms of giving america a real choice he needn't consolidate the feel pretty obviously but again the intensive stricter for every candidates stay in as long as humanly possible rathe n simply saying my candidate has no purpose ism out and go back to being a successful senator an a great guy from the state of south caroling instead ism just going to stay in meanwhile on the trump front dona trump spending his days in the courtroom now gan that is not his fault he is being prosecuted for no apparent reason in at new york the prosecuting him for fraud despite the fact that the people hes supposedly defrauded say that they did not reason his assertions of value in order to issue loans for example he would say yet my apartment is worth a bajulian dollars and its three times the size it is and the lone officer would then say it'll hate you organ to organ to our own appease and the they would do it base on the apparel and now that you're going after i flight to fifty millintimes understand it stupid and the can see how how drummed up all of this is and there's a a pool camera i inside the courtroom the other day then the honestly the objects of this are awkward and weird you have got letitia names who is in the backgran she is the g of new york who is been pledging for years scuff coronal true and she is a glaring at trump in the background and then the camera makes its way round to judge anger who is t e judge in this case was a liberal democrat i such mugging for the cameral roast and stupid he hearts with the pool cameral look you're more likely hat camera o be y you in suing in stand wit ten humane was us er that bungler it is all in rested the bellman on god when we are trump a yon this o her the o work if she is a crown show she is glaring and trunk et the play after to a see on trump u well be either kill with a when they robin trill and then a a camera personas owning his way around the room avens is we i r o annoy in in con an o on e camera o i the or ground an but hero to on our country is such clowncho it is such a clownchobe do you is any of this likely to make your biding not president that is all i care about make job not the resident any more two thousand twenty four that she be the campaign slogan and again is on drums fault they'd been dragged into court in this particular case but if the entire campaigns an revolve around the stuff he is not in win if the entire campaign is about dona drums legal troubles he is not going to win well now he is been told to watch what he says that post or risk landing up behind bars frump to month in the second day of the former presidents financial fraud trial much rather engrain just issue t limited gaged against every one in miscible case to stop verbal and social medeorlated posts post it swipes to members of his staff personal attacks on members o my qourtstaff or unacceptable not appropriate en grow made clear tuesday after trump took a partisans swing at the judge as principle law clerk algin greenfield on trumps truth social platform calling what trump did pot a disparaging untrue and personally identified post about a member of my staff negro only sited one of the defendants is one behind the post but i was obviously referring to true then now t e leave post greenfield and picture standing next to chuckshumer and calls her summer's roll friend with this long history of going on offense to days the first time any judge as put the restrains of a gagger on trump that is according to deadline by the way en baron would love nothing better than to put donate trump behind bars for a month he would love it would be this favorite thing in the entire world trump for his part he is campaigning against the grossly in competent and fraugunalent the tissue names i notice is not the can presidents of the united states ism not blaming trump for going on offense on the stuff by point is if the entire rates is a bag dona's drums legal troubles he is not going to win i know the s an audacious claim but if the entire campaign is about that his chances victory are a lotslemer than they would be if the opposite were true democrats know this which is why they are doing it now that can be unfair it can be wrong it is unfair and it is wrong all those things are true also you do not my to priority is t e conservative not jo biding be job hoping president that is my top priority i do not what there doing t trumping it is very bad we should debut we should all contribute to dona's trumps legal defense fun and then we might wont thing by nominating counted who is not on to spend the next eight months in the court room spending every every dollar that goes into his campaign fun on legal lies and here is trump yesterday going after out the visa names all i he gain he is not wrong about any of that also what is already talking bout today now the should be talk mantis the economic news to the economic news for trobidnis awful an recession as i been saying for month what goes up must come down it went up house can come down where the economy's going people are holding the money and cash every invested i know right now is waiting to see what happens with prices the cause a mentally when the economy goes down that is when everything goes on smile of the store lot of people are waiting to buy up assets when they hit when they hit the skids right now that ben artificially bugged by inflation but they are going to go down as can take a little while for the economy come back recession is probably around thequorana shouldn't that be top of mind for most america in fact it is top of mind for most america unless they are focused in on due crap unless they are focusing on stupidity i an there is a reason democrats are doing the strategically democrats our putting trump in the dog in order to make that the top issue you make say o they will let let us defend trump by making him the nominee then you are you are in fact living democrat what they want because what they do want is trump in the dock as the nominate they can only control one part of that putting trump in the o they cannot control the other part making him the nominate wen i get the emotional temptation to say oka well they they they want it let us give it to him woodland heard the prom is is that going to work is that likely to work is the going to be beneficial or not they're many issues on the democrat side the out to talk about again democrats should be historically on popular right now if politics were working wage should work wright now democrats would gotten blown out in the last election cycle republicans would control the senate republicans lost to least four senate seats they shouldhave won in the last election cycle which would have given them a fifty three sept majority in the senate republicans should have had a housemajority not of four or five or sexpots they should have had a housemajority of twenty every one knows this is the case but again frustrationwen the entire system is is leading people to a think with with lower parts of their anatomy rather than their brain as not going to end well on can meanwhile one of the things that make be america by one talk about is the giant crime wave that is now in golfing at the nation again in cities all over the united states have mobs of roving criminals or town criminal things and now they have been at least two left saying journalist social justice advocate soul who have been

circular firing squad and go to town ut a time for some things i and then some things that i hate just as democrats can you for ass inside the republican party i can root for case inside the democratic party gave news announced a woman me lafanza butler who is actually a gerrymander for united states senate he put out a tweeting ism proud to announce californium's new united states sextet lafanza butler as we morn the enormous loss of enter finest the very freedoms she fought for reproductive are coequal protection safety from gun violence have never been under greater assault lafanza

next time all be an out know war between atom shift and barber lee but you cannot ism it'll make you the senator but your not permanent instead he is just throwing her in there and now the democratic

thirty six billion dollars out standing to the international monetary fun and they now face another default they received ta fifty seven billion dollar bail out just five years ago thanks to out f con trial spending argentina has had to print past is hand over fist which is why according to the ministry of the economy total money supply in argentina sky rocketed thirty point seven per cent every year from two thousands haven two tho two thousand and twenty two poverty rate in the country is cornily forty per cent i man i wonder why people might want a change well delay comes into office promising serious gut his media appearances may be colepral with that all serves a purpose a determination to make massive change to argentines economic trajectory mayday has promised to slash and

to day we retake to path make is country grate to my we en radiating is the libertarianism ciao this model ofdecodents has come to an end of there is no turning back his reforms include closing the central bank that is the institution printing money hand over fist mile recognizes the reality inflation has crippled argentines ability to recover he is called pesos garbage not even useful as fertilizer which is true they are worth pretty much zero in argentina all this should be treated is good news argentines trajectory has been a total disastraria for decades despite the glorification of paganism at the hands of hollywood and in fact the markets a treating delays election as they should argentine stockman bonds have jump on plays election mainly because he is the first leader of argentina in generations who has a plan who actually avoid economic defeat miles election should be treated by the united states as the possible opening of a new era in south and satin america along with all savidoran present ai buckle a new wave of conservative governments may be building in the global south that would be incredible given the called pink wave that has washed across the continents over the course of the last two years then why the heartburn the answer is there are many in the united states in rope particularly on the political left especially in the media who somehow feel more comfortable with the socialist radicalism of bull de sofa gabon boric even nicholas maduro then with any one who smacks of libertarianism or conservatism that is because argentina is a living example of what happens when corporatism and social democracy are taken to their limits the substitution of government for markets the overregulation of industry in pursuit of social redistribution's the attempts to create acari being everything produced in country the attrit protections and trade restrictions the dependency theory marks his nonsense that is dominated satin in south america politics for two generations the endless populous promise that if all power is given to the government to protect the people all will be well that promise always results in privation and misallocation in tyranny and poverty relay's victory represents that realization left to label delay the worst slower they can think of she is just donate now the media and the political left will attempt to shovel all of argentines failures on relay's shoulders meal is walking into a hornets nest into a room that is completely on fire medley still faces a partly parangs legislature as well as a court system stacked in favor of left is foolishness the supreme sort magistrate poracioros toy recently said that any attempt to polarize meaning to get rid of the past and instead substitute the dollar would be unconstitutional and violation of national sovereignty this means that delays power may be curbed he still faces intrenched economic problems including a hurt of valuable currency to move toward polarization there are not enough passes to trade for dollars to get the country's currency back on solid footing he will require an infusion of foreign capital in order to write the ship in argentina and then if he comes up short capitalism and economic liberalism will be blamed for the failures of generations of paganism this by the want is always the pattern corporatism ruin economies and then capitalism gets the blame this was the story of the two thousand even twothousinate economic crisis in which the federal government subsidized sub prime mortgages at exorbitant rates and then when everything fell down they blamed capitalism but meat can succeed investors need to look stout to put their money wear their mouth is to insure that argentina realizes its potential as a massive source of prosperity wealth and power and that a lions with the united states and the west grow stronger as a result in just one second will get to more on the situation in argentina first this is your last chance to takecamanage of birch gold black fridayety also as we talk about the economic problems in argentina and the problems debasing an entire currency the west soon enough is going to have to debases currency because of the exorbitant amounts of at that been piled a top economies that of the united states we are now approaching forty trillion dollars in national debt an were got way beyond that right now when you open a gold pray for every ten grand you spend by remember twenty second birch gold will send you a free gold bar but you have ten bend to ninety eight

gold claim your eligibility before black fridge to receive a free gold b are with qualified purchase that is been to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight meanwhile in domestic news the poll numbers keep on coming for jobidon and they are absolutely horrifying if you are jobidon you should be greeted the hell out bran new hazard harrispole and every result in this pole is awful for jobidon just truly truly bad why what because hes one a terrible job governing right now the pole shows country right track or wrong track wrong track fifty eight per cent right track thirty five per cent yours economy right track wrong track right track thirty five per cent wrong track fifty eight per cent about forty eight per cents of america say that their personal financial situation is getting worse only thirty per cent say that it is i proving bison's approval rating is still stuck at the very very low rate of forty five per cent in this hazard harrispole his approval on handling most of the key issues is currently under fifty per cent in fact the only numbers where he is over fifty per cent are's handling of coronaviris for whatever reason and stimulating jobs which just just because in the natural outgrowth of moving past cove for jobs o be added to the america economy every single other question he is under water including the economy where his at forty four per cent the democratic party over all by the way is out pacing jobidon in these numbers the democratic parties approval rating is fifty two per cent negative forty eight per cent positive which is still better than the grope which by teenage is demonstrates the absolute wizardly in competent of the grope it is amazing jobidon is the president the democrats run the centare and somehow republicans are still less popular as a party then the democratic party which is kind of amazing as far as the presidential election jobidon is now according to this pole trailing significantly against dona trump and and most pole analysts now think the tunnel trump has a small but measurable need in this turns election cycle if you lo it the primaries trump has a major advantage on everybody in the primaries grope primary first or second choice according to this hazard harispole dona true seventy four per cent on to cent is thirty seven nick hailed twenty four awake twenty three everybody else ten or below in ahead ahead against to cantus or hailed trump is above seventy five per cent against the artist seventy five twenty five a against nickel hale eighty one to nineteen most of the trump voters in the primaries they say that they prefer him to all the other candidates obviously but not only that they say they might think about changing but its not can be based on any sort of criminal conviction meanwhile three and five voters say jobidon should not run for a second term only one in two say the same for trump demeans fifty nine per cent say the jobidonsiouln't run only half say the denotrump should not run n now fifty eight per cent say they would consider a third party candidate but when it comes to a head to head right now here is the head to head bidders is people nominee horse race fit the twenty twenty four election for present were held to day and o as between trump the republican and bison the democrat who is you vote for that is stay to day is trump plus seven forty eight to forty one eleven per cent undecided if you include people leaning one way or the other this is why there is a critical pollectuallates the first poll have seen that has donate true significantly over fifty per cent is hazard derris pole has dona trump up six at fifty three to forty seven which they blow out for dona trump if this s at three waylays and you include robot of kenned trump is still up a forty one for trump thirty for for bison eight per cent for do not know on sure seventeen per cent for a if cay junior if you include leaders trump is still up eat per cent he is still up right per cent if you include for example oil stone or coral lest by the way that the the entire case just poll speaking again this coming from somebody white primary would vote ford rondosantis above dona trump but the reality is what these poles are showing is serious tor ability for dona trump against jobidon why the answer is because people known trump he is a known quantity people one already factored in all of his flaws all f his foibles all of the crazy all this slow is already make into the take and it is very difficult to think what could dona trump due that would truly alienate a large segments of the electorate this point now again it maybe that all the folk is don bide right now this is the going theorizing the democratic party the when you swivel that that is potty back on to trump in the up coming year that his poll numbers are gin crater that is a theory now it maybe it is true maybe it is not this pole shows by the way at any race between jobidon and on to mantis that race looks even or bison plus three if it looks it if if you look it trump verse is derris trump be derris by twelve points if it were bison fer snicker valley bison is up one on nickel valley again why because nickel whale's numbers it forty one per cent this hands his numbers are forty two per cent bison is still at forty two or forty five per cent with for the same numbers yo would have against trump except that everybody knows trump and we already move over to the guide they already know there is something to the known quantity and these poll numbers are devastating for jobidon they are awful for guidon every single element of this pole is terrible for jobidon now what what is underlingthess there are few thing that urnelingthes one thing that is underlying this obviously is the fact that jobidon has been really a o policy and on every single policy issue people ten to fave or republicans over democrats o this point except for per has abortion and the election is not can be run on a portion of trump is the nominee because nobody perceives trump as particularly per life because hes not campaigning as somebody who particularly proline he says i got red er row my job here is done and that's actually not eight a stupid political attitude to say when it comes to federalization of the abortion issue it is actually something that was sort of tried by let younker in virgin and for all the tog by how did not work it kind it did virginity a very blue state and pretty much everything that was within a biding plus nine what republican in virgin because glen younker took u fifteen week position on abortion because that is a very purple state purple to blue hell nationally speaking trump its avoiding the abortion issue which means sort takes it off the table and the it just be comes a rerendim up or down on did you the country better when trumpets running it or did you the country better when tobidon is running it combine that with the fact that every one things that you biding his tool than got a real problem on your hands yesterday in your times o peter baker you sang the white house is doing its best to down plate jobidon's age is birthday has happened over he past couple of days hes eighty one years old which means that by the time he left the presidency he would be eighty six years old which is super old that is seven years past the life expectancy of the average magical i an your biding is not he is ailing he does not look good here is peter baker from he your times your the basgrat old noting i mean not i loathing in public about to day star call tan ion tot el sell pain drive at up an a toast o is family when he goes up tomorrow for the a tax giving holiday an look it o i mean it is what it is that white house then thin is tar tired talk in bout this issue but it is one o the most sallies issues out the counting to all the poles that the be not is the talk people think hes told is the to mad downer cast from the point of view the i house the the is too old a satin on it is ha is a hard think tin the can bens other wise now which i same for the while house is look judge in by his record in is performance a us to last to we salon a present who is not only banging with this war in the it a lease may be not through bags liking but certainly she showing great energy in doing but also reading with the leading leader chide out with leaders as leaders blat america would leads from trap i leader mexico and son and hat his demonstration through is performance that he can do the job and well that is not how the

honor o black fridge go to heck sleep got come slashed us cod hell's partner twenty five is the best offer yet sunken last long with helices better sleep starts right now a again the going concern is that mobile is on to lose the election in large pare because he is to all men obviously the world's none could ship and that gets attributed to whoever is the precedent at the time me dona trump was running into severe headwinds in twenty twenty at the black lives matter riots he had bovid he had world economic melt down a had a lot going on but jobidon is having that that same sort of issue the thing is it is all self created as i said when join was elected that to was the luckiest kin world he walked into a situation n which tonal trump had handed off to him the graham cord top piece in the middies burgeoning a a rat relatively contain china a relic civil contain rustressy is a very peaceful foreign front dona trump gave to him a vain roll that plan that jobidon use for good or ill but was able to claim that he was the one who hid actually put upon the land the economy was already in recovery by cut four of twenty twenty and continued to be in recovery after that except slower under hoiden join was handed the keys to the car and the car was running and ten he proceeded to just blow it completely screwing cup avid axelrod the former adviser to berokoboma he says quote i thing has a fifty fifty shot here no better than that may be a little worse he thinks he can cheat nature here an it is really risky the have got a real prom at their counting on trump to win it for them i remember killer doing that too axelrod re gently suggested that bison should could re consider his reelection bid prompting ire from the president who reportedly called the strategist a m a word that rhymes with chic his on solicit advice followed in yourtimsiena college all that job widen trailing trump among voters an five key battle ground states and again this is the reality the reality is that right now dona trump has a lead on jobidon trying to pretend other rise is really really silly and if you take a look at all of the latest poles they show trump with a significant advantage in battle ground states for example latest poles from michigan from epic am are jo trump up five over jobidon presidential lichen pull from dipsos his nonmember thirteenth to fourteen trump plus too from you gob trump plus one from entire news trump plus too in fact it is very difficult to find national pull in which trump is not leading jobidon at this point in that the serious prom obviously for for present abandon and a lot of this again is exacerbated by the fact that everyone knows he is told now i think old is a catchall i think if people tough he was doing an a making job the old thing would not count if you were old and everything was great he would oka he is a charming elderly fell but because everything is garbage everybody is looking at jobidngoing this i cannot handle the crisis the s k cannot handle any of this the my initiated the crisis gramps pilled the beans they are all over the floor this was all exacerbated by jobidon's performance and the performance of hi social mediation every time jobidon goes on stage as i said before it is watching nick willed walk a cross a tight rope over a volcano is it every time he goes up a set of stairs you are wondering if god forbid s the end of his presidency the is the stairs might to feed him every time he gets on teleprompter you are wondering whether con o make it through the sense and this ben on going since the last elections likely and twenty twenty during the to bates the big question was we will jobidon physically survive the abates then he did not people a wow he all performed expectations he still breathing well the same thing is going on except worse because he has visibly degraded between twenty twenty and now for example yesterday he was codons botching his lines over and over and over his something he does lot we never come out of a situation tat i a i that be better o point om thou ais can get er liberty o have a e trot competition e the work and paciorse' be willing to travel over a bout a mile e can say i hard get a tic it tot it a tho or r i i i to anal can sorcerer to but if a all of that was exacerbated by what i think might be these single worsting to grandest of all time jobidon's media's him is not down you any favors it was his birthday and jobidon's ins to gram team put up be following post a the s a picture of jobidon for those who cannot see and the caption says turns out on your one hundred and forty sixth birthday you run out of space for candles now i know they are trying to be self to facing bah up y there is many things wrong with this is hard to know where to begin for the who cannot to the picture it is jobidon gripping the table gripping it as though he is about to suffer from a tremendous coronary and keel over he is grip he is a white knuckling the table he is he is stretching out he is white knuckling the table and he is grinning the rictus grin into the camera men he looks in comfortable he looks can allot ye no in a the devil's advocate over here ready to out ready to offer you a deal for your soul the reason he looks that it is because his team one's got look to thinking i soft lot thewhen i fire saw the image i thought it was a ye i seriously got ooh a my i thought somebody went into an ai generator and said job bison devil eighty first birthday he we because they put a cake in front of him and they did not apparently want to put the candles that you meteor your seven year old birthday party where just says seven on it they do not want in eight and one the is out underscore that he said he one years old and really old instead they put eighty one candles on the cake and then they lit the thing on fire and it looks a city burning down that cake looks the great chico fire that cake looks a nuclear explosion i mean it is all coming together in a hell fire banana of catastrophic proportions it is the dog me jiff it is amazing and it is and it is frontlet genuine turn on the lights in the room properly he he is sitting there and the fire is is balancing off his face lighting up a devilish amebic what are they thinking what are they thinking you are underscoring one he is too old to do the job too the world is on fidelity it is the easiest joke in the entire world this t onto be the closing of every single republican ad from now until the election job bison sat the world on fire picture of him with a giant cake with a giant fire rite in front of him as as those going a tost marshmallows on the cake and he is unbelievable it is unbelievably stupid what is his social medioteem doing they should all be fired to from a political point of view that is the biggest self goal have seen in modern america politics for last couple of years minimum really bad stuff well all of this is underscoring a serious prom obviously for jobidon careen show pierce also has nobility's actually spin jordan positively she is just awkwardly out there trying to talk pass the graveyard the literal graveyard at this one i here is a green shop pierce talking about the president's stamina and a abilities i would pit the president famine present t wisdom ability to get this done on behalf o the america people a get anyone any one any day week ah ye you would put his stability and stamina above anyone literal any one any day of the week would you though would you i men do not think the america people would this of course the major problem and there the a lot of democrats work con of falling off the manwaggons here is the thing join requires hill to turn out another one dona trump did in fact generate extremely civil to turn out on both sides on both sides but democrat's also benefited as we all know from changing the rules there are an enormous number of mean ballast into thousand and twenty that that extraordinary number of male and ballast and early voting ballast that went that the total number of votes jumped sky rocketed and an that obviously benefit when you get the the fringe voter the lo information voter the voterwho does not normally vote to vote in vast numbers what you went up with is typically more benefit for democrats the the giant spike in male an ballast during twenty twenty something that was en courage by the democrats and discouraged foolishly by dona trump that obviously benefited jobidon mean according to reports from twenty twenty one the associate o press fewer than one third of voters casting ballast in the presidentiallection did at a pulling place on election day two thirds of the votes two thirds of them came in viamaleand ballast that is insane in twenty sixteen twenty eighteen about a quarter of all voters used male ballet that jump to more than forty three per cent in twenty twenty forty three per cent of them voted viemalean ballast the re raining voters either cast their ballet at a pulling place or during early voting and that early voting was of course puss very much by democrats and discouraged by pressed in trump what what if people just do not vote the same way in to than twenty four i very few election analysts actually believe we can get the same voter turn out in twenty twenty floor that we got twenty twenty in twenty twenty was rife with all sorts of issues first of all the democratic white heat about dona trump second black lives matter protest third bovid by all of that generated extraordinary levels voter turn out and again in courage people two male in their ballad because youyou ware doing everything from home there is it the is difference by the way between a world in which are literally doing everything from home working from home never going to a move theater never t never going out to eat and then this just another thing ore doing at home as you fill out ball t you ended ink that is literally hire doing everything and a world in which you actually are engaged in the regular world than now you are probably going to take time out and get go vote well that is t a system that does not benefit the marginal voter that jobidon realizes upon the enthusiasm for bison is through the floor democrat's now this but they are convinced that dona trumpet's bag candidate that they are going to count on him to lose the election that that is really what this is ye you can see the roiling under current of dissatisfaction with jobidon from one of the great luminaries car time carry be ti she shut put up a post that is on pretty viral in which she basely threatens by now to i thing a carry people and o voting for jobidon of course because a gain a lot of the people whore very annoyed with sidelight now they will come home but it is on to be enough to defeat donate trump who has extremely high levels of enthusiasm among republicans here is what is going on right now inside the electric republicans are very enthuse to vote for dona trump democrats are not very enthuse to vote for jobidon democrats are counting on democrats to be enthused to vote against dona from make that works and maybe that does not the reality is that killer canton lost in twenty sixteen because she was not able to replicate the levels of enthusiasm particularly with minority voters that they had for barackobama that is why she l out jobidin is in very similar danger that was covered up for in twenty twenty because o the pandemic it is covered up for because of the tonal trump of it and black lives matter of movement and all the rest of it in twenty twenty for will that be replicated i do not know cry here is carte what is what is laresabout carte and this is not the first time that she is rant about economics is that carte many people who are of the left she is close to seeing the thing but she cannot see the thing here she is railing about the fact the new york city is now cutting services then she idiotically blames federal spending for that which of course has nothing to do with it if she actually understood maybe how economics works and the work city has to cut services because the tacks are too high the regulations are too high they do not have enough money coming in they're spending to much went maybe she might think differently about government she does not but she is blaming trobidin for it there she was the other day and you are your there is ta hundred and twenty million butty cut there is a hundred and twenty million butt cutting new york that is going to a went schools public libraries and om to police the part yo o o all cops ben get is what it is there is there be an a hundred twenty million doll butty cut withscools wit the libraries and the to and the police the party and the five million doter butty cut and sanitation o o butty cut insanity o on be on rat a and two the go to cutin i no for e comet a hunter hundred main tot a butt cut in new you city wit for om far schools library o police to antanitacy yet a be cabo la yer we e fun to work we e unto wort to a o about we do not got it when we got it at we the great tasty no awe no re to o om for now o are not now i that she is blaming the federal government for this an me hetero governess wen for a lot of things are not to blame for the fact in your city has busted it is budget over and over and over by the way she is wrong about the numbers he projected gap in terms of budgeting is five billion dollars for the next fiscal year in new york city the e or city budget by the ways a hundred billion dollars a year it is the largest annual butcher of anywhere in the country but she is close to the thing she is close to the thing which is where's all money going where you spending all this money she is never going get there but when people are dissatisfied they are not going to show up for the party that they blame for the dissatisfaction hardtop win trump for a the bad things that are

come slash black fridge do not miss out on the best deals of the year if you are democrat anchor freaking out about hoiden probably losing to trump at this point if the election ere held today well there is only one thing you can do and that is you got to go back into the old grab bag of grumpy issues and that means trumpet littler yep get ready for that thing all the way from now until the election then your times headline last night quote trumps my your words raised new fears about his off forterian bent w ah you scared yet an shivering down your spine that is right the the orange gentleman who is sitting at farrago twisting in all caps that dude just he sitter reminder he settler that that is that is on to be their pitch from now until the election cycle donate j trump rose to power with political campaigns that largely attacked external targets including immigration from predominantly muslin countries and from south of the united states mescal border but now in his third presidential bid some of his most vicious into basing attack have been leveled at domestic opponents during a veteran stay speech mister trump yous language that echoed authoritarian leaders rose to power in germany an italy in the nineteen thirties degrading his political adversaries is german when he'd to be rooted out supposed to jobidon literally did a speech in front of independent hall lit up blood red in which he called his ultra man opponents traitors to the country flanged by marines in the background yes authoritarianism were were deeply word about from tonal trump the threat from outside force is trumps that is far less sinister and dangerous and grave than the threat from within but by the way that is ideologically true we h united states is not an existential danger from china or pushup or commas or was bell or on all this horrible countryman and terristentities could do terrible things taws but are the an existential danger no it turns out the existential danger to the united states as always with a great country and a great power comes from within but s as the centimes this inward turn has sounded new alarms among experts ah the experts they are here to save job the experts on autocracy wave long worried about mister trump's praise for florin dictators can disdain for democratic ideals get is it the same media that praise they praise hula in braille these are the same people who have warm words for g in china in it it is while is just while scholars democrats and anti trump republicans are asking a new how much mister trumperesembles current strong men abroad and how he compares to authoritarian leaders the way you mean opponents of dona trump a asking whether he teller no this is new perhaps most urgently they are wondering whether his rhetorical turn into more factious sounding territory is just his latest public provocation of the left in evolution in his believe or the dropping of vale ism what exactly are the things that they are were he is going to do quote his ambitions include using the justice department to take vengeance on his political rivals i this is my this is my confused face jobidon is literally using the justice department to targadonal trump right now right now dona trump is bout to face for separate trials going into the next year three of them are completely specious the only one that has any relevant to it criminally speaking whatsoever is the class document's case and jobidon also miss hartal class i documents and did hillreclinton and then bleach bit her her actual arrives yah oh my god dona trump i caponize the do ja just barakobama and jobidon also he is plotting a vast expansion of presidential power and is telling idea logically in line lawyers in see positions no wait wait you mean the executive branch is going to people it is going to be peopled by those who agree with the presidents of the united states he cannot have that and as we know jobidon and berakobama they were famous for appointing people with the vast panoply of beliefs across the political spectrum to political positions in their administrations erickholder who literally called himself the presidents wing men mister trumps allies dismiss the concerns as alarmism and cynical political attacks seven chon campaign spokesman responded to criticisms of the german remarks by saying it came from reactive liberals whose quote sad miserable existence will be crushed when president trumpery turn the spiciousfoot i do ah i do love the people hoar around true because is just is just insane doubling down it is just it is just insane doubling down hi true says the german thing and then they go to his campaign and does that sound muslin is no no does not sound muslin blood alone moves the wheels of history o but that is comfort in any case it is a clownshor alltheway down but again the medal got here is to ding trump as offer as possible and then to say that hes such a threat thatyou have to elect the dead old eye in the corner some experts on authoriturn ism said that while mister trumps recent language has begins to more closely resemble that used by leaders hitter or muslin he is not quite juror famous leaders of the past still they say he does exhibit traits similar to cogent strong men victor run of hungary or a sept type groan turkey how does he resemble undone you mean the guide who took complete control of the atomist military in in turkey and who is been continuously ruling place for twenty years that that one arts him out organ who is a democratically elected leader you might not how he runs the country but they have elections an those elections are actually relatively clothes in any case this is the entire stick this is who my melburg of prison b c of course don late night chose because this is the way that works is that if you are an names it is all cross pollinated of a melburg on prison b c but he's not really animus and he see he is on late night with set mires on end c because he is such an important person talking about how if you vote for trump that might be the last vote overcast booths is such absolute sheer nonsense it is just nonsense you heard from the right you herd from the left all the times the next selection will be the last lection know don't it is not on to be i'mjuston and ton prediction take it to the bank the next selection will not be the last election of your lifetime in the united states ism not sure about much i m one hundred percent sure about that if ism wrong i will eat this pen a dangerous bat here is ta are member doing this ruin if you have some one whoever it may be in this case i total true who literally try to overthrow democracy instead of leave office peacefully if that person takes power gan it is not a second turn they are taking a life turn and i don't think the contras to wake up to that it is not just ta second times a life turn we are talking that is of what who's we have covered and the criminal legal contact is lithely going on trial for evert over through the election in that the legal process and he is presumed incised he could still walk but in the political electoral process if you were going to give your vote tost one whole has already tried to steal your vote very blotlyographically and publicly that might be the last vote you get to cast something really think about i think this clip would only be that thing slip could only get better if we're an infinite regress of are members it quotes himself on n b c with south mires and then he cuts from are melburg to more are melburgh so think we have just continue doing that all the way down the luck again this is such nice try i me nice try you are you are right the famous take over him is imminent or maybe it never happened when trump was the president the first time maybe there is that i just one saconall get to the latest from it the middle east first have got a holiday gifts i dead that sure to make you the hero of the season for ladies

every order to day is instantly upgraded to free expressiipping that is genuses dot come slash o per to day again genuselldot come slash chipeiro meanwhile the government of the israel is seriously considering or will soon a prove the possibility of some sort of temporary stop to the fighting in order to free hostages apparently in a deal broker by costar this literally the only reason that costar is still in much with the last is to broker these sorts of deals apparently the is rally government is societies the real he security cabinet which is comprised o right left and center the they are deciding right now as to wether to a prove a deal in which fifty hostages would be free dozens more possibly to be freed in return come ass would get some three hundred palistinians among them some women and miners there would be a stop to the fighting as the releases go ahead apparently according to some reports israel ad stop using drones to monitor parts or all of gesso for several hours to day during the seas fire which seems totally in shine to me a is your brokering that deal just allowing the terrify to run around free for several hours whalyou allow the hostages to be release that seems wild to me s the move around a the weapon a in all their terrorism and you do not have any sort of of window into what they are going that the problem in the first place again that the big problem is that the president was set by the is rally government years ago than return for one soldier gulogially they least one thousand palistinian prisoners wear actual terrors and now obviously withthat pressed an set that is whycamas took the the prisoners in the first place benisons is the war cabinet minister he said the return of the hostages would help win the war he said we are non extremely sensitive days for his rally society their turn of the hostages a moral order and also an integral part of the resilient that allows us to win the war it is important to say that especially these days is rally society as a whole right and left is praying in wishing for the safe re turn of the hostages apparently it is going to be largely women and children we are going to be returned at this at this time it is unclear wen exactly this is going to to stars colossus chief is male honey has claim that the the truce is close and the prisoner exchange is nearly settled again that would be a five days sees fire and entrée of three hundred eight trucks to the godship ice crisis only going to prolong the war from israel for effective the basic idea would be after five days there going back after five days that is still not over there still hostages wo are being held there is the possibility they've ben talking about that the sees fire would hold for longer if comose continues to release hostages the problem is that every day that cross does not release the hostages and brokers for more time they are shifting weapons around there and betting more with civilian populations there of course shipping in more she maniterrianaide that as then stolen by comes prolonging the for sot israel basic bargain here is that they are willing to allow for the prolongation of the conflict in order to get more of the hostages home now the good people on both sides of that particular argument suffice it to say that the war is not over when the hostages are return the war continues until colossus eradicated and i might make it difficult it might mean that more as badly soldiers die nor get those hostages home that is the mat that israel is doing right now we should remember again this thing was initiated not by the mere taking of hostages whose initiated by the greatest single terror attack on the west since nine eleven that is what is initiated here just remind you here is a piece of tape that has now been released by these really government you will see in the state commons terrace on october seven they shoot one than age girl dad a second than age girl they run down and a she they force her to her need she then proceeds to beg for her life and they shot her directly in the head you can see the comose terrace they run that that is one girl who just got shot in in the head by a terrace the terrace than runs down the tether girl she pleads for her life on the side of the road the commons terrace just stands there she is pleading and then you will see he raises his gun and he shoots her directly in the head killing her these i the kind of people that israel is fighting just because his real gets its hostages back does not mean that this war is even close to over he is the executes her nosy style there is literally indifference between what this personnel and what a noisy would do none the war is not over when the hostages return by the way this war is going to be broader than that because israel has a lot of enemies who wish to destroy it meanwhile i it worth noting that israel actually has evacuated babies too egypt according to the associate press egypt state on medius a babies evacuated from gosesan battle shelf a hospital have now arrived in egypt remember israel suppose tore the baby killing country while nope it turns out only one side in this conflict once dead babies and that is commons that at least is being made clear by john curly over the national security advisory i he is saying that he was asked yesterday by it crazed reporter whether israel committing genocide and he is to know i said this the other day again people can say what they want on onside a a ta a we respect ta that is tat the first of moments about but this war genocide's getting thrown around and a pretty interpret a a not to different folks e what hammer want make no mistake about it is genocide they want a white israel the a they have said publicly more than one occasion infant just recently and they've said that they are not in a stop what happened on the seventh tethers can happen again and again and again and what happened on the seventh of october mud slaughter of innocent people in their homes are at a music festival that is genocidal intentions well yes obviously true those matter the media are doing there best in order to create a moral equivalence the washing con post which is just a come hospropagan ta ruled at thisplants o truly amazing a piece by habamah lose and sire at the touch another goes a hospital caught in fighting as storms deep an civilian misery heavy is really bombardments counted north and southgosanmody killing more civilians and once again bringing hospitals into the crossfire was the conflict entered its forty this day with few signs of let up now again remember the larsuasel less media cline that ill she for hospital was not actually terra headquarters it was a terrors headquarters they literally drag hostages into all she to hospital directly from the fossa envelope and huge sanity legs media not who is it can we really trusted s a terrace a terrace had course brush to now they are doing the same thing with intension hospital again the idea is that israel is targeting these hospitals the only reason israel has remote interest in these hospitals is because these are used routinely regularly as part of worse strategy by camaswhi do the that because they know the credulous morons in the media continued to repeat that every hospital is a non military site even if the hospital is clearly been used as a military sight en there just to man people out there where doing the propaganda to work of comas clearly from the protestors o are out in the streets to the legs he media that something that is daily president as the curia pagan is a member of the political last use a leader in the labor party he said this yesterday well he was on fox news we a face be tween hey coalition of the hate a coalition of they i can in darkness which is a ghazi condition which mana montero with i with its proxies an ta banning got o cops by camps in man with the whotisan o to treating is lame can talent via is an all over the world which ones tor a them of all of us if is on one there then pro will been in the united that e to shore because they call a united fate the big fatal and that is why i think this protest a supporting mamas there there actually a comprises to the whole notion that you can much yon children that you can so pads of women that you can ray women and pragnentwomen that you in of today all tagolca soviets and you can do a hold bacon acrostic and because the obtain i sap coma that is wat they don he is right about all of that another people sing all my gossip cans to the protest of course the hoping comas the is there goal the goal is to help compass what they would is forever seas fire is declared here to be made more permanents to leave come ass control of the southern portion of the gastric there by to hand them a victory well they still hold hostages by the way but even if all the hostages were to be released to morrow israel still have a moral duty to track down and kill all the members of comose and any one else who is complicit and helps in the october seventh attacks the protestors are trying to stop that becusethey want to leave comose in control meanwhile the soft headed liberals in the united states they continue to focusing on the real problem and the real problem is the antisemitism of melon mosque that is the thing that really matters that is thin caraswisher who i mean she just has a raging something for a for elonmusque caraswisher again she believes that she should rule all social media this is why at one point shathaly interviewed sudan sudan woshkicky who is the head of a out and she she asked seriously whether a they could possibly band myvidos from you to because it turns out the cars wisher's kid likes myvidios and doesn't that in any case i she is now accusing bill amen who is a major venture capitalist of hypocrisy because he is defending melon must who is not antis metic well quod quote docking college kids by doing she means putting their faces on posters because they actively signed a petition in favor of come not the same thing here is caraswisherd again the real antisemitism is zealonmusq according to the soft headed left in the united states none of them mot shat you the one who is really stop up tantisemism is cars wisher by was those kids they are not docs no prepuce published the homodress nobody publish the one numbers if you sign a letter you're a public person because you have signed a public letter that is the way that works but again all the folks has to be in tuque obviously ut because we all know the real reason which the swisher just tatesmoque and wants him take him down and whatever is the tool at at the disposal of the left they will use calling muskerasis cline n anti some calling whatever they can do in order to take him down that is the gold it is all just convenience well folks the news has been dark and terrible of lay but ism excited is

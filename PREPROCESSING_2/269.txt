rebec remembers exactly when you learn the astonishing truth shes second grate i man in to were best run rather its school one day and she pulled me aside and and said last night at you know i lost the tooth and i woke up well the toothfairy was putting the money under my pillow and guess to the toothfairy was it said o my god who was it i i have to know and she said my dad my dad is the toothfary and i remember running home after school and telling my ma'am mim i know we the toothfairyous and declaring it as if i had grown up that i i knew who who the toothfairy is and she said of well who is the toothfairy and i turn to her and i said race's dad is the toothfairy bonnie lover fell is the toothfairy and she said i cannot believe you now it is totally secret you cannot let any one else know but your right bonnie is the toothfairy and he works really hard and it is the secret as you cannot let any one else now he is the toothfair you cannot let anyone else now and from that day on bonnie bonnie loverfelt with toothfairy and it'll of my notes under my pillow were signed love bonnie lev as felt now ism in his day job what id running over felt do i think he did something in fine ounce who either an account an or a stock broker you work next to a stopping shop an make tooth sets in newton a dark hair worse too i deftly had images of his driving his solver around e bosstonarya and delivering the toothfary treats i remembering wondering what it was for rather to know that her dad was the toothfairy and deftly being little envious that her dad had the special job in the special power and that he had this whole other interesting life for my red best came home from work and that was it when you would actually run into running overfed what was i for you how would you act i try tactcool i did not want any notes if your star struck but you do not want them to know that your star struck sos i meaning a celebrity exactly you down play it you try not to mention at but you definitely check them out twice and and look at them when they walk away i go my got for the toothfary but enough to play a cool and know enough to place can i said hay how you do and i what is for dinner how m getting home to night how my parents get to pick me up if they call you did play at cool when interesting question in all this why did both girls come to what seems the least likely conclusion from the evidence in front of them of a parent swapping money for a tooth under a pillow the i was not got mix studies hell children thing she says of course it is logical for a seven year old to conclude that her own dad might be the toothfairy children understand that there parents for instance a powerful in all sorts of ways that make them very different from children i now from a child's point of view knowing where those powers begin and and is pretty tricky i mean to think about all the things that your parents can do that you cannot do and think about the fact that the is not any obvious explanation about why your father can use of easy cart for instance i know which is something that you cannot do i the power to be a toothfairy is not all that much more impressive its a certain con of story that could tell it the rowing wore felt story he they will get something going on around them observe i carefully the about it logically i one thing connects to the next thing to the next and then come to conclusions that a completely in correct there mist again dolman in texts tells this story better little girl in their plan then she was about for ears or and her very first flights and as the plain was air born she turned to the woman next to her and said when do we get smaller that had been their experience at airports watching airplanes take off they do get smalistories are joke and fossa poems i think because there is a ho quality to them some connection is made between things surprising connection a wrong connection actually well be at this america life love these stories and to day we bring you a full hour of them do you be as chico is this america life a lira glass to day in our program kid logic are showing for acts at one baby scientists with faulty data a two where will in their youth as very for michael shape on a three the gaining over to the fats o man things at for when small fought me big grains stay with us like one baby scientists with faulty data thirty years ago psychologists and scientists believed that babies could not think at all that they were irrational in a logical self ended little balls of need and wont what science as learnt in the last thirty years is that this is not true the children are observing the world and thinking about it and coming to logical conclusions from the day they are born malison gopenit and two over colleagues decided to sunrise a lot of this research in a book they called it the scientist in the crib many the babies are little scientists they argue that wen a small baby sits in a high chair and drops a spoon on to the for over and over and over for major dead to pick up what the baby is doing essentially is running a little baby sized experiment because it turns out that babies are very interested in gravity and how gravity work the that fact that things full down an not up is not obvious to babies i and it turns out another find the very interested in is human beings and how they work we are actually the brats there actually doing experiments all an of to see how we get when you raindrop this to when you get to for the price of one you get and experiment about gravity you get a little physics tutorial and you get a psychology tutorial you can see about how that person a well do something over in offering while kids think with the same logic that indents us and apply that logic just as rigorously there are certain things that they simply do not know and take a wild of figure out up the six or seven years old for instance it is not exactly clear to anyone what is imaginary and what is not or if wishing for something can make it come true there is a wonderful experiment about this actually that pharos in inland it a where he got children to amain a that something was in a box he would say cade now here is this box wore wen open outing a closet a now it is imagine that there is a puppy in this box or else let us imagine that there is a monster in the box a and he asked the children is there really a monster in the box is there really a poppy in the box they did now they were just imagining it then the researcher would walk out of the room leaving the box behind with the child and then something funny would happen the kids who were told to imagine a poppy in the box would go over and pile inside the box just a check and the ids who were told that the was a monster in the box they would edge away from the box there wore can it take any chances just in case wishing actually could make monsters cabin a they did not want to take any chances about what was going on in that box but by the time the children are six or seven they like grown ups they have understood that just wishing for things is not going actually making he when that's jo small and in experience about what happens in the real world children have to make logical inferences all the time based on the day that they do have here is how shadchan responded when our producer jonathan goldstone asked them about the toothfary what do you think she does with all f these teeth that she is collecting way she gave the people at after who oh people what do you think she does with all these teeth sees the college teeth and make things i my what kin to stuff i i that a two how to twelve feet and i to stay how many meet ten thin takes to make a tooth house i d i can why when she just make the house but of brick it everyone else i o i elfin the i a meet these stories where kid take a perfectly logical premise and go through a series of perfectly logical deductions that we do perfectly incorrect conclusions just said that science does not have a name for these stories which is surprising given how common they are and how they i recognized around the world for their sheer entertainment value here we have collected a few more we lived in ta duplex the duplexes directly to the left in the right of us were aunts and uncle across e street from us all ans and uncles it was no such thing as walking out testing a strange i just we all looked alike we all had common ancestries well my i became mobile when i got my for when i got my on first trisicple i could go a little bit further i ventured down the street and i looked and as saw these the couple did not these two people but they were people that i had never seen before it'd never seen anything that because they were white people and because i had never seen white people i as some that they were ghosts i waves i wonder if i wave you know what kind of people are they what they do they talk i waved and i remember hearing the man going will that must be the way they talk it was a scientific discovery i discover the first ghost people and they take to me they got communicated i waved they waved i said they know how low and this are fellow in their language e et all began at christian two years ago hand my daughter was four years old and them it was the first time that head ever asked about what it what to this holiday mean and i i explain to her that this was celebrating the birth of a of jess and she wanted know more about that and we went o n bought a kids bible and had these readings at night she loved him wanted to know everything about jess i we read on about his birth an about his teaching and them she would ask constantly what that what that phrase was and i would explained to her that it was do one to others as you would have them do unto you and we would talk about those old words and what that all meant am and then one day we were driving past a a big church and out front was an enormous crucifix she said who is that and i guys i never really told that part of the story i had the sort of ye well that is that is jess s and i forgot to day the ending yet well a he he ran a fowl of the roman a government this message that he had was radical and unnerving to the prevailing authorities of the time that they had to kill i they they came to the conclusion that he would have to die that message was too troublesome the was about a month later after that christian we'd gone through the whole whole story what christian want and and it was me canary and her are school a celebrates the same holidays as the local schools martin is the kinda was off i knocked off work that day and i decide we would play and i take her out the launch and a we was sitting in there and right on the table where we happened to plop down was the art section of the local news paper and there big is life was a huge drawing by i a senior old kid in the local schools of martin with her king and she said who is that i said well as it happens that is martin is the hang and he is why you are not in school to day s we are celebrating his his birthday this is the day we celebrate his life and she said who was he i said when he was he was a preacher and she looks up hi mega for jess n i did ya he actually he was but am but there was there was another thing that he was really famous for which as that a he had a message and you trying to say this to a fore your all its very this is the first time they ever hear anything she just very careful about how you phrase everything i said well yes here was a preacher and he he had a message she said what was his message i said when he said and you should treat everybody the same no matter what they look she thought about that for a minute and she said well that is what jess said i said yet i guess it is and i never thought of it that way but yet an than sort of do on to others as she would have this down to you and she thought for men ad much of the me and said that they kill him to i to where wolves in their youth in this act we have this example of kids thinking kids tit is an exiptosort story by michael shape on i had known him as a bull dozer as a someday as an android programmed to kill as plastic man and titania man and matter eater lad as a begin electro as a peterbuilt truck and even for a week as the mackinaw bridge but it was as a werewolf that timothy stokes finally went too far i was not there when it happened i was down in the ravine at the edge of the school yard founding a capital for an empire of ants had just begun to describe to my south and to the ants the complicated right sacred to the god whose worship i was imposing on them when i heard the first screams from the playground the girl screamed at timothy the same way every time he came after them in unison and with a thrill that sounded almost delight as if they were watching the family cat trot passed with something bloody in its jaws i scrambled up the side of the ravine and emerged has timothy shoulders hunched arms outstretched growled re idiotically and declared that he was hungry for the throat of puny human en timothy said this or something in every time he turned into a ware willow i would not have been too concerned of and the course of his last trance for nation he had actually gone an bit and virgin pes on the neck it was common knowledge around school that virgin's parents had since written a letter to the principal and and the next time timothy smokes hurt somebody he was going to be e spell timothy was in our teacher missus gladfelter's words one strike away from an out and there was a wide spread if unarticulated hope among his classmates their parents and all of the teachers that cropland fork elementary that one day soon he would provide the authorities with the excuse they needed to pack him off to special school i stood there a while above my little city watching timothy pursue us snarling bluebird corse along the hopscotch crosses i knew that some one ought to do something to calm him down but i was the only one and our school who could have any reason to wont to save timothy stokes from expulsion and i hated him with all my heart and i i have been cursed for three hundred years who de claim he was wearing his standard uniform of white surgeries and a plain white undershirt even though it was a chilly afternoon in october and all the rest of us had long since been bundled up for autumn and corduroy and down i have been cursed to stalk the night through all eternity he went on i have been searching for pray as lovely as you he lunged toward the nearest wall of the cage of girls around him the girls peeled away from him as though sprayed with a hose bump shoulders clung shrieking to each other sleeves some of them were singing the song we sang about timothy stokes timothy stokes timothy stokes he going to the home for crazy folks and the one singing the loudest was virgin pees herself and her furry black coat and her bright red tighten virgin had blond hair and she was the only girl in the fifth grade with pierced ears and painted finger nail and timothy stokes was in love with her i knew this because the stokes lived next door to us and i was privy to all kinds of secrets about timothy that i had absolutely no desire to know i forbade myself with an almost religious severity to showed timothy any kindness or regard i would never let him sit beside me as lunch or in class and if he tried to talk to me on the playground i ignored him who was bad enough that i had to live next door to him it was toward virgin that timothy now advance a rattling growl in his throat she drew back behind her girl friends and their screaming now grew less melodious less purely formal timothy crouched down on all force he rolled his wild white eyes and took a last look around him that was when he saw me half way across the yellow distance of the sockerfield he was looking at me i thought as though he hoped i might have something i wanted to tell him instantly i drop glad on my belly my heart pounding the way it did when i was spotted trying to spy on a baseborn game or birthday party i slid down into the ravine backward at first i could hear the girls shouting for missus gladfelter and then i heard missus gladfelter herself sounding very angry and the bell sounded the end of recess and everything got very quiet but i just stayed there in the ravine i told myself that i did not feel sorry at all for stupid old timothy stokes but then i would remember the confused look in his eyes as i had abandoned him to his fate to all the unimaginable things that would be done to him in the fabulous corridors of the special school i kept recalling something that i had heard timothy's mother say to mind just a couple of days earlier alters does had told my mother and that big sad donkey voice of hers your little pal is timothy's only friend i decided to spend the afternoon in the ravine the sun started down behind the embankment and the moon rising early emerged from the roof tops of the houses somebody was putting up in front of the school the moon i noticed was not quite full i did not hear the scrape of footsteps until they were just above my head pal said missus gladfelter leaning over the lip of the ravine hands against her thighs pal cover what on earth are you doing out here nothing i said i did not hear the bell pal she said now listen in me pal i need your help with what i did not think she looked angry but her face was upside down in it was hard to tell with timothy pal i guess he is just very wound up right now he is pretending he's werewolf to day and even though that is fine and we all know how timothy he is sometimes we have serious things to discuss with him and we would him to stop pretending for just a little while what if my is not pretending i said what if he really is a werewolf maybe he is pal but if you would just come inside and talk to him for a little bit i think we might be able to persuade him to change back into timothy you are his friend pal i asked him if he would to talk to you and he said less ism not his friend missus gladfelter i swear to god i cannot do anything pal timothy isn't trouble he needs your help and i need your help to now if you come right this minute and get up out of that dirt then it'll forget that you did not come in from recess if you do not come back inside it'll have to speak to your mother she held out her hand i come on please and i took her hand and let her pull me out of the ravine and across the deserted playground aware that in doing i was merely proving he unspoken corollary hat my mother had left hanging the other morning and the air between her and missus stokes there was a song about me too ism afraid a popular little woman at went what is that smell pal cello he is a big fat hipped fellow i the cute he smells pose smells tomato beef alphabet's timothy stokes i knew as i followed missus gladfelter down the long silent hallway to the office hating him more and more with each step was my only friend a timothy was sitting in a corner of the office trapped in an orange final arm chair there was a roman numeral three scratched into his left cheek and his brilliant white shirt and trousers were patterned with a camelflodge of grass and dirt and astral well now timothy missus gladfelter took me by the shoulders and maneuvered me around her look who i down hay timothy i said timothy did not look out missus gladfelter gave me a gentle pushed toward him in the small on my back why do not you sit down pal now i did not want to be left alone with timothy not because i was afraid of him but because i was afraid that somebody would come into the office and see us sitting there too matching rejects and matching orange chairs that is enough now pal said mister butterball the principal his friendly smile looking more false than usual sit down soul right said missus gladfelter you see what you an do about helping timothy turned back into timothy we are just going to give you a little privacy she followed mister buterbout into his office and then poked her head back around the door ism going to leave this door open in case you need us all right there were three chairs next to timothy's i took the farthest and showed him my back that any one passing by the windows of the office would not be able to conclude that he and i were engaged in any sort of conversation at all are you expelled i said there was no reply are you timothy again he said nothing and i could not stop myself from turning around to look at him timothy are you expelled ism not timothy professor said timothy gravely but not without a certain air of satisfaction ism afraid you are precious antidote did not work come on timothy i said cut it out the moon's not even full to day now he turned toward me where were you he said i was looking for you i was in m the ditch with the aunts i nodded i heard you talking to them before are you aunt man no dimming why not cause ism not anybody you are not anybody either we fell silent for a while an just sat there not looking at each other kicking at the legs of our chairs i could hear missus gladfelter and mister buteo talking softly in his office mister burbot call her elizabeth the telephone rang a light flashed twice on the secretary's phone then held steady thanks for calling back doctor shatter i heard mister buteubout say yes ism afraid i went to see doctor actor a couple times i said he had my grenades and the emboss he has stretch armstrong too said timothy i now why did you go see him timothy said did your mother make you yes i said how come i dunno she said i was having problems with my anger bipedal i guess i was mad about my dad and things he had to go to jail timothy said you are at just for one night how come he had too much to drink i said did you visit him in jail timothy said no stupid god you belong in special school timothy i hope they make you eat special food and wear a special helmet or something i heard the distant slam of the schools front door and then a pair of hard shoes knocking along the hall here comes your mother i said what kind of special helmet said timothy haunt man wheres a helmet missus stokes entered the office she was a tall thin woman much older than my mother with long gray hair and red any hands every morning she made timothy pancakes for his breakfast which sounded okay until you found out that she put things in them carrots and left over pieces of corn oh hello pal she said and her your voice missus stokes said missus gladfelter coming out of the principals office it is been kind of a long afternoon for timothy ism afraid how is virgin said missus stokes she still had not looked at timothy oh she will be fine mister buteo said just a little shaken up we sent her home early of course he added her parents are going to one us b eat to you of course said missus stokes ism ready to do whatever you think would be best for timothy ism not timothy said timothy oh please time stop this nonsense for once ism cursed he leaned over and brought his face very close to mine yelled them about the curse professor i looked at timothy and for the first time saw that a thin dark down of wolfish hair had grown upon his cheek then i looked at mister buterbau and found that he was watching me with an air of earnest expectancy as though he honestly thought there might be an eternal black magical curse on timothy and was more than willing to listen to anything i might have to say on the subject i shrugged are you going to make him go to special school i said all right pay thank you said missus gladfelter you may go back to class now tell later timothy i said he did not answer me he had started to growl again as i followed the secretary out of the office i looked back and saw mister buterbau in missus gladfelter and poor old missus stokes standing in a hopeless circle round timothy i thought for a second then i turned back toward them and raised and imaginary rifle to my shoulder this is a dark gun i announced everyone looked at me but i was talking to timothy now i was almost but not quite in merit it is filled with darts of my special antidote and i made it stronger than it used to be and it is going to work this time and also there is a tranquilizer mixed in timothy looked up and bared his teeth at me to i took aim right between his eyes i jerked my hands twice and went timothy's head snapped back and his eyelids fluttered he shook himself all over he swallowed once then he held his hands out before him as if wondering at their hairless pallor it seems to have worked he said his voice cool and reasonable and fine anyone could see he was still playing his endless game but all the grown ups mister butterbur in particular took vary pleased with both of us thank you very much pal he said ism not pa i said everybody laughed but timothy stokes he shape on reading an except from his short story where wolfs in the youth can find in the question of short stories of the same name is that his novel just came out is called moonglow coming out kids talking kid talk adults not understanding but you will as i special kid say that warned is things addition of our program continues in a minute from chico bubogradio when our programmed continues this america my from or glass he's we con appear of course we choose some theme bring different kinds of stories on that theme to day's programmed kid logic we wanted an hour filled with stories in which kids empty kid thinking especially the id thinking that is perfectly logical but completely wrong headed and we arrived at at three of our programmed at three the gaming over till the fats me man things a little kid stuck about a crush or love are they talking about more or less the same thing that adults me by those words why how we jackowits remembers how he thought about love and grad school he wanted girls to him but they never seemed to ho he is looking back on it i think part of the problem was how i thought about loves kid i had a few ideas abut how you gets some to love you that in rest respect one particularly helpful to me first i thought that if they can see me sleeping they would immediately fall for me when i went to sleep each night i would raucously try to sleep in acute way just in case the girls hat could peep on me i wiling to a needle ball if yo kitten and scrunch my head and for my pillow hands under my head i image at all he popular girls intention cruelly ranking me bat a ladder and climbed with my bedroom window but instead of painting fatso or whatever on my window as plant the collect of parts of melt as they saw me sleeping a babe an angel varied snuggle into my blankets i guess was some cross over but kid's knowledge of what was not doing to ales like to romance my second theory was that they would fall in love with me if they can see me reading aloud this conclusion came out of my experience with niece's and nephews would fact all over me when i read to them by age six i was already and uncle and i felt to slept me a certain maturity often i rests time i go to the back of the classroom and read from a selection of kid's books all the kids would gather round in a circle i port he books mercy the rose eating donkey affecting the voices of the different characters and speaking with a preachers sweaty charisma i much for why but we've one of my class seemed to love the way hand it up the only prom with this was the girls in class ended a treemenlike their uncle they call me uncle how and take to me in baby talk leave me a stop uncle how he on but get me wrong i love the attention but i want to lave not one i had all these ideas about love and of all the girls i knew my theories were most intensely target one girl at most valvular girl in school barren she became i most serious crush i carried torture for carbon from great one great six though carry did not seemed to me much one thing have learned about love on t v was that if one was sincere love in break all boundaries i believe that would come a women where i to speak the words i love you to carbon wit such tenderness and tears that i would break her heart and she would cry too confess her love i would allow one brave tear to travel down my cheratually protean joint lie mayo t very very her now years later in friends with can actual friends with both her in her husband allay i even work for him for a while learn and i have talked be fore about her elementary school days usually steering the conversation towards how mean she was to me ut have never spoken with her about populace i wanted to know what she remembered whether she knew i even had a crush and her at all to who are your interest we will cut i go your by year an ki definitely at interest a barysalli the can i there keypad more in milter yes yes yes notice if she does not mention even though it was far in the past you crush is still such an awkward thing to talk about when i finally did tell her about how i felt about her when we were kids i sort of mumbled my way through it back peddling all over the place i even forgot to actually point the make at her when i was in the elementary school you are a big crush you see thou i t i realize that there is a canon love maybe it the time i knew be no g actually we me when i think back on it now one time in the field keep toll me to tall

and id say by great sextant you not my it turns sat the can remembered exactly one story about me where my most vive memory of you is sitting in class and the teacher asking us to platter homeward and you been yo was and the paper kind of overflowing outer that desk and you rummaging frantically through the best trying to find wat homework and we were asked to take out and not being able to find it an our teacher walking apt desk and everyone knowing what was going because it probably happen two days before and the teacher just the lacing in to you and dating the cone gets gone tarot akin like and when dos when that happened at i seem cool lice a bad boy now every on ha very e that here wo more than anything i wanted carrion knowing me none that way i think the problem with my theories was that i expected her to fall for me the same way i felt for her that she would see me from a far reading to our class mads sleep in little prince i thought that what it took for some one to fall month i wanted her to think that this was the real mu i wanted to think it was veal me and the truth of it was that the real real me was getting screamed at and he me as desks spill up on the ground each nan is a can lev a grill in great six that will never have again ti something about kids or at least the way i was as a kid that is purely romantic in the truest love son steering sense if the word only a year or too later mi series in the ways love a change drastically by set great i had some seen the bottle sessions under my belt and i had concluded then instead a dreamy about a true love i could not have i she get a little bit more pragmatic about the whole thing one night after deciding i wanted to have a real girl friend i called up i identical twinsisters at let darleanan elizabeth darken answered i told her that i liked her and asked her she to officially go out with me she kindly told me that she only me as a friend but she was flattered no problem i said is elizabethal she passed me over to her twin ho i made the same offer to a elizabeths sic shirt and that was it the that is wat twins was the difference i figured we went up for two whole months it was great how he trackways is the creator writer and artist behind how action commies me me back for and small thoughts meet to big brains i key saw all this hour we have been talking about kidlodjec and sometimes the incorrect logic of childhood dare not i get corrected during childhood it does not it get corrected till much much later when childhood is long over halkmomberg explains i can reconstruct the events that li made at one of the most embarrassing conversations of my adult life the chain starts back when i was eleven or twelve and i first heard the term nelson family is probably listening to some adults talk and from their conversation i gathered that networks consulted nelson families to find out how popular a tellivishon she was but that did not make sense why would they only ask people named nelson which shows they liked did thinking i knew that when they figured things this out they did not ask everybody they just tats a small personal i people and than extrapolated i think i figure they would done some research and found that the name nails because was a common name maybe and had seemed to cut a cross class an economic lance actually came pretty close to a representative sample i knew this was not the way they measured public opinion now but it seemed the nails surveys had been around for while and i figured they we just to hold over from o more primitive statistically rigorous time after that i relatedn't think about it again or if i did it was only with a mild curiosity i wonder we tyveestill does not that way fan's forward twenty years i was talking with a friend of mine who as telling about her friend who would been selected to be in nelson family and i said to her is not heard that they're all named nelson my friend looked at me for what seemed a long time somewhere during her very long pause because of the very long pause in fact i realized of course the totally name nelson i makes no sense at all at the time of this conversation i was thirty four years old and could not believe i got intis far without ever stopping to think it through made me wonder what else it'd missed ani that is ever happened to any one besides me when i was a kid and i would see the school crossing signs and as a picture the little kids walking and i would same school eating and i thought that the eating was a word n i pronounced to sing turns out ism not alone i been talking to people about this for weeks there is lot of was out there me and this woman toddy mace carding around our childhood believe well into adulthood body though the we lots of zings dealings railroad rings i make sense wells o my twenties and i was walking in to work and about ten geese walked in front of me in the sidewalk and om i just turn to my to worker in casually said it looks they should have a sing sign there for the geese those for of a long awkward silence then i saw it that he was thinking that really is a good idea but instead he was he finally said sing is in a word an talking to people i found out that a lot of these lingering miss conceptions involved is pronunciation and often e miss pronunciation survives into adulthood because the mistake just sounds better or makes more sense it should be a word and it should be pink you know you do not want a kid to walk slowly across the crossing she smart he is gone to sing consider the word miss led i talk to

ism is the unicorn in angered r extinct and a basically there was a the gaped of silence as you might be gathering at some point and all these terms you come to a bi gap of silence and then everybody

he know it is important that you act cold and sophisticated and whatever everyone begins complaining about the food that were being serve what was that horrid stuff in the sloppy jo what was what was that mystery mad what animal did it come from and i ism looking at these people they are crazy i was the variety we were getting here every night every night there is a different meal i mean midnight it is one night its marchese one night it is mystery meet one night it sloppy job one night it is a us a ha how can you credit t m men that is a testament to what great shafts they must be that they can make at different meal every single night of the week and they just kind of they on stared an there what and ism what what what is running through my head is wait a minute these people are implying that they had variation in their meal plan for their entire life mind it is mine bending a and i do not care what i learned throughout college this is the revelation that has stuck with me this is what have learned all t a sudden only got when robin came home for thanksgiving that year confronted her mother with the startling fact that everyone else made things besides chicken growing up here mother just shrugged her shoulders and said you chicken robin had to conceive the point even when they got out to restaurants robin ordered chicken they will had a here is one wore when harry learn her was a girl her family was going through some leaniears there were two kids the house need repairs there was not much money for holiday gifts harry was seven and she wanted a bike her sister sudan was twelve she wont of a set of insects tedious but when they came downstairs on christian morning there only two small boxes waiting for them what was inside them and we both had exactly the same gifted were these real ugly medal tissue holders painted laugh wite these corner red and yellow roses am they were painted with these cheesy looking red and yellow roses and i looked at my tissue box and i started to cry and i looked at my big sister sudan and i thought of course she was in a cry too and she looked maybe she was in a cry but then she sit of put on a big smile and then she told me that the boxes were painted by trained monkeys the box became habit is praised possession she kept that on display in her room throughout her menteryscer through high school friends asked her about it so say oh yet was painted by trained monkeys nobody ever challenged her on it may because she believed at herself completely then one day she was home from college back in the house where she grew up and ism going through some papers ore maybe i was sneaking snooping through humans papers and i found a composition and it had her name on it that she had written it in high school and it was called the tissue box story i sat down on the floor of sun's bedroom to read this composition and sudan told the story just as i told it except that she wrote how she felt when she saw me crying and how she then looked at my parents and saw that my mother was about to cry too and how she looked at the tissue boxes and then she remembered that my father had a friend who made them and she knew how much my parents hated taking charity and suddenly even though she was about to cry she forced herself to smile and she pretended those boxes were painted by trained monkeys and then ism and i end of course i i did not know any of this but the funny thing she wrote in her composition is that she just rushed upstairs and started crying all over her pillow and she was not really said about the gift really is what she said in composition she was not sure why she was crying except that it was sort of my she had volunteer to be a grown up before she was even ready for it up until that moment i had never thought to question my sister's story i had never subjected it to the scrutiny of a grown up mind i mean i was twenty i i do not know i had this tissue box that was painted by trained monkeys and then it was not painted by train monkeys really but until reading that story harried thought that her sister's lies had been only to torment her lite the time harriers swallowed an applied and her big sister convinced her that she had an apple tree growing inside her she always been jealous of her sister i was going to be the big sister but reading her sister's story that day it realized how responsible her sister felt for her and for the entire family how there were benefits to being the baby it was good to learn all that but the vision of the lie that we live in a world where monkeys can be trained to paint tried to give up and really it is just that i con still picture this tissue box and how much i loved it this tissue box painted by trained monkeys i know what she means for me

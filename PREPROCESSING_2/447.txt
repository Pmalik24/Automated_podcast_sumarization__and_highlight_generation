welcome to the superman loans a science science base to s in the i mandrhubermen and on a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are talking all about goals and the science of goal setting and achieving your goals is a tremendous amount of information on the interned and in gooks and forth about how to set goals and assess your progress towards goals and update your goals and forth in fact there is many programs out there that include many different acronyms that it can be a obit overwhelming to day's conversation about goals is going to be quite a bit different indeed we are going tint talk about setting goals we are also going to talk about how to assess progress towards goals and we are going to talk about goal execution however we are going to do all of this in the context of nauru science because it turns out that there are not hundreds or dozens or even several nauru circuits in your brain that control goal setting and movement toward your goals there is one and while it includes many different brain areas that one circuit is the same circuit that is responsible for pursuing all goals and it relates to some very basic petrochemical mechanisms that are understood while there is a wealth of information out there about goals and goal setting and gal achievement and forth there is comparatively little information that is been available to the public about the nauru science of goal setting and goal achievement that is what we are going o focus on today i promise that we are going to get into the nauru science we arguing o touch on a little bit of the psychology and how the nauru science relates to what is known in the psychology literature and we are going to establish several in fact four specific protocols that you can use for goal setting goal assessment and goal execution in an ongoing basis regardless of what your personal goals happen to be before we dive into our conversation about goals and goal seeing and goal achievement to highlight some recent scientific findings that i think are going to be interesting and actionable for many of you out there in earlier podcast we talked about nauru plasticity which is the brainsability to change in response to experience in fact negro plasticity underlies all forms of learning whether notes language learning or learning music or math or physical skill all forms of learning in solve the reorganization of connections in the nervous sister the brain and spinal cord and body one of the key principles of nauru plasticity is this notion of making errors as a good thing toward nauru plasticity is a pubic counter intuitive but what the scientific literature tells us is that whenever we are thing to learn something new if we make an error we know it feels frustrating but that state of frustration actually use up particular brain areas to be more alert that on subsequent attempts to learn that thing we have a heightened level of focus and a higher probability of learning the new skill regardless of what the t skill is now talked about this before in various episodes as encouraging people to embrace errors or pursue errors not as their own goal but errors as an entry point for making the brain more plastic and if you think about it really make sense why would the brain change at all if it is performing everything perfectly when you make errors well in the immediate seconds and minutes after those errors you are in a better position to learn a common question i get however is what should be the rate of errors which is really just a way of saying how hard should the given task be that you are trying to learn or perform and it turns out there is an answer there is a recent paper that was publish in a great journal nature communications this is a paper a last author jonathan con and the papers entitled the eighty five per cent rule for optimal learning this paper we will make available by a link in the shownote captions but basically what this paper shows is that when trying to learn something new you want to make the difficulty of what your trying to learn such that you are getting things right about eighty five per cent of the time that you are making errs about fifteen per cent of the time and the reason i this paper is it really point specifically to some protocols that we can implement because people always say o k you want as set high goal you want to trying to achieve something that is really lofty be don't want to make the goal lofty that you do not make any progress at all other people say you really want to start with really small goals and make things very very incremental only set out to do things that you can accomplish and that will feed back on your self esteem and all these positive fee back loops and then layer by layer layer by layer you'll eventually get what you want to go what turns out that neither is true you need to set the level of difficulty such that your making errors about fifteen per cent of the time and i want to emphasize about fifteen per cent of the time because there is no way to o figure prootocalls for sport or language or math or anything else where your going to have exactly fifteen per cent errors anyway this paper the eighty five per cent rule for optimal learning again we will supply the link but it really points the idea of making things pretty hard but not hard that your failing every attempt or even half of the attempts failing about fifteen per cent of the time seems optimal for learning hopefully that information will be useful to any of you that are trying to learn something fully it will also be useful to those of you that are teaching kids or other adults if your teaching keep in mind that you want to keep the students reaching for higher and higher levels of proficiency in whatever that is that your teaching and that fifteen per cent of the time they should be failing if it gets to twenty per cent that is probably oke if they start failing about half the time than probably what there trying to learn is too difficult for them at that point now of course this is going to be control by all sorts of external factors whether not they slept well the night before with a not you sleep well the night before in your being clear in your instructions a to them et camera but i think the fifteen per cent rule as we may call it is a good metric to aim for and at conserve both students and teachers and other words it can serve both those teaching and those that are learning before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an a in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stop come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they're all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element dot come slash supermen let us talk about the science and in particular the biology and neural science of setting and achieving goals setting an achieving goals is not a uniquely human endeavor other animals set and attempt to achieve goals a honey be attempts to collect honey and bring it back to the hive a survivor will go out and forage for plants and will also have a need to reproduce it some point in its life will need to find a mate and maybe even raise the young depending on what species that is predators will have to hunt and kill and eat their food and they have to avoid getting injured in that process they also have to raise young et camera humans are among the other animals or we could say the animals are among us in the need to set goals and to make efforts to achieve those gals now why do i emphasize this commonality of process the reason i emphasize this commonality of process is that it turns out that there is one basic system by which all animals including humans set an attempt to achieve goals now humans are unique in our ability to orient our mind toward immediate goals moderately termed goals meaning things that might exist on the scale of a wake or a month or even a year and very long term goals a lifetime goal or a goal that lasts a decade or takes a decade to achieve that is what makes us unique and of course we do not have access to the mind set or r the thinking or the emotions of other animals but what we do know is that common curl circuits meaning brain areas that a present in animal species and in humans are responsible for orienting ore thinking and our action toward particular goals another thing that is really unique about the human brain is that we are able to have multiple goals interacting at once for instance we probably all have fitness goals goals in relationships of different kinds friendships and romantic partnerships as well as maybe clastic goals maybe maybe are in school your pursuing some kind of learning outside of the school environment or and or you have business goals or financial goals we are able to have multiple goals at once another animals do this but humans are unique in the ability to juggle a lot of goals and a shall one of the major challenges in pursuing goals is that goal pursuit often interacts meaning if you can spend one hundred percent of your find chasing one particular goal that might be very effective for that goal but then we tend to fall back on some of our other goals ah you can imagine how this plays out if your working very very hard on your silly focused on business often your health will suffer if your solely focused on your health often other things will suffer and we have to juggle both our goal setting and our goal pursuits and today we are going to talk about a number of different ways to work with what could very well be call these inter leaving goals by focusing on a common practise er common set of mechanisms that are present in all aspects of goal seeking what is that process what turns out it is a curl circuit a curl circuit is simply a collection of brain areas that when active in a particular sequent give rise to a particular behavior or perception for instance when you feel half by it is not because you have a brain area that the happy brain area that is electrically active rather it is going to involve numerous brain areas being active in concert and to different degrees in the same way that the keys on a piano together played in the appropriate sequent represent a particular song you would never say that one key on the piano represents that song but that key is necessary similarly in the brain we can say that a brain area might be necessary but not sufficient to give us a particular experience or generate o particular behavior when we think about goal seeking and the pursuit of goals of any kind in the brain it does not matter what the goal is it involves a common set of nerd circuits and the neral circuit that i to orient us toward to day and will return to it a few times involves learning a couple of names but you do not have to worry much about memorizing these just more important is to understand the logic of how it is put together and i will explain that and make it very clear if you want to learn the names that great one of the rain areas is the called amygdala the imigula's most often associate with fear s you might say while how is that involved in goal directed behavior well a lot of our goal directed behavior is to avoid punishments including things embarrassment or financial ruin or things of that sort and the imigdula and some sense of anxiety or fear is actually built in to the circuits that generate goal seeking and our motivation to pursuit goals the other areas are the called venial stratum the stratum is part of what is called the bail ganglia the bani ganglia is a neral circuit that can very simply be described as a neral circuit that helps us generate go meaning the initiation of action and no go the prevention of action type scenarios let me make that even simpler the eventual stratum is part of the tin called the radio ganglia the bozo ganglia has sort of two circuits within it one circuit is involved in getting us to do things ism going to get up to morrow and often a run five miles first thing in the morning don't no howmashican to do that but ism fussing s an example another circuit within the bozo angle is a logo circuit is one that says no ism not going to go for the second coke or the third cook ism not going to eat that and then the go circuit would be the one that is responsible for instead eating something else case we have go and logo circuits within the bail angles we get a eidola think of his conifer and anxiety and avoidance we have got the bail ganglia which are for initiating action and preventing action and then there is the called quarter the quarter of the outer shell of the brain and their two subregion of the quarter that are involved in goal directed behavior one is the lateral prefrontal quarter prefrontal quarter is involved in called executive function things planning thinking about things under different time scales on not just what we want in the immediate term but what we might want to morrow or the next day and how our actions currently organ a relate to the future and the called forbid frontal quarter forbid front of quarter has a large number of functions but one of the key functions of the orbiter frontal quarter its is involved in nesting some emotionality with our current state of progress and comparing that emotionality to where we it might be when we or closer to a goal oke there basely four areas one involved in anxiety one involved in emotion one involved in planning and another involved in this go normal action that is a bunch of detail but if i wanted to make it really simple for everyone i would say there are four areas one is in area associated with anxiety and fear see ampulla the second is involved in action and inaction remember go and logo that is the basoganglia the other one is involved in planning and thinking across different timescales that is lateral prefrontal quarter and then the fourth one is involved in emotionality where we sit emotionally at present compared to where we think we will be emotionally when we reach some particular gal and that is the orbit or frontal quarter oke again you do not need to know all those names you do not need to know all the details just understand that those different elements are involved in the decision making processes that lead us toward particular goals and have us update our goal seeking et camera one key thing as it does not matter what the goal is the same circuits are invoke whether not you are trying to build a companies that istle building follow company that is tonnage public or your thinking about planning a crafts day at home with the kids or for yourself or your thing about what move ago see goals goal seeking and assessing progress towards goals all install the exact same neral circuits is really remarkable also very convenient for our discussion today what is going on in these circuits can basically be boiled down to two particular things the first is value information trying to understand whether r not something is really worth pursuing or not placing o value on a particular got the other component of this neral circuit is associated with action which actions to take and which actions not to take given the value of a particular goal in a given moments time one say that again the other component of the circuit is involved in action whether not you should act or should not act based on your assessment of the value of a goal at a particular moment in time and i you region to hear me say over and over again in this episode the value information about a goal is key her's why there is basically one neural transmitter or rather neuromodulator system that governs our goal setting goal assessment goal pursuit and that is the neuromodulator dopamine dopamine is the common currency by which we assess our progress toward particular things of particular value in fact dopamine is the way that we assess value of our pursuits and we take a moment and we shift our attention to the psychology of goal setting things that you have probably heard a bit more about about what sorts of goals are good and haw to set goals and how to categorize goals i want you to think about how dopamine could possibly be involved in these different processes and the reason i want you to do this is that all of the psychology of goal setting in goal pursuit is wonderful because it places things into different categories it allows us to parse our thinking and organize our thinking but what is not often see in fact ism not aware of any literature out there scientific or literature in the popular press are in popular books is an understanding of how the underlying neurobiology can be paired on top of the psychology of goal setting to allow us to set and pursue our goals more effectively and that is what we are going to do to day we are eventually going to arrive at a set of four practices that when performed on a regular basis will allow you to assess what is the value of this next particular action step how worth while is it to to behavior versus behavior be in order to achieve or particular goal if any of this is vague now ism going to make it all very clear for you you are going to come away with some very specific lists of take always that you can put down on paper if you and that you can use to set goals asses goals and execute goals more effectively using the now science of the circuits i just described and an understanding of the narmodulator dope let us take a look at the psychology of goal setting in goal pursuit this is an enormous literature meaning there are tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of scientific papers about the topic of goal setting and goal pursuit also a lot of information on the internet about goal pursuit and in looking over this information one comes to appreciate pretty quickly that acronyms are a big thing acronyms seem to dominate the area of goal setting especially as it relates to things in the business sector but also in the relationship sector now acronyms are wonderful they allow us to organize our thinking into miss and conceptually they can be very useful but as i moved through this literature i start to see some redundant themes and what have attempted to do is distill out the redundant themes that regardless of the person teaching or the scientific laboratory that happen to come up with these acronyms that they boil down to some common features that's talk about that literature and i think we will come away with an understanding of some basic elements that are common to all goals now the modern science or the modern psychological science of china understand goal setting and pursuit as she dates back to the nineteen thirties and we have to be sure that members of our species were focus on goal setting in gal pursuit long before this scientific literature emerged it just stands to reason that since the human brain has not evolve that much we do not thing in the last ten thousand years that people would be thinking about these things they just did not get them down to papers that we can evaluate on submit and forth but now we can we can look at those papers and what you find is that acronyms abound in the psychology literature about goal setting in goal pursuit for instance you hereabout a the work of a lock an small for instance the of the last names of a various a researtures the called a b c method that a goal should be achievable it should be believable and that the person be committed it sort of obvious one to hear but the a b c method then people came along and expanded on that they talk about the called smart method smart being another acronym that it be specific that the goal be measurable that the goal be attainable that the goal be realistic and that it be hidebound mean that you set a certain period of time in which a given goal should be performed and then people come along and modify these this is way that psychology research is done i am not laughing at it ism just chuckling because outhit seems the acronyms get longer and longer and longer am they developed the smart up approach adding in e are to the acronym smart to seem a art e are they added ethical and rewarding which fortunately o are good things i believe ethical and rewarding a what does all this mean well what it means is that any kind of goal pursuit any kind of goal setting really has to involve a number of different states and neral circuits in the brain and body at least that is how i view this literature why would i do that well whats thing about the very modern version of the kind of acronyms that i talked about a moment ago dating back to the nineteen thirties and extending into the nineteen nineties you can find beautiful talks on line from people who have worked with some of the biggest companies and greatest high performers out there to achieve incredible things and they will talk about generating a sort of objective mine set for goal setting they'll talk about goals needing to be significant as to be a big goal that has to be concrete e have to be able to describe what the goal is it has to be action oriented has to be inspirational has to be time bound you have to have reasonable realistic verifiable measures you have to constantly up the anti if it trying to sound repetitive it is because it is repetitive there are easily only three or four elements to goal setting in goal pursuit basically an individual or set of individuals has to identify a specific thing that they are going to attain in some communities the talk about knowing what right looks meaning be being able to define a very specific goal you cannot just say i want to be a champion athlete you have to say what sport and you have to understand what the path to that is any big goal of course is broken up into a series of smaller goals but the whole thing starts with thinking about the end in mind and in a few minutes we will talk about whether not visualization of the end in mine is actually beneficial or detrimental to achieving goalsars actually great neral science in pay apology data on that now i mention all these acronyms not as an attempt to disparage them i think they are wonderful and i mention all that psychology literature n to in an attempt to disparage it but rather told just say that goal setting is the first step a assessment of what whether not one is making progress towards those goals is a second but necessary step and then there is the business of goal execution and that brings us back to the nail circuit components remember this nerd circuit involving those four things earlier the miglastridum over front of quarter and the prefrontoquartex they work together to divide the whole process as i mention before into two general categories the first is assessing value knowing whether not where one is that one given moment relates to some external thing are things going well or a things going poorly and knowing how to gauge that accurately and then action steps goes and now goes do more of this do less of that do this do not do that et camera now we are going to shift back to the narrow science and we are in a talk about the practical applications of the information i just describe because have going you a lot of kind of academic information and as we do this unlike you to keep in mind what are some things that you have either accomplished or that you to accomplish going forward because as we do this we can build towards a set of protocols that at the end you will be able to very quickly plug in your particular goals and a route to those particular goals that is grounded in the science that i think are going to be very effective in allowing you to reach those goals more quickly and with indeed less effort in fact let us start with a tool now because as we move through all this information i want to make sure that people are coming away with some practical things that they can implement and indeed somethings that you can even do during the course of listening to or watching this podcast the first thing to do is to understand the difference between perry personal space and extra personal space perry personal space is all the space literally that within side your body the surface of your skin and in your immediate environment pray personal space is a key concept in narrow science because you have particular marry circuits and particular chemicals that are geared toward what are called consolatory behaviors meaning using things in consuming things and enjoying things that are in your immediate perry personal space let me give you an example of this for myself just to make it concrete you can imagine similar examples for yourself right now within my current perry personal space is my interception my understanding or perception of my internal body how quickly on breathing my heart raise the feelings on the surface of my skin et camera but also within the confines of my perry personal space is this coffee mug that if you are listening to this you cannot see this but ism lifting lifting up a coffee mygamatace us of coffee it is a consolatory behavior i have the coffee i do not have to do much or mode of ate much to get it i have other things here apendsincaputer et camera o we things in your perry personal space and consuming those things is generally governed by a set of agrochemicals the at center around the neuromodulator ceratonan and there a few others as well things oxytocin but mainly ceremony contrast that with the called extra personal space extra personal space is everything beyond the confines of my reach would be something in the next room it wild be something down the street it wild be something at some other location in space and time and the near modulators an petrochemicals that are associated with any kind of thinking about anything in the extra personal space are distinct from the narrow chemicals and nuromodulators that involved in thinking about or making actions towards the perry personal space and the molecule that is most associated with thinking about or orienting toward the extra personal space again things beyond the confines of my skin or your skin is dreamy and this is a vitally important concept understand when your setting goals and seeking goals if we are to be good at goal seeking if we are to be good at setting goals and accessing goals if we are to achieve our goals we have to be able to total back and forth between a clear understanding of our perry personal space what we have and how we feel in the immediate present and our ability to understand what is out there in the extra personal space and our ability to move into that extra personal space and a simple way to conceive of all this is that we evaluate our progress in the perry personal space we evaluate how we feel about some pursuit even if we have an initiated that pursuit yet how we feel about a particular goal is truly a feeling that we experience in the here and now even though the goal is in the future if we are going to evaluate whether not we made progress to day or yesterday or not that is in evaluation of how we feel in the immediate perry personal space however moving toward any goal involves orienting our thinking towards the extra personal space and as we go through to day's episode ism going to teach you a technique or rather a negro sins base tool that will allow you to continually transition back and forth between the perry personal space in the extra personal space in a way that will allow you to up date and evaluate and better execute your goal seeking the whole principle behind this is that human beings other animals have to make evaluations about whether not they are on the right track however the important thing to understand is that humans in particular can do this over different time scales we do not just pursue food cause we are hungry we pressure pursue food souse me for a particular meal that we might be having with people tomorrow right we can modulate the time scale in away the other animal stone that is how we adjust our goal seeking to different timeskills and in addition to that humans are ex exquisitely good abasing our behavior toward particular goals over very long periods of time but there are a lot of mistakes out there in fact things that are outright wrong in the literature n and particular and the internet and in the condwelness and fitness and connive fitness space that send people down the wrong path and those things we will talk about in few minutes but things visualization that visualization and visualization of this big goal is the best way to achieve your goals in fact that is not the case there is a much better approach to doing all this now it'd to shifters towards talking about a few of the things that most people get badly wrong in setting and assessing and executing goals this is based on previewed research i think it is very solid i know it is very solid and it runs counter to what many of us have been taught let us start with a simple one we have all heard that mufti tasking is bad we have hear multitasking as bad it does not allow for focus if you will not achieve anything you don't accomplish anything you should not mufti task well turns out that is wrong turns out that there is a roll for mufti tasking but the mufti tasking has to be placed at a particular time within your goal seeking behavior in order to be effective really nice studies done at cardiac carnage melon university the danish lab i valuated how long people are able to focus in different environments how long they are able to stay concentrated on their work and it turns out that number is exceedingly low turns out that most people whether not they are doing computer work or whether not they are doing writing or accounting work or anything of that sort can hold their attention for about three minutes at a time before they shift their attention off that is ridiculously low when you first hear it but that probably reflects a basic state of brain function that hearkens back to a time when we were hunter gathers i doubt that we were maintaining focus solidly for hours and hours and hours unless we were under some particular threat or some in some particular crisis rather you can imagine that people collected seeds and nuts and berries for about three minutes and then prove he stood up looked around and then kept going only or that they were hunting animals or in some sort of pursuit fishing et camera and focus focus focus and every three minutes onto they might have looked up and that can look of the sky or look around to make sure that on other people were there or not there et camera it all stands to reason that that will be the case again the curl circuits haven't involved much now mufti tasking has been shown to have a very interesting physiological signature when we mufti task when we jump back and forth between things there is an increase in the level of the narrow transmitter also some noes called the nurromagulater but basely same thing for sake of this discussion there is an increase in the burro transmitter epineferen which is a adrenaline and there really nice studies now point to the fact that doing a bit of mufti tasking prior to jumping into some focus goal directed behavior within its mental behavior or physical behavior can actually be useful because it gets us into action we have all been told that multitasking is terrible but if you for instance find yourself cleaning up your house and also checking your phone and doing a number of things right at the point where you should be sitting down to right or do some focus work it probably reflect some adaptive mechanism where you use action and somewhat varied multitasking action in order to generate a adrenalin in your system because a adrenalin just gets you into action now that is great but you do not want a mufti task throughout any kind of goal seeking or goal pursuit behavior because what is also very clear and are going to talk about this in exquisite depth to day is that visual focus and in particular contracting your visual window bringing the aperture of what you see to a very fine point can absolutely increase your clarity of goal seeking and the likelihood that you will pursue your goals have talked about this a littlest before in the podcast is a way of increasing focus for any kind of pursuit have talked about a practise whereby you can literally look at a dot or a line placed on a wall or on your computer in front of you first thirty to sixty seconds and then moving into some dedicated work where you need to focus and indeed just looking at narrow piece of the visual world a small piece of the visual world for some period of time in forcing yourself to hold that gaze on that location as best you can can increase your level of cognac of attention in your ability to focus and stay focus and this is not magic it is the consequence of the fact that most of your cognition follows your visual perception for those of you that are low vision or no vision meaning your blind or you have trouble seen my lave does a lot of work with a people who are lavish in vision they tend to use their auditory system their hearing as a way to anchor their attention to particular things okay but most people out their cancel and see pretty well and visual focus is the way to do that now early er we were talking about this notion of perry personal space fortis extra personal space and ism just going a seed a litlabit of the later conversation by saying that when we focus on an external point we are in a process of extraoception is the focus on the extra personal space not the perry personal space when we focus on something say a line on the wall for thirty sixty seconds or at our computer for thirty sixty seconds and just look at it and then move into any kind of action whether non its work action or physical action we are at its very core we are engaging in this pursuit of extra personal space we are placing our focus outside our body and therefore we are placing the brain into goal pursuit mode work at m oi you in particular in the laboratory of a a phenomenal research for in their psychology department by the name of family falsettos be a l c e t i s family falsettos has done really nice work on this they have done is they had people focus their visual attention on a goal line of some sort and then to engage in some sort of behavior that requires a lot of effort the have one a lot of different experiments this but it'll just explain one they always include a control group wear people have to go through the same physical effort or mental effort but they do not focus their attention just on one location the long short of these studies is that when people have to focus their attention on one location a goal line they are much more effective in reaching those goals and they achieve them with the perception that they expended less effort will give you an example of one particularly nice study from the falsettos lab this particular study involves physical exercise although is i mention before they have done similar studies looking at cognitive type work and what they did is they had a group of people exercise wearing fifteen pound angola weights and they had to basically move a certain distance or run a certain is to reach a goal line one group was focus on the goal line visually focused on the gal line the other group was not told to visually focus on the goal line and what they found was that the group that focussed on the goal line it was able to achieve reaching that goal with seventeen percent less effort they measured effort and that he got their twenty three per cent quicker that is a remarkable difference right same distance travelled with same work load because everyone is wearing these same fifteen pound weights on their ankles one group is simply looking at the goal line the other group is not told to look at the goal line simply by looking at the goal line does something to the psychology and end physiology of these people that allows them to move forward with less perceived effort and to do it more quickly that is remarkable right and in this case the focused on the goal line but in a few moments will talk about how one can use up dating of goal line incremental saline starting with an intermediate goal and then extending the goal line further and further but just sit back for second and think about that just by changing wear a person looks they change their perceived effort and their ability to do something more effectively more quickly than a group that is not deliberately focussing their visual attention on one location that is incredible and it is incredible in fact you might say how coal that possibly be what turns out it has a very specific underlying physiological reason and that has to do with changes in our called autonomic nervous system than aspects of our nervous system that prepare us for readiness and action or that prepare us for resting and relaxing what is special about focusing one's visual attention at a given location what turns out that we have two branches of our visual system visual information all comes in through our eyes but then this can head down two different pathways one pathway is engage when our vision is brought to a common point when we call a vergenciye movement for focussing very intensely on a given point regardless of how far away from us that point is are visual system engages a certain set of neuron's curl circuits that are involved in resolving fine detail and that can evaluate small changes over small periods of time just think fit is a very detailed camera of the visual world intend to be very restricted the other pathway through the visual system is a call mango cellar pathway and this is a pathway that is involved in taking in global information about lots of things that are happening around us movement of things to are right movement of things to our left things are happening down on the ground and all around us and that pathway involves a sort of relaxation if you will of the neral circuits that are associated with alertness and attention when you walk down the street you're not thinking about much provided you are not looking at your phone you are to focussing on one location your more lesson tat relaxed state compared to when you are looking for particular sign you are looking for a boss or a train that is coming or a particular person and that should inherently make sense when your level of attention and alertness goes out the sort of a small but perceptible increase in your level of a arousal it is not really stress necessarily but a arousal of alertness and it turns out that the visual system a accomplishes this increase in alertness by communicating with your circulatory system and the system that delivers blood and neutrience and oxygen to the rest of the tissues in your body it is talk for a second about what focussing our vision on a particular location does because in the study from the balcettis lab what they found was focussing on a got line allows people to move more effectively toward that goal this is something you can average in all aspects of all goal pursuits what happens when we focus on a particular location believe it are not there is an increase in a particular feature of our blood pressure now your body has of course artery's veins and capillaries and your heart pops blood first to the arteries and then to the other a components of ourvascular system and we have called blood pressure my blood pressure is just how much the fluid volume is pressing on those arteries veins and calories s you can imagine a pipe with very little fluid moving through it that is low pressure you have a pipe with a lot of fluid moving through it that is even more pressure you have a pipe with a lot of very viscous meaning very kind of a sticky thick stuff moving for t that is even more pressure we have blood pressure and you have probably had your blood pressure measured there is always two numbers right you've a top number which is the systolic blood pressure and then you there is the bottom number below the line which is the diastolic pressure the important thing to understand is that your blood pressure will rise when your heart beats because there is more fluid moving through those pipes that are your arteries your veins in your calories and that top number is called the pistol or the systolic blood pressure because that is the pressure at the time when your heart contracts o the top number which normally if you have a healthy blood pressure is somewhere in the range of ninety to a hundred and twenty millimeters of mercury millimeter a mercies just the way that pressure is measured that t of number your cyst your systole your systolic blood pressure is what is measured when the heart contract of that is the amount of pressure when there is a heart beat and its moving through your sculpture now between beats right the heart beats but then it relates your blood pressures can a drop to a lower value right because fluid isn't being pumped through the system at those moments and that is the bottom value the diastolic pressure and typically for healthy people that is going to be sixty to eighty millimeters of mercury you might hear about a normal blood pressure being about again this is an a proximate a hundred and twenty over eighty what that means is at the point where blood was being pumped through e your arteries in pains bum that it is a hundred and twenty millimeters of mercury but then when the heart relaxes for a second before the next beat then it drops to eighty case there is high pressure low pressure high pressure low pressure this the fruit is being pumped through the system an why am i telling you all this what turns out that there are neural circuits that link your visual system and focusing on a particular point with that top number the systolic blood pressure and when you focus your eyes on a particular location that systolic blood pressure goes up and there are some other systems that are coordinated with it in your brain and body that start releasing a adrenaline low amounts over adrenalin in most cases and that a adrenalin further readies your body for action bringing our visual focus o particular location does a number of things to the brain and the whole system of the body to prepare it to place it into a state of readiness that makes us more likely to lean into our goals into action and if we step back and think about that this makes perfect sense the brain and body need to be coordinated we cannot just think about a goal in fact a deer or a lion cannot just think about a goal it has to think about a goal and then has to feel some sort of activation energy some willingness or desire to move forward in pursuit of that goal imagining a goal has to be coupled to the physical pursuit of the goal our visual system in a beautiful way brings together a focus literally of visual focuses on a particular point outside us then it recruits and increase in systolic blood pressure which creates a systemic a body wide and brain wide increase in full utilization in oxygen availability in our willingness to move forward as a body as a whole coherent system and then there are also nauru transmitter systems apinepronis as we will soon see dopamine that get recruited as well to place us into a continual mode of action this to me is a remarkable feature of our physiology and it gets right to the point of some of the psychological phenomenon the we are talking about earlier was just recall what some of those are will not list them all but a goal has to be significant they say cha all the psychologists all the popular stulfalines has to be big indicant has to be inspirational and has to be action oriented case let say you look out into the landscape of what is available to you whether notes just in your mind or you look at a specific point you say ah i want to go to that particular restaurant to eat that particular food and you orient towards it and you move towards end this is the way that your brain embody are coordinating their actions together conversely when our visual system is in a mode of looking at everything when the aperture of our visual system is very broad we know that there is also a reduction in our goal directed behavior and a reduction in the systolic blood pressure it is as if are very personal space is sufficient we do not need to get beyond our current state we are not oriented toward any one thing in particular case have now describe some of the psychology and some of the underlying physiology now it'd to mesh this within the context of actual specific goal setting and goal pursuit because what many of you are probably thing in this oka that some physiology either some psychology but how do you actually apply this toward setting and achieving goals well you do that by understanding that your mental frame and your attention are always either position to your very personal space focused on your immediate possessions and state or towards things outside you but that you also have the ability to dynamically travel back and forth between those and next wore in to talk about what the literature says about things visualization immediate and intermediate goals long term goals and how to best achieve those and then we are going to move specifically into the protocols that you can use it's a protocol that have specifically developed for you the listeners in order to incorporate all the science into a best practice that you can do any time any place to really identify what it is specifically that you want to pursue and the best route to pursue and achieve that goal focussing our visual attention on one particular point is incredibly effective for all types of goal pursuit and if you to read some of the scientific studies or read a review of the scientific studies that have looked it how narrowing one's visual attention can really enchants the effectiveness of pursuing goals it'll put a link to this study the title of a study is keeping the goal in sight testing the influence of narrowed visual attention on physical activity and this is a paper from emilyball set's lab focuses mainly on physical activities but it mention some other things as well this is a a article publish in personality in social psychology bulletin and twenty twenty to its recent ah it is exceptional paper in my opinion really gets to the heart of how all this works an som an examples of where it is been implemented let us apply this visual tool in a very simple way to any type of goal that you want ta pursue if you already know what goal you want to pursue may be it is a work out may be it is a connive work of some particular sort again the process of very simple you are going to focus your visual attention on one point beyond your very personal space o it could be on your computer could be on the wall it could be a horizon it could e at a at a distance and you can a focus your visual attention there and with some effort you can hold your visual attention for thirty to sixty seconds you might blink that is o k but your going to try and hold your visual attention there no moving your head around ism no diverting your attention to other locations some people will find it very easy to do other people find it quite hard your mind may drift cognitively that is o k but try and bring your visual attention to that common point several episodes ago i talked about how their actually studies looking at developing this kind of training in students for arty it and the date on that are actually quite encouraging for people w have a d it and focus issues and attentional issues this can be effective for people who do not this can also be effective again it places your brain and body into a state of readiness and then the idea is to move into the particular actions that bring you closer to your goal we we have not yet talked about how to set goals and how to assess progress this is simply how to pursue goals of but the visual component is important in fact i would argue that the visual system and harnessing your visual attention to a narrow point is going to be the most effective way to get your brain and body into a mode of action to pursue whatever goal it is your trying to pursue that practice is in start contrast to mouth tasking where by definition your attention is moving from place to place to place right i mention that mufti tasking can be effective in getting your system into somewhat of an increase level of active activation the you can pursue a more focussed goal but the visual attention to a particular point is going to be the most effective way to bring your system into a state of readiness and action for goal pursuit there is another really interesting way that you can leverage your visual system toward long term goals the ballet a slap has also done some really interesting experiments looking at peoples ability to set and stick to long term goals and the long term goal that they looked at was one related to saving money for later in life this is only a lot of people struggle with the lot of people have a hard time investing money or saving money for later in life simply because as human beings we vary in the extent to which we worry about what is going to happen later here is also a phenomenon if called delayed discounting delay discounting is the fact that goals become less rewarding when they exist further out in the future how you may have experience this walking past a dona oh i love donas just can admit it over and over gown this but i love the smell of the tell of the taste of them i try to eat them cause ism told there not that good for mean indeed i i do not think they are i occasionally have and i eat one or many but in general i try not to cave to the immediately rewarding properties of the smell on the taste of the do it but what we know is that if you smell a don't or you smell a wonderful piece of food in the immediate term it brings your level of focus your mental focus to the immediate phase and it feels very rewarding if you had it now it would just be good but if you actually extend that reward out to to morrow or the next anything are om to day happens to be a sturdy that were according but journo on tuesday morning ism in to get a dough it does not have the same value because the reward system does not work as well for long term goals it is not as as salient it is not as tangible a goal especially for something a dough whereas the kinds of goals that work when you place them out into the longer term and can create a heighten sense of motivation ten to be things that are much more rewarding to us delay discounting simply says that the further out in time that a even goal is the less effective that reward will be in motive eating one's behavior and indeed you see this with saving money for retirement you see this with all sorts of long term investment the basset slab therefore did an experiment where they looked at people's tendency to save money for later in life but the groups that they created in the study were really interesting they had one group imagine what it would be to be thirty or forty years older and then to invest a certain amount of money according to whatever it is they thought that they would need and they measure the amount that they had set aside and saved for later in life the other group actually viewed photos of themselves picture images of themselves that were artificially idigilly age that they could see themselves thirty or forty years into the future and it turns out that people in that second group simply by perceiving their own image in the future invested far more money into later life i they set aside more money somehow bridge the gap between their immediate experience of life and the longer ark toward what it was going to be in thirty or forty years very powerful result in my opinion because what it says again is that our visual perception of the future or our visual perception of the present is what allows us to anchor or goal directed systems and our motivation to take on things that in the immediate term might not seem that useful you can imagine all sorts of a variations on this you can imagine that every time i want a dough it'd see a vision of myself or an actual physical picture of myself om as a consequence of ad having eaten many doughnut every day for the next ten years i do not know that image we look as have never seen it a that is not an experiment that necessarily need to do because ism not that motive itydougnats but i have to confess i somebody who i think ism pretty good at managing resources but i think if i were to see an image of myself at seventy or seventy five there many things are associate with visual images what our body must feel what are needs are probably going to be in that state or in that age what sorts of things we may or may not still be able to do at that age and that anchors back to immediate goal directed behaviors such as setting aside money for retirement such as investing in one's health practices and indeed there is a study that has looked at how people will invest in exercise and healthy eating if they just think about the future and what they might be in the future verses seeing images of themselves in the future if they were to go down a healthy or unhealthy route again the point is that the visual system what we see is principally important in defending what we do in the immediate term even if what we see relates to something in the far off distance i think these are phenomenal studies and they get right down to an important issue that is been kicked around over and over in the literature and in the discussion about goal seeking which is visualization we here keep the big goal in mine focus on the big goal now we are going to address what is the science say about visualizing big goals if you are somebody who's interest in business or a let us at your focus on relationship is thinking about the perfect relationship and what that would look and the the family that you would haven where you would live is that effective in generating the kinds of behaviors that will lead you to that is it effective to think about the big win at the end what turns out it is but you have to be very very careful with when and how you implement that visualization cause if you do it correctly it can really serve your goal seeking well and if you do it incorrectly it can undermine the entire process does visualization work well turns out that visualization of the big win the engoalso the superb win or eight gold metals in the olympics or graduation from the university of your choice or making a certain amount of money or finding the partner of your choice et camera that visualization is effective in getting the goal pursuit process started but it actually is a pretty lousy and may been counterproductive way of maintaining pursuit of that goal meaning continuing to engage the sort of actions that are going get you to eventually achieve that goal i think this a going to be surprising to people at first but if we think back to our discussion about the physiology of the blood pressure system it will make sense good scientific studies have been done where people are told to imagine or even script out their long term vision and goal for themselves what is the big goal and it there taught to or told to imagine it with a rich amount of detail to think tat how it is can a feel in their body an the big wind and basically what happens is if you measure people's blood pressure or other metrics of physiology you see in increase in that systolic blood pressure there's an kind of a camping up of the readiness and excitement for that goal but that increase in blood pressure quickly wains and over time that visual of the long term goal becomes a poor thing to rely on in order to generate the actions that are required to reach that goal in fact there is a much better way to maintain on going action toward a goal that also involves his realization but it turns out it is not about visualizing success it is about visualizing failure the falsetto slab and other labs have looked at whether not people make progress toward goals of different types whether r not there thinking about the goal the thing about that goal line and what they want to achieve that long turn goal and all the wonderful things associate with it or whether not they are thinking about all the ways in which they could fail and route to that goal this is not typically what we are encourage to do typically we are told do not imagine failure push failure out of your mind only to canon success fact till you make it or is a phrase that i absolutely hate frankly because i clear with that means and at i clear what the ethical form of that is i think it means continue despite any anxiety or fear that things will not work out but if you look at the literature the scientific literature what the falsetto slab and other laps have shown is that there is a near doubling near doubling in the probability of reaching one's goal if you focus rouroutinely on foreshadowing failure you think about the ways in which things could fail if you take action a or you take action be and instead therefore you take action we you are specs to think about how things could fail if you do not get up and run each morning if your goal is say a fitness goal let us it use that as an example because even though i realize people are in pursuit of many things not just fitness fitness goals and physical goals are a very concrete thing that we can all get on the same page about as they're related to actions let us say somebody is they sets a goal of running five miles four times a week minimum and as many as seven four times weetmentmun be four at a m can a previous pod cast on habits i talked about the benefits of tonsil setting specific times that one will do things but setting time blocks that one will do things you say before ait a m you can run five miles and that is can o happen up to seven days a week one version of this would be of sit back in a chair and think about how great you are going to feel in look if you are doing this every day how your health is going to improve how everything's going your blood markers of lipids at center are going to improve okay fine that is the visualization goal of visualizing the en point turns out that is far less effective and may be even counter productive compared to thinking about what is con to happen if you do not do this the negative health out comes that ore going tor cur the disappointment you are gong to have in yourself the fact that you are going to wait until seven thirty that is not long enough for many people to run five miles you gore to put on your shoes as to be pouring rain or even hailing or snowing outside and now you are not going outside unless you are somebody whose particularly motivated to do that of foreshadowing failure turns out to be the best way to mode of eight toward goal pursuit in fact as i mention before there is in near doubling in the likelihood that people will reach goals of any kind when they are constantly thinking about how bad it is going to be if they fail if we think back to the nerd circuit associated with a messing value in our goal pursuits this makes perfect sense the eidola that center of the brain that is in told an anxiety and f are and worry well the imigdola is one of the four for components of our goal setting and goal pursuit circuitry and there is no bi passing that there is no one listening to this or watching this whose eidola is not involved in their goal setting and goal pursuit behavior and while it'd love to be able to tell you that all you should think about is rainbows and puppies and all the wonderful rewarding things that on to happen when you achieve your goals the truth is you should be thinking mainly about how bad it is really going to get if you do not do it how disappointing yourself your gin a feel how it will negatively impact you if not in the immediate term in the long term if indeed your goal is to reach your goal i want o emphasize that ism not interested in encouraging people to coagulate themselves ism encouraging people too achieve their goals and it turns out the best way to do that is by for shadowing failure and the more specific you can get by writing down or thinking about our talking about how bad it will be if you do not achieve your goals the more likely you are to achieve those goals part of the reason for that almost certainly has to do with increases in systolic blood pressure and increases in readiness in your system when you imagine failure the brain and body are much better at moving away from fearful things than towards things we want i wish i could tell you that was not the case but there is a true a symmetry in the way we are built in fact the brain and body can engage in what is called one trial learning when something bad happens we eat of food that makes a sick we have an interaction with a person or place that we really do not it only takes one trial to read one event one time to reorient or rewire our curl circuitry that we have a bias toward moving away from that thing in the future when things go well unfortunately that does not often occur if things go really really well it might orient our brain embody toward wanting more of that thing and will have neral circuitry changes that will lead us to engage in that particular behavior or interaction again but it is never as effective as these avoiding circuits again foreshadow failure if you are going to visualize in a positive way do that at the very beginning of some goal pursuit may be intermittently every once in a while you imagine the big win of i o scoring perfect on exam or winning the championship or the great relationship but most of the time if you want of be effective you should be focussing on avoiding failure and you should be really clear about what those failures would look in feel now let us talk about goal setting going back to that prominent literature the psychology and popular literature again can here some of these theme start to emerge the goal should be significant we are told it should be inspirational it should be aggressive yet realistic well o we that is all fine and good but let us get semi quantitative about this let us at least get biological about this how inspirational doesn't need to be is does it need to be the kind of thing that is inspiring to me that i cannot sleep at all without one be good because i believe and i know many you have heard me say many many times before regular deep sleep eighty per cent or more of the nights that you go to sleep is going to be crucial to your connive and mental functioning in your ability achieve your goals in a long term that is absolutely clear it is how to be inspirational and exciting but what does that really look and what is that correspond to and how to we actually make that happen well once again there is a mismatch between what the real data show and what were most often told turns out that again work in balsetaslab but also other laboratories has a a dressed weather r not the probability of achieving a goal goes up or down depending on whether not one visualizes or sets a goal that is easy moderate or impossible can impossible goal would be for instance if i say ism going jump from my front driveway all the way up to the road the roads quite a distance away it is more than twenty mentors away is just not kin it happens i in happen this lifetime as i hatpin any other lifetime not unless it involve some elaborate technology that ism not aware of a setback or something that it is just not kin it happen right an easy goal would be something can you jump or could i jump n a too feet in front of me obviously yes or can now musing a trivial example here but this could be translated to any kind of goal school goal physical goal et camera turns out that when people set goals whether not they are nutritional goals eat more of this or eat less of that with another fitness goals in a run more lift more some other goal swim less swim more whatever it is their gal happens to be some learning goal some relationship goal some attempt to modify their behavior turns out that if the goal is too easy it is too within reach it does not recruit enough of the autonomic nervous system to make pursuit of that goal likely now that might be surprising at least it was surprising to me you think was something is really really easy i as a very low bar to achieve it people probably more likely to do it but turns out that is not the case when we hear that a goal needs to be inspirational what we mean when we hear that something is too easy to recruit our action what we mean well thalsetaslab measured systolic blood pressure and found that when goals were too easy for people to attain they did not get that increase in systolic blood pressure and recruitment of the other curl and vascular systems meaning the blood systems and the nervous system that would place them into on going effort and they quickly gave up also if a goal was too lofty if it was too far from their current abilities it did not recruit enough systolic blood pressure even if people could get very excited about something mentally it simply did not place their body into a state of readiness because they it was not tangible that they could actually perhaps really achieve it it turns out that when goals were moderate when they were just outside of one's immediate abilities or that one felt that yet that would take a lot of effort but it is within range or maybe in range maybe i can do it maybe i cant then there was a near doubling g of the systolic blood pressure in the good sense it did not go into the unhealthy range and ay doubling or more of the likelihood that they would engage in the ongoing pursuit of that particular goal here for ti am a goal setting what we are saying is set goals the are realistic but that are not realistic that they are easy the goals need to be realistic and truly challenging do not set goals that are challenging and lofty that they crash that blood pressure system in the other direction and make you or any one feel unmotivated in hearing this it make sense but i do not think i would have predicted it had they not done this very controlled study i would have thought the loftier the goal the bigger the goal the more that it recruits the autonomic a system and the more that people are likely to lean into the energy and effort to pursue and attain that goal i also would have thought the if a goal is really easy to achieve that it would engage the systems of action in the brain and body enough that people would sort of get into motion and pursue that goal but neither is the case again set goals that are difficult to achieve but that are not lofty that they collapse your system and that you feel overwhelmed and the important thing here is that how we perceive a goal whether not we think its within reach or not of course will vary depending on whether not we are rested depending on whether not other aspects or of our life or going well and we can think that we are hot on the heels of a lifetime goal and everything's going well and then there will be some crisis interpersonal crisis or there will be a health crisis and he'll be shut down and then that goal seems very very hard to attain we we will talk about how to update goals under different contacts in a few minutes but of course this is going to be an averaging this is in something that you do just once but the take away again is very simple set goals that are moderately hard to hard but not hard nor easy that they do not engage your brain in body properly moderate goals are best if you want to achieve your goals now i to talk about three particulars of scientific study that point to goal pursuit goals element and goal achievement previously i told you that it is great to foreshadow failure that that is a great way to get your system into a state of activation i also told you that you want us sat goals that are challenging but possible and again here on paraphrasing from the work of family bullet us or on to be very clear there are few other things that one can do in order to bias the likelihood that you will succeed in trying to achieve your goals first of all limit your options trying to pursue too many goals at once can definitely be counter productive now i realize that life is complicated we all have multiple goals that were trying to pursue but if we have particular goals that are important to us we have to be careful to nock at distracted by other goals and many people run into this problem setting one or two or maybe three major goals for a given year is going to be more than enough for most people and is actually going to be challenging for most people of course we have daily goals and monthly goals and yearly goals but if we have big lofty goals we need o be careful not to contaminate our mental space and our visual space with too many goals and why do i say visual goals well what serious department stores and supermarkets have discovered is that the greater the number of things in our visual attention the more that we can draw or attention and our goals off a line of pursuit what does that mean well let sting about in the practical contacts this as actually been done big department stores have figured out that if they stock their shelves chalk of block with many many options of food or clothing items or objects or anything that people simply buy more stuff people are very prone to orienting their attention to whatever in front of them you put a lot of stuff in front of them their attention drifts you put fewer things in front of them their attention is more narrow in a later episode we will talk about designing a work space that is optimized on the basis of this it does not mean being in our room with nothing except just your desk in a computer does not have to be that sparse but visual sparseness actually can help us orient our focus an our behavior when we have a lot of things in our visual environment or lot of things in our connive environment it is the same thing and f you are going to try in pursue a fitness goal of relationship goal and academic goal and a long term life financial goal all at once that is four things and you are going to have to come up with systems that allow you to isolate those goals in a very rigid way and if you do have multiple interleaving goals and overlapping goals and simultaneous goals in if yew minutes we are going to talk about a process that will allow you to use your visual system to a line towards each of those goals sequentially in a way that makes it much more likely that you will achieve them now let us talk about specificity of goals we have all heard that the more specific o goal is and the more specific we are about when and how we are going to execute that goal the higher probability that we will actually achieve that goal and indeed that is the case but there's an additional feature that is not often discussed that is vitally important and in fact may be more important than having a specific time of day or specific end point in mind the really nice study that was done looking at recycling this is something that a number of groups business is households and individuals are trying to do more of they are trying to lower carbon footprint or contribute to om the world in some general way by throwing away fewer things that could potentially be recycle this has been studied an the contacts of the work environment where a business decides and lets everybody know that there is going to be a greater effort toward recycling cans or bottles or bottles in cans et camera and then the way these studies were done is that the janitorial staff was swopped out temporarily f or researchers that actually measured the number of recyclable items that showed up in the trash and not in the recycle as a function of the total amount of trash what i say the function total mound trash what is a way of controlling for om differences in beverage consumption from one week the next anyway the point is they were able to very carefully measure how much people are recycling before and after this call to action to recycle more what they found was if they said we are going to try in recycle more try not to put cans and bottles in the trash there of course was an improvement in recycling but it was pretty modest whereas when there was a very concrete plan and everyone knew wat that concrete plan was for instance to place all bottles and cans into the recycle not the trash or to limit the amount of trash by fifty percent or to eliminate all recyclable items from the trash when they made it very concrete exactly what the action steps were there was a remarkable i man close to a hundredfold or more improvement in recycling behavior that lasted many months after this call to action was made the take away from this is quite straightforward it means that having a concrete plan is essential you cannot just say i men to become a better recycler or i men to do things that are better for the environment or i mean to become more physically fit it has to be a specific set of action steps that get right down to details about what success would look have heard this before described as what does right look what is the actual outcome that one would to achieve in terms of action steps not in a curly feeling states it was not that they all sat around that how great world en a feel about ourselves in the world when we accomplish this goal it was very concrete statements very concrete plans about action steps that would deliver one to one's goal somewhat straightforward and an intuitive but none the less worth while it it what it suggests is that for all of us if we have certain goals the we want to achieve we need to be exquisitely detailed about what the action steps are that we are going to take and to constantly update those action steps that we have a higher probability of meeting those action steps some of you may be asking how often should one assess progress well that of course will depend on the given goal that your trying to pursue but in the studies that have been referring to hear the a cessiment of progress and the updating of concrete plans was done weakly it seems like weakly is a good starting place to address how well one performed in the previous week and then based on that performance tho update the action plan forward the upcoming week weakly seems a good solid rule of thumb for setting particular action goals and accessing one's progress towards the immediate and longer term goals any discussion about goals and goal pursuit would be incomplete without a discussion about the molecule dopamine dopamine is often thought of as the molecule of pleasure and reward but actually it is the molecule of motivation this is best illustrated by a classic set of studies that have been carried out in both animals and in humans the animal study can be described the following way two rats each in a separate cage you can provide those rats with the opportunity to indulge in something that they food or mating or heat if its cold in the environment or a cool spot in the cage if its warm in the environment and forth in what you find is that rats will very readily approach the rewarding thing they will mate they will eat they will pursue something that is of pleasure now if you are to take one of those rats and deplete its dopamine neurons you can eliminate its dopaminurons or block dopamine in the brain what you find is that those animals will still enjoy pleasure they will consume the food they will mate et camera however their motivation to achieve pleasure is vastly reduced in fact if you place the item of pleasure the mate the food et camera even just one rat's length away from that rat the rat without dopamine will not even move one length of its own body in order to achieve that pleasure and there are naturally occurring experiments in humans that mimic that result very accurately there are certain conditions in humans where there is a depletion of dopamine in what you find is that the depletion of dopamine does not inhibit an ability to experience pleasure necessarily it inhibits an ability to pursue or go through the series of action steps in order to achieve pleasure dopamine really sits at the heart of our motivational state to seek out goals and to seek pleasure and this is true for immediate goals that take place within a time frame of minutes or a tie came of a day or the airframe of a week or the timeframe of a lifetime dopamine is the common currency by which we pursue goals now dopamine does a number of things that are very interesting i am gan describe a few of them as they relate to goal seeking behavior first of all there is a fundamental feature of how our brain releases and uses dopamine that is called reward prediction error and the simplest way to think about dopamine reward prediction error is that dopamine is released in the greatest amount and place us as into a greater state of motivation when something happens that is positive and novel now an important thing to understand about dopamine is that it is not always released on the same schedule there couple different ways that dopamine is released and when it is released relative to your anticipation of a reward is key if you do not expect something positive to happen it is going about your day and something positive happens dopamine and a lot of dopamine is released i had this happened recently i had no idea that i was going to be receiving something in the man but i went to the man i looked in the man and i got something very positive and out really really excited about this is a real event that happened just today however if we anticipate something positive is going to happen and then that thing happens we experience dopamine as part of the anticipation even before we get the reward there is an increase in dopamine it is not as high as it would be if something really novel and unexpected and positive happen but we do get an increase in dooming and then when we actually experience the reward we experience the positive thing there is a smaller increase in dopamine case again the biggest increases in dopamine are response to things that or positive and unexpected lesser dopamine is released when we anticipate something good will happen and when that happens yes we get some dopamine and we also get some dooming when the positive thing happens think about anticipating a great meal with friends we have some dopamine churning friends come over then we have the meal and we also get some dopamine from that but not nearly as much as we would if it at all happened as a part of a big apprise then there is also the case in which we predict that something good will happen when that happens there is an increase in dooming just as it was before but then if that thing does not happen for instance our friends do not show up for dinner then there is a drop in dooming below our initial base line that drop in dopamine is the chemical essence of what we call this appointment now this dopamine reward prediction error as it is called can be leveraged toward trying to reach our goals because it tells us where we should set our milestones we cannot be in a mode of simply being focused on the finished line very few people can do that over long periods of time in a way that is effective now earlier i talked about a study where people were focussed on a finish line visually and they were moving through space with these ankle waits on but that was a very short term goal ochres if a goal is within minutes or maybe even within an hour iris in with our mediate visuals of environment maybe we can do that but most goals of the sort that most people are pursuing fitness gals academic gulls business gulls relationship gulls et camera involve some milestones understanding what we know about reward prediction err we can make better choices about were to place the milestones how far out in the future to place milestones then the question becomes how often or at what intervals should one assess progress and it turns out this is very subjective but that there is a way to make it objective now in a previous episode of the vegan labpodcass i had a discussion with the great robot's appolski and we are talking about how the brain can subjectively change whether not a given behavior or experience is positive or negative and the example that robot gave as a really phenomenal one it is a a study that is been done in rats and also in humans where it took a rat they had a rat run on a running real rats turns out to run on running wheels and the blood pressure of that animal the health metrics for that animal the lipid profiles many many things improved o gay the rat was exercising and it got healthier and presume we got happier we do not know we could have asked it but we would not know doesn't know how to tell us but we can measure bloodlipids we can measure blood pressure and all sorts of things and indeed when that rat exercised or when people exercise they generally get healthier except in that particular experiment they had another animal where every time rat number one ran rat number to was forced to run it was on a running wheel and it was forced to run not because it wanted to but because it was forced to and what was remarkable is that the physiological effects of being forced to do something we are in the complete opposite direction as they were when those same behaviors were undertaken voluntarily in other words the rat that was choosing to run got healthier and the rat that was forced to run became unhealthy blood pressure went up in a direction that was not effective and useful bloodline has got worse stressharmons went up et camera et camera and you see the same thing in humans now what this says is that our subjective understanding of why we are doing something is fundamentally important for the effects that we will get from that behavior and indeed the effects of that behavior will have on us this has to major implications first of all interns of reward schedules we can decide to use any reward schedule that we want for a given behavior we can decide that the milestones for a let us say a plan of getting in really terrific party of vascular shape over the next year we can decide to access every day and ask ourselves how good was our progress and if we made progress than were can reward ourselves we could do that every third day we could do it every week we could do it every five minutes if we actually have the time to do that the reward schedule the opening system is highly susceptible to the subjective effects these call top down effects of when we decide that something is going to be good for us if we analyze it on a given time frame well then it is going to be good for us what i suggest people do is pick a particular interval at which they are going to assess progress and if you have been making regular progress towards a goal that you reward yourself and the reward indeed is all cognitive it is all mental its telling yourself yes ism on the right track now some people say wait but i want to no exactly how often i should do that you need to do that at an interval that you can maintain consistently okays you are not going to reward yourself every minute were every step of every jog that you take unless you can do it every minute of every step of every jog that you take for that reason i think that mut that daily or ideally weekly assessments are g going to be best i think that checking in at the end of a week looking back on the previous week and assessing how well you performed in pursuit of a given goal how many times a week you ran or how many times you studied or how many times you did something hat you wanted to do or avoided something tat you did not want to do i think that to reasonable and tractable schedule to assess once a week that is one point that pick a milestone that you can maintain consistently throughout the pursuit of a goal the second thing is that the subjective effects that were described by that supolsky study or that supulsky described rather or absolutely essential for all aspects of goal seeking behavior we cannot under estimate the extent to which the dopamine system and our sense of whether or not we are on the right track is under our cognitive control if we constantly place ourself into a mode of thinking that we are failing well then indeed we are not going to turn out much dopamine now earlier i said we need to predict and visualize failure but that is not the same thing as thinking about ourselves as failing we need to predict what the outcome would be if we failed but then in countering that and in behaving in a certain way and thinking in a certain way and pursuing our goals in an effective way may be checking in on that each week we definitely need to reward ourself cognitively for the correct and successful pursuit what this means is that anticipate and think about failure as a mechanism of generating motivation and indeed fear and anxiety that you lean into the correct behaviors and you lean away from the incorrect behaviors to reach your goal but then weakly or whatever you can maintain consistently you absolutely want to reward yourself cognitively by telling yourself ism on the right track i got another week where i accomplish whatever it is that ism trying to accomplish a concrete example that ism following now as this hundred and fifty to two hundred minutes of zone two cardie per week because that shown to be very effective in improving mental and physical health metrics once a we all checked with myself if i reach that hundred and fifty to hunt to two hundred minute threshold then it'll reward myself simply by checking off abortion saying oke ism on track ism on track on track this dopamine system is critical to re up to remind ourselves that we are on track if indeed we are e on track because dopamine itself provides a state of motivation and readiness to continue in the regular pursuit of our goals dopamine the molecule is actually used to manufacture epinefran in norapanefran which are other molecules in our brain an body which put us into that readiness and action state they are actually the molecules that help generate that increase in systolic blood pressure that put it puts us into a state of readiness you can think about dopamine as a self amplifying system provided that you are leveraging the dopamine system on a consistent schedule now by also following a consistent schedule of self reward you set yourself up for any positive unanticipated rewards that may happen for instance if you're checking in with yourself weakly telling yourself that your doing well if indeed you are and then out of nowhere for instance you are out on a run or your doing something i amusing fitness as example by you are doing something you find yourself performing particularly well that is a unexpected dopamine reward that will further amplify the system now know many people out there having heard me talk about dopamine before worry well can i release too much dopamine and then the whole system will crash and then it'll run out o motivation in general that does not happen unless people are using pharmacology supplements or prescription drugs or elicit drugs to increased dopamine this is why ism a big fan of things cold showers and cold water exposure was which has been shown to lead to long lasting too point five ex increases in dopamine or in some cases supplementation with things altirasine which our precursors to dopamine or in some cases canine which can increased the number of dopamine receptors that we have that whatever doping we have floating around can be more effective in activating these modeofational states but things that really increase dopamine and then cause it to crash can be problematic one way to conceive of dopamine is as a sort of dopamine wavepool you promising these wavepools where some pressure is pushed into the pool than you get these waves going if those waves are consistent enough but that and there of high enough amplitude the waves can continue to go up and down and up and down but if it is a giant wave if you get a huge blast of dopamine well then a bunch of the water sloshes out of the wavepool and then you easily have to take some time off reset that dopamine level that is what happens in addiction and when people start pushing in a lot of a drugs or other things into the system that increase dopamine too much to day we have almost exclusively been talking about behavioral tools it is possible to incorporate supplement send things to that sort that can increased dopamine as a way to getting into on going motivational states but i caution people in about relying on those too much really what you want is you want a situation where your own positive feed back your own understanding that you are reaching the milestones that you have set out for yourself that your achieving those and that is what is causing these waves are these increases in dopamine that will further amplify your mode national states another very interesting aspect of dopamine that have not talked about at all on this podcast before is actually how the dopamine system interacts with the visual system we talked a lout about how harnessing your visual attention to a particular point is great and can help serve your ability to both set and achieve goals really wonderful work that was done by wolfram shoals whose one of the great pioneers in this area of dopamine and dopamine reward predictionery showed that for people that of normal levels of dopamine there visual search meanie how they scandivisual environments tends to be pretty constrained they might move their eyes around o particular visual environment searching somewhat for people that lack dopamine they actually have very little movement of their eyes they do not actually tend to look very far into the horizon there do not have that very focus virgins point that were talking about the kind of ai guess for lack of a better phasic an my of the tiger focus on a goal rather their i movements are depleted and they are not actually evaluating horizons often their future they are not focus much on the extra extrapersonal space and this actually can be restored in some of these took place in parking in stations and other people of dopamine to pleaded that when dopamine is restored pharmicalogically their visual focus is re enhanced again now there are lot of details to the study that do not mat perfectly on to everything that have talked about but the point is this when we are focused on a particular point in visual space or is particular goal or horizon all those systems are blood pressure epineferan end indeed dopamine get recruited to put us into a state of readiness and willingness to go pursue things in that extra personal space when our visual attention is very diffuse all of that relaxes and we tend to be more comfortable staying in the place that we are in our tripersonal space and the effect works in the other direction too when dopamine is increased are visual attention for particular things out in space increase the way it works is reciprocal when we use our visual system in a particular way bring it to a point of focus it recruits chemical and neural systems in our brain and body that put us into a state of readiness in pursuit and when we increase certain chemicals in our brain and body epaneferand dopamine then we also allow our visual system to be in a state of looking out at particular locations in our visual world the system works in both directions and some people leverage this by using things affine or taking things eltiricine to increase dopamine and again it works both ways there is no right or wrong way to do it i am a particular fan of using behavioral tools always prior too using supplementation or any kinds of other tools because behavioral tools have a very unique feature that supplementation and other chemical tools do not which is that behavioral tools used over time engage neral plasticity as we start to practise using our visual system to harness our attention to particular locations and in that way move toward particular goals we get better an better at using those systems in fact the systems for focus and motivation themselves have plasticity to we get better at being motivated in focus when we place our visual attention at a given location using chemical assistance of a safe kind of course check with your doctor but things eltirisine or caffeine ore those combined yes it will increase dopamine an will increase our ability to engage in visual focus somewhat but those compounds alone do not modify the circuitry's in the way that we want i always say behavioral tools first then nutritional tools then supplementation tools and hand if it is right for you in safe may be you advanced into some of the other more sophisticated tools it'd to just briefly recap what have covered up until now and again emphasized that much of what have covered has been based on the beautiful work of family ballet us and colleagues yo hope to get her as a guest on the podcast by the way first of all set goals that are challenging but possible those moderate goals not superheavy not superdifficul but moderate my challenging goals seem to be the most effective in moving people towards their goals over the short and long term second plan concretely you need a concrete set of actions that you are on to follow in order to reach your goals third foreshadow failure this is a somewhat surprising one to me i would have anticipated that imagining success is the way to go it turns out that imagining success in visualizing success can be useful at the outset of a goal and may be every once in a while in pursuit of that goal but that it is not terrific for putting you in constant pursuit of that goal rather foreshadowing failure visualizing failure in all the terrible things that it is going to bring seems to be more effective in that maps very well to what is known about the nail circuitry in the involvement of the emigdula focus on particular visual points as a way to harness your attention and to remove distractions removing distractions in getting your body and brain into a mode of activation getting that healthy increase in systolic blood pressure that puts you in to forward motion towards your goals is absolutely key that is a brief summary of what have covered up until now there were other things too of course the dopamine system men the power of subjective top down control in regulating that opening system but i want to be sure to include a tool that is been especially powerful for me that is grounded in the narrow science to search and in the psychology research and as i describe this tool next i think you will see the ways in which it meshes nicely with the work that evil ballet us and colleagues have done this is something that have personally been doing for many years based an my understanding of the visual system and the understanding that indeed we can move our cognition and our perception from a place of interception and focusing on our perry personal space that space within us in immediately around us and on the things that are immediately accessible to us that we can shift from that mode to this mode of extroception of focusing on things outside the confines of our kind and that are beyond our reach that are literally goal directed behaviors in goal directed thoughts and this is something the in the past i have talked abut a little bit have talked about something called space time bridging in it we have not talk too much about the time domain of the visual system to day but space time bridging is simply away of using one's visual system to focus on the perry personal space and in terreception and then gradually in a deliberate way stepping one's focus into the extra personal space and then back to the very personal space in a way that gives you a lot of flexibility and control over that ability in your daily life ism in the first describe the tool and then i will explain more about the underlying science and the underlying mechanism here is hell you would do this you could do this indoors or outdoors although ideally you would do it in a location where you could view a horizon it could be through window or ideally outdoors without a window could be done any time of day at night it might be a little more challenging but it goes the following way you first you is you would close your eyes this could be done leader standing but you would close your eyes and you would focus as much of your attention including your visual attention on your inner landscape on your interception that would be your breathing your heart rat may been the surface of your skin but really focussing internally now how can you focus your visual attention internally if your eyes foreclose well you do that by imagining your inner landscape cha you not to imagine your heart beating and forth but what your trying to do is a eliminate perception of the outside world your eliminating enter attention and your focussing all of your connive attention and your perceptual attention on what your experiencing within the confines of your skin or at the level of the surf's of your skin and inside your body and you would do that for a duration of a proximately three slow breaths of close your eyes you would do breath one breath too and breath three concentrating all yourattention on y u internal landscape then you would open your eyes and you would focus your visual attention on some area on the surface of your body for me the way that i typically do this will be to focus on say the palm of my hand while focus my visual attention on the pall my hen and i then do three breaths again focusing on my internal state but now ism splitting out a little bit of my attention from interception to extraroception focussing on something outside me the ratio or the split of attention is about ninety ten about ninety per cent of my attention is focused internally but ism also focussing some of my attention externally most people can o this pretty easily then there is a third what i call station i now move my visual attention to outside my body to some location in the room or if i am outside in the external environment something in the range of five to fifteen feet away and ism trying to move ninety percent of my attention to that external object now ism really biasing my perception and my attention towards exteroceptor as i breathe on paying attention to those three breaths that is why there still ten percent that is focussed on my internal landscape because i want o pay attention of those three breaths but ism focussing as much of my attention a outside of myself maintaining just a little bit on my internal states i can measure the cadence of those three breaths then i move my visual attention to yet another station which is further away typically a horizon or something as far off in the distance as i can possibly see again for the duration of three breaths and at that point ism trying my very best to move ninety nine if not a hundred per cent of my attention to that external location and then what i typically will do is i will try and expand both my vision and my cognition to a much broader here this is that magnacellar vision that we talked about before where ism not focusing on a particular location on the horizon ism trying to dilate the aperture of my field of so i can see as much of the visual landscape as cumin as possible if you are in an internal on excuse me if you are in indoors then that might be the sealing the walls and the floor of the environment your if your out doors it would be to expand your visual focus as broadly as you possibly can again for the duration of three breaths then i would return immediately to my internal landscape i would close my eyes and i would do three more breaths focussing entirely on my interception on my internal landscape or what we call before it my very personal space and i would then repeat that perry personal space hundred per cent focused on my hand ninety per cent ten per cent on my perry personal space for my internal landscape stepping out to another location where it is mostly exteroceptor may be a little bit of of recognition of my internal scape then to the horizon then to this broader visual sphere than back into my body and i would work through each of those stations may be two or three times the entire thing takes about ninety seconds to three minutes depending on how many breaths you do i said three but you could do one or ten it does not really matter or it is also can to depend on for instance how slowly your breathing cause you a breathing might be faster than mine or is feria what is all of this doing why do i call the space time bridging and wisest useful for goal setting the reason i call it space time bridging is that the visual system is not just about analyzing space it is actually how we batch time its how we carve up time and the simple way to state this is that when we focus our visual attention on a very narrow point that is close to our body and our immediate experience we tend to slice up time very finely we are focused on our breathing were focussed on our heart beats in fact our breathing and our internal landscape and our heart beats become the sort of second hand if you will on our experience we are carving up time according to our immediate physiological experience whereas when we focus our visual attention outside our body not only do we engage that exteraceptive extra personal space system and we stare to engage the dooming system the goal directed system but we also start batching time differently when we focus our visual system into a broader sphere of space or into a space beyond the confines of our skin we start carving up time our frame rate changes now this is useful in the context of goal setting goal assessment an goal pursuit because with the exception of a very few isolated examples almost all goals involve setting some goal that is often the future and then carving up the time between now and the achievement of that goal into milestones that range in duration and the rewards even if we trying just make them every week are going to come at some unexpected intervals and that is actually can be helpful for reenforcing behavior intermit reward that is intermittent and random is the most effective reward schedule we know but the problem is always how do we keep our cognition in line with the long term goal while also being focus on these more immediate goals and this particular practice that i call peacetime bridging but we can give it a different name ism sure thenar better names when we can suggest some in the comment section on you to that are more accurate or more a map to it better but this behavior or this practise rather is teaching us to use our visual system and thereby our connive system and thereby our reward systems to orient to different locations in space and therefore t different locations in time and that is the essence of goal directed behavior that is the essence of setting a goal it is about thinking about what you want then it is about setting milestones that are intermediate to that goal then it is about assessing whether not your reaching those milestones and then it is of course about updating your goals if you need to update your goals all of that is an enormously confusing batch of challenges if you think about it all at once but if you break it down into these elements that the visual system can help you find and move towards those milestones i think there is ample evidence to support that and that your control over your visual system is indeed yours that you can deliberately set it to different locations and then you make a practice of stepping through these different stations on a regular basis again i do this each morning i do this once a day home rarely have i done it twice a day rarely have i miss ta day but by doing that you can be very effective in teaching the systems of your brain that are related to goal setting of reward to map to different time frames i found this to be a very effective protocol the falsettos work has mainly focused on visual tools that are of a single horizon hereon talking about multiple what i call stations or horizons but what is very clear is that an ability to move from different visual stations and to do that in it deliberate way in a focussed and conscious way clearly maps to an ability to conceive of different goals over different periods of time and i do believe can be greatly beneficial in allowing one to set particular goals and then move through the milestones to those goals and to constantly update ones pursuit and reward in reaching those milestones and eventually the over all goal per usual covered a lot of material to day we talked about some the narrow science and psychology and popular understanding of goal seeking behavior how to assess goals et camera ice about the beautiful work of family falsettos at new york university and the her work on the use of the visual system to better achieve goals and indeed things visualization and why forecasting failure can be more effective than forecasting success as center intuitive that might seem outs with the data point to and we talked about the importance of setting concrete plans and really what that means and what intervals at which to assess progress and what intervals at which to assess reward and how the dopamine system is involve and in addition i describe to this practice that one can incorporate as a daily or semi daily practise of called peacetime bridging of using the visual system and your ability to deliberately step your visual system from stations that are within your bodies call very personal or interceptive space out into the world further and further and than back again in sequent as a way to harness and cultivate and build up these systems that link vision space time reward systems and forth ultimately as you set out to accomplish your goals there are going to be a number of basic steps that everyone will have to follow you have to clearly identify what the long arching ultimate goal is you have to identify what the milestones will be you might not know all of them at the outset but you ought to have some idea about the intervals at which you are going to set those milestones and set your reward schedule for assessing progress in to those milestones in your ultimate goal my hope is that you will be able to incorporate these tools if not all of them perhaps just one of them or two of them in pursuit of whatever particular goals you happen to be footstone at this

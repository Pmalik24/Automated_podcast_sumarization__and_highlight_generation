a folks earlier this week you remember that we reported on d e i inside medical schools diversity equity and inclusion over duke medical school surgical teams that are being infused with d e i principles medical schools that are teaching witness as opposed to actual medicine and we ask you for tips and we have received those steps we are now breaking news about internal males from utilized medical school which is one o of us in the country my wife went to you seal medical school to great medical school but if you annoy understand how d e i works at medical schools he have to c these females these males come from a monitory class that is called structural racism and health equity structural racism and health quit you silk medical students are told to read about wars of indigenous resistance in which native america killed thousands of white people to imagine what liberation could look is legitimately what is being taught a medical schools you shall you have to be inculcated into the cult of likeness in order to actually achieve that which you seek to achieve which of course is the d e i principal meanwhile students are also taught about blackness and indignity and quote how we can imaginal world and the aftermath of settler colonialism and white supremacy and as students are also told that for further recommended reading they should read an article titled decolonization is not a metaphor which again when when people say decolonization is not a editor what they mean is that they are excusing actual violent imaginal world in the aftermath of settler colonialism and and white supremacy by the way means eviceratingall the social structures because with the left means when thy say settler colonialism is literally anything the west has done and when they mean white supremacy they do not mean white people believing they are superior black people they just mean all the structures of society which they believe are inherently races the males from this first your class over you silk medical school also reveal that students are encouraged listen to a pocket titled indigent which covers it in array of unscientific abate including people who identify as conquer two spirit and comic stop i because you can say women because they concludes men as w o m ex and which is not even pronounceable what exactly makes this not it recommended but monitory class work for medstudents how exactly dos this mean that these are going to be better medical professionals the answer is it desire it inculcates into them a set of values in that set of values then supposed to be carried for it into the practice of medicine your supposed to presumably value certain nations more highly than others your supposed to treats your patients differently that on race because after all your fighting white supremacy and settler colonialism these materials are not just irrelevant they are actually dangerous because again the only thing you should be taught in medical school is how to do the medicating you should not be taught about why various types of interjectional populations are more valuable than others because it turns out that the health recommendation for diabetes should be the same a cross the board it should not depend on the quonquot history of structural racism you should have to soul your punches because you are afraid of offending the somebody when the proper medical diagnosis of an issue require that diagnosis the only way to actually stop all of this is of course to expose it to that is what we have been doing again folks if you have and he sort of in formation newsworthy information you would to share go to tiptoe daily wire dot come and go check them out right now and send us whatever tips you have and we may reported on the show an meanwhile yesterday the big news o the day is that donate trump and jobidon had fueling trips down to the boarder and this about as bad press as you can have if you are jobidon this is your most vulnerable issue according to the latest pulling do at twenty eight per cent of america say emigration is now there top issue and on that issue jobidon ranks in the low thirties he is twenty points under water against donate trump on this issue may be thirty according to certain poles and he heads downs thenar at the exact same time that trump is on the board which is always on to go portly for him this of course comes at the same exact time that polling is showing him trailing donate trump in a wide variety of battle ground states brand new bloomburg news morning consul swing state voter survey published on thirsty shows trump is a head of bison naris on a forty nine forty three in gorge a forty nine forty three in michigan forty six forty four in neat of forty eight forty two in north caroling fifty to forty one in pennsylvania forty nine to forty three and in wisconsin forty six to forty two was a devastatingly terrible numbers the close to state there is michigan wish to forces as we will discuss i jobidon is now pandering to the comaspans in deerborn it should be pointed out by the way that when it comes to michigan the exaggerated tale of how jobidon if ye appeals comose win michigan is not true when people say that a hundred thousand unpeople voted in committed in the state of michigan terms us up thirteen per cent of the number of people who voted in the michigan democratic primary whebrokobama in twenty twelve ran about ten per cent of people in the democratic primary voted in committed and if you go and look at deerborn michigan maybe four five thousand people total voted in committed in geerborn michigan which was supposed to be the place where jobidon was gain just absolutely get so lack by the arab america population that tends to be list proportionately procomas in reality a lot ofpeopleare voting on committed against jobidon not be cause of the comas war the are voting against jobidon or voting on committed because they do not think he is a very good president in any case the forty fifth president annal trump according to the near post beats out bison in a driveway ballast trump is forty three bison thirty seven a if bag gets nine per cent cornball west and green party candidate solstice get one per cent each and in ahead to head trump is ahead further a a large part of this is because people think that jobidon is not just in competent they think that he is senile and that is because he is both in competent as well as senile according to the washington post bison an trump headed to different parts of the border they fitted visited separate texts border towns president began when to brownsvolt texts which is the place where the emigration proem has largely been brought under control meanwhile dona trump when to eagle past which of course is were emigration has not been brought under control joining in go to eagle pass because it lookrally ugly for him but actually quite hideous he going to eagle pass and then in the background you see i legal emigrants rushing across the border shouting jobidon's name that probably a bad looked for him see him's go to eagle pass none them went to the border a disown ut where we went which is very actually seen most o the dentinal trafficking happening right now all is also comes amidst joyriding's white house referring to e legal emigrants as new comers ism not getting you this the thing that they did there is a white house factory those put fora on the senate bill that includes some language with regards the border and here is what thewhite house has quote the bill includes one point for billion dollars for cities and states for providing critical services to new comers and would expedite work from his for peoplewho are in the country and qualify they keep using the word newcomers as supposed to be legal immigrants how warm you think america are for that proposal seriously that these are just new comers as appose you people were he legally entering the country how many people believe it when allahandr mayarcus the secretary homlentsecurity says that no executive action jobidon can take would fix the border crisis we know for a fact there are significant executive actions that jobidon took as soon as he took office to reverse what donate from had done on the border itself here's allahondromaarcas however protesting that actually actually jobidin cannot do enough there is nothing can do on the board of yea executive action despite the fact that donate trumped executive actions that the president can take to reduce the number the large number of migrant that the or coming the has net the of border that we satin went any three continue this here act to the matter is the e it only enduring solution is legislation congress new tho a we have i bi artisan es o legislation that re enters for on i manly we number of ones was go privilege be the table the i technical an operational r ten penis ration was refer san i a the table we need congress to act nobody actually believes that they need congress to act he is in donate trump did not need congress to act what did jordan actually do when he got towns the word will first he staggered round a lot an the video of jordan just looks terrible it looks as though members of border patrol a is scoring in all timer nations on a walk about that is what it looks he can eerily stagger means just looks to i'msarry it looks awful the presidents of the united states does not he is not physically capable of this job a mean luck look at this this it is honestly it stay to watch he is effect fly dragging his feet your a paid he is on is slip on the gravel and and fall over he can hardly walk more than a few steps is the sort of commanding image do you want to be demonstrating in america southern border which is wide open to the drug car tells and make no mistake jobidons policies have fomented the designs of the drugcar tells again go check out the first episode of our series divided states hoiden over at daily wire and you will see that jobidon has left that southern boarder wide open and he is basically acting at the beast of the drugcar tells of this point the drugcar tells our rushing e legal emigrate to certain parts of the border as to read o fact boarder patrol from other parts of the boarder and then once those parts of the border are left unoccupied that is when the drugcar tells rush across all the guises with the backpacks filled lifentinal that is his actually happening at the border and seeing a staggering tottering old man barely holding himself upright around the border is not exactly a good look then jobidon tries to blame republicans for not putting together a by partizan consents a son immigration there is a bi partizan contents close the border just do it no one stopping you do but here is join trying to blame donate trump it is not going to work can my we i legal pass sass ire a to mister to shuck pass she choking miners a carer to book for so crash joking r all going you an chilling the con passes far pardon boards security we can do it to meter you known i no just the chumps fosticshishon t felt that words scurf got crecteris ever she us to the print call you e wonder we disco to given gin we except for the fact that you could to it yourself your on administration is floated trial balloons about returning to re main in mexico the executive action his a winning issue for donate trump which is why hoiden went down to the border an actively humiliated himself further i truly think your people asked who exactly running t the bison whorehouse he is runningthe biding campaign give in the absolutely competence of this campaign the answer is jobidon his a massive piarbooboo for jobidon just a couple weeks ago he committed another mass of piarbooboo he had the the prosecutor the special prosecutor who is looking into his mishandling classfight in formation basically say that he is a seen dotterel and he immediately rush to the microphones to prove it and he held a a late night press conference by late night me s seven thirty at night but for him that is late night that is well after the den he is early bird specialist available and he is normally tucking bet by that point he does a press conference trying to demonstrate his mental acuity and in the process proceeds to can the president of egypt the president of mexico and forget were exactly his son got his rosary the only person who made that call was jobidon who made the call to sand joining down to the boarder to dotter around and totter around on a gravel road and then blame donate trump it is it is only got to be bison it is got be widen himself is i if you i makesense if you are going go down to the border and announced strong action on the border than to make sent to go the border are n a go there n just look at things he makes no sense at all you look not only what could do nothing it looks your ignoring the waves of e legal immigration the habit crippled the country for the last several years meanwhile again tone from him self went down to the border as well and it'll leave it to you to decide who is closer to the median america on this particular issue dona trump or hoiden here is tonal true talking about this being a job n invasion he is crate this is a jo by invasion this is a biding invasion over the past three years i call him crooked jo because he is crooked es a terrible president is president our countries ever had a probably the most incompetent president we have ever had but it so allowing thousands and thousands of people to come in from china a ran gamin the congo serial and a lot of other nations many nations are not very friendly to us hes transported the entire column of a fighting aged men in the roll at a certain age an you look at i miss deal they look warriors to me somethings going on was bad now the united states is being overrun by the biding migrant crime it is a new form of vicious violation to our country it is migrant crime we go at biding my gooncrimebut that is a little bet along ill just lave it but every time her here that her mirin crime where that comes from allowing thou sands and thousands and actually millions an millions of people to come could be fifteen in could be eighteen million by the time he gets out of office gay well it may not be fifteen writing but is certainly seven t ten and then true put forward a pretty obis proposition which as be seen a wide variety of crimes committed by legal immigrants of the course of last we alone we reported the here on the show and and here is dona true joining out jo biding dos in fact o blood on his hands and there is no other way put that when you decide to leave the border wide open when you decide herein a change of slum policy that in order for you to be release in the country all you have to do i say i fear to go home you are going gain up with an awful to people come at crimes in the country and again there's the a lot of arguments is whether illegal immigration increases the crime write or whether hi legal immigrants have a lower crime write in for an subsections of theamerican population that is o relevant zero crime it should be committed by people who ark here illegally because the should not be here in the first place here is not a true going off on widen let yerisediticalegalalien criminal who as released into our country by jo widen was arrested for raping an eleven year o girl an street going her to death an paced e text and shortly before she was murdered she text the father that someone as knocking at the door he arrived home from work and found his orders bodies stuffed in laundry basket underneath the bed horrible crooked jo is the blood of countless citizen victims it is many stories to tell many horrible stories three years ago ad the most secure bother iris try brand as tying the general as saying it wit the most secure bother and people will outcome because they they pul get t get in he is right he is rights who is a major far by jo don he looks feeble looks out a touch looks he is not taking the action that he should all the subproblem for him now the media are simultaneously trying to put to bad the border issued by blaming it on both sides and then trying to put to bed the hunter biding corruption issue that issue is nock and go away s the media been trying to play up the fact that the f bi is prosecuting an unnamed sorts who was quoted by the f bi at one point with regard to the idea that jobidon was paid directly five million dollars and was hunter bison a that was a very small part of the hunter bi invasion was late breaking we been reporting the hunter biding corruption allegations for legitimately several eaters by the time that report from the f be t was even pushed out intone public by the house over my committee with that is that hunter bison testified behind close does the other day and the media basically declared that the hunter biding corruption story is now over because hunter bison i justified that his fathered nothing to do with it and really he was just tat he was all cause he was high or drunk none of this passes the smell test for example according to the naropost first son hunter biding claims in congressional testimony on wednesday that he was high or drunk when he wrote to a chines associate in twenty seventeen that he was quote sitting here with my father shortly before the trains for of five point one million dollars in to biding family link account a readout of the fifty four year old first son's close dor impeachment inquiries up at is mission with provided to numerous news talents on wednesday evening siting hunter's claim tat bison had nothing to do with the shape down of the chines stately c e f china energy you recall the story is a story in which hunter bison was on what sap with a person name jaw and demanded a bunch of money and said ism sitting right here next to my father and if you do not give us what we want my father is going to basically put the screws to you publicly according to the redoubt it said that hunter admitted he was high or drunk when he sent the sitting here with my father what is that message the he and he says he ended to the wrong recipients and is now embarrassed by the message the same force a that enter confirmed his dad was not sitting next to him well there is only one problem why exactly would you believe hunter bison basically the case hunter bid is now making is that you have contemporaneous what is at message is showing i was a my dad's house at the time and my dad was home and then magic he says that he sent the text the what is hap to the wrong jaw at did not italy go to gaherans is u some random guy name jaw wear then that the next day five million bucks chowed up from jam an his account what a coinciding or alternatively this sounds a giant lie since hunter appeared under a sepia the text in the testimony technical my counted as a more sensitive definition rive than a typical transcribed interview that what is hap missive the implicating join was provide to congress last year by the tires case agents josh bigger again the most damning stuff with regard to hunter bid as all stuff that hunter biding himself set forget about what people set about hunter bison twenty babylinskes the world the most damaging it f that is said in the hunter biding case was all set by hunter bison but what is that message saying my daddy is sitting right here with me give me what i want the tax to his own daughter saying have been paying this family's bills for half half the families builds for all of my life adjust takes my money mike all that suffix incredibly damaging in its directly from him again that the fact that that the media are trying to suggest that basically the case is now over yet no it is not and even if it does not and in job bisons impeachment the widespread perception of the bid family which is correct is that it is deeply rot because obviously it is every single personal the last name bin has been making money off job being in politics for legitimately decades at this point since the nineteen seventies for half a century they we making money off job in politics and everyone knows it and meanwhile i am please that the republicans decided that they would not in fact jump on a rake the speaker of the house my johns he did sign off on a temporary spending build to prevent a partial government shut down this weekend now bunch people on the righter very upset with my johns because they believe that every time there is a spending build that the power of the purselize wat the house the house has an obligation not to abuse the power of the purse and that easily that means that any time the republican house has the chance they should use the leverage in or to lower the spending the point that i makings that on principle i agree with that when it comes to the purepolitics of the situationthat the very bat idea those two things can simultaneously coxes n the best of all possible worlds who old run every appropriations bit through the appropriations process in the best of all possible world republican houses would initiate only the kinds is spending that are constitutional which would cut government spending by approximately ninety eight percent with all of that said if the republicans were to jump on the giant rake right in front of them and shut down the government right now so bison is proceeding along the course of election lost that would be political you practice the reality is you can only achieve large scale change in america government when have unified control of the government the days of by partisan cooperation on things budged balancing are well over that is not going to happen any more the clintonia era in which democrats an republicans after the ninety six election came together to do welfare form that is a thing that is not going to happen again which means that republicans i can have to tratsen short term laws for some long term gain if they hope to win back political power my johns knows that is the first stone that might johns actually i think is is using his political common sense here rather than being held captive by the republican police here is my johns yesterday announcing that they were not going to shut down the government eyes look the appropriation appropriations press is is ugly the maxis ugly am this is the want work every year always has except that we have insitutisan o innovations we broke the umlybus every that is how uashington is been run for years we we are we are trying to turn the aircraft currier back to real budgeting it spending reform the is was an important thing to break it up in the smaller piece a gat now the problem for might johns that is in crop up going forward is that the process that he used here he could theoretically also used with regard to any sort of are package for you crier israel and that is what the bine administration immediately is jumping on the the approval in the house for some sort of big aid package on the foreign front is very large would get at least three hundred probably three hundred fifty votes in the house for some sort of aide package at this point and johns has been holding at back presumably because he is afraid that hes can to lose his speakership position yesterday however he did bring forward a proposal that ninety nine republicans voted against most republicans did back the speaker but those also true of kemmacarthy when cevmacarthy was passing bills he is doing it with the majority of of the republicans but he is doing with some democrats as well and that apparently was enough of a in for mandates and others to try to button soothe question is where is that wing of the party now represent of any big who is one of these people voted against the deadline extensions and said that johns has it worked hard enough to cut spending and the he squandered house republicans sole source of leverage by on being unwilling to shut down the government but in reality again at some point the speaker of the house is going to have to actually govern or he is not con be speaker very long he is on be the minority leader very soon in meanwhile jobidon again is operating under the bazar proposition that if he caves to comma somehow this will be better for his presidency it is it is a very weird proposition you not america do not very much when america allies lose they do not when america basically fosters terrorist victory you now we know that c they did not afghanistan join did that an afghanistan and his approvalrating absolutely tanka an is never recovered the media may be disquieted by the ugliness of war but not the america people really really do not when america enemies people wo hate america when america really do not that very much we do not the war in our face is all the time but there something we even less and that is losing wars i understand that this his become the way that the media have basely controlled america form policy for for decades to this point a pretty much every america foreign policy has been in initiation of force or support of force by an ally and then the media immediately attempt tod to do he what war is very ugliest very ugly what here is the problem america enemies know that war is ugly and they know that america care that war is ugly and s they attempt to leverage that that is prison that exactly or compass is doing right now according to the wallstre journal senior members of cosses leadership an exile met in dohocats a earlier this month amid concerns as fighters were getting mauled by the israel offensive in the goes trip enemy troops were killing dozens of militant each day as they methodically over on comas strongholds then a courier arrived with a message from yachyasinoir the had of cmassand gas saying n effect do not worry we have the israilies right were we want them comes fighters the alcosombrigades were doing fine the puppy message said the militant were ready for israel expected assault on raft is city on gasses southern edge high civilian casualties would add to the world wide pressure on israel to stop the war sin wars message said according to people informed about the meeting and this is this is how comas wins the comas wins is not by winning at least twelve thousand members of come as direct militant members of omasa been killed along with a bunch of fellow travellers remember when you read statistics about women and children who are killed in gaze many of the people who are con ordered children under a normal definition of crime beaning under eighteen years old many of those are sixteen year old boys for fellow travellers with comas for example we do not actually have strait statistics from inside the gosastrip because comas that is providing them and commas like all the time if you really believe the compass going around counting bodies and identifying who is died they are making an up on the spot legitimately making it up we know this for a fact which is why it is pathetic that for example the biding administration continues to mimic the propaganda to put out by commas that is what comas wants comas has only one plan to survive this get enough palistnian civilians killed that they can then get the international community of pressure israel to preserving comas that is all they want out of life right now and bizarrely that is exactly what members the bine administration and the europeans are doing the are now suggesting that israel basically ought to leave commas in place because they do not leave comas in place then too many people will die because of comas of kat the is a formula for never winning a war again for any one who is in the less move basically just given them the upper hand the more evil and brutal they are toward their own civilians the more yore going to leave them alone seems to be the prevailing message here meanwhile by the way israel is supposed to ignore the fact that it is own citizens are still been killed an other words when comas and its allies in palsonian authority murder is rallies the world does not care one soda at all yesterday and a story that no one covered to israel citizens were murdered at a gas station in all which is in the west bank a palistonian terrorist open fire at the gustations to be the second time in a year that this gestation has been targeted by terrorists and as it turns out one of the one of the people who committed the attack is a member of the palistonian authority police t palisnian authority those of the people that the bide administration would to run the gasistrip the palistonian authority s the biniminstritions plan and medal east is to hand over power to the palisonian authority which literally pays people who murder us pays their families and preserve comas presume bell in order that jobidon can win michigan or something and and again let us be very clear about this there is no party on the other side of the isle from israel that is willing to make anything a lasting peace it does not exist for example here is a senior palistonian official just this week talking bouthahitler was right this is very typical rhetoric in the palistonian authority is as several european america and arab officials have said innthat in is rally attack against the palistonians in raff ye would constitute a no less or crime than the polices anear bulk we i wild to ask wides in the polices happened man i am not a fan of hitter by haeweecan but when hitter perpetrated the holicostels and movies reasons on y the news and glubbozinas were offered various places in the word an a h beimacan i n the argentina no ganja n the north of sing in the south of arawwecane an the chose palestine for other reasons that we may mention later u no godwanthey plans to take control of germany a is the pain an authority as the news plan to take control of germany killer had to kill them obviously these a the people that that jobidon would to leave in place and give power all f this has been exacerbated by an incident that happened inside the gasistrip another two accounts of this incident one is the account that is being perpetrated by comas and alga'zera which has run by cotarwich of course works very closely with the leadership of cousin and supports comas and the other is the idea one account is it back by zerofootage but a lot of an total accounts and one is back by actual dronefootage the account that is being pushed out there by the palsinan authority by cams by the europeans is an account in which is daily forces open fire on a bunch of people who are trying to get aid humanitarinade that these rallies themselves are carrying in there israel has created a humanitarian corridor aid can get in comose by the way has ben high jacking all of the sate an stealing all of it and then killing people who are tempting to stop them in that effort which his created a massive poverty an hunger situation in the gozestript despite the fact that israel placing literally no limits on food aid going in there is no one to distribute it is the problem because come kills people and then takes the food not only that theisrailies have been putting their own troops in a harm's way in order to try to provide humanitarinate a by way all this and literally day if comasurrenders and gives up the one hundred and thirty four hostages it is currently holding everunjest pretends that that never happened the the comas does not exist any more or something the white counts is still saying they do not know what happened and no one knows what except for the dronefootage and they called at tremendously alarming what happened israel shared drop footage of troops attempts to disperse a swelling mobs and in responsibility for the massdeths amid international criticism of its gaze pensive compass as blamed the idea for reported one hundred four deaths in the early morning hours now we still do not know how many people have actually died at this plowing because come lis about it starts the military's said that fewer than ten of the casualties were result of his daily fire and the released new details thursday night playing soldiers had fired warning shots and attempted to ease the crusher people looting a convoy of aid trucks that entered northern gaze early on thursday morning the violence was quickly condemned by a countries and jobidon held talks on the incident with leaders of egypt and cuter and then both the white house and stake department expressed hour over what occurred and indicated my out demand answers from israel now gan nobody ever demands answers from comas on why they are looting aid trucks and nobody ever demands apparently the commas just surrender they are currently holding negotiations with comas that force the idea to publish a dronvidio showing thousands of people swarming around the aid trucks as they reach the area in northern goa the vehicles tried to push forward very slowly and then apparently what happened is as they tried to back away many going decided that they were going to rush the soldiers and a tank at an if check point tears after they had already rush the last truck in the convoy further south that is when some is daily soldiers open fire on people who are literally rushing a border check point and a tank they did not open fire on the radical see from the drop foot is they're not opening fire on the crowd look at the size of this crowd they hear the aid trucks for those who cannot see he looks world work mean this is just thousands of people for crowding these aid trucks trying get food presumably the israilies of this point if they wanted to master or people seriously cot of there is no fire in see they mean every aid truck is being crowded by thousands of people thousands and then israel is trying to slowly back away behave tanks cay they've again overwhelming fire power most of the people who ware injured and killed were killed in this crush because there is a mob rush on the aid trucks and then apparently they fired some warning shots to tried to disperse the crowd som that the ad trucks could move and then some people rush the frailly soldiers some these artily soldiers further up and some people were killed this of course ended with a bunch of of people in the men and t e european union claiming that the all israel fault which is amazing because it turns out that it is a oases fault again mamas started a war when you rush across another nations borders and killed twelve hundred of its citizens and take two hundred forty hostage that tends to lead to war according to the idea spokes person he said this morning the if coordinated convoy of thirty eight trucks to provide additional humanitarian assistance to the residence of northern gaze the humanitarianaid came from egypt when through a security screening at the carom at swollen humanitarian crossing an israel and then entered goa for distribution by private contractors as these vital humanitarian supplies made their way toward dozens in need thousands of dozens rush the trucks some began violently pushing an trampling other dozens to death looting the humanitarian supplies they are the fact at four forty a m the first ai truck in the humanitarian convoy stare tod making its way through the humanitarian quarter that we were securing our tanks were there to secure the ommandiar a humanitarian corridor for the aid convoy are you a vest were there in the are to give our forces the clear picture for above at four forty five a m a mob ambush the aid trucks bringing the convoy to a halt in this video the tanks that were there to secure the convoy salve the dozens being trampled and cautiously tried to disperse the mob with a few warning shots when the hundreds became thousands in things got out of hand the tank commander decided to retreat to avoid harms the thousands of dozens that were there you can sal cautious they were when they were backing up there is idiot back all this there is drown shift footed vole this they were backing up securely risking their own lives not shooting at them no idea strike was conducted toward the right convoy on the contrary the idea was there carrying out a humanitarian hate operation to secure the humanitarian quarter to allow the eight convey to reach its distribution point the humanitarian aid could reach gown civilians in the north who are in need then of coursouty egypt bored an the allacuse israel of turning civilians in the incident of course and sorted turkey which of coursebooks comose and france which can always be counted on to take the the antistatic position they said the fire by his rally soldiers against civilians trunk to access food is unjustifiable spain also the most antiseptic country in rope they said something similar ye hat of course i stave petrol was the left wing present of colombia announcing that is government was suspending purchases of weapons from israel again is a blood libel the evidence suggested israel do not in fact t open fire into a crowd of civilians if they had would all be on that yuwavfootage which it does not but that does not matter that does not matter and this is why again members the meet are looking for moral equivalents beyond anything else ha really looking for it seen en properly reported for example that this was a chaotic incident which it was and because nobody actually knows what happened yet even seen ends headline here is misleading they say at least one hundred killed an seven hundred injured and chaoticansinat were idea open fire as people waited for food and goa palistinian official say again that that even that headline is misleading but hat was n good enough for john steward whose constantly in search of moral equivalence he said note to mean an a chaotic incident is college had storming abascobulcor not a massacre at a food line again masker f food line assumes facts not an evidence that does not matter that does not matter and ten jobidon of course comes ford and says this incident is en a complicate the negotiations what is complicated the negotiations what is count camps has rejected every sees fire tell presented to it because they insist that israel leave them alone and leave them in power this tottering old fool when his not eating ice cram an talking about seas fires the are unachievable is not being ice crewman talking about seas fires that are unachievable the deadly goat incident complicates hostage negotiations that incident happens because camps is starving the people of gaze they started a war they do not care whether those people livened i in fact that is wrong they want them tod but here is jobidon doing the dirty work i know o no s on a complicated the negotiation an lending moral credibility to commas to derris this not a good look you on a lose elections the really god way to do it he thinksigan a wind five thousand votes in dearborns can lo hundreds of thousands votes across the country they sent his absolute cowardice on issues this one an by the way he is still claiming that he is hopeful about the was fire whishes again first rule of negotiations do not go out and publicly talk about the negotiations you doffs here he was probably not by mondaybot yes hopeful based on what based on what the reality is that because he is talking bout the negotiations publicly he is giving every piece of leverage to commas he is saying i want this i want to sees fires bad i can taste it and comas is watching give us for it what we get for it now the reality is what is actually happening for mamas and yes ballad which are both run by run beth homes and is ball our hoping that israel does not going to raft if israel goes into raft it is going to finish off commas yucca singer will likely to capture or killed when that happens israel presume we will turn north cause ball is threatening that if israel goes into raft at is ball is going to open in northern front jobidon wants to prevent all

is actually in america interest for terrors groups to get their gut stomped out terra groups our a threats to america and its allies you be very much in america interest watch is real just walk right over is ball again no america troops involved no serious america cash committed instead jobidon is trying to to have it both ways he knows inherently that if comas remains in place is going to be bad for i politically but again he is still trying to pretend tat there is moral equivalents as to achieve in all ramp that will amount to many many more people killed over the over the coming years it absolute and he is got his members of administration doing this two laid busting the the garbage secretary of defense he is still sighting comas casualty figures is her secretary about how many pellistinman women children have been killed by israel in october seventh so yours over twenty for for he those are commas casualty figures by the way that the numbers that he is using right there even comasaesn't claim that at least twelve thousand military age mails a been killed it is cowardice does not when you elections and it does not win you wars what it does win you is is a seat in the old age home thinking about you are no longer president after one term as what it actually win to heard just one second we will get to thebaine administration softly backing away from its one environ mentalist ideas first lady callers is the hilarious story of how group of mail losers who cannot win against other men decided to identify as women and when woman's baskobully absurd ridiculous yes except that it is actually happening right now look here is a quick look what is being called the most triggering moody of the decade isrdaninttranobi a on lady callers move es to be far anetlat lis eleven otyemaer streaming exclusively on daily wire plus don't wait each lady balers the move holliwood did not makes we did exclusively at declare plus right now and meanwhile the bindaminstration they know how vulnerable they are and that is why they are having the e p actually delay a k climate rule and then their taking up a reason why they are doing that according to the washington posed the environmental protection agents he plans to delay final limits on planet warming admissions from gas power the gas fired power plans is significantly strengthen them the agent announced on thursday the decision means the rule will not be finalize until after nonmember wise aptly to that cat relate wright the is a big priority for the environmentalists very green bide administration is to get the e p a to basically shut down gas fired power plants now the reason are not doing it is pretty obvious if the energy prices go up jo bison could lose the election s instead the e pas can make up another excuse the move comes in response to please from environmental justice groups which said the rule is not protective enough of disadvantaged communities that breath the unhealthy airfordecades communities of color and loin come neighborhoods are just proportionately located near gas plant smoke stacks and other sources of industrial pollution it also comes bid an tries to sell voters on his climate record during a brushing reelection campaign against at dona trump son made twenty twenty three the e p a issue to proposed rule that call for drastically curbing green house gas missions from existing cold plants existing gas plants and new gas plants the agency said thursday that they are till on tract to finalize the rule for existing coal plants and new gas plants in aril but said the rule for existing gas plants would take longer why there a their pretending that is because they're environmentalists but you may notice something the reason that they are putting a bunch of pressure on existing cold plants is because most energy is not coming from existing cold plants and the reason they can put pressure on new gas plants is because that is not can manifest until after the election anyway what is the one area of the law where the e p is avoiding issuing a ruling on the stuff for you mostly get your energy which is the existing gas plants and the the pretending is for environmentalist reasons that is a we they know that they are environmentalist nonsense is really really on popular with america america to pay verbal image to the idea that they care deeply about the climate when it comes time to actually pay up in any serious way america are not into it especially because they know the whatever marginal sacrifice at they make is going to be offset by whatever increased emissions china in india then provide to the world and it turns out that the climate is global and they no matter how much you cut your missions of china and india are making up more than that amount all your doing is destroying your own economies of china and economy can grow theirs hoiden knows that and his people are smart enough to tell him do you really really cannot have a massive inflationary spiral on energy prices going into and election cycle cam meanwhile vladmrapoutent sensing mush in the bide administration is now raise the sector of newsletter conflict if

the way very often that territorially aggressive dictators then pave the way for invasion of surrounding states glamerputen is not hitter for variety of reasons but territory aggressive dictators they youtypically do this is you find a region of a foreign country that has a lot of speakers of your language and the you have them appeal to you for production and then you walk across the word to protect them according to signed poor russia rebels and a separate to sliver of moldova have now ask paten to protect their region from what they claim are threats from moldova at government trains nose treat which a legally split from moldova as the soviet union crumbled has remained within the krumlantorbit while moldova is bidding to join the e again they are looking for protection because

compatriots were a priority again if you are looking at the region of transnistria transnistria is bordering you moldova borders you crane its between romania and urine transnistria is an in recognized breakaway region can we along the borders of moldova and ukraine would be strategically useful for the ruffians to hold it for shore if they were able to somehow jut or round from trivia up

that said do the ruffians want war moldova is in a lot closer to the rest of rope then the eastern regions of ukraine according to signed no country officially recognizes transnistria russia has about fifteen hundred troops there right now again are the are they willing to up the anti right now will russia warn you cranes had a profound effect on transistor as economy you crane closed its border

as the twenty twenty four election gets closer hoiden is becoming more and more desperate and he should be the world is an uglier and uglier place under president bison nearly no one believes that the country is moving in the right direction and hoiden is clearly an ailing a man he is not with it everyone knows it that apparently includes forming president barokobama according to the washington post over the week and quote for a present barokobama his raised questions about the structure of president bison's re election campaign discussing the matter directly with bison and telling the president's aids an allies the campaign needs to be impower to make decisions without clearing them with the white house according to three people familiar with the conversations in other words borokabama is telling hoiden to outpost his campaign to people what not hoiden now apparently mama grew animated in discussing the election he recommended avid proof who mama's own two thousand eight campaign manager to head a join the elect effort other democrats are also deeply worked about bid's re elect chances according too the post quote representative crisis lot can a michigan who running for her states open sentence has expressed concerned to allies she might not be able to win if bids at the top of the ticket according to people familiar with those conversations and according to acids quote many high level democrats think things are not fine they fear the president's political machine has not found the sweetshop between a chills en and dangerous complacency and has been wait to en bid's allies our world that his base will not soup that includes him cliburn your member him caliber the congressmen from south caroling whose in dwarsemen of jobidon over burning standers basically turn the primary elections in twenty twenty toward mobile here is cliburn saying the he is worried that voter turn out is just not going to happen for jobidon how worried are you about black voter showing up for president bidding nonmember on that word a very concerned at tat tat ties a tat ha in no at notes report ago see is one report indicate the tat that i sat tan not it at it him a that to him bat a ens a i hat not problem it bat invitation and what it is done tat probe is o we a that in able to break through at that thgowal in the yet to people exactly wit is ps it has done guys do not worry he is not worried he is just a deeply deeply concerned and again he should be deeply deeply concerned because tweeting twenty was an outlier election in terms of voter turn out as we discussed last week the percentage for eligible voters who showed up to vote in twenty twenty or vote by mail was sixty seven per cent that is sixth seven per cent rich points higher then in most prier elections is real statistical outlier do you think that joins can to get that can tot turn out in twenty twenty four the answer is not based on his performance this means the widen is already turning to his very last messaging refuge it of donate trump last week on fridge he of a speech in valley forge thous a weird place to effectively launch your reelection campaign because when you think a valley forge you are immediately thinking of negativity my valleyforgeis not a happy place you are thinking nation under attack trying to live through its stark is moments just about in the shuttle of defeat it is non about hope or about changed about soldiering through the winter it about gorge washington and a bunch of starving men at a fort it about gangrene and frostbite now when i thing about ta that is of ion think reelect success if you are the president and you are running based on your record and your running based on what a high achievement you are first ad ministration

first month of coverage's robin chose up in valleyforge to give this speech and the entire theme of the speech is going to be how he is gorge washington and i turn out the dona trump is killer this the entire time of the speech in is can with t theme of the campaigns o you think that is went twenty was a rough campaign wait in til twenty twenty for and we are in it it has begun his the first time by the way that jobiton has really launched against trump in the campaign he is really been attacking con ka man or republicans in the impression that perhaps company wo is not on trumplasgon to win the nomination i think biding his hardy figuring i have to de find my opponent trump is likely to be the opponent he launched a full skills frontal assault on donate trump at leas best he can now the objects he picks for the speeches are always a little but strange the objects he picked for his last democracy is in danger speech which was as i recall before the twenty twenty two election that one was in philadelphia he is flanked by marines in the background and a blood red intepennance hall and that is where he declared that thirds a battle for the soul of the nation well this time he decided to do a general paten he is standing in fronton a giant america fly a and again all of this is just a little much it is a little much not the america play man place grate but flanking yourself the america play wall you declare that the people who are running against our threats to the actual democracy it is a little bit much it is a little much and this entire speech was bison going full hitter as bison saying that donate trump was a full sale mothy and those who had vote for him presumably oar little brownshirts that was the message of the speech he did not really to ferenshate between donate trump and his followers he did not really to frendshape between drums followers and the republicans he did not to reshape between trump voters who do not januorsix and trumphotors who do januorsix everybody who hold vote for trump is apparently in that particular camp and that is a very dangerous play it is the same sort play that killer canton tried in twenty sixteen when she suggested that donate trump again was the leader of the deplorable and turns out the known voted for hillaryclinton people just did not show up and she lost the election well what happens this time when you have an ailing elderly fragile old man who has tyrannically used the power of the executive in over to overthrow generations of president with regard to what the president cannon cannot do standing up there and declaring that his political enemies are actually enemies of the republic itself again that is why he is a bally for he wants the dark he wants the cold he wants you to feel that but he wants you to feel that not about his administration but about donate trump i think that this man shot i really do bankchotston ton to workman politics for those were not familiar with baskaboult terminology a buckshot is when you used the backboard in or to make a basket another words it requires a rickashiy jo bison attacking donate trump as a candidate with reference to canary sixth particularly as opposed to what donna trump will do as president or what donate trumps o agenda is as president it it is not con a play because again he wait on the calender as of to day is canary eighth of two thousand and twenty four we are now three full years remove from canary six and in that intervening time donate trump has not in the president of the united states for all the talk about ho horrible juniors six was at i think januorsex actually was quite horrible for all the talk about canary six was horrible i did not actually stop the peaceful transition of power in the united states it did not dona trump left office on an fulguration day and drobiden became president and since then there's been three intervening years since then there been three intervening years of this man being president and he's wan talk about any of that any of it he just wants to talk about how donate trump is a threat to the republic and again this would go over a lot better if this guy himself were not a threat to the republic as well discuss hurt here is jobidon launching into his that this really was the launch of his campaign this is the first piece of his campaign relaunch very regarded year true two hundred forty secure later just one day before jaguar e six a day freer surd a maker beast was on that day we nearly lost the men lost at all get no one who has a brain believes thus no one believes the canary sits we nearly lost america it was a riot that went out of control and then was cleared up within three hours and then the vote was certified by republicans and then mobile make him president of the united states does any one believe the a bunch of goats and some people who just did not now the how they were doing walking through the capitalbilding was a threat to the very fabric of the most powerful republic in the history of the world fall the people were saying the it was a you typically a coo requires you to activate the military and to use that military power in order to take control of the levers of power did any of that happen in the actual building itself what was the crowd generally armed with weaponry i sons him knives on be they find lots of guns ism beluga's rocket lynchers what yet you you can point out the canary six was ugly and terrible and was predicated on a lie which the device president of the united states had the powers unilaterally overthrow the sort of find election results from states that was not true it is a bad legal theory and dona trumps should never have been pushing that grab es that the same thing as we almost lost it all that day but the pilot here is the thing the reason that biding has to say that is because implication is that if donate trump wins the next selection you will never vote again do you think that is true i do not think that is true i only was true that if donate trump wins the next election you will never vote again i only in fact i know that is not true i know for a fact that is not true that's not a reality he hast it the the worse is president's he looks the worse he has to paint trump at a fastest the fact that he is going in canary twenty twenty four lice eleven months before the election the fact that he is already going trump is a noisy where d yo weuveveen go from there how do you build the campaign beyond that what is worse than noisy by trumpets going to be full statant he cannot say that because to any democrats sate but wet i where is gun a go from there won't been understand he start this is starting point he say here he goes he is continuing but the democrisi still america sewer cars it is the most urgent question of our time that is what is the twenty twenty for election is all about voice is clear o top campaign is about hand not america not you o cops campaigns obsess with the past not the future he is only to sacrifice i about put himself an power or campaign is different from me come our captains about america about you it is about every a in back on to cut my this country no one believes thus an can particularly because the line that he set hes spouts there which he she says dona trump's campaign is obsessed with a pass not the future he is literally doing in entire speechobout generosity the entire speech is about jane six now again i may not be amazing with math but i know how calender's work and i know the canary six twenty twenty one is in the past and i noticed that you are at valley forge and you are sighting a past that this is not fact the entire stick of the campaign you being out there saying that dona trump is all about the pass and work about the future as obviously no truealso when he says things are sacred democracies at rest again i would take that a little more seriously if i did not believe that you were willing to over throw petty much every vestige of democracy in pursuit a political power you attempted to use the occupational safety and hazard administration in order to foist lateens on eighty million people and we had to so you to stop it you unilaterally declared the you could get rid of student lonedat after acknowledging you on of the power to do that you what what power has has this person not tried to irrigate to himself view the executive is anyone truly believe that jobidon and coming haeres our deep down devoted quote quit public servants none believes that gan this is go of better if mobile or not provide ma jobidon is jobidon making the claim the dona true is self centered is truly am every one knows that but how is that any different from jobidon and coming derris the last time we had a true public servant as they as a president of the united states ism not yours happen in my lifetime well get to more from jobidons campaign launch speechify what it means for his campaign and all the respect again situation the unitedstates is very rim ring how things do not look good they woke valley forge when you've the president campaigning valley forge its i can

slash ben o gay more from jobidons speech on fridges de clearing that he was the man standing in the doorway preventing donate true from destroying democracy here we go for the first time o a is isurrectoso costar e pecaltanortansrparin me first time spay editor shattering doors a tacking the police a gain all of these charges would carry a lower weight if commit her to rice president had tried to bail rioters out of prison during twenty twenty tried bail them out of jail in twenty twenty and gan any one who thinks that t canary sixth events were even remotely on par with prior insurrections in the united states lake take the civil war is out of their mind that is a crazy talk no one takes the canary sixth talk that seriously other than democrats who is he speaking to core the moderates out their warlike inflation is up twenty per cent the red sea is being overrun by who've pirates the president might fall down at any moment he secretary defense literally got lost over the weekend will talk aby that a a while but i do remember on canary sixth was bad i understand the democrats hon to make this thing a national holiday and that every yearoeging commemorate canary sixth as though it is representative the great breach in america society but it really really is not it really is not i think this mouth works when jobidon is not on the ballad but when jobidon is on the ballet hins can of a tough sell then joint started talking about how he won the last selection which of course is true what is weird though is that when he talked about that he did not talk about winning the electoral college which is actually how you win elections that was the entire debate of the canary sixth rioters in in compatriots the were a time at the electoral college states certifications an all the rest unsaid he sided the popular vote which against a weird thing until were we do not decide presidential sections in this country base on the popular about a record eighty million people vote my cans thandistes top lost the popular vote by seven million get then he suggests the dona trump if he were to lose or if he were to come president again and had the power he would invoke the insurrection act to gong recall of his enemies now get that that is not when down true talked about invoking the insurrection act who talk abut to stop actual honest god riots in the streets in two thousand twenty here is jobidon just let i guess the dealers that if dona true becomes president then hoiden will went up in jail because trumpinvokes the insurrection acted to overthrow state governments ore something what is he talking about former a tromplansinvo the insurrectinsac insurrection u to allow him to deplore not low to do nor allow him to deploy yes military forces on the streets theme si cause this to for oppose vermin talks tabour the blood of e mar is be poison at going the same exact language yous notsigermity gas o again trump is a not hes a noting a now most of us look a trump and we say that kiss clownish things on on the regular he does he says very silly things all the time in the same speech which you will talk about poisoning the blood of the country will talk about how magnets do not work in water that is about how seriously most people take donate trumps actual verbiage but we are supposed to believe that dona trump who is buffoonish when he speaks very often is somehow the same person who is going to in vote insurrection act in send federal troops into your home to arrest if you oppose him or something and he says this fight the opponents of the republic our parents of democracy he said at a at a rally flanked by a giant backdrop of an america flag as he tables his political opponents enemies of the republic and then of course he lumps in our re publicans ad this is this is his mahlstick his mahlstick is that he is going to lumping pretty much everybody that is clip eight is true the push told america story's not a fry e every tried fora amebic is neverrosispa amen times those o fer progresstoseloit tat fer for the no personal gan from those who trafficked lives to for power and profit for those whore dinner by grievers and grief costume by consperisi victim o this set very history a van books and can all this is just such a projection and when he says things the people who fear progress meaning if you do not agree with him those are people who exploit fear for personal gave he is literally standing there telling if you do not vote for him the republic is over he is exploiting fear for personal gave he says from those who traffic an lies told for power and profit he literally lies about the history of the united states suggesting that because america has terrible racial history that means that all in quality to day is a form of an equity he says the people whore driven by grievance and grift and consume by conspiracy an victim hut are on the other side he is entire coalition is a coalition of the supposed victims from those seek to bury history and band bookstore literally pulling down statues it is it is truly amazing thing this pitch is not going to work if this is bison's final pitch i just do not see how this cannot in the same way that it did even say in twenty twenty two when jobidon was not actually on the ballet a this a trump was not on the ballet but neither was bison when bison is on the ballet is that what you are thinking about hell get you job bison in just at one second his actual look what is actually happening to him the is par the probe is the person presenting

that if you ere a ringing image of small you republicanism some ye believes in democracy he would not look a seen decrepit messenger of a failing ad ministration but that is what he looks jobidon concluded his speech and one big proms hid ben having on this campaign and that is presidency is that jobidon literally does not nowhere to go when the speech is end his not know what to do here isn't know where to go he gets easily confused am tar if this is hurting feelings but it happens to be the obvious case to any one who has e functioning prefrontal quarttexan retinas every time tobiten finishes a speech she starts wandering off into all it is bazar i than gills is line which that he turns into a rumba at the end of speeches it is totally true so what they do now ism not getting i bison check she sprinted up on stage she sprints upon stage to go grab him by the hand and need him off the stage here she us she sprints this thing ends she is on stage of a shot here e go u g am and he is trying to make a joke about his wife but he see nil it does not come off and hes trying say t she is the real power she sprints up on state of rooms wise jill up there she is in the chalone second go and here is the reason fellows up there i the just to lead him back he can barely walk he is still confused when you the very an he is looking round the wreak were gong well the be to am s it is sad ism laughing but but it is sad it actually is sad that the president of the united states is obviously ailing he is obviously ailing and by the way when we talk about threats to democracy here is a kind of a that's democracy what happens when you try to disqualify your political opponent from the ballet what happens when you sick cur to ja on your political opponent filing no less then for different cases in various jurisdictions some state some federal what whale exactly what amounts to an assault on the republic right now scheme is a polling staff for you ready eighty one percent of democrats believe that stay should disqualify former president trump from presidential ballots according to a new sexiest news you of pole eighty one present four in five democrats believe that donate trump should just be thrown off ballots thrown off the ballots he is never been criminally convicted of anything he's anything charge with insurrection by the way and all the various cases where his being charge is not been charge for insurrection which would be the thing that would theoretically in woke section three of the fourteenth amendment but any one present democrats want him summarily kicked off the ballot now poll republicans on whether they think that jo bison should be actually barred from the ballot i guarantee it an any one per sent youron't talk about insurrection's legal theories basically the case against trump when it comes to canary sixth is twofold an you will here both cases made by democrats would the merge them one is the canary sixth was in fact the actual insurrection was a full scale coo attempt by donate trump with is weird and house the president of the united state and has the power of the executive to order around the military which he did not actually use there is that but the claim is that he incited in the insurrection the standard for incitement is much stronger then you need to go peacefully protest at the capital building that is not incitement of an insurrection too it was not in actual insurrection is a much a morons who decide there can a break into the capital building while screaming and shouting one rest a weird barbarian wearing buffalo horns and then a munch people who were just get to following along cause the police officers were standing right there in their walking between the rope lines again the not tho minimize the violence done the police officers outside the building those people we are arrested but case number one that they make is that trump was responsible for the events of canary sit that said trump raised the temperature that is not the same thing as being responsible four the actual breaking into the capital building two is the idea that from nonmember fourth two canary sixth dona trump put forward a bunch of specious legal theories they were untrue bat election fraud about certification of state election results about what the vice president could do in the face of all that and the idea is that that is insurrection the specious legal theories put forward into law is an attempted insurrection and this the other case the bulk your democrats make what o you call it when you activate state players in various states to literally removed your political opponent from the ballot without a criminal conviction or in investigation of any sort what a deftly would you call that because of a is insurrectionist activity then be clearly qualifies s insurrectionist activity which is it youron't told lout threats democracy it seems to me barring your political opponent the presumed hominy of the opposing opposing party from the ballot that seems all little insurrection that seems a little non democratic and yet this is what democrats keep saying by the way went when jo biding says things donate trump is a threat to the republic and that canary six was infant an insurrection he is agreeing with that legal theory when he suggest canary six was an insurrection and the dona trump is responsible for canary sixth he is agreeing with the legal theory that says dona trump need to be barred from the ballot under the section three of the fourteenth amendment what here is washington he see's mar burial bawler who cannot stop crime but certainly wants to stop from from being onballd talking about trumping body from ballet do you think he should be barred for any ballast given his actions on anyway a i support that every state taking variagrassive action on tit to keep him off the ballet i he is under gowan a in a court action across america that is amazing stuff meanwhile the colorado secretary state his responsible for boring from from the ballet there pending supreme corlitgation this ta metisenfranchising anyone by barring the leading presidential candidate for the opposing party from the ballet do you think t it there is a risk here of wisent franchising voters i think the be is is o is infranchisein voters happen on canary six when donate from try to tell the presidency from the america people make no mistake that is exactly what he intended to her i we are a country of as in our constitutions there are qualifications for office is ta for example if a to waters woe to on for opals ordinate it would not be able to do we because he is dis qualified from dining for president under the united state constitution the dosh is not risen franchising anyone he is actually dis qualified little man's i democratic you it say not allowing killed the vote for your political opponent that is exactly out from is responding to all this he says you are calling editor that is rather insulting since i left power we got to beat this i this fool this fool the i strong a dona top is dictator can you ma tool trumpeter come dictator all i want to do s have a great country i want to have great i do not want to be ripped off with tratdeals i do not want these country was a ripping us and boy we had it stopped we did you as him we a we did the greatest radials ever but all i want to dos have a great country low taxes we did the best textual ever bigger than the ragantaxteo we just what i have a great country says i ma dictator insulting actuallates insulting but he is a a threat because he is a threat or the to he does even note the word me she is a threat to democracy and then he says something that is true he says you can also be a threat democracy by being grossly in competent which is what gabion actually is from it is not wrong about this and here is the problem for jobiton if things are going well mobile would not have to resort to this sort of attack but he has to now and it's because he is grossly incompetent dis my goes around and says i ma threat to democracy my know he a threat as he is in competent he is a threat to democracy you can be grossly incompetent and be a threat to democracy cause he is lotus in to wars were in warstow you look at the middleleas look at what happened in you can that would have never happened these things would have never happened in flat i would have never happened t attack on israel would'tnever happened the attack on new crane would never all these things would never have happened get that is going o be trump trunks argument true strung target is joins bat president and bison's parent trunks argument is trumpet hitter now the senior gong to trying t run this one up the

number is relegated to very very blue cities i know i we to live in one and some people there actually believe that while they were sitting outside in the sunlight insanthemonicas drinking their sparkling wine well trump was president i its just it is it is an absurd contentment if the battle is between the accurate definition of your opponent donate trumps definition of jobidon as in competent bates his job bora line see nice and jobidon's perspertrail of dona trump as a fool scale filarian threat to the republic a noisy only one of those is connaccurat in just a second ring the

the do d sent of a word on canary fourth the officinal said it was highly unlikely auction ad conveyed for debidon before jam solve was briefed on it if take did not know noway the president knew said one of them would've told him of auntie's condition of hotcake if some one did tell the preside and take would ben his first call bight n held a cordial conversation with listen on sturdy night for one of the of officials the present has complete trusting confidence in secretary busting the official said but as the news of auntie's situation came as a shock to all white house staff they were unaware the pentagon bast was dealing with complications following an elective medical process national security staffers were surprised to the pentagon longboat them know of satin status the pentagon did not make that in formation public until fridge evening they notified congrasabout fifteen minutes before they released a public statement busting had quote i could have done a better job in during the public was appropriately informed i commit to doing better but this important to say this was my medical procedure i take full responsibility for my decisions about disclosure a then you need to resign probably because that is crazy apparently he was in the ice to you for four days for four days on fridge evening as many people were turning toward this week and do spokes person major general pat rider announced busting had been hospitalized since canary first his deputy called he's partially assumed some of his duties during that time but there is one problem seamen is now reporting that actually she had no idea where he was from canary first which again was a money until fhursday she did not know where he was there was no one at the top of the pentagon any time of conflict and your secret people our suing the secretary defenethat his death's doing job no he isn't icy you the number thous not been infirmities in the i you she is probably not even receiving up dates he should be receiving this is crazy that is totally wild why exactly with this happen apparently those because listen is supposedly two macho to let anybody know that he went in for an elective procedure and ended up in the ice to you but that's a terrible reason when you still left to let people know when you are missing producers act not in to day he told us and the he did not come in that is hot works when you are sick when you go to the i see you i for four days and you are these secretary of defense you don't to let your number to know what in the actual what the what what that is crazy sire that is totally insane apparently these number to where bushy shows on vacation in porter redo at the time and show not in formed of buster's hospitalization till the afternoon of canary forth at that point his began to make con tensions he plans return to washington easy on fridge but because fasten was expected tore turn tho his full duties it'll be it from the hospital beside stand portico to enshurect continuity of communications there all these people around the secretary t all times to manage men help motivated debases no one even told the white hose had one pence on officials ism surprise that no one is using the word cover up yet i mean is obviously a cover up what the how how that is crazy according to politico some one's head has to all but is on be listens ism sure to be some low level age who is told you need to tell my number too and then the number two never got told to low leverage ends up without a job excepts the lay usually works in washington to see the higher up shuttles all the responsibility down to somebody lower down that print gets fired anna and that's the end of the story the white have some pension insist buster's job is not in jeopardy but they are sticking that line despite not even knowing what is action ben going on at the pentagon the precise nature of listen urge tore medical complications even is current con edition remain unclear seeker defense department white house official still do not even know the details of the procedure totally insane totally totally crazy he no one's in charge the present is non charge he secco defense non charge number two at thedefense department bet we know the secretary defenses no in charge things are going amazing meanwhile over on the border we now have some new starts according two data released by the biding administration the department of homeless security they say that two point three million not migrants havebeen allowed into the southernborder coring to reaches now i do not know that number is real that number seems low to me it does the reason that seems now gloomy is because at least six million border apprehensions have taken place since jobidon took office to put that by way of perspective during the entire for years one donna trumps administration there one point six million border apprehensions by the want apprehension is not mean that the person is then turned away and sent back home where they came from a border apprehension means they pick you up they take you to it attention facility if you claim asylum then they release youintof the country within seventy two hours of the date to come back first some sort of court date that is literally means the period of time between when you arrive in the country dare picked up by border patrol and when your released ins the interior of the united states is usually within a week will always within a week and usually within seventy two hours when they say two only two point three million people of enter of the country i have serious doubts that that number is accurate i think that number is a way higher that also does not include the estimated one million roadways people who just when into the country smuggle drugs into the country or entered but tween ports of caul and and were not picked up by border patrol and apparently known roadways only re per cent may b in they really do not know s they don't know me in known roadways they estimated the c b p that is sixty per cent of all roadways are known which means your talking about another eight hundred thousand unknown roadways theoretically so me got nearly two million people we have got into the country as it roadways any talking about according to d h s two point three millions that is four point one million a lot of people and by thewy the numbers are way hired that there is no ways only two point three million people a d chi spokes woman said sturdy the agency continue support significant numbers if on authorized microns including family but is that reality i really really doubt it again all you have to do is look at the charts the charts are insane in remember of twenty twenty which is the last month of donate trump full month of donaldtrum's presidency your talkingabout approximately eighty thousand seventy five thousand border apprehensions life by march of twenty twenty one when everybody now realizes your widens in office you're looking at north of one hundred seventy five thousand boarder apprehensions more than double and then in remember this last remember three hundred thousand apparently these are insane numbers obviously and it is a real border crisis it is not just that is crisis the borders that everybody knows to crisis at the border according to a brand c is news you got poll forty five per cent of america say whats happening the border is a crisis thirty per cent soy was happening the border is very serious eighteen per cent say that it is somewhat serious you are now up to by those numbers ninety three per cent of america say that is at least somewhat serious seventy five per cent say a crisis or very serious by the way to crisis only seven per cent say not much of a problem ay that is i that is in astonishing number according that say pole immigrants in your local area have been forty per cent increasing thirty five per cent having noticed twenty five per cent decreasing as far as whether people believe that the widen administration should be tougher should be easier or is handlingthings right fit five per cent said should be tough fer in submember it is now sixty three per cent two thirds w america believe the cordon should be tougher on the border only sixteen per cent say that hoiden should be easier and the twenty one presented say the handling things right obviously does understand wat the he's going on the border by thewy what is actual going on the borer is two things one dow drums for main a medical policy was ended when people come to the border an the claim asylum by america lather ow put into the system he use to be don true had negotiated to deal withe pelicans to keep people who applied for asylum in mexico awaiting their border hearing this cut down on ai legal immigration by a huge margin beaus a old those people get turned down and if he ready a mexico they have no enter to the country day one jobidon ended that police instead people come they immediately say i fear for my life my home country the united states states them in process them and releases them into he general interior of the united states that is was you have to do just say i fear to go back to my home country under america current asylum rules number two because the united states refuses to detain full families together under the flora settlement and because the united states re fuses do you re main a mexico all yet to do shop with kid andbasically raging to be released into the interior of the united states jobidon ended every policy that would have prevented mass illegal immigration by the we the car tells know this the cartels and been redirecting america resources toward this wave of legal migrants that is e why they are doing it and then meanwhile while the board patrol is acting as a bussing and frying service for legal emigrants all of the roadways that were talkingabout drugs smugglers criminals those people are just t entering between these points us rushing into the interior of the united states and boarder patrol is not there it is not that we require more border patrol agents its that the board patrol agents we do have our basically acting as d m b agents at this point and members of the local metropolitan bussing l authority as oppose to you know actual boarder patrol agents here is them images a bum a breach in the boarderwall and arizona the by e way the the way the you reach the borderwall is om if they are no word patrol agents around they are no board patrol agents around he just cut a hole in the wall which is what there doing fearsome that the legal emigrant trimming through that borderwall this would be on thursday it e people just walking right on through here we go in the united states by the we even if they are caught at this point border patrol then ask them what a you doing here and they say i feared you go home to my country and then what happens there process to released into the interior of the united states that is the way the this works mike johns these speaker of the house he says yo of course this is a border crisis that is why we are trying to focus in on it what happens miss speaker an no no money for you can no money her israel no money for tie on and then no fix for the border a ma hates is camisole what do you thinking well well we are thinking that the white house has the come tit sens as they are getting pressure fro even never cats o course the the mayor of these fix sectary sits and blue states there crying out for help they no that a shouts as tan ago the than in all the re sours as there we have a tecollics on the other side the ow who understand n that this is arise us that must be resolves am often less take and hopeful that they will listen of the america people and make then u say changes and policy tho get this that i hope the set it white take up our let us nation car to and to the right thing the come sens thing that fix the problem amazingly enough the leader of the sane opposition on this point is john fetterman i don't haven't john fetterman his certain into christens intima it is amazing here is john fetterman over the began talking by the borograzes anal allies admit there ta close at the border and the i do not know how anybody could pretend let there isn't correct everyone knows this everyone knows this but democrats are sighed into the idea there must be mass migration mass illegal migration that they are refusing border funding if it even means changing the asylum rules that is what crazy the single thing that is the biggest magnet driving people north of the border is this idiotic rule that if you claim asylum with no evidence whatsoever that you are being oppress in your home country other than your home country is can so you are immediately admitted republicans ha been saying locate why do not we do a fou things why don't we number ones who remain a mexico number too if you claim asylum we have to establish at your initial hearing before release you into the united states thou are likely to prevail in that claim for asylum you cannot you say the magic words and then arcade bra all f the door s open democrat suppose this alehuns or mayor's the dacha secretary he says that they would not even accept more fun if those fun were used for do hortation when you say that republicans will not except the extrafunding they have a problem with the funds being used to release an transport illegal migrants around the country congress is listening right now which you except the extra funding on the condition that the funds could only be used for detention and renew removal but not release into the country a erect the funds are needed to provide the department of homely security with more bored patrol agents the funds are needed to provide the department of homely security with more technology the funds are needed to provide our department with more detention space to provide the department of justice with more immigration judges what he wants is more money to broad in the picket along more legal ligans into the country why well because to we she says the apart a la was there two ways of shutting don in legal migration whole s you close the border the other s you prevent anyone from saying ten yupalon to legal out say the fauve are legal now you an't you tended legal migration by this token by the wagon and all murder in the united states by legalizing murder it watch fabricate bra murder is now legal i guess that no illegal murder is taking places on murder is legal that is baselgood as he is suggesting here just with regard to emigration here she does from all parts from the political spacktrown whine of the pigetations that will have when it comes to migration is the fact that we have an undocumented population tat you can fix that by trinal build a law or you can fix fat by trinal document people and create a pactositisenshep i failook at the pistons keno that our shelter system have wait an things that but one of the reason that our public system experience way ifs because people do not have a documented and reliable path to work and fifteen an folks just all of our ancestors did and our and our granparin yet the difference is that when our great grandparents came to the united states there was not a giant welfare system that was in plays for public support of people who came he without any job prospects whatsoever also because of that people were force ta simulate much more quickly when my great grandparents came to the united states in the early twentieth century they will spoke girlish none of their kids did why because the markets did not bear people speaking girlish particularly learning english was a major major aspect of this it turns out the markets are great way to make people assimilate to america values because if yo would to live in a market base economy you've have to peter to the customer bowel get rid then entire system and then you declared there should be open emigration of course what you went up with is a multiple cultural too in which nobody actually assimilates but you didn't quite part i lad which the democrats you want in open boarder s again we are talking about open border not a great economy and say d i all over the administration verses donate trump is a fash just which one of those you thinks is more damaging politically when it comes to d i this administration as declared itself in favor of equity at every step of the america experiments this administration is says that in fact equity motivates all of their policy apparently including migration policy which is why we are just can open the board wide well i have to say one the great exchanges have seen recently on television happened over the we can than salon is a an author and right rights over the manhattan institute use on john gilbert and on the other side of this debate were a couple of wild leftest including cariswisher andthe're talking about d i an than who is not a white america is in fact my norite america you would be jumped into the people of color category he just goes off right herein pretty spectacular when a person of color fails all of us ante an incitement of an entire system that the right does this a ridiculous she was a graduate of exited and standard with a party from hazard an w alteration a ceterationation america who came from a family that dominated the concrete in do surety she was not the wretched of the earth you a shine whoso an goddaughter barely and i option rat war a lo go absolutely not but she was selected because she a established the oaths of diversity equity inclusion an belonging to hazard she provided over a steep decline in the free fetch for i lean she alsoargit by norite profectlolo to sanctity from per perspective that la a problem she martin with ideas not fly hog ever i ha are they he is exactly right about all of that but again diversity equip inclusion stick that is the biding stick again you have lined up on the one side don drums the fasts not or in joined worth who o give to and on the other side you have jobidon is doing equity hesillelimigration and by the way he is doing complete supplied chain failure the soothe attacks on shipping continue across the world the cost of shipping has markedly increased you wife that is a chart from axis and what it shows is the average shipping contanerates for particular roots and what you see is they have jumped spiked dramatically toward the end of remember why because that is exactly when ye start seeing toothy attacking shipping in the red sea and the baby bandit straight in facts what you see is that the cost of shipping from the aria media terrane from as to the mediterranean areas jumped wildly from a little bit over twenty three hundred dollars a container to fifty one hundred dollars the this doubled when you look at shipping from as to the north america east coast it the stuff the we care about ye cost of shipping went from what loos about twenty three hundred and twenty five hundred dollars to thirty nine hundred dollars that asthma massif that is our container who bears that cost you bear that cost we all bear that cost because jobidon is allowing the soothes to basically gum up the works in the red see and in the babelmandeb straight why because democrats keep hoping that well if we are set and if we are nice than things are not in askclate me further when it is precisely the opposite tack that actually gats thing is to calm in the mildest when you not calm things in the mildest it you do you make clear that if you screw it the united states things go real bad for you that is the actual way you calm things in the mdeleast it is why every one in the last was afrit to start up while dona trump was president because they thought that guys nuts that guide rase you might just fire missile at my house i do not know but with jobidens i od or no should we touch the whothese she not that maybe should remove an aircraft carrier from the media why do mouthing the thing's lasting as long as it is with re got to his block has booze keep firing antitank missiles into northern israel why dyuthink there doing that if the united states had listen when his missiles goes aright and hits an america and you will not exist to morrow morning which is true that is actually the reality by the way that is what would happen if the united states said that if the united states said if you rads your rate of fire above ex and you just one exist tomorowmorning you know it would stop tomorrow morning that but jobidon is too cowardly to do any of this instead you have gene for grand home who is out there declaring that they kind of hope that things are going to calm down they are not sure exactly if there going to calm down nocking this secretary of energy togging about how shipping ill public get after even though mark is now saying that there can completely avoid the red sea which of course creates is obliging bottle back what will it take to actually insure that shipshape can go through that area o obviously yet there has to be this coalition effort i know that many commercial a a ship shippers are really not just there doing what mess has decided to do which is to a circumvent the red sea and the miss canal and that may add some price to to energy in terms of how long it takes and how much more full it takes to get the shipment surround but this coalition and the active not just monitoring but a but in certain of both a sanctions as well as a lots of discussions behind the scenes i think we are gin by hopefully if it does not escalate further will be o k hopefully if it does not escalade further use responsibilities ma sure does not escape further might be your ad ministration's responsibility and here and lies the problem they do not want the responsibility that just wen y all about down from i

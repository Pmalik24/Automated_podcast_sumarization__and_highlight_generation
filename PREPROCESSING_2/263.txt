graham grew up in a working class town north of inland and the he was eleven or twelve his family moved into on the first houses in new development that was being built it was kind of hitting the jackpot for him at that age is all around everywhere were homes under construction which i remember this from construction sites in our eghbourhood when i was a kid was incredibly fond this became my new playground is graham i we in a climb on the scaffolding to bit of can amateur gymnastics but also build stiff and the big thing amongst us kids was lighting fires and the was talk paper was one thing that bunt very nicely his of you of kinds of troubled getting to bricks i boards to play with and wat conure to it in they bent rough the workers left cigarettes which they would smoke once spent worn magazine and when day graham was there alone and he had this great i dead h put together a little makeshifts he saw or as he calls a her tater t a plank of wood balanced on a brick at the center e but another brick on one end of the plank his idea was to drop something really heavy really really heavy under the other end of the plank from a great height to find out just how far he could send that brick catapulting into space it accomplished this he said up his teeter titer by some scaffolding i climbed up on the scaffolding and i carried up this can massive piece of curbing stone i guessing around twenty five pounds we you are how high up probably at the but a second floor window level and bout fifteen feet twelve feet he care which is to line up the stone directly above the near end of this he saw below down on the ground and then he dropped the stone it it landed perfectly i really had lying this up pretty well and the brick launched and the following few moments i probably the most vivid memory i have of my childhood i was of to see watching to see what the brick would do because that was the experiment really to to but a full ow that in its in its journey but the brick it did not move at all look he thought he thought it was going to ark in to the air a rocket instead it dis eyed to be getting bigger and bigger i now have an image in my head of this brick just getting larger and larger as it headed right towards my face i i even remember very vividly that the brick had a the construction of the brick had tree circular holes in it and i can still picture them now as they headed towards me in a kind of slemothon why yes very much i feel that memory is minutes when o is it was just not even a second i i believe instinctively jerk to my head back as this brick came directly towards my face and i have a very clear memory of the can a sound and the wind and even i believe the brick as it flew past me flicked my fringe the fringier hair yen it it but a whistled as it went even when i throw my dogs ball now which has a little whistle device in it that memory comes back to me this moment was stunning li nothing this had ever happened to him and i remember having to sit down for ache quite a few minutes to recover i really fell and probably for the first time that i was inches away from death i member walking home in some state o shock afterwards he dice to wonder if if the brick at hath hit me and killed me an you don't maybe id fallen off the scaffolding or something i used to wondered whet then the crime scene investigate us came to look what what would they make of the whole set up what the even understand what had happened u no e you get i by a brick big where did it come from yet this does dead child who laying in a building sit ah that was the death taut of that but i i even had this supervision of what if my body fell fold and destroyed the little structure that i made down there and how did i get hit under the chin with the brick and where's the brick what the forensics would have made of the whole set up that istle thing right your on death that is not bad enough on its own there isthewhole question of the forensic's death wards what people will make of it it is we are to think of the stare at the scene of your death wit the the objects scattered around you get it all wrong get you wrong that is the bigger thing i he bigger question after you are gone is not just how i happen but you your motives you state of mind what to make of it your whole life you good qualities you bad ones to ant a broken

something here something that is ben eating at me for a while are read that you actually do not mind when people die from something you were selling because it tells a hard court users that the high is really powerful the high of heroine mixed with sentinel sentinel which is up to a hundred times more potent than morphed one hundred times more potent than the drug given to my father when he was dying from cancer a death from the stuff is a collinear is that true the my sisters of obituary bringing business for you in have a friend what a jehovas witness and she told me that in the resurrection it'll beau be to hold my sister i used to and speak to her nothing happen i this idea but i cannot get myself to believe it her body was burned cremated a one thousand hundred degrees i do not picturing that but i do the side from my own body hers was probably the other female body i knew the best lean taught muscular she wrote horses she was fearless always wanting to ride the ones that we trouble she could lose her saddle and gallop at a flat run a wild woman gripping the horses main with her hand her leg muscles were iron cables she used to put me in the vice a move in spared by our love of the w w f restless she would wrap her brawny legs around me in sees until i almost could not breathe my mother always called dacha the daughter with a bleeding heart the one point when she was working in new haven you would walk down the street with her and she knew all the homeless people by name if you were driving with her she would jerk the card of the side of the road get out leaving the car door swinging open and call to the man or woman to see if they were coquet if they needed anything that was her life's work she was actually a clinical social worker with two masters degrees and social work and public health bit the last five or years of her life she had trouble keeping jobs she had trouble committing to anything the daughter with the bleeding heart her of tops report says that her heart weight three hundred and sixty grahams one i had to identify her body the edges of the sheet she lay on were pink from her water down blood the water down blood of her compassionate bleeding heart they should have cleaned up better cleaned her u better though i caught myself thinking how perfect her eyebrows were how ill you were you my sister's age younger did she was forty for maybe that seems old to you but it is not she looked old her since she started using but before before my man she was gorgeous sexy she probably met you at your place were the too bell parking lot in her filthy car baseball cap picked at skin too much liner maybe you could never imagine that but she was ask any one who knew her asked the multitude of men who knew her asked the ones i would to find up against a wall execution style an actually execute asked her first to mind fuck of a boy front at age fourteen an the obsessive one that followed an high school asked the professors married men random men apparent friends the one a first gave her crack the nosy con ask her coach who slept with ha young women on his team and pulled her into a coke field party scene while she was still a teenager he denies all this to day i find myself fixated on the men they circle her memory these lose her dead beak ghosts or something how dare they have the nerve to be alive the year after sash died after visiting her grave in a summer day i drove through the center of our home town by the town green there as a cluster of boys and girls not yet high school age the boys were on their be ex's doing tricks riding down a little hill the girls were all clumped together watching these young peacock strut their stuff knowing their jaw was to sit there and be imprest they were nearly silent whispering among themselves by the boys were having a the fun i drove by them and shocked myself by rolling down the window and yelling girls get a backbone they are not that cool i worried what my sister's death was doing to me what was your dislike to day your day is a dealer i much heroine and sentinel on the streets these days an pretty sure your crushing it as the kid say on the radio i heard the chief medical examiner for connecticut actually get choked up about how they need to build new buildings just to keep up with all the dead bodies from over doses i grown man who seemed dead bodies for a living ride you my man are powerful is that how you feel a few days before she died sash sent me a silly text there had been an incident about a seeking a half before at my mother's house where she had been hosting a cook out for friends sash showed up in bad shape slowing her words fighting off drowsiness i forbade her to use some combination charcoal gas grill because i thought she is on a blow us all up there was a fight she felt wrongly accused and was crying a lot i tried to get her to talk to me about what was really going on and that went nowhere my om confronted her with some hard evidence a text i saw ding on to her one sash did this thing when she knew she was caught should stare hard into your eyes while she sized you up what did for sure what could sou convince you of look could she get away with admitting without completely throwing herself under the bus eventually she is sort of faded away into the next room trying to clear the table but nocking things over instead i was still holding a grudge about it but i was happy to get her a nosy was text asking if i remember the drawing in our middle school french books an went with the word feeble meaning week look a man with no bones making a face like he had just eaten something distastefully plan growing up my sister delighted in imitating the man feeble you are making me crack up she did it often it was such a stable in our repertoire that i thought was odd that she would even have to ask if i remembered but this was our pattern there would be an incident then after thing subsided she would reach out and we were both be happy did not have to deal with ha larger issue but each time i knew i was being roped into denial i was less willing this time an i held out on writing her back i wanted to punish her a little more show where i was not a push over but this thought came to me strongly you do not want that to be the last text she ever sends you read the subtext she may need you and you need to let her know that you love er i never tested sash back i waited too on after she died i looked at the texts in her phone from the night of that cookout the night we fought about whether she was drugs she wrote befriend how dot i not hate my sister my family truly hates me i on want to talk any more her friend wrote back dam naughty a the fucking nark seeing the word hate in association with me knock the wind out of me i want end to yell at her no you have got it all wrong ism the one who loves you not those people but by the time i read that she was arty dead ism jury thirty first twenty fifteen the day she died she had just seen her drug counsellor after our dad died and her diction blossomed he became the father figure in her life she was working in his garden toward the end of her life she created gardens for people just because she loved it gave her place to put her anxiety her manic tendencies he called to her saying he had to go an was she oke she waved him on ism fine ism fine this was maybe three thirty p m ism glad that she saw her counsellor that day they loved one another very much at four o'clock she has a forty seven second out going call to fallen at four o two there is an in coming call from allay for fifty four seconds at four or weight she calls marry for one minute then marry calls her back at four twenty and they talk for forty two seconds at four twenty seven she calls gay again and they talk for forty one seconds at four thirty nine she has an outgoing call to him for one second at four forty she has a call out to jerry for one minute ire you fallen merry him jerry were you the last one to talk to her did you see her too were you with her both her windows were rolled down at some one been in her passenger seat were you with her when she died and you got scared and ran tell me what were her last moment's what was she saying befoul did you watch her die my mother worries that she wanted to die but i do not think ow long ofeyou been cutting heroine with sentinel i do not think sash saw it coming you suck her punch people she had meetings coming up written in her day book about possible work she was trying in an email we connecting with he beloved former colleague two days before she died she said hi surprise surprise rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated hello well her offtopsy says six fifty four p m as the time of death some time between four forty and six fifty four sash and hail the drugs that killed her she hated needles she was found in her car an the parking lot of a seafood restaurant ill fin ninth five the detective on the seen happened to be an old high school friend he told me that he thought she had probably used felt sleepy i needed to pull over the restaurant is on the water i was happy that maybe she was seeing water in those last moments there is an off track betting place next to the restaurant with galloping horses painted on it two stories hive maybe she saw the horses i just wonder if she knew it was happening er did she really just think she was going to take a little nap i do not want her to have known what was happening i do not want her to have been scare if ism going to be honest here mi going to be honest here maybe i do not want to believe that you deserve my empathy i soft want a look you in the eye because she may not look much different than my sister you may be her some one who cannot be around their family that much any more because pretending is hard seeing sash trying to dry the wine glasses we used for thanksgiving while she noted out pretending that she still had one foot in our world was one of the most heart breaking things i have seen you may look that you may be sick you doing to get his just to maintain some equilibrium you may have been her friend i may have even met you you may have called her sage you may have loved her god help you if you loved her to be fair my sister dealt too as i was writing this to you my husband offered me a gentle reminder of this fact it was manly she could use there is long handed mission and subtraction in the back of her day book with people's initials how much they owed or paid her how much she owed and paid in return it is chump change really written a you times as me free drugs we her pay this was not high rolling dealing this was survival what my husband reminded me that my sister was dealing too i quickly defended her yet but she never killed any one he said again gently you do not know that i was dune it is true i did not know that the fact is she could have killed some one i worse fear when she was alive was that she would be driving around high and kill some one the idea of her killing some one kept me up at night i often thought about having her followed curious i was about what her days were where she would go i was once driving to visit her in my mother thinking about how i could spy on her when i was a traffic slowdown an i ninth five a few egress away from our hometown on the radio they said the was an accident up ahead my mind went to my sister ad she cast it i pulled up in the traffic jam rip behind a purple car i gasped it was sash here was my chance to play detective she moved to the right lane in the middle one i was in began to pull forward i was at risk of being scene i decided to not try to hide i pulled up next to her ready to make a stupid face and stare at her until she felt my presence to my horror she looked half asleep her head was back her eyes at half mast i could not believe she was able to drive a car my heart started racing and i pulled in behind her as if that might shield other cars from her i followed her all the way home to her house trying to steer her car with my body a bowling ball headed for the gutter she was still living in her own place with an ex befriend turned best buy not yet evicted and forced to live with my mother during the last year of her life i pulled into her street and watched her drive in to her driveway i wanted to follow her in barged into the apartment that she never let me enter but i froze because i did not know what it'd do once i was inside deal if her some jonovarch opera hull logan speech she'd go for that i did nothing i told myself she is going to an out patient client she has a therapist o drug counsellor all these professionals helping her but unfortunately she also had you and here is the thing my man i need you to i know that i know what ism doing here because of you i get to say if it were not for that guy because of you i don't have to blame her because of you i can not my head when people tell me there is nothing in could have done but i do not know if that is true i did try my family tried interventions honesty confrontation rejection love she once told my parents that out have any one in the world she cared most about what i thought of her i ache at the possibility that if any one in the world could have saved her it was me but to save her i would have had to go to her live with her make it my life i would have had to physically remove her from her life and stand guard at the door holding a shock gone would have had to somehow wrestle her denial get herd ha finally go to her knees and raise the white slide but i got engaged i got regnal to day whenever i tell some one about my violent feelings towards you they inevitably say well if it was not him it would have been some one else there was not him it would have been some other guy but my question is why did it have to be any one at all why should my comfort be that there would have been another one that all we can expect from life as a game of a hackamore what was shoddy people i cannot accept that because what man it was you and ye ism raging at you i do not have to rage to myself or my sister to save myself from falling into a sad heap on the ground yer ism using you i do not care none of this is fair my man fuck you fuckyou because you are still here and there will never be another her fuck you because i will always think about you you are my dealer now man you tent me a life without sash because of you ism going how to do this alone and it'll never let you

to obscure hoping it would be a kind of a play on moment more which is a moment of awareness of one's own death but even i know maybe that is to obscure i but anyway alow o the story happens in the common section of facebok moment morris anyway sepnipou explains after some one you loved eyes suddenly even their most annoying traits and retrospect seem endearing blame birkhart's friend was his guy have mar there were both comedians ain chico went their twenties in the comedy scene blame was drawn to have because he was this extraverted weirdo loud and absurd he was also a problem drinker and constantly high even at a bit about being stoned he could not order food in the movies and he had this laugh i remember that and of bugging me you he would just her talking of festbeti olio it is hardly down fiction wether goolikoblcomlon anythat graben shake my shoulders instead if he was excited about ti's the dumbest thing a new at new job he show have saw himself as this in your face brutally honest i conic last but blame says thinking about it now he cannot really remember any actual instances of have being much of a rebel he just remember have as being disarmingly nice to me it was almost little that annoying how kind he was because it made me look bad in comparison can we were always together yet he was that he would go up if people that he had only that once or twice sand say hey hows to go n how ere you to day and you you tell he really meant it on stage you could often here this earnestness and date's comedy this almost collide excitement mot ridiculous stuff your surly es ye oh y o is icy y to be on o lo o lo ye got to recording of his sat have did on october tenth twenty four to help days later blame it a call that said have was in a coma it was sudden have had been a diabetic and somehow his blood sugar had gotten high that his body shut down his kidneys were failing blame visited him in the h spital it was jarring then after three weeks of doctors trying to jump start date's body they told his family twas probably best to take him off life support they invited his friends to the hospital to say good by when i found out a he was not on to be coming out of the coma an and was gan be taken off i support i just said i i cannot go there is noway i can i can see him that knowing that i never be a the talk him again instead i went to my housewhere at the time i was living it for other comedians and all friends with have and i said i man i go home and every one should just come over to night after you just y have we just made a hole night out of it and just cantata basically awake for have and i just can awaited for the news of him officially passing how many people came i was at least fifty sixty people while that is a lot everyone knew have was con o be taken off life support that night and finally a face book post confirmed it rest in peace daff mar then his seventeen hundred face book friends began to post eulogies of him to his face book while thoughts and prayers i had a gigantic crush on have on admitted another said let us all be the most have mar versions of ourselves bloke's post kept it simple ti wrote i love you did had you ever told have i love you to his face i do not know i do not i do not think when your face was actually losing them you cannot you have realized it more unfortunately that is how t works two weeks later on thanksgiving day there was a post on date's face book page from have oh man it was this it was it is hard to explain this is have mar boiler alert you're alive i despoiler ism here his friends all whipped out their phones in the middle of their thanksgiving dinners and started shouting enjoy on his face book page people are saying no one celebrates thanksgiving the we have celebrates thanksgiving a have turned thanksgiving into master it turned out dad's parents never did wind up taking him off life support they transferred him to another hospital instead and a couple days later his at walked into his room and star talking to him he had countless times since he would fallen into the coma and at some point perhaps i recognized his voice my eyes popped open and i was still intimated at this point i had a whole mess of tubes sticking out of my face and attempted to scream but because i was intimated it came out silently but i just mouth the words what have had been in the coma for a month he is a type one diabetic who just on an awful job caring for himself he had not paid much attention o what he was eating drank too much and he had no way of monortering his blood sugar because he sold all his strips for weed money he had no idea has led sugar with sky rocketing eventually sending him into a coma the last thing he remembered was puking into a bucket and figuring he must have food poisoning and then after a month he welcome in hospital bed completely bewildered by the entire situation but the upshot of all that was that he was in this weird situation some of us fantasize about that tom sawyer thing of being at your own piano regret to hear all the things people say about you he get to finally find out how your seen what people will remember about you have did not get a chance to look at casebook for a while he was still recovering his hands would not stop shaking he could not even use his found it took another month or for him to be discharged from the hospital and that is when he finally decided to read through all f the lilies people had left on his page about a hundred of them it was nears day after the ball dropped and everyone went to sleep he was recuperating in his parent's house he went down to their basemen and that alone at the little kitchen land scrolling for hours it got to be two and three and three thirty a m and ism just there at this island reading these things from my laptop one of the first things he spotted right in the middle of all that i miss was a post from his brother trying to quash the whole thing written the day after have supposedly die i think my family was honestly pretty upset reading as some of these things to friends of avid there seems to be some confusion and unofficial word on davit's passing at the time of this posting have mars still with us until you hear official word that avid is past please out of respect for him in our family refrain from posting about avid in the past fence it got seventy lakes three comments but the casebook algarathem had buried it it was overshadowed by all of the comments coming in facilitating the dead have narrative some of those got twice as many likes and reading these comments was sorta you would imagine people brought up about of memories things he did some of which he didn't even remember funny stories and he got to see what this life he bumbled through actually looked from the outside there is pretty good ones in here this one i had forgotten existed i o get to this woman rights deep into the late night hour of a crazy sexy cool party i found have pounding on a closet door and then she transcribes this conversation where she says what you do in die and i say i got to go to the bathroom and she says that is a closet and i say no it is not it is the bathroom and there are people in there there are people in there and they need to get out and then she says i show have that it is indeed a closet and then the last line is me saying just let me knock on the door for a little and then it'll walk away that people do not know what i did and that is great man that is funny a bunch of post perplexed him just cause they were random there was one from a next girl friend who was appreciative of the fact that he broke up with her and fished his car because it was cold outside one woman said he was a great story teller and also quit unreasonably sweaty ay absurd right what it is easy not to include that is sentence but as have kept scrolling past the funny memories of course things got heavier many of his friends had been devastated and they took to casebook as a form of fairy pouring their hearts out about their loss dozens painted have as a devoted friend the kind magi who was there with hugs and advice and beer whenever you needed him many got to this one post from a friend the just got at him he did pretty sure kit took this photo right before i told you i was going to leave her party in order to go to bed early and then you made fun of me for doing that i guess i never thought about this before but you were totally my best friend in college even though you were senior when i was a freshman you insisted on treating me and every one is equals even though we were not did you really made me feel effing cool my due smile in this photo is one hundred per cent genuine because i was happy to be with you all the time it was not just me who felt that way whenever we went to we v s or walgreen every employ recognized you and said fellow we have even need not a chopollay for free because you have it going on did thanks for telling me not to be hard on myself and then laughing about how funny that sounded coming from you thanks for all the ride's home thanks for being my best friend it looks it is finally your turn to turn in early you earned it it'll talk to you later duffer that is sarcwey ye yet is it is just really sweet it is really i do not know it is many these things i an remember i do not remember things that way i do not remember implead it walgreens on knowing my name i remember shop lifting from walgreens and spending the night in the in jail that is how i remember this stuff this was the main thought have hot going through his halogens even though everyone was being nice he thought there all wrong i know that people do not really talk shit about some one when they died but it it is just really tuft square the image that i have of myself with the way other people talked about me when they thought i was dead and that is why reading his own eulogies it actually made him feel awful he felt overwhelmed by the complete disconnect the tween the go he thought he was and the guy everyone else was talking about he thought that he was at for a bad person that he took his depression out on people that he could be insensitive self centered i put myself in this coma it was my carelessness my recklessness that got me to this place in the first place and on the one hand while it is moving here that everyone at this wake at bloke's house was miserable to feel i had gone i made these people miserable that train make sent you were you guys you're not acknowledging how fucked up it was that i did this stupid thing to you right and that is why it was it is very different the experience wit my family because my family was pretty aware that an and they had been hurt by in terms of the traditional wreckage that and ow gohoulike earn attic leaves in their wake my family suffered a lot of that and they were not effusive when i came back they were very aware of the ways in which by contributed to this situation b now that everyone was saying he was this wonderful nice guy it actually made him feel guilty even now years later it is a burden witnessing your own funeral it actually on a supped maybe it would not if you stayed that the problem is if you have to keep on living but what this did not luck for date's friend blame have you ever found his laugh annoying since then now now it is tour music to my hand my that is how very bake got to watch his loft on come back to life that is really the thing with fantasizing about he

for another guy named and for lawn an he had died a few weeks before he is young when he died only thirty five the ego began dear this medical life ism attaching a quick document that i created fridge documenting some of the thoughts and emotions i had following the funeral of a navy seal the whole experience was more of an modesty than i bargain for this caught the eye for producing her in a she dang a chip us her she his the ego was signed by a retired officer in the navy a guy i in a called charge it is not his real name the document he detached to the ego was an essay it was four pages long he written it quickly after add for lane's funeral at he was a stranger to him tut there was something about the whole experience that seemed a kind of haunt him that let him to write an essay something deeply emotional i could not tell what it was gave him a call why did you write us i new es prion i the rate radio shows a lot i i do not and i think i wrote you gas one time prior because an that sold is live and knew haw a contact you tho case him ma be charge writes radio has more than most people i asked him to tell me the story of eddy for lane's funeral last summer the story begins with a random tax message from a friend of charity's a surname mark he in charge went to the naval academy together after graduation charge went on to become a naval aviator flew met a a helicopters in a rack in two thousand seven his friend mark joined the navy seals the navy special operations forces what was the taxed that you got from mark i actually started with the good morning i say good morning hows a houseboy an yer son and a his next texts he i got a out for you and our bast for response came back doesninvolve explosives he says e ten the service a frog made in my absence frogman is i nice for a navy seal and for lawn a mark had bee navy says together the funeral was in be in sanding and mark who lives in florid could make it i asked charge who lives near by to go in his place that was the moment where it was that moment to says as well do i really want a got o a funeral of some i do not know in his absenceoye if it was anybody but for a probably would have what made excuse did he sit there for a minute or two before ye rote him back thinking of excuses not to go give yell if i said now i did think of a few excuses not to go because funerals or ore those things it people a tending to begin with and let on the funeral sememe that you do not know which pecan my shes tell real because just not important the charge wrote mark back said set me the details and it'll do it and then in the swirl of his own life and work and family he can't forgot about it two weeks later he woke up and realized it was the morning of eddies for lane's funeral he put on a nice bargained some big shoes in a dark button down shirt he thought he go to the service during his lunch break catch the eulogy and then screwed out of there he back to work he realized he did not of any of the details about the service and he also did notknow anything about die for lawn he did some goggling and found a face book memorial that mark had set up and it go fun me page asking for donations to help support eddies family it mention that he had passed suddenly in the essay charge sent us he writes there are pictures of his three children and the smiling face of eddies and seal training submerged in mud and simply and giving a thumbs up with green fatigues on the date of his passing was listed and i sandy goggling to for military tragedies be antral alumni from a military academy means that rarely is there military accident where some one i know is not involved or affected found unusual that i could find no reporting on anise's sing y at the time i a i told myself that he was a a maybe feel at the had you'll died in glia did he had e i it was a if it was a major fire rider era conflict there would be o there would be yellow vas there would be prays would be flags everywhere there would be people weeping the streets if it if he had died in commit it was not that you knew it was not about el death well i a was not i did not get that little lam bug in the back your head because like the can will how he dine it was a caravan the under net did not shed any light on the mystery's surrounding eddies death at anyway it was the day of the funeral charge would probably find out what happened there is a heard thing being a proxy a funeral he reminds me being a plus one at a wedding only miserable he do not know the person who died or their family sos hard of any feelings about id the fact that eddies for lawn was gone it had not changed the course of charlies life at all just course of his lunch break silly charge gets to the chapel la because mark tested at the last minute and asked him to pick up some flowers for the family corsages for eddies for lane's daughter and widow as soon as he drives into the parking lot he notices a woman sitting on the sidewalk dressed in black a tending to a little boy who is having a total melt down over his pants and how he does not want to be wearing them charge recognizes the boy from pictures is eddy for lane's son when charge walks into the chapel the service has already started and he is charring those flowers one of the funeral directors intercepts him and asked him if he is the flower delivery guys charge tries to explain awkwardly and in whisper talk because again the service has already started that no he is there for the service but no he does not actually know the deceased and no he does not know the family either he just there for gin florid as a standing the funeral director lets him by and charge finally squeezes into the back row of corners the pews well willful and the walls ism wish of the back the walls were wind with that men three pieces that were six foot four poetic see built were and glasses of a year clearly may be seals people were giving eulogy es in is es say charge writes that have felt odd to hear about the achievements of a stranger stories from his friends the men on the back wall with him were still faced betrayed no emotion until die forlawnie's daughter e seven year old name fella broke down in tears the little girl was a you sobbing you knot in that s deep heartbroken deep heartbroken sub arm she mother you almost can at bent over and escorting her out through the door and she is just sobbing a sobbing id again toucan imagine always six foot plus three hundred pound athletic maybe seals and is that everybody just look helpless it was the is not anything these guides cannot take on and i and id is a little girl sobbing a you are right behind us it is not off that anybody you do there is a part of your essay that at that really struck me ism jusconried you wrote the military traces you to separate the emotion from the mission at he is oldest girl fella was old enough to understand what was happening but not military enough to know not to show it did you want fella to be a little more military in that moment i not say that because that little girl daily out there the whole way am yet it that that again set off a cascade of grief that everybody there had to con out stuff away charge stuff the grief away with an old military trick he focused on accomplishing the mission to deliver the flowers mark had sent him with i stupid an i feel barreled even admit this but ivy that is mi clung to is i need to give the flowers i clean i clung to that idea that my mission is to give he the flowers luckily a voice intharly's head his wife's voice he says told him that delivering the flowers then was a really bad idea he stayed put it made him deeply uncomfortable all these feelings for a stranger he was in being military enough you lose i degree of empathy in the military because paths not a not a it is not a advantageous skill to have an most specially coat airfields empathy is not e useful emotion have and the fact that i sniffle and and carry up is generally you don't thought is week i i say you you your your empathy your empathy setters and to be a atrophied well i man i think that you could all sure his proof that you are empathy sentry havenatrophied that their actually quite present they just come out at the wrong times at with odd things which is i guess all this i think some people would argue that a funeral is the exact right time for it to come out it at present an the service finally ended the chaplain asked everyone not to talk to the family just proceed outside to the flag presentation but charge ignored these instructions and walked up to eddy for lane's widow eager to give her the flowers to accomplish his mission at last when he told her she was there on behalf of his friend mark she brightened and gave him a hug she told him mark was the whole reason they'd hot service there in sandbag he deranged everything charge got back in his car and called mark to give him a report and then mark said something strange he told charge he was relieved to hear the had been many people at the service it hid hid me it hid me almost at touching lights hat he said ism glad people show up how was when no one was going to be there i an and and you get that kind of thinking feeling that you have is something important and the told me was is because because of how he killed himself and and that eddies had disappeared from home three and a half week's uglier he been missing for about a week before his body was found under a bridge he had aback back filled with pictures of his family and his service record and his essay charge writes about that moment after the funeral when he was in his car talking to mark and he finally understood how eddies had died it all came together in my mind suddenly no mention of cause of death no new stories of training accidents no mention of the end of his life at the eulogy the monster that hides in the dark the one that you do not mention lest she summoned his attention how did that change things for you to understand that eddies had committed to hi side i i got light head it es i had at physical at a physical reaction i just can there was nothing there was nothing about it that me met non no no oracles of it the chaplain's in vocation tod talk and nobody said anything about it both mark and day's would as i found out this sorry we i thought wore they were terrified because i expect to so up to an empty chapel they expected no one to come in fact the navy chaplain had mentioned at the start of the service that eddies had killed himself but charge arrived late and missed it and charge had misunderstood mark's worry that no one would chow up mark told me he was worried about that tat not because at he killed himself it was more it all happened suddenly and he was not sure people would be able to come the morning before our interview charge called eddies widow to make sure i was octet with her that he talked to me and during that conversation he learned something about helm's break down in the chapel when on my she were to leave this cause she was ashamed she felt that she felt ashamed that everybody new her father had killed himself and that the other felt that she was a a bad person and i was who was horrified to hear t hat i he o e holly yet the things for o think she was somehow is print for father passing wayifat everybody that world series who's therms shorter and she was i i is his for and i was horrified to hear that and that she want to leave ad he left the military and twenty twelve the same years charge charge says when he go back to civilian life you get a job you have got your family and friends that you miss having a greater mission your your sense of purpose is gone it is you have to evolve but when i heard what any did id i i i understood what he i understood what he was thinking of that moment i various credit o try to explain an a basically terms without no you do not myself but i do not maybe i i i i can put myself in few the she's eel with o talk e an about what i being able to put yourself in their share i mean k k can you talk about that are you up for it ut for talking about the so been caridreading this you won't take a little break i i can keep the like i i to say of brave enough to take that subject or but i do not to i do not i do not think i in thick i can n think i can do that i the the sir this fin that is fun charges had his own about wit suicidal thoughts he brought his career in the navy to an end he told me about it when the microphones were off he said it was cade to talk about here i asked him if in retrospect the thing that got him about eddy's funeral he reason he felt compelled to wite the essay was that it could have been his own funeral but he said no that is not i and then he explained why he read the say he said he knew from his time doing madofour flights that the mere sound of a helicopter approaching can improve the vital signs of a person on the verge of death he said i wrote you because i wanted to be the sound of a helicon turn to some one anarch of us we went t share the those of the national suicide

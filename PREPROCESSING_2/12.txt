wellfolks there is something called the dunning cruder effect dunnincruger effect is a bias in the brain that you tend to think you are better at something than you actually are and the dunning crugeraffect is widely held across a wide variety of skillets in the united states is also held in general by lot people who think they are smarter than they actually are but it is particularly held by people who have been made in touchable by the system if you been made untouchable by the system and you have just been riding through the ranks for years based on say your interjectional identity you are going to think you are much better and more competent od things than you actually are and then get away with a lot more this is the story of fanny wills fanny wills is the futon county district attorney she is the person was brought charges against president trump based on supposed violation of recon law which as we have explained on the show really does not apply in this particular case it is certainly a legal stretch she is attempting to make her name by getting at donate trump particularly in a state sort becaseif pecan get donate trump on state charge where the ye cannot pardon himself if you come president of the united states well things started to fall apart for fanny wills over the last couple of months she's a heroine in the media she was she was a hard charging prosecutor was going to finally get trump and then it turns out that she is k example of the dunning cruder effect but with a interjectional twist because she thought that apparently she could get away with literally anything just for background wet me playyoueclip a fanny wills explaining before she was elected d why exactly she should be the d here she is because they deserve a d that will not have fact with it employ because they deserve d that will not put meddle in their old poke when it should go to benefit children because we deserve better o now as we are about to find befallen county people did not actually receive that d apparently according to forces wills faces accusations she violated state conflict of interest in public money laws of her claims from a group of trump codependence that she engaged in an improper clanduston personal relationship the we mere relationship wit a man named a cranial wade who really had very little prosecutorial background but was appointed the special prosecutor to help her out in the futon counticase against a dona trump wait and wills apparently travelled together on two vacations according to for documents and state records reveal that wade earn more than six hundred and fifty cousin dollars working with wills yesterday there was a hearing about all of this it was a it is an evidentiary hearing in sort in which the defending asked that she essentially be removed from the case for conflict of interest and fanny wills for some od reason decided she was going to testify now this came after head basically destroyed her own time lines to the question here was wether she had hired this guy because she was supercompetent she would paid him and then they fell in lave an they started going on cruise in having seasonal he rest or whether she had known the guide for a while and she decided to bring in her lover to pay him state tax pare dollars and then gone vacations with hem with with state aware dollars and did that not based on the interest of the people of contain county but based on her own personal interest in the guy she was stumping well si wills and many of her employs had been open to testify apt evident her hearing to determine whether she should be disqualified from the case and last week she'll try to stave off her testimony and that completely failed yesterday first they called a bunch of fanny wills is employes her pals here is one of fanny willies's pals explaining that fanny wills actually was in romantic relationship with than with than waded as early is twenty nineteen her name is robin very she was considerativeswe will see a friend of fanny wills but then hey got very gossipy and and a kenafellapart for fanny wills on t stand here was at the friend a former afford the often county district attorney's office robin hearty talking about the relationship between wills and waded you are without going at all that the patakinty thous the her out your mind a tent thousand lateen til the thousand twenty two on miss fills n mister a were it a romantic relationship what is the question i were no doubt that there were me into relation ho i in effect one thousand nineteen to the last oftystop with her no no an not based on your personal outer alien an over an yer speaking wit canteen in together take like got e no case that is what she testified and really there two issues in the seven entire hearing is she number one is when fanny wills started dating than waded if it was earlier than the appointment which suggests of course that she appointed him because she stubbing ham s that is question number one and question number two is even if she was dating him after they got to gather on the case was she then expending tax pair dollars on him in ways that she would not any other employ that's question number two and fanny wills fails on both accounts tell it is more on this in the second first going on lone without expressive pin it is using your smartphone without a pro detective case butts the time probably is fine all takes is one accidental drop on a solid covered to make you wish you would protected yourself this may or may not have

same way that i d by visiting express vena calm slash of ben he asked p r he as us apian to come like beeping g next for three months for free it's express piazza calm slash ben they then called than waited and said tries to deny that he was dating wills in twenty twenty he tries to claim that because he had one of cancer it was not possible for him to have romantic relationship because he was trying to isolate i it did not go over amazingly well in court he was sweating bullets than wide as you would imagine no a o ai tat a er is i o dis you indicated a i to a or when a on yo a i i i o e no a o dis's i is we e i dish an a a is i tin is very i serosa a to you would at er a at er wat it are you in farming the monsierity and the in willie is not still of course that is this tern amends is o condo a do not you own ta a at were is et an i our yo we o o i when you said here for wo i i the i of or agree it is not tat a a o a to i her i i in tat and o course you i ay at worse a worse experience at at a er me that er r wit you your a your be fecal year don't you awe wo e can and you do l at wan w a for o after work at would you cat a wat visa n is of i could not be day went when wan is you went then muster say a i wire we dating no no is no reason conga he is basically blown up on thestand he says polka well i could not bin dating her because i cancer at the times to well you were a pretty non serow that in tire time ism assuming that you could have been in a room with heating her at the time wain was then force to explain about his sex life with vanning wills ans a things got awkward have you had a personal relationship at all and what i mean by that after the summer of twenty twenty three at you asking me if i intercourse with the discant i was trying not to but i i guess e it you in a character i today that answer would be tense would be now it is been surely professional since to summer of twenty twenty that is where we having issues i ya you will have to explain cause i do notknow what the issue would be no i will explain to e i is you say personal om we are very good try probably coset tear become o be the tack would if you skim meet s inter course be tan you es to abet e by change from intercourse to romance no o case then what the hell is hug a gave was then admits that he was paid for a bunch of stuff that was really not appropriate he paid for things apparently using the tamper dollars he would been paid for sees tax they went on a cruise he would pay for that using his business credicard and to the question is well was the state essentially paying him to then take her on romantic crisis an re he says none her no because she paid me back in cash that is going to be the excuse now is that whatever state dollars flowed to their relationship in appropriately it was not really an appropriate because she had fat stacks of cash in in the safe ism not kitting that the actual defense the then weighed and fannywell's try to use her is that in the actitatat that you roughly share tow a yous thou this awful car hotel your tank he remark ye to do and nereid you epithet the on e rammer o c she to do me ti i she hare notion hash r her carol i she shier you'll stuck out o you and to all the vacations that she to she paint you cash r island you her all thevication on your bit act and you included to in deductions on your aces a tat ye did not a gave again his claim in this got clam number two a clem number one is that he was dancing her before he was esse hired claim number too is that they were taking business trips that is airoquotesfor those listening around the world and that he was paying for them a sleeping tax pare dollars and then she was reimbursing him for her half in cash right's that hit did not look as though they were basically scamming the government out of money that is that is essentially the claim that she is making the the counts sailing claim would be that she paid him six hundred fifty thousand dollars to be a prosecutor an area where he has no qualifications in orders that they could gone romantic vacate s together at this point fanny wills decides she must testify now first of all let me to s be clear any time you are the subject of any sort of court proceeding it is almost invariably a horrible idea to say you one testify this is why every defense council ever will tell you do not get on the stand very few people are good witnesses in their own defense the really bad witnesses fanny wills happens to suffer from two things one she is not telling the truth and too she also happens to be one of the most off putting witnesses in human history the don't cruiser affect that i discussed the very top yer that of fact is obviously present with the nnywellis it is almost beyond comprehension this lady thinks she isgoodet her job she thinks that she is convincing she thinks that she comes off as honest and forthright and righteous and she comes off as precisely the opposite she comes off as obnoxious and lying and scheming and it is really bat vannuwels blows up on the stand we truly blows up it is more on this in just one second first have been talking about my he lick sleep mattress for years as have had my helix sleep mattress round almost a decade at this point it was made just for me and it continues to be the gift that keeps on giving every night when i climb into bed after an exhausting day of taking care of my kids i am ready for the magic of helices if you've not lardy checked out the relics ley collection you really should he like harnesses years of

apartment went five it is their best offer yet it is o kin a last long that heck sleeps to comslesh men use code he looks partner twenty five this begins with her saying the she is going to testify against the advice of council o she all her o a he the we a we need red her you always an w for ow wo all she gets on an a she is standing there it comes was miss cross i don't like you an see we miss wells to maybe there withdrawing the objection to the motion or more miss post take a lev ere a her to e bison of the dis return this points that she is no longer i investing miss him miss merlins allies next comes she had tried to not testify and nature is going to testifies she strides up aggressively to the witness box and now is the moments o first she starts off by suggesting that making her even answer questions is contrary to democracy which his were because it seems actionably as well within the boundaries of democracy to ask whether the d a who is prosecuting donate true for political reasons is in fact a corrupt person who is having sacs with the other prosecutor and paying him vast quantities of tax parish well taking vacations with m here she is getting very very self righteous about thole situation is not tithe matmesser way her on an i con i o do a man owe wee is intrude of i think are on very i on bee to ism not a hostilely i my e want can be to more wit your hostile is work to be a first i heritors a poses means i her interrupt port contra contrary to democracy not o mine that mean a case o firsts terrible lawyer the sound hostile witnesses the way that it works in a criminal trial or a civil trial actually is a hostile witness when you have seen it until some e permission to treat the witness is hostile and what that means is that went witness is a witness for the defense and a prosecutor is prosecuting the they can cross examine the witness the can ask more adversarial questions because they are not a friendly witness it does not mean your affect is hostile or not hostile she is even know wit that and she is the decacounty i love that that the the the defending interests are contrary to democracy because the claim is the to dependence tried to overturn election therefore she is completely shot free on the question of whether she is in fact a corrupt public started and then she goes full out she goes full a ponce know in injustice moral you are out of order you are out of other sine ire sort is out of order here we go fannywellus well on the miler i object to you getting rector to din intrusive in to people's personal live you confused you think ism on trial these people are on trial for trying to still an election an twenty twenty ism not on trial no matter how hard you try to put me on trial well i mean its an evident sour hearing to determine whetheryou should be disqualified partechnically in this particular portion of the trial your actions are on trial but guess what brazenness is not going to substitute for actually being innocent in this particular case it gets worse and worse for her she starts yelling about the media she is the media lied about her which is heard because again she is the one who apparently lied a lot and i her to one a i testimony ton i get only made event to that i pul be you nae witness and i think very anxious to have the conversation in to day i ran to the torso i tin as i nepenthe is er was o has fin a fin ye just assume you we be not witness n only make fence i painless in any than to i pat to man no i ti youlasitity arguments i get you the t argument this morning is ridiculous to me you lied on money and yet he still a an i get risen to that argument i i you to that just the aroma e a o id under trot the argue the morning water ataman body i tot gain excellent girl ten you how ti ones you er with the sort on money and ism actually survive that began contain tin titeiyer i am well she what what would a heroin here she is a she throws her friend unerthboutts remember robin arty her her former friend who testified that she and than wade were romantic in twenty nineteen and i here she is throwing her friend under the buss yo a hanger or five whatever o plasifit as have you been friends it her i had not spoken to robin in o over a year i girly not consider her fin now o think that she i the tan o e the go o penis an i thin that she betrayed of ration now she betrayed the friendship i apparently talking about what this lady was doing outside school o a then she gets to the question of the cash that she gave to than wade she says dory that cash was never that serious there there is not what i gave him cash w i mean it is a little weird is it not o i her o say the about you don't know of that has for e the rat maw you i care her ice no test money greatly o ism not when i allow you to is carry to a my vitals i know that i keep money in my house the amount the money i gave mister wad hit was never that there it only i never handed him more than twenty five hundred dollars in avian best we not talking about twenty thousand dollars in a i do not have twenty thousand dollars in cash right now the most i ever gave him i know i gave him twenty five hundred dollars won we to believe because we went to one on hotel and then we went to a second hotel that twenty five hundred dollar actually gave him dollar fix in believe i know that the rube trip the one that you describe with his on think i gave him about two thousand dollars for that trip for lie total o gat then she was asked man why do you pay him back in ash but there is no record of you actually reimbursing him for your had of the traveling gan that looks a kickback if if i hire my wife and or anybody else and that person is it a close personal relationship with me and i pay them a lot of money and then we take cruises together that the other person is paying for the id dead is that isms for to pay for my half she demonstrate that ism not actually stealing money from the government but there is no record of her having paid back than wade instead she says that she paid him back in cash she was asked why jail you paid was waiting cash all the time and i here is her not very convincing answer the money ha at the way the half in october a twenty twenty tar you don't know when that money i do know wet came from the came for my wearing to you wit job eyes a don't o you nor titi comfort i came from i don't not o would you talking ye could have come for o a private do because before i was the a i was in private practices i learned money doing that time to i is probably i ye it oft out have would you mean i do not know i me for i had undersea situation the for you never order a jam man i do not have to i o s you ha no pro of any re o ma inane was be a it it testimony one within it is enough to prove a fact mi i o haven't me a a inner i down with your intimating i dear ism a mi to me that you ma ma a see pun fit what i i till it do wit o a i have for om probably fin train of action if an believe the probably thin five hundred dollars on my card she has no prove that she actually paid wed pack and i love that the lords like yon you prove the sic we give just gave you the prim i set it that is not prove that that there is evidence that you set it but the whole question is whether you are lying or not i we gan just take it face value that you claim the thing it's more on this in just one second first think about the joy you feel when you tree yourself to something new slipping into a new pair of lounge where it is a simple yet delightful

question is where she got the money right on the middle of this proceeding fanny wells absently admits to a campaign finance violation apparently she says that she took money from her campaign and kep that which i do not believe you can do for personal use last i tract my question on where i that cashorigal comic it any can o back cases an plengeib a cash for years in my hot for me to tell you the force the money comes from when you go to public thingy buy for y get fifty dollars o throw in there when you've been my whole like when i took out a large amount of money on my first campaign i ha from the cash of that what now again first roll of chiming folks do not admit to the chiming yet that was grate that was really really but she concluded with an explanation that she does not wine she likes o grey goes seeming again this went amazingly well for fanny fellas and for the anti true team in this particular case here she was me just lose up on the stand here it is it is wild much cash at tom probably four five hundred dollars an ma not paid for o a on outta i think we did too differ wine tor if she did shuerfit to om hake to bout hand he likes wine i do not li like win to be on the i great shouts gragoose that is the important thing as you expend six hundred fifty thousands expire money on the got yoursnipping ye that is that is the important thing we even mas ante see was o there goes the georgia case an must ten be see had on a former federal procure name chuck rosenbrig said i it may be time before fanny wills you leave if it is determine that they have apparently is that even before the generals in this case we think we should beach a point were for the interact of protecting the trial entirefoln county trial a that they should voluntarily stud as as of is a great question this is not going well for the state a it could turn out an ka at it might turn out worst to your point a it might be appropriate for miss wills to consider removing herself from this case now and turning the rains over to a senor official in in the district attorneys office let timer her handle it it is worse than that because dona trumps ta turnips her can be able to make very obvious and clear case that fanny wills ginned up this entire case she these she could hirer in high profile fashion the guy she was stopping so she could gone expensive cruise with him as con be a very easy case to make and ism not the only person making nutcase over on he mess and be see is an annalistnam caroling policy she says the same thing she is this case against trump is pretty much dead in the water do not let the legal we for you this is aspect tit this menu manta if things are going in the direction we think a holy will li to the court if the game over for her she will be disqualified i if they had a relation ship prior to when they a represented to to the court it is it is a huge dislike a cover state it gat yep ism this is a problem this a problem semi just make clear one thing for all those who wish to be associated with or two taiga dona trump dona trump is the monkey's paw the monkey's paws a short story in which people discover a magical monkey's paw where if you actually make a wish upon it you get your wish but in the worst possible way that is exactly dona's from fannywillis got her wish dona trump made her famous down from me er prominent deal true may and up putting her in jail which just just hysterical the way this is working out we bet a fine farewell the fanny wills whose career is abashedly over because once again the running crossruff a undefeated for a lot of people and the reason tit exists is specifically because of the intersectionality here in the same day that this is going on your times ran in entire piece titled why the case against fanny wills yours familiar to black women and i just have a question why should that feel familiar o black women our black women routinely is appropriating fun in order to pay off the person there stopping it items a little races but according to the new or times tangalla hollies palmer fell ta science of pride when she learned that fanny wills the dead of full counts georgia and one of the nations to elected black female prosecutors would leave the election interference case against for a president trump but that pride would be tempered by dismay as news emerged of miss willies's personal relationship with a fellow prosecutor than j wade and outside lawyer she helped to she hired to help run the case miss hollies palmer a black fort year old turning for mississippi is mostly used a critic's trying she said to discredit miss wills at first you skeptical of the delegations but when miss wills herself conceded the relationship miss hollies reserve tome disappointment for the prosecutor who should have used a little more discretion and a little better judgment she said again the idea here is that the reason that she is being targeted is not because she is in fact corrupt it is because she is black and that is why by the way there is all these questions about t e i surrounding people fanny wills about a formative action surrounding people fanny wills about people coal garrison competent of their jobs suddenly vice president of the united states in air apparent to the whorehouse in there old be blat that where vary an competent and why variety of spores and if the entire society tells them they are not subject on meritocracy that is hi on it with fanny wills as the district attorney in folding county blowing of whatever case she is going to bring against dona trump in the first place he's more on this in just on second first the only thing that fuels us here i the daily ware other than our desire for justice in the universe is

going to start with jury section in march lake march march twenty fifth queen to york judge that of course is the idiotic plan brag case against dona trump claiming the dona trump for some od reason violated state campaign fin once laws by violating federal campaign finance laws by paying stormy angels pay off money be quiet about there affair that is that case it is foolish there is really no basis for it butt that trial is going to move forward in new york city that is the latest on that meanwhile there is a do j case that is currently being brought by special council avid while against former off behind in formant this would be the informant who claimed that president trobidon and son hunter we are involved with bedesman holdings the person who they are now prosecutes got in oleander smernof he has facing charges in connection with long to the fan creating false records to corngstanan he as rested thursday in lot vagus apparently the indictment alleges that smernov's story to the fa was quit a fabrication an a amalgam f otherwise unremarkable business meetings in contact that it actually occurred but at a later day than he claimed and for the purpose of pitching berizman the effendante services an products not for discussing bribes to jobidon when he was in office the bunch of fpamemos that contained his talk about how seriema wanted to pay job and hunter or five million bus o peace an all the rest of it and now the fee i is is saying that he lied about it and they are going to prosecute him over this the question the democrats are are making it that one they bringing is there suggesting that because smernof was lying this dis credit everything related to berizmaand hunter and jo which of course it does not that was supplementary material that supported a lot of the allegations that were made about hunter and jo and t was very treat but again unsupported by sort of further evident about actual payments of five million dollars to join but it does not end all of the questions about job hunter and trafficking in the in the biding business name that is rases questions as to whether the deejays actually targeting this guy because he lied to the big or whether the targeting ham in an attempts to basically get bison off the hook for the second time in e last couple of weeks he did violate classified document statues but they also said he seen s that is lad robin is being let off the hook can meanwhile and what i think is far more important news than any of these legal developments the leading critic of vladmerpouten has now been found dead in prison we has died in prison under unspecified circumstances this is an actual important world o men alexin ofvalny is was in h anti corruption campaigner who was widely seen as the chief rival to ladmerpouten in russia unclear how he died he was merely forty seven years old he had been sentence on a bunch of trumped up charges to a penal colony penalty of more than thirty years he had been behind bar since jaguar twenty twenty one according to waste journal when e returned to russia from germany where he was recovering after he would fallen ill during a flight inside of russia he he got sick whiles on the fighting had russia he then flew to germany to seek treatment then upon reaching germany doctor's concluded that he had actually been poison with a soviet era nerve agent called novichak which is again one of the things that vladmerpoutan does he tents to poison his critics nearly for years was a large scale critic of ladmerpouten up until his arrest he came back from exile who was immediately arrested by by vladmerpouten's team and then he was sentenced and the he was moved to an arctic prison to remote that at first nobody knew where the hell was mentor for literally weeks they shuttled him around that nobody could find out where he was to then finally he released a message saying that he was in a place that was extremely cold far in the north where all he could see were some dogs into snow basically curious footage of naval from yesterday in a court appearance and as you can see he looks alive and wile e was skinning obviously but this does not look somebody who is on first death obviously this him literally yesterday i asked the walk return reports nivaone's death practically extinguishes the last real political on opposition that still remained inside russia following gland residents invasion of you plane his cracked on on free speech and the passage of increasingly draconian laws aimed at stamping out any descent invades time in yell reflected the worst accesses of judicial imprison system that is increasingly been used to punish dude's political opponents he had suffered a alarming health ailments in prison issues that it worse in in recent money his wooers ere basely cut off from all access on him he was growing increasingly emaciated in biddy appearances in quart again every one suspects because people gets suicide regularly and i and death by natural class is regularly if thereopponents of land reputed that a the put machine finally had enough the lection any and they felt the threat from the outside or from any or from ay the inside of russia and it was just a convenient time to to get rid of lacy valley and ifvalney again large skew critic of the gremlin in two thousand twenty litany did not interview on sixty minutes and i and here he was on sixty minutes talking about his poisoning i said to the flight attendant and i and of shocked him with my statement well i was poison and ism going to die and i immediately lay i under his feet sexy navolny was on a flight to mascot from liberia where he would been campaigning against queen's party in a local election when he collapsed with no pain but knowing he was dying ax should ever sell of you body just at telling you that is body wad don and i gathered they suspected poison right away yes of course meanwhile his german liberia searched his hotel room collecting things navolnum may have touched this water bottle which the doctors in berlin sent along with a blood sample to a german military lab to see exactly what the poison was and the answer was anoverchuck they discover o i chalk this not agent in my blood in the inside of by all my body and alphas total from the hotel that is why we now we know that i was poison in the hotel because i ell it is again it is just a pure speculation because no one knows wat what what happened exactly but i think that when i was maybe put some clos with the an this poison on me i watch it with the want and then i see from the bottle the nor agent was not inside over bottle but on the bottle love chock is a highly toxic nerve agent said to be ten times more potent than saran gas labs an francs and sweden corroborated the finding there is no doubt it was military grade nova chock in just one secondly get to more on elegy novalnes death certainly killed in prison get's that a second

vladmerpun trad kill him but why would paten on a poison alley navalney when we first met navalney three years ago he was running against patent for president he had made a name for himself by getting his hands on in criminating internal financial documents related to high level officials and posting them on a long to these documents that you got prove corruption absolutely i work as e rest blow

this is why i have to say it is pretty while that tucker carbon did not just interview paten which was fine as i takes about on the show at length when tucker interview paten i thought he do divine chop all he did with let putentock and i thought it was illuminating and interesting and then tucker went on to a chenshilly act as he prop again is for vladmerput an russia he went on to act as a as a sort of water to panty burned s wanders knock off he has spent the days since his interview with gotten gallivanting around mascot and doing what pretty much purest to be almost identical to burn standers level propaganda on behalf of the russia regime mi stay this because here for example is a burning standers for to nineteen eighty eight talking but the matches of one of mascot's train stations just to give you sort of a background here here is a here is burn the stations themselves absolutely beautiful a including many works of a handles ti wit beautiful it was a very very felt of an tucker began his tour of mascot by going to one of the train stations in mascot now a few things here he is said before that mascot's train stations are clean there home less there do you not were about being pushed in front of a train and actually defended that statement to the extent that i think that major america states have done an awful job with crime e now just encamp to new jersey which is one the crime capitals of the united states is a fact o the america cities have done a terrible job in terms of cracking town of crime that happens to be true be that is not what but tuckers swing here tucker is doing something a little different which is suggesting that the entire regime upon which the train station is base he goes to a train station than basically says because this train station is nineteen has shandy leaders people in rush or living wonderful lives under the tutelage of lander gotten and he keep saying that sort of thing over and over and over again which is strange because he does not ashing to make that claim if he wants to claim that the you ctranians should not be supported by america tax pair dollars you can make that claim without actually going full drafty but as we as robertown in guvnor might they never go full drafty in any case here was a here is tucker at the at the mascot station of o the ways you understand a society is through its infastructr the places where people gather the places where they go to travel you got a lot of people in one places tells you a lot about the people with that in mine we are standing in front of the give sky metro station an is train station next to it there metrestatemens build by josh stain seventy years ago and the question is hows doing now after seventy years we went into it to take a look and what we have found shocked us now that is not an endorsement of stalling who was bad obviously norms an in worse when the train presiding by thing ere who you may to him either but it does not change the reality of what we sow or or precisely did not we the overfeeding there is no filth w no saw smells they are no bombs or drugadics or waits for people waiting to pus you on to the train tracts an kill you now it is perfectly clean and orderly and how do you explain that where not even going to ass that is not our job we are only go to ask the question and if you are response as to shouted us slogans bomber than the slogans we use to call soviet and mock that is not really an answer how does rush a country were told us they a station with new clear weapons haven subway station and all people used to get to work an home every single day that is nicer than anything in our country where not in gan we are o to speculate where us going to raise the question and wait for some one in charge to give us that answer what is the ante i stop the lecture and let you take a look for yourself at what the capscya metro station in mascot russia look li to day i gay nine pase been second he is not con speculate on what the answer is here a it'll give you the answer the answer's very clear every dictatorship has certain areas they are extremely clean where they bring of foreign journalists to show them how clean those areas are in fact that is precisely we this train station was built in nineteen thirty five this particular train station was open the is o originally created i guy named lazar koganovitch who happen to be one of josh stamen's right hand men the way that the translation was built s they hired bunch people who would actually built the onion under count and to go tote last to get people to build it for them and then they basically jailed all those people because they knew how the mascot train stations were working and also in order to fun this thing they had to bring in a bunch of workers and they to pay those workers hell how t exactly to they did they pay those workers they needed her current my to buy all of the instruments in order to build this particular train station how did they get all that stuff hell the answer is they went over to you train they stole all the grain and they murdered all the clocks the halladamar is actually one of the reasons why you have a beautiful train station right here but that does not even answer yet nice now e answerlites nice now is because dictators have always been able to clean up a particular train stations that is not answer as to whether the country it self is in good shape the countrysult is that isn't pretty terrible shape actually if you go to pion yang they are beautiful pictures of some of the subway stations in on yang that is in north core north core is a shochole this bazar notion tat you can go to one train station and then suggest that something is being done right over all by the regime because the one train station is nice again i fully take the critique an an agree with the create that the train stations in the united states i from my garbage in big cities new york and that they are too dangerous theresbeen no one more proof than i have been on the issues but that's not the argument tuckers making he is making the argument that somehow the regime over all is bazar my legit and it is all done by implication right ism not even going to speculate ism not even what i mean you could just say what i say am you cut you could don't have to speculate the reason the train station is nice is because laderbuttan spends dictatorial resources on keeping that train station nice and the reason the rest of rush is i really badshape is because lady rodent spent all of the resources making the train station nice and telling his political atones electing of jolty this all happening the same week that he killed the lacing of one an all likelihood in prison after jailing him on specious charges by the way and then just it make sure that it is not commentary you get the actual full scale propaganda to bee rule from the mascot railway station here we go that february twenty twenty for in the middle of a war here it is is a beautiful train station sons one in pong sane in fact were the highways in germany in nineteen thirty sex it turns out the pretty much herd there is place invasion that are supervise every single dictatorship on planet earth has great places to show foreign journalists will they have chandeliers in the siren election of all these not con to see those any time soon but they you have chandeliers in the subways and that is the important thing is not it that it is well wit and that this one train station is is great not this is not even the best sort of bazar video from from tucker that he is released in the last three days he also released video in which you went to a russia supermarket and now honestly what this video shows to me more than anything else and again the entire idea here is that your suppose to be enraged at the united states because you went talk russia super market yes she says that in this video and ow i will point out many things about this particular video because it is truly conman astonishing video remember this is well russia is in themiddle of invading a sovereign country in you grain the warning train has killed a couple hundred thousand people on theucraninside play three hundred thousand people on the russia side the russia economy is really really week the this since in russia our imprisoned or killed or both is in the case of laxity of one be tucker did go to a grocery store said he could talk about about america is in the weirdest way possible here is tucker a long standing feature may be the longest standing feature of cold war propaganda in the wast was the soviet grocery store no products no choices shoddily made things and it was not actually propagettit was real and you could look a the pictures on the into if you want we thought it be interesting to take a look at a contemporary modern a twenty twenty four russia grocery store two years into sanctions here we are or a the we go i guess to put in ten troubles here and you get it back when you put the cart back it is free but there is an intensive to return it and not joust brigade yore home wast in camp o k ss the grocery hard has skillet this is divined ism sing en us out now where the wheels do not move they lar on the grocer cardesco look a no hands retail placeman herslito it different you walking through casings to get the hold o k we have got through the perfume section to get to the grocers organ trying by what a family forward by every week an to see what the selections o runs i a and russia famous for its bread is one thing i can asses pretty well the low carbine tall is not swept russia a thank heaven because the an light that it is fresh to i that unicorn and many tells er o con a russia we of my coffee do not i don't just the sugar o flower beans with you be e it looks a staple we should get it it is a very good king packs sooty flowery and this is russia wine its from crime which on only has the one water nail base but also is the source of most of the grapes a in this part of russia for one sos towel cruet shes us check out of a grocery store and you have got gum racer blades and candy actually they hidtulatulates stilled but these are all seem to be western products mars twin snickers milky way bounty to at as possdrops men to it is prettynon sanction jimmy but what o i know i went from amuse to legitimately angry a we were guessing what the i cost everybody hears from the nite states by groceries and we do not pay any attention costs were just putting in the cart where we would actually eat over week and we all came in around four hundred box byforner bus a it was a hundred and four dollars you ask here and that is when you starts o realize that to ideology maybe does matters much as you thought to rushing if you take people's standard of living and you tanker through filth and crime and inflection and they literally cannot by the groceries they want that point may be matters less what you say whether you're good person or a bad person your wrecking people's lives in their country and that is what our leaders have done to us and coming to a russia grocery store the heart of level and seeing what things cost now people live it we radicalize you against our leaders that is how i feel anyway radicalize were i mahogany this up by the way two things there were noting here one the it didn't matters your good or banner how corrupt it is long as there are no homeless people at the substation don't kill lucky f baloney but as long as you can so a began is the grocery store does any one really should you complain really number one there is that which is absurd on its face on i on more level and then you just have the be sic misunderstanding of how economics works but you really really be sic misunderstanding of how economics works little secret about supplying demand if it turns out that you're in a poor country if you are a rich america everything looks super duper cheap i know it into making if i go t even as walk whatever i have in my wall will probably by half the country right now is that because even is daylights an amazing economy production cheap there it is amazing or is that because ism a rich america and the exchange rate means i can get pretty much whatever i want and you than any poor country in the world i can at why do you think america tourists are up charged on everything if you go the shook in israel or an arab market anywhere and you are an america and here is negotiating with guy and they realize you america they will up the price why do you think that is cause they know you have money at it is the thick that is the whole thing by the way there is many things that are wrong with what tucker is saying here it is on a radicalize you the you go to a poor country an things are cheaper which is how does he think that that the wage base in he united states has been under cut by foreign competition because wages in other countries are cheaper that because things are amazing in say chin u for those wage labors after all they can get their food even ore paying them nothing in over to radicalize yourself off of off of the fact that food is cheaper comparatively in russia than it is in the united state's for in america i say for n america i to get you how expensive is if you are russia in a second you have to want to be radicalized you have to want to do the propaganda to work and i gan tucked n have to do this all tuckered to do and if he steps outside mascot by he way things are way worse he is being led you the nicest areas of mascot he is being taken to the busboy beat and he is being taken to the mascot translation and to the really nice up scale super market if you took a three mile ride outside mascot things would look very very different but that that is the kind of amazing thing about all this let mes tell you something about how it works if you are a russia if you are russia russia has a per happen a we to pe of thirteen thousand dollars it per happen a g t pe of thirteen thousand dollars the percapita g d p of the united states to day is seventy thousand dollars seven zero compare to thirteen it is worse than that by the way because per happen a we type is not tell you even remotely theentirer story of who has all the wealth in russia bout five hundred oligarchs a presage all the wealth in russia legitimately all of it in fact the median salary which is a good representation a sort of the average person in russia rangers anywhere from about five hundred ninety bucks per month in jury of twenty twenty three adorning to serer insects about seven hundred fifty but month now do the quick math you are hung melic less than eight thousand dollars the year would be themedian salary in fact according to studies sixty plus per cent of ruffians spend half their salary on food half of it that is not remotely what america spent on food because why we are real rich over here and that means that we can support higher prices that they cannot support in russia in other words tuckers over the being all my goblins out cheap the is in every mission is looking at that bill and their thing themselves that is it that is a lot of that is that is a lot of money an he says this would support that that what he had in is cart would support a family for a week right that that is shady says suggests in the crossing a hundred but and to him that is really cheap but as i just set the average monthly salary of a russia the median monthly salary is six hundred buck month is oft a hundred bucks to feed a family for a week there four weeks in a month last i check that means your spending well in access of two thirds of what you earn in any given month just on food in russia and in fact when when he suggests that well they don't have inflation over here because m men lookout cheap things are eight's the opposite it is the opposite the exchange rates to the trouble has say rocketed in other words in america dollar goes way farther in russia then it would in the united states specifically because everybody in russia is much poorer in facticumecy in the video tucker shows footage from the supermarci cash register of how much that cost and it was something nine khamsin four hundred eighty one troubles and he says that comes outs a hundred and four dollars in other words the exchange right right now is one one dollar is ninety two troubles ain two thousand ten one dollar was about thirty troubles pert let inflation and bad economies russia hasninflation an bat economy in fact just over the course of twenty twenty three consumer price inflation was eight per cent in twenty twenty two it was thirteen point eight per cent and for particular products cabbage or oranges the increase in prices was in access of seventy per cent wife in russia is not good under fladnerpooten do not be fooled bi the train station with the shandy leaders full on twenty three per cent of the russia population does not have indoor plumbing you head over out to the rural areas not to the center of mascot the richest area what you will finds that forty eight per cent of ruffians in those areas still use outhouses eighteen per cent additionally two thirds of ruffians for living in rural areas do not have in dor plumbing eighteen per cent have zeros stage system not even in outhouse than have a bite tell get that is how things are working in russia to day and as for the supposed joys of living in russia they have a twenty one per cent alcohol is em rat in russia for men and women about five hundred thousand abortions were year in russia cassia's population right now it is a proximally a hundred and forty three million the united states population right now is approximately three hundred and thirty one million you have not a million abortions a year in the united states which is awful and horrifying and terrible in everybody including tucker hates that cassia's abortion ate is far higher than that of the united states well hundred ten per cent of ruffians actually attend church on a on a monthly basis forget about a weekly basis a monthly basis in other words propagandizing for this regime is a lie it is it is bad it is wrong in tuck also went to a my donates over in russia it it is mcdonalds that they would been transferred over to russia control because my donates decided that they could nation make money in russia it does the same thing he is amazed by the quality of the it it is amazing it is just the same as my donates hell yams a mean it was a my donates and then they just turned over this particular train to the russia we e owe of my donates they sold it to him what tucker neglect to tell us that for several months in say twenty twenty two they did not have french fries because be potato harvest was not good enough as reported by the associate o press of the time now why is any of this important because the junta position of what tucker is doing to prop up russia as some sort of wonderful model to emulate for the united states which is what a lot of these videos are about again specific cities of the united states when it comes to our positions on crime for example i i agree with that let tucker is doing here it is clearly nowatucker is doing here he is see continue stake hes being radicalize but things low prices in russia because to poor country or that he is amazed by the fact that they have things that are common place in the united states well one thing i noticed is that when it comes to population migration not a hull of a lot people from america migrating to russia lot of people for russia migrating to the united states and that is for a reason be the question of what is indicative of of haveladmerputent rules the death of flexing any er the fact that they tell of shandeleders in the mascot train station it is pretty clearly death of elegy nevalny that is without any political reference to what is going on in e crane there is this strain that is grown on both the right and the left that suggest that america is somehow not the greatest place in the world that america is actually quite terrible and tat if you go to other countries these other countries are better there is certain things about other countries they could tar superior to the united states you could you say thither is certain educational systems that are run better tan those of the united states you can say that a train station in mascot is cleaner then a train station in you city but the broad base political critique that is somehow it does not matter how you run the government long as the trains run on time or it does neon matter if the trains run on time america is just kind of inherently bad that is incredibly problematic incredibly dangerous and it is hard to see how it is super america first cardigan the rest of the so continues it right now or can be getting

from w b s chico is this camera can lie from or class what of our prettysers conichoffhe want has seen few years reporting on the history of one school it is a public school in a big city and teethe beginning con thought the story was about segregation and in equality in public schools but the more she spoke to people a research what had happened at this one school the when she realized it was actually about the inordinate amount of power that white parents had at this one school and she found many stories say that we realized we could not fit at all into one episode of our programming that we wed e released is its own little many series podcast last wee a little three minute traitor was rugs the name the show is nice white parents and even before the first episodes appeared it became this war thousands of ratings and comments on wine at apple pod case people saying it is decisive that it is races to talk about white parents giving the show one star reviews other people giving it five star refers to cancel out the one star reviews remember nobody had heard the show yet comment were about some imagined thing that people's thought that the show would be rather the the actual story that conatells which is you no count of funny i think it also speaks to how the entire subject freaks people had much white parents how rarely that is explicitly named as the subject of reporting there is much reporting when people of color as people of color and little reporting on white people as white people even when three the heart of a story as they are with this one and when you listen a what hot of found you feel horeritis i personally found it eliminating you can prison and judge for yourself to day we are presenting right here one of the stories at hon o tells in her series about one of the big turning points in the schools recent history ah before we started on a note everything you can hear this hours recorded before iron of iris arrived it is a world were people you don't get together person with no mass or anything do not be shock are not here is one i started reporting this story at the very same moment as a turn of figure out my own relationship to the subject of the story white parents in nerd city public schools i was about to be one of them when my kid was old enough as started learning about my actions and many there was ore is owned public school and bookman ere i could apply to a handful of special t programs i gifted program or magnet school or language programmed send to look around this was five years ago now but i vividly remember these tore it'd show up in the lobby of the school at the time listed on the website look around and noticed that all or almost all f the other parents he'd shown up for the eleven a m middle of the workday early in the shopping season school tor were other white parents as a group we would walk the halls following a school administrator almost always a man or woman of color there was school full of black and brown kids we would peer into class from windows latched the kid sit in a circle on the rug ask questions about the luncheon homer policy discipline some of us would take notes and the administrators would sell the whole thing was essentially a pit we of fer stem we have a partnership with linking enter we have a dance studio they were pleading with us to please take part in this public school an not think have ever felt my own consumer power more visor than i did shopping for a public school as a white parents we were entering schools that people us had ignored for decades they were not our places but we were being invaded to make them parents the whole thing was made much more awkward but the fact that nobody on those towards ever acknowledged the obvious racial different that roughly a hundred per son of the parents in this group did not match say ninety per cent of the k ids in this building i remember one time being guided into a classroom and being told that this was the class for gifted kids and noticing oh here is we all the white kids are every one of our tor saw this all of us parents but nobody said anything including me we walked out into the hallway mom raised her hand and said i do have one question have been meaning to ask and the group got quiet i was thinking o ka here comes but then she said do the kids er play outside every day i knew the schools were segregated i should have been surprise but the time i was boring schools as a parent it'd spend a paramount of time in schools as a reporter i done stories on the stark any quality in public education and it'd looked at some of the many programs and reforms we have tried to fix our schools many ideas we have tried standardized tests and charter schools we have tried smaller classes longer school days stricter discipline looser discipline tracking differentiations we have decided the problem is teachers the problem is parents what is true about almost all of these re forms is that when we look for what to broken for power schools our failing we focus on who their failing poor is lack kids and down kids we ask why are not they performing better why are not they achieving for tools are not the right questions here is a powerful force that is shaping our public schools arguably the most powerful force it is there even when we pretend not to notice it the gone that school tor if you onto understand where schools are not better that is where ye have to look you have to look at white parents that is what this story is about am going to take you inside o public school building and utterly ordinary squat three story near city public school building not too far from where i live this is not one of the schools i told and my own kids do not go here they are too little this is a middle and high school called the school for international studies as i so the story of this school and it is relationship with white parents down the block stand sixty years but the part i one to tell you begins it as i ask and the spring of two thousand fifteen rite before everything at the school changed in two thousand fifteen the student it us i ass were back little know and middle stern kids mostly from working class an poor families that year the year before and the year before that the school was shrinking the principal villain human was worried at a last two years we had a thirty students at our sixgreat class and it we really have room for hundred ah numbers i think ah or hard miss rumor started to reach out to families from the neighborhood inviting them to please come tic a look parents are to showing up for tors of es i ask mostly groups of white parents miss human was thrilled and relieved she watched parents through the building sayings thought me any time if any one has any questions really anything and want you to feel comfortable an miss trumpet says they did have questions mostly about the poor test schools that was fair is human expected those questions she did not expect the other set of questions she got a lot from parents is there weapons is there are you scanning are you was scanning school because rigor daingeress though have weapons have heard that there is arming metal detective right i heard the fights and to those kinds of things i do not i do not know what school our talking about i have never heard of that incident ever happening ever the fears of what this building is and what this felt building has represented ah has come transient itself we all late week w t there is a different story of international studies outside the building how much of that yo think is racism i think our entire society is fearful of the unknown excellent principal answer principal jump is black by the way she needed these parents schools get money perstudents a shrinking school means a shrinking budged miss duennas worried if this continued the middle school could be in danger of being shut down by the city as i so is in coble hill brooklet leafy streets brown stones it is a wealthy white neighborhood that is gotten wealthier and whiter in the last gate but white families were not sending their kids as ass miss human told these parents show as i ask were turning things around were in the process of bringing a new prestigious international backaloria crreulen renovating the library here is the new gorgeous yard it is an excellent school the parents seemed interested but i believe that might have had just as much to do with what was happening outside of the school as what they were seeing inside the building sure some names rob hansom an i a apparent we were the middle school processes o interesting to lives near by as i ask but he had never heard of the school i know problem his district rob could choose from a eaten middle schools the majority of white families sent their is to the same three schools job's wit those were the schools he heard of and those were the schools he told of a but they were pacts tools there were to many wealthy white families in the district to continue cramming into just three schools there is a couple of city did once were we want we stood on line for an you an you to have and than joined in an an auditorium full of parents and then had them announce that they were excepting fifteen students in the following in the coming class and they would been running towards all day most cities have some amount of school choice this tors an options near city though is an amid up version of what happens elsewhere the level of competition the level of wealth the diversity of people sorting into different schools everything is more intense rob found this process fresh treating although rob is very even tempered even when he is frustrated his canada when he gets especially hot he starts calling things interesting and this whoolmiddle school thing was very interesting he asked of their parents on school try what a we get a de some one said have you get heard of as i ask that building down the block rob had not the others had not they decided to all go chick it out together i walked away lot's parents wack today from this tors think a people jamming up into some schools and and your your leaving sixty seventy sees empty empty all your long you thirty kids a does not that is you spread them out around and that is a big school than all the sudden your sort of lineage second was there is nobody here was rob told as i as he had an idea that night he milled principal human and he asked would she be open to starting a dual language french program at as i ass they had one at the elementary school rats kids went to and everyone loved it sure principal juryman was open robs there end spreading the word as i as is starting a dual language french program we should all go rosebays there was interest but a lot of people he talk to had this question wet are other people going an the says had that kind of were what if i youkow if i look around nobyhas came with me and a and i came for something it's not here because nobody son's a collective action problem we wise a collective why white you need to collective ah just an the just i think over all there is a collected action is you o but if you are interested in this an part because of the french to language part of it am if if you are the only one to show up there is no french teacher for once to but there is a program if fifteen come if twenty cop but we all have to then take one step forward exactly the same time the vision requires people to come and what are nobody cops when it came time to choose middle schools parents were supposed to rank their top chicks rate before they did before every one chose their schools absent to survey out to the families he would been talking to to try the in sure that a group of them would choose as i ask together it was a simple survey monkey if enough people did yes they rank as i ask as one of their topics and they would be able to act as a collected people said yes the numbers were stunning and two doesn't fourteen there had been thirty six graters at as i ask and two does fifteen there would be a hundred and three that two hundred percent increase was almost entirely was kids did you think about yourself as in graters or did you think not my pause was because i was trying think a if that hat con to line did not no no the am not integrators am for dissent in t e school that was gwichkin mostly be diverse am but the not i that is not a framing or way o thinking about that it would have occur to me the time am nobody i talked to from ass i ask characterize what was happening there as integration the cures why in migration was on my minds the near city department of education was aware their schools were segregated it was also aware that these segregation is the most effective way to close the gap an achievement between black and white student but it did not want to mandate racial integration through zoning or school placements the city was trying to make integration happened through choice hoping to lure white families into segregated schools the school tours i went on for my own kids tho sparkle programs and a enemies that was the new approach to integration but can this work for white parents to to in to integration not because we have to or because it is the right thing to do that because it is a selling point because we get a dance studio and stem and a school that was hopefully diverse integration without talking about race the kind at a s o the did tike about i immediately a two thousand fifteen the first few weeks of school a senior named christen mans over to her class make cress and mumbles they are at a wat kits in the school and chis says oh ye a teacher warn me about that over the summer but ye tome of the to on be a lot of whit kits coming an french like kids from i per economic stations would prepared for that christen nods yet guess we were pared and then she turns to me to say i should have been ready for that we saw the parents on the tours last year s won the milk tho the hall be we never new was serious hat a whole group of cocks would coming of be s divers but whose take such a big change i that is a been prejudice i thing that i notice the big change his schools are more hisparics an bags with the few occasions i make the new go that came in all occasions take they try to me diverse diversethis was a word i heard over and over in the first few weeks of school diversity i love diversity saw that it does not whup i ti see other whips om diversity seemed to have two different definitions wat families would talk about all the diversity it as i ask and they were talking about black in his panic kids when kids of color noted the diversity they were referring to the new wat kids for lati kids a color this looked lot something they would already seen happen in their neighborhoods white families showing up in large numbers taking over stores familiar spots there is a word for that it is gentrification but i notice that no one was using that word about the school what was happening here was diversity that is how the adults talked about it diversity is a good thing something you are supposed to be o payees for the most part the kids work it was different for the parents some of them a specific advantages to the diversity mania blunt the to vice president of the piet as i ask he was excited having the new parents coming in in the diversity that pirceclarly becomes from the the news it'll call the new neighborhood we of interchanging in the neighborhood i is that we have a gentleman who his profession is fun raisin rob hansom the dad who started the survey monkey rob raises money for non profits and foundations for a living over the course of the year all her rob hansom referred to as tod hansom tad mansion mister hansom mania was the only on who went with the gentleman whose profession is fund raising the most common was just the guy who gets the money rob told the pier he was eager to raise money for the school the xenia this meant more resources at his own kids school his boys and all the kids could benefit she has brought on the challenge of take upon himself to raise fifty thousand dollars ism five zero with freezers after it yes fifty thousand dollars am which against a gain goes back to the whole it'll say a diversything new people were thinking outside the box as our pair i don't think that we were thinking that big they were definitely not thinking that big because the per was run by i mean her pandas and her cold president sudan postcard i me is not a gentlemen who fund raises she is a social work target the first time i went i me she was wring at teachers that said ism not spoiled my husband just loves me that way she is porterekan grew up in brooklet her husband marine is porterage and black and really does adore her he group an brooklet to the have one daughter one pitfall one person cat and one school i make it my businesses stick myself in her school me the new diversity he gave her pads what i shall in septtember the population that came another oh that is a little frighten and even the sollshu is split ah radioing known ah i shaw lot of white people with very high shillshie social economic backgrounds they have money and that is great but money tends to scare people and ism one of the people at scarce ism one of the people assuage because twists everything around and i don't that do not the i do not that am it'd rather have a dinner were people of different cultures bring their food and we share together then have somebody else cater that is how i feel you build community of a social worker that's my background and that is what i believe in i me was in her second year at the school the year before she put on community events teacher appreciation a spring carnival with face paying and hot does they raise the money here and there but i means vision for the pier was not really about fund raising the new parents though they wanted to be active in their new school and they were accustomed to supporting their kids schools by fund rising the two approaches c face to face at a tie meeting in october three more menu a an then s the every are yes y yo all a ti a a hole its e gaga hole there bet a dozen grown ups sitting on small classic chairs around a classroom pebble the pier executive cord principal human is he or to i mean leading and the principal o jumps in she says she wants a minute to share how much the new fund raising committee had raise far i may looks confused principal jump goes on to say the new sundries and committee is had a lot of success the total they they have raised a cordon to rob not eaten thousand dollars ah and then we just had a donation from a family a couple we ago more to the unanimous ah that they are going to get either five to ten ten grand and remember this is this his big money people seem ism clear what to do with their faces this is good news right but us what is the fundraising committee i me turns to her his band mortice a retired cop marine is also the treasurer of the pier because when he retired his wife told him he could not just but round at home marine shrug said i me does not seem to know anything about this new money said ma turns back to principal human really can we use that money quest get a that was of fashion of the taken a tax to this went cause i know already like but what is the ate o that that is he a question alegrapses eighteen thousand dollars rob has raised under the umbrella of per that is principal human i think but who whose do not e wholly a anywheres to in yet a me i i i we ne do o no a a o my o i talon a a i of ma row marine asks how can that money be access for mister in a groan who wants new him uniforms or mister lob to get his microscopes i me naans i in tat doubles robin more power to ha e but he tat an official member i i think that would makes it confuse dales for me he is a tie member because he is a parent e that part of the executive words i think that makes it that is public try he ha makes a tricky i mean in again o ta and they ai me not he c can bring o money o i i know i no principal human no repeats that she wishes rob had been able to make it she was hoping every one could be here and get on the same page about money but rob is chaperoning six great over night trip their la getting back one mam a wit woman who came in with the new group of six greater says look i know rob he means well o i a he is a professional oneeyet e yes or es red as he is kitty money we a bund rain you and i think that great but i do he she chi to in presses in to and know o noon he sort we wise we that he is not thinking about we we my i of know an as he really i a i i that is principal human oat this point every one seems to feel a little weird about how long they eve spent talking about a fellow parent who is not present in anyway it is money for the school were all for that we just been better communication i ma says yet it just usually money was by parents goes through the tie we can only talk about were to spend it you i said who has to say as if it is a collect e we the is en a we to whats an o the room he just got back on the six great trip he sits down and they all set to talk we need to start out some questions about money then mam from the funderisin committee says has worried about me recording and ask me to stop that i do not binders o t a redo to they let me say though i take notes ran apologizes and then explains a group of them have been meeting to raise money for the school the new dual language french program is expensive and they promise the principal they would help raise money to cover it they were just eager to help ran says they formed a committee he is really sorry he should have communicated and to ordinate better with the tie but good news sis it is going great some one has a contact with the french embassy a guy at the cultural services arm in new york and h says he wants to help cover the cost of new french teachers and books they have already tick dinneround ten grand it this point in my notes i wrote lots of looks beg money ran says the embassy suggested we do a fund raiser an event they can help here i wrote looks confuse mad nobody really talking i me says this fundraiser will be at the school though right and free for every one ran says yes good good she asks one more time free i just one measure every one can go lot of not ran says totally this is a community went for our community after about twenty minutes i my says were out of time guys i cannot tell if this is out of a professional commitment i me has to stick to the schedule or a personal commandment to getting out of that room before i came to less i ask i never sought much about the role of ties ever and as they has early on i had this feeling of oh a pet's actually critical to the success of an integrated school a per has a very simple democratic structure every parent hasn't equal vote smart it is i a built system to equalize power to help them make a budget together be decision sepriarities collectively or not we are luck ad a we have rob her who has really take at over fun is i try to bring it to the next level hero hereat our school collect it is another ate i i but and the whole collective thing is not really happening route last seems the new parents are still raising money separate from the ate and the communication proms do not seem to be resolved and some of the new parents have an idea the propose a form separation the ate and the people doing fund raising go ran says this way there be too organizations collecting money for es a yes thereould be too sort ways dollars arms one would be a community was the says a direct i at would be the utter side the community funds then there would be a separate organization that would go after grants and big donors up until this plain there seem to be mention bubbling under the surface between the new parents and the old parents but it was not really until this moment that the unsaid started to get said mostly by time's husband marine i tie lot of was feels dis noticing goods the fun rase imp which is my know that is what woks like you got have to school o but i for t gall mall e i go not yo the find for i no i we a where about the us o school well one were going to i don't not is very was to feel t was that is marine a white ma'am this new its or lota not marine is asking is this new money you are talking about is it just for the new french to a language program which is another way of asking is this money just for your is or is it for everybody ran says emphatically it is for everybody marine says really you me that tat that be my you big okay do ears join the a french embers ego a w wo by twoltwat tat that i tat b i i you say the fifty thousand be for eat community to si was wen a go me i hear what you're saying which is sound great why gait made not something about last meeting when filial e will we don't get at the cent we stool a matleader talking to rob i learned that the new separate fundraising arm he is talking about is actually a foundation they want a create a school base foundation at as i es the plan as to call it the brooking world project i asked rob why do you need another way to raise money but there is a there is a pitied most people have heard of a school pitied why do you need a separate organization at no the pitied yet the probably easiest way to explain it is to not think about it from the school side u to think about it from ah the potential done side a basic idea t were following is that the the titian that internationals as we want to do existence day and we want a do theatre and we go when we find a downer who loves theatre and loves the french language and loves the idea that kids who never spoken french and at no exposure get the chance to go ah an compete actually against some of the most establish schools in the city and a do not a dis loves at li got love it i love giving that kind of opportunity to is i ma to cover all that because i thing it is that important ah if that money goes to the pier you could have a situation of pier says or remembers the tie say i do not know that we really the theatre program ism not sure i think that we should be using those dollars to do ever why or s now normally you real to say well do not er intend is what it is you should probably use it towards what it was intended for i i normally in another finders an in meaning in non profits there is a basic kind of morality of an on profit to say if it do not e gives you it to you to do something you should try to do that do not intends in important part of it ti for the trust that is established rob says because the pier is a democracy it makes things complicated the very thing i saw as the strength of a tie one parent one vote to rob that s a problem for fund raising parents come and go and changed their minds about what is important a private do note antes ability and rob is trying o raise money for the kind of programming that was available at his sons wealthy elementary school at that school to was coo president of the pier and the previous year his pitied pulled in close to eight hundred thousand dollars eight hundred thousand dollars money that paid for after school for ramming and ballroom dancing cast art music a garden eight hundred thousand dollars for a school that is seventy five per cent weight and serves the tiny fraction of the porkies in the district there ain't enough wealthy parents at us a es to raise thy ken of money that year rob held raise eight hundred thousand dollars the yes they ask pitied raised two thousand rob it was trying to be creative a foundation was a way for his new school to catch up the school leadership the principal was behind the idea is demon told me she saw the foundation as a past to equity an access more resources meant they would be able to provide all kids with opportunities say a school trip to francs but the parent leadership they found it annoying i mean new the new parents for trying to help the school but she city liked the school she felt in she was being saved against her will play there new she said should not we be the ones helping them she was fine with them bringing an ideas but she did not understand why they had not brought them to her first they had not thought to consult her she said to me multiple times why r they coming up with all these private plans and meeting in secret committees you were pissed about that boldly ye that was involve n me why were you angry about that because here i am trying to build something with the school why did not you just involved me why did not you just tell me about it i felt it was a secret nicer was offer was not ism invested in the school clearly hat proven to you invested in the school and you could not tell us that you wanted to sunrise in a different way rob and the new parents did tell the principal that they wanted to fund raise in a different way then i me felt what about the rest of us she felt the pitied was ignored at that last meeting i ma went quiet she told me she just felt enraged and then embarrassed for feeling enraged i guess i just through a tantra and i busted i one of your part of it which is not right but i think again in the moment i just felt i was hart i you throat it was the tantrum thing i saw was at did not ting a tantrum no now that was not a tantrum i could have been lot worse when i was really really thing to restrain myself ye i really was that was really under control really really unto control i was not but it was reallyreally inly control i asked was there another time tantra yo had home o my husband that is what town my tantrum it was tents among the parents but this is a school for children did it matter if the adults were not getting along or who controls which pot of money yes yes it did that is coming up after the break b b t chico when our programmed continues to smart con li from y re glass to day's program nice wite parents ho i off you wat is tolling the story of parents and the influence over the working one public school public school brook wen called s i as the school for in a national studies hot a picks up now i wish you left off the school you re moved forward job's fund raising committee moved forward with the french embassy to plan the fund raiser it was now being called a gala the pier move forward with parent volunteers to pain a spring carnival it was being called the spring carnival quiet resentments talked in place here's ham is tacking on a phone one night i mes cold president on the pitied sudan masker she told me she was worried the school was changing in ways that were damaging to the community sudan is whit herself but she did not come in with the new parents when she started her son was one of the only way kids in the school now sudan fell they were all being written into a narrative that was not true that as i ask was a bad school before and now that the new white families had arrived it was being turned around it did not nod a able i think it id something that even my child picked u o a ate li a very different it at er cling among hem the in e a a parent i ad thrill again ta he a can they our poor struggling school that and possibly make it on a ton without their money in their vision i and we did not all keep at that i early the hate what do you feel a this was a long conversation the upshot she's not happy but the way the new parents are behaving it was true a new narrative was taking hold at es i ask it felt the kids were talking about it all the time but it was in the air and the kids were starting to pick up on who was value in why in the canvateria i her middle school er saying the french kids could kill some one and they get away with it upstairs in the high school i hear kids complain all the attention as shifted to the new middle schooners we are being pushed aside an down on the library i met three six rate boys white boys new to less a s there steady from plant soccer and looking very small against their huge back packs these boys even at eleven years old hey have absorbed the same messages that us i yes was not good before m it was a bad school the age would not pay mention and they had garterlike on out every little thing and i bet they learned very little and now and now but yes now this generation with us i think we are doing a lot better and i think that work learn on much faster page he and his friends there turned the school around that is when he is learning is kenned wonder the top choices already in tee the book when you are applying to they'll schools you get a book shorter on statuses in stuff and i think the schools actually t really high up in the statuses nobody calls it the book on statuses they call a directory of schools with info in roman numbers for different schools scores and special programmed but i love they calls it the book on statuses because this is what happened at less a es the school had a bad reputation among white families and then suddenly it was in demand it is status had change because of the white kids e powerful draw for white families into any school is other white families once you have a critical mass of white kids you passed what one city calls a bliss point this is a real thing researcher study how many white kids are needed at a school to make other white families feel comfortable choosing it that number the bliss point is twenty six per cent that fall white families were crowding the school tours at less a es not because the escort had improved the newscores had not even come out yet but because the other white families made them feel blissfully comfortable of course the thing that mad the new white parents comfortable coming as they us in the first place was the promise of a french programmed they want a french and they got french now all the six seventh eighth and ninthraters a learning french it was not a true duel language programmed were kids learned in french for half the day or whatever that first year most of the french was happening in the after school programmed you sent up for regular after school stuff culinary or soccer drama and it would be conducted in french we area er y is a wen the at a trial and it is sweet the kids are on stage were herring the play they wrote in french we'll said they having fun that i can't help feeling there is something off balance about this most of the kids doing this drama programmed seems to be needed french speakers but not all french a six grater named my es standing to the side of the stage stripped in hand waiting for her line mess la the we a casadtya e sain ye fly even even in the plating of in practicing you know the he dines o sea alive son time whence yourself o french a class sit on yo san and do you figure it outer as a li a hes still she is excited she is grinning watching the other kids on stage she hanging out writhe friend cons starts my aunt gets up to deliver her lines oh oh he did wrong a i wat of did y just say aunt in then areas test what ate the constancy a native french speaker tells my you set the wrong thing constancy corrects her pronounces it for her aka you as you yes is i cant see my says i cannot and her friend says it'll do it for you it'll get ill just s a you no you lady learning another language is not new to my mad as be sabecan a non perish and naan french yessed to hosing say language in same time ram when the new way parents asked for a dual language french programmed at es i ask principal humane said yes essay s was supposedly an international school but she told me they did not really have a lot of international programming switching a good idea to her but there was no schoolkids to beat about it or consensus the community did not decide what if they had more than a third of the families hat as i es are his panic what if the dual language programmed was punish for arabia ten person of the students speak arabia if they had made a difference nice he essay a had a dual language arabia programmed my would be teaching constants how to read her lines she would be the one explaining the cultural references and teasing her friend about her terrible accent she would be the one translating the teachers stage directions there was money for a french programmed which meant that sea es french had value arabia did not punish did not that is something my is learning at school along with her french scriptfrom the very beginning i me and the others had insisted on three things from the new parents and the fundraising committee that the gala fundraiser they were planning with the french embassy would number one the open to every one number two take place at the school and number three be free then four weeks before the gala the p t e asked for an update and apparent name debt showed up mam to a new six crater part of job's fundraising committee i will start with the fact that i had a nice conversation wit b but missus rest is i frees in the so deb volunteered early on to help organized the part and she tells every one i met with our partner cut breeze at the french embassy and the event cannot be at the school the embassy will not be able to draw the supporters to proclaim it will be at the cultural services building on the upper eat side and can forty five minutes away i apologize if i say these you gig orgy now but i didn't know some of the in faso was god wit the event it is really it is the event it is not really hour obit oh it is the even that is sudan with the o murices leans forward elbows on the table oi me is not here she knew the meeting would be almost entirely about fundraising and she sitting this one outmaurice is now concentrating on rob who turns to debt and says no in what sense is it there event they make the rules she ss with our input but there are certain things that are not flexible the biggest thing is nobody will be allowed in at the door you have to be on a list

have a lot of practising new york city has one of the most aggregated school systems in the country white press here have very little practise sharing public schools maybe this is all to be expected white parents will charge ahead will sometimes be careless secretive or entitled in response parents of color will sometimes be cautious or distrustful defensive these are well established patterns

other white parents hereabout downstairs a van sudan i me pitied president on a bench by herself she is near the band drinking wine looking a little dumb struck i ask if she is coquet this is something else she says and then she adds it is just hard to explain how this is a public school fundraiser when the founder of america public education force man lead out his vision for public schools back in the day he wrote his horse round massachusetts podiemtopotium and his pitch was common schools would make democracy possible they would bind us to one another and doctrine us give us the kills and tools we would need for democratic living public schools he believed would be the great equalizer rich and poor would come together and develop what he called fellow feeling and in doing quote obliterate factitious distinctions in society for that is a happen you need everyone in the same school together at as i asked they have gotten that far every one was in the same school together but there was no equalizing we can be in the same school together and not be equal just we can be in the same country together it is not enough after the gala money poured in to as i us and more white families and roll their kits at the school but in the years after that there was a backlash and as i ask changed in ways that made rob question himself he wondered if she would made mistakes he told me he the they all wanted the same thing for the gets he just did not know not knowing the happens a lot with white parents most of us we do not understand the buildings we walk into we do not know what came before i looked into the history of this school and i learned that this was not the first time white parents showed up here white parents have been involved all along it'll log back to the very beginning of this school half a century ago doing the same kinds of things id just seen it happens again and again white parents welding their power without even noticing a guy wandering through a crowded store with the huge back pack knocking things over every time he terns where is man believed public schools would make us e school but it does not work i must er how to fix that but i want to way out the story the whole story of this one america public school because what i am sure of is that in order to address in equality in our public schools we are going to need a shared sense of reality at the very least it is a place to start ponajofo all that mission as we politics up in the other episodes in mysteries nice white parents his produced by our colleagues to be made the serial

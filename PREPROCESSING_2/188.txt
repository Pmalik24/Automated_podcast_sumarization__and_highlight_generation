a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in today's epic some of the show if ye prefer a beep version you can find that at our website this america life doth work from w b easy chico it is this america life ism show coal sitting in for my glass this is not a story about bicycle theft it is a story about a counterintuitive impulse exhibited by the human species in which a lot of bicycles happened get stolen the first bike belonged to a physical therapist named carry helping her is was in settle back in two thousand fifteen she wrote her bike to work always locked it up securely always and wen she came down to get it at the end of the day it was gone she felt about this how you might imagine mad like i you on my bikini know how mi get to get home and it is laid and i tired and just frustrate it stay all that the cops were remarkably responsive came right away they were all deeply pessimistic said all the usual things you are not likely to get it back we get reports this all the time usually nothing we can do unless something happens carry was not sure with that man until something did happen she was at work the next day tending to her physical therapy patients only checking her phone now and then between appointments and i remember thing the stacks from the number that i did not know that just said something i may have found your bite an it what do i do with that i do not know who you are is the joke is this i town it was the thing the i crossing my mind a lot is as the some cam would were you trying to mathematically figure in your head how the scam might have worked if it was the scam and then i soft know how they would know it with me this is the thing that i kept find of figure out would they steal my bike an the know it me and then ask me for money and then they eonian and they give me my bike back and they tat no hundred dollars mare something which carry says that would been find with hers better than having no bike anyway know how to respond put the phone down examined more hips and shoulders and knees came back to another text that was your bi stolen i think i may have found that y writ la and son lie a es is is the same guide you for questions and omethike was it was stolen who are you and then i think that point he probably responded and tad i was looking for a bike for my wife i was looking for bike for my wife and the sad came up on credulity real questionable this is the guy who was testing dirk ta grout works in marine construction excicelist himself by questionable he means the ad was poorly written listed the bike for way less than it should have cost a couple of blood pictures taken at night nothing whole hell tikes pictures at night i did look in som growling i found began be it is a site where people can register their bikes and report them stolen as carry had done he said i saw that you posted on bikini that and oath body now this is starting to sound a little but moral feds but i thought no idea who he is an i think we not probably around my lunch rate and he told me that he was mad begin to go get the bite and as i waiting was i and i remember him they n mi the can kind of last about that am getting a little a deal and i an tatting l pard of me as grass that is all that problem somebody f ye wants to do that by like a you not i why d youth my want a do that and be careful lie i that would be the scares thing it is noway i would ever you that dirk did do it arranged to meet the guy selling the bike except when he got to the appointed spot unexpectedly it was three guys to more than him he gives the biker once over careful tho check out the serial number when she got from carry and sure enough it is hers is when i had no idea what i was doing o i a a have let is piece of paper in my hand with the serial number and a looking t these three gs in him hold an allay key in why he takes out his phone and subtly dials nine one one and the call not go through no signal i i lie knows i eh that was the cob's us they are on their way and as if there were ever any doubt as to the providence of the by one of the guys at the very mention of the police just takes off running hedsgoots off another is two guys they are both sit there a little agitated they do not know film lying and amidst settles pretty steep som think you dot maybe i could esparto kick one of these guys down the hill spartan kick as hie got on o when him to do wit the other one but this i ism tall but i'vehad my asking many times at my friend will tell him not a very good five and then after several long moments with the three of them just kind of staring at each other as though bidding farewell to a couple of drinking bodies for the evening dirk says well guys you knower and count of a stale made which s can it take it through the bike in the back of my try and than e now calls it is your by have i where should i meet you o i a i just bethought i that he palls up then call my by o an i hi deny the curry go the c pa a yo on i do not y the pay meet we i nits at ss really crazy to me that li the night before my heartbroken my bicastol and and the next night bike can mi my by home already it just to we married which brings me to wet the stories about the fact that dirks t actions well seeming to come totally natural to him made no sense from the outside even to the person who directly benefited from those actions carry's brain could not stop trying to make sense of it even as she wrote away that night you you just ad this huge an making thing for me that was incredibly kind and ism very you do ma let before of me and a coss it me sit do not know or there's words be wanted how how just unusual it is yes would somebody really do this but they goes t be on my by back for me and then bring it the me why would somebody do this why there is got to be a catch some i catch a o a but there was not dirk just does tell this if he is driving and he sees a cyclist with the flat tire the idiot that stops on the side of the road i you me help ting as i fuck off no we know oke e me know he likes helping people he can still picture how happy carry looks when he drop the bigot she was jest locking i mean stood absolutely dilated and i seeing all this emotion on her face i ism not a very e emotional ti i but i my i felt it just a deep sense of accomplishment and it felt o just good that was said a very specific feeling it is it is the same feeling i now get when i come home from being gone for work for week and my son jumps down the stairs to of me it is a of is great i have the much sounds yer describing appreciation yah ye y eye i us said that very well could be you now just feeling appreciated might have been the trigger the trigger to make you one a keeper in behead the trigger to make me one keep doing that and he did keep doling it the fore too long he recovered a bike for a eye from colorado who had just moved o town carry the guy was very grateful to have his bareback then there was the college student who but dirk a six pack ovine pier after he rescued her bike for her dirk does not really drink dear though the systems ad administrator who mailed him an envelope of cash which was not even the nicest part of it for dirk i had his thank you a him a half for in my office for a long time his methods were pretty consistent always started with obsessively scrolling sites crimes lest and offer up to see what bikes were for sale and then cross referencing those against the stolen bikes on bike insects then he would message the person selling the stolen by and says interested in being it sometimes he would give the cops heads out have them waiting near by to swoop in at just the right moment other times he just confidently and with an almost easy calm say something he ism not accusing you stealing the bike i just know it stolen you may have stolen do not care and they would dopily skudofv took him ten recoveries before he really felt he knew what he was doing after the twentieth one a settle police detective who specialized and property crime gave dirk his directed line told him to always call and arrange for back up ahead of time that sting thetwentieth one was significant in a lot of ways actually was not just a bike that was a home invasion the thieves grabbed everything they could get their hands on dirk is mentally cracked to that case one of the officers on duty that night looked at dirk and asked him the perennial question w held you doing this a i just feels really good no to help these people has a cot interesting your robin hood is now robin hood robs from the rich and gives to the poor i guess you are that man and that was tat me that was it i i bike that man wit m home it was sticky enough tot i stark people calling him theater bike bat man bike the resold bat man on roll against thieves it is a they call him tea the bike bat make bat man you are in battle and i think brine and the shuttle times broke the story followed by local deviant radio outlets ow the newspapers and magazines an all of the accounts dirk stayed anonymous he only decided do unmask himself for this story cause he is not doing it any more he says he just has not had time for anything since his kits came along but the news worthiness of it was that some one would go very far out of his way to retrieve property that was not his for people he did not know has the whole world had the same reaction is carry helping her the first person dirk helped who was mentioned in one of the magazine pieces how the each is in the article he i i think she thought i was a weird on a i e deny bike course the whole thing seems a lot less weird if you are dirk to root from his perspective he figured out how to solve this problem and once he figured it out he could not not solve it because no one else was doing it he was somebody is got to do it a kind of knew what to do and it was hard for people to people just did not know i go i do what to do if you find our big stolen on coexist actually cannot think of a better way to spend your time on this planet and to identify something that is vexing someone else or lot of some one ease's and to put yourself into that gap between them and the solution to danarsho and ti tell yo about some remarkable people who do that and why they do it and how it goes or down do for them stay with us there is the same ice that really stuck of a lot of a sere f to show he might have seen it it is the photo of strollers baby strollers at a train station in poland in short these polish moms anticipating a problem that you craning refugee mothers might have when they crossed the border clutching their little kids started leaving strollers for them at different points of entry in the food they are all lined up on the train platform some fancy some not some knew some with warn tires each one a polish family thinking about what could possibly be helpful when everything else is falling apart and providing it another problem that war has yielded you have probably heard is the lack of access an russia to real accurate information about what is going on brutality of the war essentially the russia propaganda to bubble tamping down on public opposition which is what act one of to days shows about and it is about some one on a personal mission to solve that problem recalling the fact cold call to action its from produce rely eagle polish notes spent the first thirteen years of his life in the eceses are he knows how complicated i can be to live in a world with limited information this was lithuania in the ladies and what polis remembers about living in that world is the distrust and the haziness you had your suspicions a creeping sense that there was something off about the news you were hearing but there was no way to know for sire and no one around you knew either after paten invaded you crane polis reached out to friends in russia to talk about the war these were educated people well red people but the russia version of what was happening made his blood run cold the story they would heard was that russia was just trying to help with the genocide there was get aside tho russia people going on all the tine and we need to take out their moment i we people will not you tat thegn go on killing russia people in the we have this need tiny operation military operation going on the we just taking off the on in the world ruffians knew there were no pregnant mothers dying on genes no levelled cities no did civilians at all some of them told tell me stories about ruffians bringing in food in inclosing to oucranias it was a whole parallel universe of information constructed and policed by paten polis believes the foundations of that universe are more fragile than they look that if the ruin people could really see no what was happening in their name queen's patemptan village might crumble some one needed to do something ruffians could understand the real horror of the war they were fighting and then one day plus was sitting in a meeting and his fun began torus it was a friend calling to say that he had an idea about how they might solve this ruffians do not know about the war problem since pots what is funny about russia say i don't there is nothing funny about russia to me is i they got the see nimbus public you just go on line and you cannot get the hold t at this members we can call them as they talked the two began to piece together a plan what if they built a web sight where you pushed a button and got the name and telephone number of some one somewhere in russia russia speakers from outside paten sealed universe could call in tell russia people one by one person to person all about what was going on polis works an advertising he spent his life trying to convince people to do something they do not currently feel a need to do he knew that hearing and authentic human voice making a passionate days can be a very powerful way to alter some one's behavior you men wat ten city has a lot of down its jo the way this hearing it the prom mason whose genie is much more persuasive than reading it on the begin see is much more likely to to to to get through still polys was not sure that this was a good idea many russia speakers outside the country were really angry he worried in just pe creating a tool for people to shout at each other polys himself was struggling with his feelings about the russia people do you see them as victims or do you see them as complicit i difficult to distinguish those two things it difficult to distinguish those these things aim ism trying to to put all the sympathy i have into this is it coming from the fact that i thing that gonna cat e bridge and ism cynical i to do i truly have sympathy polys did not have a clear answer what he knew was that the scheme had at least the potential to help shift the tide he put is outs aside and decided to go forward the polar you can come up with all problems you want you can make a problem that do not exist but if you do not do anything tithing will happen ply says that he and his colleagues worked around the clock for five days until the website call russia went live about a weak and a half into the war the landing page featured a large yellow button which random my generated russia telephone numbers and the side was an immediate hit polys says he long to thirty two thousand calls in the first two days still it was not until hate on launch day that polys himself was able to sit down and try out this idea he pressed the yellow button then called the number the appeared on his screen the phone was answered by a ma i told them who i am and and a a a and he stop shouting immediate and i i said i do not wish and anything wrong adjust an ordinary person trying to connection people in russia and i said do what is happening there and he shouted at me they a i remember that the a vividly he shouted me they are killing just there and i trying to save them and he said he cased me any hang up the fence that was my face conversation a few calls later polys heard the voice of a woman what i fanon could most of women i will a will told humanly to me but that late she was say the lady yelled at me i do not know probably seven minutes and she was saying do who i am i sin of course i do not i do not how it lo i do not know which which sedan loin goody tell me please and and she was a ism the voter of cutin and now ism in voting my father to take ye of you now i know she is not well guess she is not a tot of foin o gay yo cannot be that coincidence or i it got it but she started play her joker is tad the this t an h who was yo find the but the water in was saying madam why are you doing that i truly genuinely won i talk with e about what is a happening in n in you grand ant cannot can you tell me what about she was that puli says that many of the calls have been those unreceptive hostile but then every once in a while there is a different kind of call but the man who answered the pone and at first seemed quite friendly sop spoken a polite and wen give just introduced myself i told am doing and that why one talk about and and a e kept going with me nicely but at the moment he understood what is about she he shed up but i could feel he is there caulis went forward told the man about the war all the terrors that pulls had seen on teethe poured out of him she he did not pick i was saying those things for probably four or five minutes he was not talking of words and when i finish interestingly he said good by you knot it touch me he felt he see me to say good by a yo don't a which is such a pol i things to do self a know you heard in his silence what ye e e hip it person breathing but most probably something the hear very clearly is a fer how i was shocks tat fer has a sound a conte i con tell he what the sound o say but cant hear that e mi busy the day we spoke i watched plus make a bunch of calls to strangers in different parts of fresh e what struck me was the tedium it felt very lazar gala littlecall tell a marketing a maun number there were lot of dead and oh voice male but every once in a while pall scapthro at the being that sense wit pales year we this ya won't your program it was when your we and we be times was same so stand me i cotreficte of li boss owe to crank we is wast issomewhan pitigulary t o sh away was sister say he hang up the those he says he knows everything o case that was not a good call pals makes calls these several times a week he spends hours on the found sometimes he gets people the quiet man listeners who contact but mostly pula says people are screaming and oddly he thinks that those calls area the best to me screaming people iavsonly the once this we needs to talks when he mean for the these was these a the supporters of what is going on a i in e it it is is displeasing and and in and is for me to have that nose con the station was as a paction that i had the settle of people he nice to have the conversation wit those people bat is the go is not about having in u s is a a some one people that apaswayte at that they i a goo thing in t in crane to and a stand that they not dong the thing a polis is realistic about what this approach will are confess he says about seventy five per cent of the russia populations up ports prudent and those people are not in a suddenly take to the streets but he figures he might edge them a little that when they see their neighbors protesting instead of reaching out to the police to let them know they might pass ask themselves if that is really the best thing to do that is why even when some one is yelling plus tries persevere emotionally how hard is it for you to withstand the screaming at i suborn is is very had is is a amogashas i donknow how to i e i a you read a travel somewhere ye in i it in n in in defend weld do you ever feel its not worth titan you cannot do it more not up they say people ho going a you a fighting in e branches people who is dying here people kill daily this than people kill to day the red li stay the bet li how i gather to a cols polis told me he would never power sure whether anything he was doing made even a wit of difference but even if these calls were a drop of water for a forest fire coulis still thought it was important to try most of the things people a see most probably will have they little or no empty all that the day was doing flows together mi pa a flows together with can an children the there is doing flowers was ucranan children will stop the did rush in in crate i most probably not but that sends of people coming together in explicitly trying to do something even if that futile makes us all of a wrong poult says since the website launched they have been tracking the country is where people were calling from he told me that at first calls for mostly from where he was with a wanna but soon he and is colleagues noticed it was spreading the idea hopping from one country to the next until they saw that russia speakers from all over the world we are reaching out to the people inside prudence bubble they would seen the same problem polished and they were all trying their best toes all that with him a we eagle as one of the producers of orphan a to to unto others on the first day of the war there were thirty visitors to the and key crane on the ninth day of the war there were none no paying visitors that was the day washington post reporter chain o grade an a couple of her colleagues went there to meet the keepers chant had been wondering about the people in crane who were still working while the country had been under we eye not just military but every day workers pharmacists grocerystore employs it is the same thought a lot of us have had about essential workers during the pandemic except in this case they we literally bombs going off around them the wanted to know what it was to do their jobs now under what a probably the most extreme circumstances possible they went to the zoo in the afternoon for a few rushed hours before curfew chant said was eerie the giant colorful raff statue at the entrance after they had just passed through several check points to get there the winding paths were virtually empty the zoo keepers were keeping the animals inside hardly because of the cold and also because the animals could be killed if they came out for some exercise the wrong moment the zoo is right near a military facility that might be targeted by russia forces they were worried about arrant missiles and tod about fifty staffers out of the usual three hundred seventy five had stayed behind to look after the animals as chazan what was behind their decision to stick it out the ones i spoke to did not make it sound a decision it was not an option the staff members really felt to responsibility to stay that that would be the way that they would spend the war cause there is no one else right right if they left what do you think would happen would there be anybody that would leap over the zoo wall no the animals would die four thousand animals be locked away in their pens an enclosures slowly starving to death if the hydration did not get them first and not just anyone can do this job in take special skill in knowledge the different animals dietary needs some of the animals need to live at different temperatures than others it is a hefty enough task during peace time and of course lots of aspects of the job a different in a wars own first of all the zoo keepers are mainly living at the zoo which they normally would not happy to i an the staff move some of their family is ten and the head of the zoo curio canton moved his elderly mother into the zoo with him to in order to care for her and the animals is it that they cannot live at home or they just thought it was safer at the to it is both in some cases may be they live in a part of town that could eventually be cut off ore mad very difficult to get between the zoo and home in which case they would be separated from each other and it is also that some of them live in neighborhoods that have already been targeted by strikes are they sleeping with the animals every night as staff member has been sleeping with the elephant force the elephanatoo comfort him because elephants are really sensitive in general they also have enormous ears and really good hearing the booms and the sirens have been especially upsetting to him to the point that he is been put on sedatives and at night he was apparently waking of walking around exuviating signs of extreme stress and they were worried about him that one of the staff members has volunteered to just stay in there with him and when he get stressed at night they speak to him an a kind of calming voice they feed him his favorite snacks of apples and things that and just kind of talk him down after any booms until he can go back to sleep some of the staffers in their families occasionally sleep in an aquarium that still under construction underground bunker link chant told me you could zee were one day hopefully will be glass in fit c would right now there all kinds of cots with pillows and sleeping bags on them chazan imagine how nice and cool it will be to hang out down there during the summer months if an when they can finish building it during the town the zoo the zoo keepers hand a van an apple and showed had a feet horas we elephant with she trouble they visited tony the gorilla as also been agitated not because of the explosions necessarily hes had no interaction with guests and apparently misses at lot at visibly excited when his hammer finally showed up also spat out his lunch all over one of china's colleagues for some reason tithe n in the administration building one of the animal handlers was feeding a brand new baby leader his incredibly small soft delicate thing specially compared to the chaos hit was born into they named him by roc tar which as a kind of furnish drone the grains are defying against the ruffians they're thinking naming his sibling javelin chain asked the zookeepers which of the animals were the least concern about all the explosions and sirens the crocodiles they said and the alligator all they cure about his eating but as interesting as you found the animals it was really the people she was there to learn about one of the zookeepers who interested her most was van ribchanko hostile come mess to the you from home on his bike and i was interested when i saw him because he was feeding a banana to it draw and the array sirens had just gone off we could hear booms in the background and both he and the rights just did not react at all they just continued with the feeding and he was just being really gentle and sweet with the drag and we were all kind of looking round should we take cover do you think it ka and they were were judging to keep meeting this banana and i asked him why are you still here hes a young man of fighting age his thirty three most guys his age have probably volunteered for the forays are doing something were directly ofrelyded two the war effort but he did not see it that way at all i mean he said that his responsibility is the drags the deer and horses at the zoo and his job is a public service and that is his contribution to the to the fight to the war effect ye he really saw i he did which is something chicanes seen a lot of she says the people whole chosen to stay and continued doing their jobs an in the fighting all of them see what they are doing as the roll in the defending of e crane after all along with staving off the day to day attacks they also need to preserve any pockets of normal see they can the things they had before the invasion and that will means still having is to when the war ends one day you can real china's article for the washington post about that keep zoo at washington postal come coming up being a voice for the voiceless impossibly the most mob and yet literal meaning of that phrase that is in a minute from chico public radio one our programmed continues it is this america life ism scion coal an frier glass today's program will some one had to do something stories about some one's stepping up taking it upon themselves to tackle some problem larger small for the greater good or just for a discreet few case who else is going to we have reached back three of our show act three one last thing after i go all the people tackling problems in the show up to this point identified themselves what needed to be done in this next story the person jumping into the fray never even conceived of the thing that he was ultimately asked to do by somebody else producer of viva to cornfield explains this all started a few years back as a joke in strange circumstances yes but definitely hots not meant to be taken seriously yes a junk atsolet junk i and i i i thing that literally this is bill edger the private investigator in queenslind australia and graham the time of the joke bill had been looking into some financial matters for a client named graham a at the time i did not

occasionally he is as to reveal something darker w t this one recent client who hired bill to confess that he would been having an affair with a neighbor for the past two years the effect of which

to cornfield one of the producers of ourself cake for a funny thing happened when we were already at the theatre this last story's a counter example of sorts were of be forgiven for thinking did somebody has to do something ere anyway that what a lot of people thought in this case hollagoffy wall has the story here is what happened a group of people went to a move theatre near loss angels to see the lost city it was a seven pram showing but the projector was broken every one in the audience was stuck waiting ten minutes twenty and then a woman from the audience walked down to the front of the theatre in front of everyone started doing stand up wo mi hanpeopleoinin any single moms in the house she says there is short clips of this on line she is in a bees dress long straight hair weaving her arms all over the place trying to project her voice to the back of the theater the act is chaotic and hard to follow she is pretty all over the place on she marry she does voices she chance maker san on yo ai until bully and she sings no the is er people who showed up to see sand bullock and changing teen roam around in the jungle instead they got this i wants her audience members who are not happy about that switch one of them says a woman has decided to try her stand up out on us it is not good another one says i want a crawl out of my skin and die in one of the videos posted on line you can hear some one in the audience actually interrupt her act to yell put us out of our misery sh to her i note woman's response this is what got me she says you window here en eye do you want to come down here try to entertain people as if entertaining everyone in the theatre was a job some one obviously have to do this to welcome through the thinking of nominating yourself to be the one to do that ism very awoken i have caplin calking to people i out et her bat a crowd o i ut nobody all going i on my gold credit can gate everyone the woman's name is tiffin king she is forty two years old retina lives in less angels she is one eight year old daughter she does many things waitresses sings she does college on line sometimes to stand up and the way tiny king ended up performing unsolicited comedy that night there is the story on the in her net and then there is her story which is different shiny says she took her daughter to the movies that night o for whence onion party and i sunn only a i i mig beg my go her ha wen a gan o like a pi on will been part every one was just sitting around tiny says waiting she turns to her daughter and says would it be funny if i go introduce the move ism with the theater do it her daughter says tiny gets up in front of everyone hello welcome to the theater we are glad to have you the show will be starting shortly and then she was just getting ism a comedian but i do hope you all have good night and she sits down but then there is still waiting and waiting and nobody's doing anything si tiffin gets up again desmids ism mi will find out was going on she goes down to the lobby a guy tells her the projector's broke in they are working on it she told them we are sweating crazy in there the guy says they would work on the a c then tiffin says she went back to the theatre and walked up front shut to tell everyone what was going on she said the projector's broke in they are working on it they know or photon her t they will try to gat the a c back an won for taking o couple of e fine any a o i can't your comment can help can gonna sure an i dot only we water hesitating because i to help i we can happen to be people happy wo the to can and what did it feel when you started telling jokes the we i would a my random queen yo i would as try to thing to gather on queen it would not be a pop for my daughter she went with a truly random collection of jokes and from titan's perspective it was going fine people were laughing laughing everything a going everything to great an help evil he maple me i y we no put a cot of her memory it was only the next day that tiny learned some of her audience had not appreciated being subjected to an unwanted comedy show but for me knowing that tiny started as a person who as trying to deliver information about the move does tot change things she was the one person trying to get answers to a problem that a whole room full of people shared she was trying to pass on information and it turned in to this because this is tiny i there is what i was thinking when tiny recounted this experience to me i was thinking about when i was at the air port and i was instructed to stand in a line for a desk that had no person at it i stood there anyway a long line of other people said there any way too quietly except for one woman who could not bear it who was actively loudly shouting to every one and no one walking by that we needed help i kept looking down ism not with her but i was also glad for her because ultimately she got some one to help us to tell us that we actually needed to go to a different desk where there was a person where the pain her was working and the yelling woman she led the way we all followed her my point is the person who takes it upon themselves to do something they do not always do it in the way you would they are not perfect but neither are we waiting in mine for the desk with no person or for the move that is not starting l when you are sitting in a theatrfule of people who are not doing anything does it is it as mystifying to you that people would not want to do something as it is to some one me that you would want to do something we all ta happened i flashed back in my find her moment an awful when i think it a five clot but we had the going another room talking o the clot mi thing i sing a or for often t i i o t o am early age and my grandmother mat rock air and i we men wen ti long giving o e cad my ad e i can piano you got them ball o i do not think that that people it down thing ah e could thing long wit e my think hat we all have to on perfect o mi an or that i have perfect bet in in an a pain and con me people on i cernsituation we me people ego getter any people the e o poem it we a all the problem and be helpful in a moment i asked did she consider that this was as situation where maybe no one needed help nobody needed to do anything tiffin said no the thought never crossed her mind which i think is probably an important part of being a person who rushes to be helpful e person who at you cannot ask yourself that question cotton tote too a jolt is one of the producers for so enigma anal youminc tea a ego an

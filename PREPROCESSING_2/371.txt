and now without further ado i will answer your questions and as always i will strive to be as thorough as possible as clear as possible and as concise as possible our first question is about obtaining from thoughts and in answering this question were on skirt right up against the topic that have covered before on the podcast which is obsessive compulsive disorder is a very serious disorder and ye can have a range of severity but people with true of d suffer a lot from obsessions these are intrusive thoughts and compulsions which are the behaviors typically associate with those thoughts i think it is really important that we define of d really clearly that we can make sure that we are talking about intrusive thoughts and the desire to obtain from thoughts versus of d and where there might be some overlap there the functional definition of of d that really pertains to the disorder obsessive compulsive disorder of d as opposed to yen we call people neurotic or we set you have of d or ism of d about this or of d about that that is become kin common us one teethe acronym of d but true of d is a situation in which the engaging in a particular compulsive behavior does not s serve to reduce the intensity or the frequency of the sessions in fact it makes it worse so a the typical thing that we hear these days is oh you are o c d or hero c d or shes seed or ism o s d now if some one is o c d in that sense case an not the the clinical disorder but seeding the sens that young their they are really clean there really fastidious they need everything perfect however that person can achieve some level of calm and comfort that is fairly long lasting if everything's clean in perfect well then that is not obsessive compulsive disorder this is really important to understand as we venturing to answering the question about intrusive thoughts and the desire to abstain from certain thoughts a person with true o c d well keep cleaning and cleaning or washing their hands or or arranging things at perfect right angles but the more they do it the more they're anxiety goes up a person who has more typical a cash we do not relieved have a language for this nowadays unfortunately but the sort of person that is extremely particular they need things a certain way and there very driven to resolve things and do things to make sure that things are done in a certain way or handled in a certain way well if that person can experience relief from engaging in let us say exercise or from cleaning right you say you are s d about exercise well but if exercising for an hour or even two hours in the morning make somebody really calm the rest of the day and they do not need exercise well then they are not necessarily true o c d they do not surely have a disorder related to exercise however if they are exercising for two hours in the morning and than they find they cannot concentrate on another things and there desire to exercise just increases an increases and becomes intrusive for them disrupting their quality of life throughout the day well then that is falling in there the umbrella of what we call a true disorder s we want a high that because the question is about a desire to abstain from thoughts and the question is in your discussion with doctor onolempki i should just mention doctoronolempki is the director of our dual diagnosis edition clinic at stamford universe school medicine she is the author of this incredible book domination that i think everybody should read i do believe everyone should read that book important for the attic and non attic to because it deals with basely the state of our life nowadays re living in this dopamine rich world where we can quickly become doomed to pleaded which is terrible leads the depression in addition to things a diction in some folks et camera on was a guest on the podcast you can fine her episode at superman labor calm just put ana i think she is the only guys we have had thus far whose a name is on us will just pop up their the entirewepside is reachable but if you want a listen to that episode or watch that episode you can access it hubermanlabdok calm question is in your discussion with doctor onolempki you were talking about abstaining from people's drug of choice for thirty days to reset the dopamine reward pathway indeed that is the prescriptive that doctor onolempki gives for m out all editions and for people that are suffering from milder even severe depression related to dole mean seeking behaviors sochiomedia video games sex food et camera however of course in the instance of food or in some other addictions you cannot obtain for thirty days i that would be terrible to obtain for food for thirty days ism sure people have done it but it is not healthy to do certain things alcohol and drugs people can abstain thirty days in efforts to never go back to them again there are cases of severe alcohol or opiate dependence where people cannot go cold turkey or they risk dying there they need to really work with a of physician but the thirty day reset of the dopamean system is something that is very real and that pretence to most people that is it is going to be very effective for most people struggling with either behavioral what are sometimes call process editions or other types of editions including substance abuse issues the question continues you said you are going to ask on how to abstain if your drug of choice is a thought or narrative as opposed to a substance or behavior the question continues as far as i can tell your discussion within a moved on before you asked her the question would you be able to discuss stages for abstaining from addictive thoughts and narratives o case o lets talk about in truce thoughts and let us start off by asking ourselves what is a thought in the realm of neurobiology we have sensations which are the a processes by which are neuron's nerve cells convert light photons sound waves touch mechanical pressure et camera into electrical signals and chemical signals that head in to our nervous system including our brain and then our brain least we think my sense of them and help us navigate the world that were in case of the sensation part is a pure transformation of mechanical information or in some cases chemical information smell chemicals literally volatile chemicals floating round in the world or brought into your nose and your neurons neural factory bulb convert those into electrical and chemical signals that your brain can understand perceptions or your idea of what those signals out in the world are either because your paying attention to them or for some other reason you decide that a stop sign in front of you is read and that on the sign behind it is white and that the sky is blue or cloudy those are perceptions we have sensations and perceptions then we have emotions which are these things that include the mind in body that on are related to neuromodulators like dope mean ceretonan et camera although those chemicals do other things as well and the course we have behaviors actions everything from me moving my pen on a piece of paper to walking running et camera thoughts are a fifth category of neural functioning that we really need to define but that does not have as strict a definition as sensations perceptions or feeling or action but thoughts are real mig we all know this thoughts are real and one way that we can define thoughts is that thoughts are perceptions that include data from the past present or future o or comminations of past and present or present and future or future and past ism not trying o given overly complicate definition here but if we are going to answer a question about how to abstain from thoughts in a really direct and actionable way we really need to address what our thoughts thoughts are perceptions that are generated internally it we do not need any external sensation in order to have a thought we can close our eyes we could be in sensory isolation for that matter were floating with no gravity and we c n have a thought thoughts tend to run pretty much automatically in the background all the time some people refer to this as chatter in the back of our minds in a very unstructured way and then if we force our thoughts to be structured because we decide they need to be or if something in our environment captures ore perception then our thoughts ten to be structured lemme give an example film just walking around if there were a way in which we could broadcast my thoughts on to a screen we would not do that but those thoughts would be a mixture of semi complete sentences and gibberish however if somebody stops me ans as high ism good to see you what you doing to day and i start answering well then my thoughts are suddenly being driven by an external stimulus their question and some internal ideas memory of who i am and what ism doing that day passed ant present and on and thoughts be comestructiured when we have a question about how to abstain from thoughts we need to be additionally specific and really pin point that what we are trying to do is to abstain from thoughts we do not want presumably either because they are too repetitive and distracting or because what is contain in those thoughts is disturbing of this is important because it gives us two answers to the questions that are highly divergent one answer to the question of how to abstain from intrusive thoughts you thoughts that were addicted to is if those thoughts are merely on loop all the time and we cannot stop them but the thoughts themselves are not particularly disturbing think about a song you cannot get out of your head or you keep recounting some event but the event itself is not very disturbing it is just intrusive because it is there well in that case the date of really point to trying to anchor your thoughts to some external stimulus getting into action getting into activities that really draw your attention away from that thought now you may still hear it scrolling in the backgrounds you might be sitting in class still hearing that loop of thou gets in the background that something that over time ought to wain it ought to disappear if we trying bring more and more attention to whatever it is that s in our environment whatever it is that we happen to be learning or doing physically et camera things mindful meditation doing a ten or even just five minute to day practice of sitting with eyes closed are lying down with eyes closed and really focussing on one's breath focusing one's attention on the sometimes call the third eye center but in science we would say the just the region right behind the forehead you've directing your attention there has been shown to increase focus for singular topics and can improve memory and do a bunch of other things as well those are data for doctor went says kid's habit new york university she was a guest on the podcast as well my laboratory is run studies on mindful meditation as well what you really thing to do as learn how to focus better on one thing and by focussing on that one thing you focus off these repetitive thoughts now i have a feeling that this question was asked and that many people voted this question because the issue is in just thoughts that are intrusive because they are there and on repeat but because the thoughts themselves are actually troubling this could be recounting a drama some one harmed you you observe something that was disturbing o you felt wrong o you felt some one else was wronged on you cannot seem to get your mind off of something and your emotions tend to follow and it is uncomfortable have a feeling this is that the rout of the question in that case the approaches very different what we know from essentially all of the quality scientific and clinical studies is that those sorts of intrusive thoughts are very much a drama now we have to be clear in defending what drama is it'll use the definition the doctor paulconti another incredible guests that was on our podcast a psychiatrist stamford harvartrain psychiatric i think one of the world's foremost leaders on the issue of trapan psychitriand psychology generally he defines drama as in event were something that fundamentally changes the way that your nervous system works such that you function less adaptively going forward from that event i not every bad occurrence in your life is a drama that is good news the bad news is many people have dramas and dramas change the way that our nervous system work that we do not function as well as we could in that sense intrusive thoughts that are disturbing are in many ways dramas and are reenforcing that drama now we know that almost counter intuitively in order to deal with drama you have to get very close to that drama you do not have to re expose and i would hope you would not preexpose yourself to the very same drama but we know that one of the best ways to deal with dramas is to get very clear about the narrative around those dramas now this can be done with a therapist ideally but not everyone has access to therapies can afford therapy there is a range of quality therapist for that matter ore always referring to the desire for peace do great therapy with really great meaning excellently trained people but it turns out that if you want to extinguish an intrusive thought one of the best ways to do that is to journal about that particular thought extensively rather than the earlier strategy for intrusive thoughts where they are just on loop and intrusive because they are on loop and present but their content is not disturbing when a thought is disturbing and intrusive we know that it is very useful to script out as much detail about that particular thought and the things around it as possible i vet see you want to do this in a way that is fairly structure to i really would use complete sentences the reason for doing that is that thoughts as i mention earlier can often be fragmentary that they pop up in our mind almost we seemingly spontaneously the they inhibiting our ability to focus or be present to work or family or other things or sleep writing things down in a lot of detail does seem to have this quality of both reducing the emotional load of whatever it is that that thought is about as well as diminishing the frequency of those intrusive thoughts over time this is far and away different than the strategy i mention for the other types of intrusive thoughts and really it is far and away different from the thirty day abstinence approach that doctor on leaky was talking about for substance or behavior addictions now of course this process of abstaining from thoughts or removing the addictive nature of certain thoughts can definitely take some time good example there would be superstitions y it'll come clean here endive talked about this before on a few podcast that when i was in college i developed a sort of a not on would superstition a many time it'd say something that i did not want to happen or did want t appetite a knock on won't i knock on wood and then i started am suppressing the behavior most weeks waste embarrassing and then i started just telling myself in my head knock on would knock i would knock id and is clearly a lot bit of an of d time thing but again o c d in er quotes here om i think it qualified as csc d in the sense that the more i did it the more i wanted to do it i needed to gold cold turkey on the thinking but how can you go cut turkey on a thought you could not what i was told to do and what worked very well for me was to just right down the worst possible outcome that i was concerned about to really get close to the nature or the underlying basis of that intrusive thought and i raise this because a lot of times the intrusive thought is not oka ism thinking about a car actor i m thinking about a break up or ism thinking about an examine that i have that can be intrusive but a lot of times it is some kind of in nebula abstract set of words or ideas or images around something that happen that we saw or heard or experienced and by putting a lot of clear structure to what the thought is exactly and to putting some thought and structure on to paper about what that pattern of not healthy thinking relates to people often achieve tremendous relief in a fairly short amount of times sometimes just in one section of writing it down sometimes they to write it down multiple times what you are mentally trine to do with a intrusive thought or a drama of any kind is your time to turn a disturbing story that is a story that of jokes a lot of emotion and captures it can hijacks your nervous system into what is essentially a known but repetitive and anole boring story where the emotional load has been depended and there of course i have to high the fact that getting sufficient rapid eye movement sleep we also know is very important for removing the emotional load of dramatic experiences and intrusive thoughts you really want to strive to get the best possible sleep you can that includes sufficient rain i movement sleep and we have multiples ourocoss resources for that at hurmelabdacom we have the episode on master your sleep we have the episode on perfect your sleep we have the tools kept for sleep all of which are time stamped and all of which can be access to complete these your cost to trying get your sleep om as good as possible including lots of rain eye movement sleep in order to remove intrusive and addictive thoughts ask yourself is this of d of the classic sense if it is you should see a secatrust they will not necessarily prescribe medication but there are tools for true of d that that are very effective in many cases and we did the episode on of d which i invite you to to listen to a well you want to ask yourself or the thoughts disturbing or merely intrusive and repetitive if they are merely intrusive and repetitive well then learning to focus your attention on other things and getting better at focusing on single things through an exercise mindfulness meditation can rally help and indeed the perhaps the best use of mindfulness meditation is to improve your level of focus it does have other benefits as well but that is going to be the major one that one will experience even with these very short five or ten menial meditations great date on that from the scientific literature and then if those intrusive thoughts are not only intrusive but they are also disturbing in that case you really want to put as much structure and thought believe or not into what those thoughts are really about write them out on paper in complete sentences and maybe do that multiple times in till the underlying emotions related to those thoughts really start to diminish and by doing that your essentially doing your own form of aromatherapy for lack of a better way to put it and again the dato really point to the fact the getting close to the specific details around those intrusive thoughts is going to be the best way to extinguish the thank you rejoining for the beginning of this ask me

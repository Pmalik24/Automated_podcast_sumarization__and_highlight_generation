a quick warning there are curry words that are beeped interests episode of the show if you prefer a beep region you can find that at our website this america life at work from w b chico with this america life my requires its been such an extraordinary and painful few weeks since the killing of gorge for and we have shut day with people in scene we recorded this past week trying to capture what this moment fees and how different people are reacting and what they down and i know usually writ here at the tap if the show i jumped him winsome story but i think it actually captures what latter people a feeling this week a at better to strut with this essay from what of our producers be a matter would ma hi yes the year i came to live and work in america nine hundred and sixty two people was shot and killed by police across the country i may be the number was one thousand and ninth three it depends on who you ask about twenty sixteen one project that counted the dead found that black male aged fifteen to thirty four when nine times more likely than other america to be killed by law enforcement in case you have become fuzzy on time lines michael brown was shot by police in person missouri in twenty fourteen water shot was shot in the back by police in charlatan south caroling in twenty fifteen in twenty sixteen alto sterling was killed by police in baton huge louisiana and a day later in falconheidts minisota police shot and killed parlando still while he was in his car with his partner and a for your old daughter those last two incidents were recorded both were viewed by the public at large at the time sterling and still were killed and twenty sixteen i ad been living in new york for four months i had come to america to report on the presidential election campaigns with a my brutish i i no longer have the original text of my veer application but i remember distinctly that it mentioned both the nineteenth century french social scientist plexus her tickvill and the late brutish journalist alistercook both elects and blister were amen of letters operating in very different eras of america upheaval the aim of their writing was to help readers back home understand the unique america situation they were good names to put on o veer application it indicated i knew my literary lineage ut the reality is that beyond the common ground of our jobs i was not really plexus or blister i move through the world differently i was a woman i was a muslin i was a child of working class immigrants born appearance who themselves were born in an african country still under the yoke of the english monarchy and of course i was black i still am thanks to the spread of empire i no stranger to the project of colonization of all the things i would be reporting on and experiencing first hand in america the subject of blackness was the thing with which i had the most literal most lived experience brutish police have historically not sons their america counterparts but the history of disproportion at black death during and after interactions with police in the use tells of familiar story the lyrics a different but the melody is old unknown to me that is the horrible thing about this moment have been here before and when gorge flood was killed an many apples on memorial day in the last week of may i had a feeling of resined leave police had arrested a man and then less than a half hour later that man was dead the manner of it a cop's see pressing down on his neck for eight minutes and forty six seconds felt a stage play we would all seen before the fact that it had been recorded felt proper a sort of sacred practice the money in location of it was familiar too a regular street suddenly transformed into an arena for public death the echo of some of flood's dying words aerially the same as epic garners in twenty fourteen i cannot breed even that felt an the notary run of a series called how to die in america almost every element of what happened next hid the exact beat it was supposed to the video of his life being snuffed out went viral tabloid newspapers brought up his criminal past protest began the day after he was killed against police brutality yes bat also against the organizing principle of colonialism in general and explicitly against the ideology of white suppremisy itself and it was not just black people yelling things shifted something was different by the end of the week there were protests across the country all fifty states and a week after that they would been protest in other countries too last weekend i watch protesters in the west of inland total the statue of toward coulston a bristle man who made his fortune by trading in thousands of enslaved african after kneeling on the supine statues neck protestors rolled it down the street before tipping it into the pistol harbor my onion friend sent me videos and powers of protest they had attended while doing their best to maintain social distancing a some one twitter put it i cannot believe corona be are twenty eight three leaves to passion the day after gorge flood was killed i quick twitter because of my propensity for dooms growling i knew my right thumb would be in constant endless motion eating up breaking news that would last crystallize into insomnia and my grains but even on integral it was a wall of gorge food content suddenly i was overwhelmed with graphics and photos and links to bale finds and that uniquely america habit crowd funding and pastel color did it'll easels people wrote antirase his quotes from angeladavis and each o ma loud artist created tributes to people twenty six year old brine tailor who was killed in her own home in larval kentucky back in march and tony my made a transmit killed in tallahassy there were guides on everything from how to dress and prepare for a protest in the age of corona virus to the specifics of raising truly an the races children my favorite or least favorite gonna of these is the one that teachers non black people how to be people in this moment post with headings here is what to say to your black friends or check in on your black friends was seemingly everywhere after that first week end of protest i got a text in one of my group chats from a black friend have either rev view gotten ten from white people this weekend she wrote yes we both replied we all shared a dark laugh people have been dying in america and elsewhere for long what different about now that first welkin i kept asking my sofethis what making white people cared now i people looking to see what have miss what was the thing that making brands o draw these lines now what makes baby names dock calm dedicate its landing page to listing black vices us of police violence a long with the note each one of these names was somebody is baby baby names dock cam stands an solid rarity with the black community what is compelling people a lot of them white to stand up for the first time and proclaim that it is time to do something how was it that i have read more proposals for defending and abolishing the poleaxes in the last two weeks than over the course of the last two years what is making people in small towns across america lewis town montane to bad ace michigan get up and protest now if s mantra lands did not do it if trick gonna did not do it if atatiana jefferson did not do it if i and stable ones did not do it how was the death of gorge flood the thing that moves the needle i cannot think of an easy answer it is not because he was seven years old if i ana stable ones was it is not because he was a twelve year old boy to me a rice is it is not because he was an award rennin e m t who treated that twenty twenty would be her year bring tailor was the next likely answer is that it is as simple as the effect of accumulation finally there are enough does clothes in the hamper to justify putting on a load of laundry maybe the increased visibility of the stark differences between the haves and have not over the last few years has produced a populace ready to be pushed into the hitherto radical lane of thought that is suggests actually black lives do matter maybe the act of his finally broke through who can say a parts of me want white people at large to feel deeply ashamed this is entry level stop killing us this is basic if the killing of gorge flood could unleash this title wave of demonstration what was stopping you before he is as meeting full as any other victim of police violence named unnamed here to day you could have harnessed all this energy fifteen twenty two hundred five hundred a thousand deaths ago but that did not happen and when i ask the question why now the truth is that i do not really care all these white people newly attuned to this frequency the rest of us know well i told a friend that i want ted every one to do their belated learning far away from me i do not want to see how any one is carrying the one i do not want to teach any one i have no office hours i do not want to know what trigger you come to jess moment i have no interest in seeing how the sausage gets made i just want to rock up to the table and enjoy my breakfast i know what is different for me ism angrier now i think of what parents say about how the harts grow bigger after a second child instead of having to share the love they already feel that is me but instead of love it is rage i find that this time i am furious that is what is different b after on may is one of produces are shall i to for a sunrise is when

policing no matter what even though it is an advent of the sing century ah where you are you saying a rivers speech my entire is dedicated to the destruction of the police in the america impart ism speaking off the cot this his is what i think about all they work another protestor came in soon after dashing key she was also skeptical of the police her tactic though was pretty deferent i i this was a white protester i noticed in front of the place cheeses animated we chatting out a black police officer she was asking him questions i in to be answering a this was a kind of conversation my had heard yet he i walked over which y lieutenant marks balloon was wearing an upper rink officer in white shirt brain out was holding an green jobs she was on her way home from drinks with her friend after protesting all day at have you levin which is not never an as come o long i really appreciate the conversation is ti on o and and on an to we should is join and again i should be even inn at no o she be noon we police in recon is in in me should me show writ on o no at what i so but that is my privilege it i do not have to o lieutenant whilst does not want o talk about her privilege well i

o at but ben this is not my first conversation non as n o no a i used a ma i want to communicate an in understand i know the really forward conversation at watch she keeps making big statements about policing ending with right it is not it is not end isolated a bent here or there ay it says emit a wo i have this general son sat people who try to we go to be police officers generally have a power is i there is a power as you or the what a helpiople an i my mind its yo do not one or the other i think generally most pop portly boss sell though of course it is hard to get lieutenant whilst to a gree withal seems to p be her central premise that there is something fundamentally wrong with his job but ultimately when police a call a and on peacekeeping missions violence senses i a we the are tons there of an what we yet in ones has already her o oasis the and as martian sons while we of these merit barrage lieutenant whilst told me later o that people who do not have as many interactions with the police often filled the vacuum with the worst images taco in the news not anything base on their own experience ems is his treated we during this conversation he told me was first to mostly just lessen but when she told him she knew what it was to be in the majored because she lived does a white person in plans he realized the dots of heir misconceptions but since she seems agama he was not out to change them we talk to bring later she said she was not expecting to change anything about his belie it just felt important to say what she thought it is there the end of their twenty minute conversation there is a moment where she asks for his advice i wot she asks he eve kid ya i i es i lav have have then i o o word tin his by rather am tin a figure i i i tell he presents is li

me i to that the a is now at to tom there is officers not you yes i to yet might i conversation convects you have to have that conversation with your kids she tells him it is funny to imagine how different those two conversations would be after she left i ask lieutenant whilst what he made of all of data have you been having more conversations then you just had are you to be mercy's vicar more white people wanted to talk to you about that kind of thing than heal y ye and you known and i get that ye sit is i i mac e i happy that you have o nation you said con teeter to a you know for coming

says people have send him sixteen hundred direct messages with banks that he has not even got into yet the stuff that police are doing in these idiot i mean the tactics that they are using against peaceful protest it is not news there is nothing knew about it to this pointed a everybody knows or should know tho the step is happening but watching them back to back all collected in one place the sheer concentrated volume of it is on nerving the simplest ones a start with utterly peaceful demonstrators it sandals of thispell ben village and saw collumpis oho hunts wot georgia wan o free corn a too many places to am and then police fire tear get and sometimes flashbacks or rubber boots with no apparent provocation lass of ideas of course give more violent an often police hot of been background at a sixteen year old boy brad we my a taller i seems et us just a bystander watching the protest from an embankment near the street a maniapolis on a superpeaceful suburban looking tree line street with pretty homes police a national guard marched down the street and fire some kind of round at a woman for the offense of videoing them from her own porch lot sandals a black find we

about this come a weeks ago one woman to his white wok up read the news of the day and the posted on line that she wanted to have a protest she got several responses from local communicators asking her not to do it the wife of a local pasture rot please reconsider this there is more damage than good that will come from this the hard n anger that the black community has right now will not allow for this stand up peacefully in the end you will be able to go back home to a quiet peaceful block but the residence of night that is the public housing wont they wile lent up with more poise presence possible cur few make it hurt and much more the one we wrote the initial post back down but last week an there was a protest in redwood one of our pritishers can a chives who lives there explains how that happened and out went the protest that did happen was organized by a twenty two year old named nod torch who had never done an y then thus before an not up with him just before the protest

woman the one who proposed ta protest on facebuk they worried i could be dangerous people from outside the neighborhood could come in in start trouble they could give the cops of reason to harass them

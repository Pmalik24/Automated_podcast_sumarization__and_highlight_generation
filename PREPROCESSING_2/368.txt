welcome to the superman laptops disks science science pace to i madruhubermen and a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor father mac dull doctor matter my dull is the hetero surgeon at nerd link nerd link is a company whose goal is to develop technologies to overcome specific clinical challenges of the brain and nervous system as well as to improve upon brain design that is to improve the way that brains currently function by augmenting memory by augmenting cognition and by improving communication between humans and between machines and humans these are all of course tremendous goals and nerd link is uniquely poised to accomplish these goals because they are approaching these challenges by combining both existing knowledge of brain function from the fields of hero science and hero surgery with robotics machine learning computer science and the development of novel devices in order to change the ways that human brains work for the better to day's conversation with doctor father my dull is a truly special one because i and many others in science in medicine consider hero surgeons the astronauts of hero science and the brain that is they go where others have simply not gone before and are in a position to discover incredibly novel things about how the human brain works because they are literally in there probing and cutting stimulating et camera and able to monster how peoples cognition and behavior and speech changes as the brain itself is changed structural and functionally today's discussion with doctor my dual will teach you how the brain works through the lens of a hero surgeon it will also teach you about nerd link specific perspective about which challenges of brain function and disease are immediately tractable which ones they are working on now that is as well as where they see the future of augmenting brain function for sake of treating disease and for simply making brains work better to day's discussion also gets into the realm of devising the parietal nervous system in fact one thing that you will learn is that doctor my dull has a radio receiver implanted in the perry of his own body he did this not to overcome any specific clinical challenge but to overcome a number of daily every day life challenges and in some ways to demonstrate the powerful utility of combining novel machines novel devices with what we call our nervous system and different objects and technologies within the world i know that might sounalobit mysterious but you will soon learn exactly what ism referring to and by the way he also implanted his family members with similar devices while all this might sound a litigate science fiction this is truly science reality these experiments both the implantation of specific devices and the attempt to overcome specific movement disorders such as parkensins and other disorders of deep brain function as well as to augment the human brain and make it work far better than it ever has in the course of human evolution are experiments and things that are happening now at curl link doctor my dull also generously takes us under the hood to speak of what is happening at curl link explaining exactly the sorts of experiments that they are doing and have planned how they are approaching those experiments we get into an extensive conversation about the utility of animal verses human research in probing brain function and in devising and improving the human brain and in overcoming disease in terms of our surgery and nil link goals by the end of to day's episode you will have a much clearer understanding of how human brains work and how they can be improved by robotics and engineering and you will have a very clear picture of what curl link is doing toward these goals doctor my dull did his medical training at the university of californium sanding and at stamford university school of medicine and of course is now at curl link he is in a unique stands to teach us about human brain function and dysfunction and to explain to us what the past present and future of brain augmentation is really all about before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and efforts to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performances element contains a science backtolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doom slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor matter mac dual doctor macdugal welcome good t be i c nor great to see you again i will get indoor history i littlest later but just to kick things off as a hero surgeon and as a hero scientist can you share with us your vision of the brain as an organ as it relates to what is possible there i may think most everyone understands that the brain is along g with the body the seat of our cognition feelings are ability to move et camera and that damage there can limit our ability to feel the way we want to feel or move the way we want to move but surgeons tend to view the world all it differently hand most because as the not funny joke goes they to cut and they to fix an they to men than the in your case have the potential to add things into the brain that do not exist they are already how do you think about and conventionalize the brain as an organ and what do you think is really possible with the brain that most of us do not already probably think about ye hat's great question thinking about the brain as this three pound lump of meat trapped in a prison of the skull a it seems almost magical that it could create a human a human set of behavior is and life a merely from electrical impulses when you start to see patience and see say a small tumor eating away at a little part of the brain and see a a very discreet function of that brain go down in isolation i you start to realize that the brain really is a collection of functional modules pinned together duck have together a in this in this bone box attached to your head a and e sometimes you see very interesting failure modes one of the most a memorable patience i ever had was very early on in my training i was down at you see sanding and saw a a very young guy who had just been in a car accident we had operated on him and as is often the case in nor a surgery we had saved his life potentially at the cost of quality of life when he woke from surgery with bilateral front a lab damage he had essentially no impulse control left and i we rounded on him after surgery saw that he was doing oka to our first guess at at his a health and we continued on to see our other patience and we are called back by his eighty year old recovery room nurse saying he have got it come see your patient right away something is wrong and we walk in to see him and he points at his elderly nurse and says she will not have sex with me and you know it was apparent at that moment his front a lobs were gone and that person is never going to have reasonable human behavior again am and the that is it is one of the most tragic ways to have a brain mouth function but i anything a brain does anything from control of hormone levels in your body to vision to sensation to the most obvious thing which s muscle movement of any kind from i movement to moving your based all that comes out of the brain all of it can go wrong i any of it any part of it or all of it a y a working with the brain is the substance of the brain as a surgeon very high stakes a but once and while you get a chance to really help you get a chance to fix something that seems unlikable and you have in a hazardous miracles not not too uncommonly it is extremely satisfying as a career could you share with us one of the more satisfying experiences her or perhaps a the top contour of what am qualifies as satisfying in in gurus surgery ye a one of the relatively newer technique that we do is some one comes in with a a reasonably small tumor somewhere deep in the brain that is hard to get to the traditional approach to takin that out would involve cutting through a lot of good normal brain and disrupting a lot of neurons a lot of white matter that on count of wires connecting the on am then the modern approach involves at two millimeter drill hole in the skull that down which you can pass a little fibrotic canula and and attach it to a later and just heat the tumor up deep inside the brain under direct acari visualization in real times your this person is in the ear eye scanner you are taking pictures are e second or as the tumor heats up you can monitor the temperature an get it exactly where you an at where it is can kill all those tumor cells but not hurt hardly any of the brain surrounding it and not uncommonly nowadays we have some one come in with a tumor that previously would have been catastrophic to operate on and we can eliminate that tumor with the leaving a poke hole in their skin i with almost no visual after effects that procedure that you just describe translates into better clinical outcomes meaning fewer call them side affects are collateral damage exactly right ye i we do not even in cases that previously would have considered totally an operable say a tumor i in the brain stem or a tumor in a primary motor quarter or primary i verbal areas broke as area i where we would have expected to either not operate or do catastrophic damage those people sometimes now are coming out unscathed ism very curious about the sorts of basic information about brain function that can be gleaned from these clinical approaches of lesions and a strokes and maybe even stimulation for instance in your example of this nation that had by lateral frontal damage what do you think his lack of regulation reveals about the normal functioning of the front loaves because i ting the obvious answer to most people's going to be well the frontaloves are normally a limiting impulsivity but as we both know because the brain has excusatory and inhibitory morons a sort of accelerators embarks on communication h that is not necessarily the straight forward answer a it could be for instance at the frontal blames are a acting as conductors and are can of a important but not the immediate players in determining impulsivity a two questions really what you think the frontaloaves are doing these on very intrigue by this a human expanded real estate you have a lot of it comparative other animals and a more generally what o you think it damage of a given curl tissue means in terms of understanding the basic function of that tissue it varies think from tissue to tissue a but with respect to the frontaloaves i think they act as sort a filter they selectively are saying s backward to the rest of the brain behind them a when part of your brain was that looks very attractive i antic o grab and take it a out of the jewelry display case or in whatever a the front loaves are saying you can if you go pay for it first their filtering the behavior there there letting the impulse through may be but in a controlled way a this is very high level very broad thinking about how the frontalopes work and that that patient i mentioned earlier is a great example of when they go wrong he had this impulse for strange impulse to i be a to acted to his nurse i that normally would be easy for frontelopes to say this is completely inappropriate wrong setting wrong i person wrong time i in his case he had nothing there and even the slightest inclination to i to want something came right out to the surface i ya filter calming the rest of the brain down from acting on every possible impulse when i was a graduates ton i was am running what are called these what these are but just inform you what are called acutes which are a your physiological experiments at last several days because at the end you i you terminate the animal this is an my apologies to those that a are made uncomfortable by animal or search i now work on humans i a different type of animal but at the time we were running these acutes that would start one day and and maybe end two or three days let later since you get a lot of data the animals an necessity and does not feel any pain the entire time of the surgery but the one consequence of these experiments that the experiment or me and another individual are awake for several days with an hour sleep here an hours sleep there but your basely awake for two three days something that really i could only do in my teens and twenties was in my twenties at the time and i recall a going to eat at a diner after one of these experiments and i was very hungry and the waitress walking by with a playful of food for another table and it took every bit of self control to not get up and take the food off the tray something that of course is totally an appropriate and i would never do and it must have been based on what you just said that my forebrain was essentially going off line or off line from the sleep reprobation because there was a moment there were i thought i might reach up in grab a plate of food passing by simply because i wanted it and am i did not a but i can relate to the experience of feeling the response is a flickering in and out under conditions of sleep deprivations do we know whether not sleep deprivation limits for brain activity in a similar kind of way i i do not know specifically if that i effect is more pronounced in the forebrain i suppose to other brain regions but it is clear that sleep deprivation has broad effects all over the brain i people starts the visual urination the opposite end the brain as the the visual correct in the far back of the brain is effected people a people's cord motor coordination goes down after sleep deprivation m i think if i if you force me to give a definitive answer on that question it'd have to guess that the entire brain is effected by sleep deprivation and it is not clear that one part of the brain is more effected than another s were ben talking by damage to the brain and inferring function from damage a who you talk a little bit about what i consider really the holy grail of the nervous system which is narrow plasticity was incredible capacity of the nervous system to change its wiring strength an connections weaken connections may be new neurons but probably more strengthening and weakening of connections nowadays we are a lot of excitement about local classical psychedelic psycholisty and sylisiban which do seem to quoting u open plasticity they do a bunch of other things to but am through the release of neuromodulators saratonan and forth how do you think about negro plasticity and more specifically what do you think the potential for negro plasticity is in the adult let us ay older than twenty five year old brain with were without machines being involved years am in your roll at narrow link and as a narrow surgeon in other clinical settings am surely you are using machines and surely you have seen plasticity in the positive and negative direction what o you think about plasticity what is possible there without machines what is possible with machines as you mentioned are alluded to the plasticity definitely goes down in older brains a it it is harder for older people to learn new things to make radical changes in their behavior a to in a kick habits that the have had for years a machines are not the obvious answer implanted electrodes and computers are not the obvious answer to increase plasticity necessarily compared to a drugs we already know that there pharmacy logic some of the ones you mention psychedelics that have abroad impact on plasticity wait is hard to know whicherry of the brain would be most potent as a stimulation target for an electrode a to broadly juice plasticity a compared to a pharmacy logic agents that we already know about a i think with plasticity you are talking in general you are talking about the entire brain you are talking about altering you know a trillion synapses all in a similar way in their tendency to be reliable to their tendency to be up a down waited and an electrical stimulation target in the brain necessarily has to be focus with he device potentially nurslings there might be a more broad ability to steer current a multiple targets with some degree of control but you are never going to get that broad a target ability with any electorates that i fancy coming in our lifetimes say that would be coming the entire surface and depth of the brain the way that a drug can and i think pal activity research will bear the most fruit hen at focuses on farmaclogic agents was not expecting that ants are given that your at nerd link and a and then again i think that all of us me included need to a take a step back and realized that while we may think we know what is going on at neral link in terms of the specific goals in the general goals and i certainly have in mind i think most people have in mind a chip in planted in the brain or maybe even the puerperal nervous system that can give people supermemories or some other augmented capacity we really do not know what you all are doing there i for all we know a you as a taking or ministering syllicidan and combining that with stimulation and we we really do not know and i say this am with hat with a tone of excitement because a i think that one of the things that exciting about the different endeavors that plan has really spearheaded m space ex turtle et camera is that early on there is there is a lot of mistake in a mistake is equality that am is not often talked about but am it is i think of very exciting time in which a engineers are starting to a toss up big problems and go forded and obviously plan is certainly among the best if not the best in terms of going really big in mar seems pretty far to me electric cars all over the road noway is very different than the picture a few years ago ah when you did not see many of them rockets and forth and now the brain to the extent that you are aloud a could you share with us what your vision for the missions at nerd link are and what the general scope of missions are and then am if possible a share with us some of the more specific goals i can imagine basic goals trying to understand the brain and augment the brain i could imagine clinical goals are trying to re here things in them humans that are suffering in some way or animals for that matter ye it is it is funny what you mentioned a nursing and i think testing space before it and up being these blank canvases that people project their hopes and fears on to and we we experience a lot of upside in this people assume that we have super powers in our ability to alter the way brains work and people have terrifying fears of the horrible things were going to do a for the most part those extremes are not true a we are making a curl implant we have a robotic insertion device that helps place tiny electrons the sides smaller than the size of a human hair all throughout a small region of the brain in in the first indication that we are aiming at we are hoping to implant a series of these electrons into the brains of people that have had a bad spinal cart injury people that are essentially quadriplegic they have perfect brains but they cannot move use them to move their body they cannot move their arms or legs because of some high level spinal cordage exactly right and this in a pristine motor quarter up in their brain is completely capable of operating a human body it is just not wired properly any longer to a human's arms or legs and our goal is to place this implant i into a motor quarter and have that person be able to then control a computer a mouse and a keyboard as if they hade their hands on a mouse and a keyboard even though they are not moving their hands their motor intentions are coming directly out of the brain into the device and they are able to regain their digital freedom and connect with the world through the internet why use robotics to insert these chips and the reason i asked that is that sure i can imagine that a robot could be a more precise or less precise but in theory more precise than the human hand no tremor for instance am i more precision in terms of a maybe even a little a micro detection device on the a the tip of the blade or a or something that could detect a capillary that you would want to avoid and swerve around that not that the human eye could not detect and you and i both know however that no two brains nor are the two sides of the same brain identical navigating through the brain is perhaps best carried out by a human however and here i am going to interrupt myself again and say ten years ago face recognition was very clearly performed better by humans than machines and i think now machines do it better is this the idea that eventually or maybe even now robots are better surgeons than humans are in in this limited case yes a these electrics are tiny and the blood vessels on the surface of the brain numerous and densely packed that a human physically cannot do this a human hand is not steady enough to grab this in a couple my crown with the loop at the end of our electro thread and place it accurately blindly by the way into the cortical surf's accurately enough at the right depth to get through all the cortical layers that we want a reach a and i would love if human surgeons were essential to this process a but very soon humans run out of motor skills sufficient to do the s job and we are required in this case to lean on robots to do this incredibly precise incredibly fast incredibly numerous placemen of electrons into the right area of the brain in some ways nursing is pioneering the development of robotic surgeons as much as it is pioneering the exploration and augmentation and treatment of human brain conditions right and as the device exists currently as we are submitting it to the f die it is only for the placemen of the electorates that robot is part of the surgery i or or another car urgent still needs to o the the more crude part of opening the skin and skull and presenting the nobody pristine brain her surface to electrons into surely getting quadriplegics to be able to move again or maybe n to walk again is a a heroic goal and one that i think every one would agree would be wonderful to accomplish is that the first goal because it is hard but durable a or is that the first goal because you and plan and other folks at curl link a have a passion for a getting paralyzed people to move again broadly speaking the mission of narrowing is to reduce human suffering at least in the near term there hope that eventually there is a use here that makes sense for a brain i inter face to i bring a my is a tool embedded in the brain that human can use to augment there capabilities i think that is pretty far down the road a for us but definitely on a desired road map in the near term we really are focused on people with terrible medical problems to have no options right now a with regard to motor control i our mutual a friend recently departed a chrishnicionois was a giant in this field of motor cross thesis it just happens that his work was foundational for a lot of people to work in thissara including us and he was an adviser touring that work was farther along than most other work for addressing any function that lives on the surface of the brain the physical constraints of our approach require us currently to focus on only surface features on the brain we cannot say go to the relief very compelling a surface a deep depth functions that happen in the brain alike mood appetite addiction a pain sleep we would love to get to that place eventually but i in the immediate future our first indication or two or three will probably be brain surface functions motor control it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundation nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand and twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i story taking athletic greens in the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the robotics that i need for got health our got is very important as populated by got microbioda that communicate wit the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics and athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tasteripe if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greens dock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel p o that make it really easy to mix up both lentic grains while you are on the road and the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply o item in d three k too again that is that letter green stock calm slat humored to get the fiver travel packs and the year supply a vitamin three k to for those listening the a outer portions of the brain or a filled with or consist of rather a need quarter the the bumpy stuff a that looks a sea coral a some forms of see coral a look brains or brains look that a and then underneath a reside a lot of the brain structures that control a what math yes referred to am thinking trail mood hormone output a how a water sleep the brain is a an would you agree that those deeper regions of the brain have in some ways more predictable functions i mean that lesions there or stimulation there lead to more predictable outcomes in terms of deposits or a improvements in function yen some way yes i mean to the deeper parts of terrain ten to be more stereotype as in more similar between species then the the outer surface of the brain there kind of the firmware or the the housekeeping functions to some degree body temperature blood pressure sex motivation a hunger things that you do not really need to vary dramatically between a fox an a human being a whereas the the outer more reasoning functions a problem solving functions a between a fox an a human are vastly different and he physical acquirement of a those brain outputs are different think i heard melon describe it as a the human brain is ism essentially a monkey brain with a supercomputer placed on the outside a which amsparksome interesting ideas about what need quarter is doing we have all this brain real estate on top of all that more stereotyped function type stuff in the deeper brain a and it is still unclear what noquartex is doing in the case of frontal quarter as you mentioned earlier it is clear that it is a providing some quieting of of impulses am some contact setting rule setting context switching am all of that a makes good sense but then there a lot of cuarticlary is that surer balding vision or touch or hearing but then there is also a lot of real estate that just feels unexplored ism curious whether or not in your clinical work or work with curl link a we are both whether not you have ever encountered neurons that do something that is really peculiar and intriguing a and here ism referring two examples that could be anywhere in the brain a go wow these neurons when i stimulate them or when they are taken away leads it something kind of bizarre but interesting y the there is a the one that comes immediately to mind is unfortunately and a terrible case and kids that have a a tumor in the the hypothlmas that lead to at what we call elastic seizures which is sort of a uncontrollable fit of laughter there is been cases in the literature were this laughter is uncontrollable and pervasive that people suffocate a from failing to breathe ere they laugh until they pass out and you do not normally think of a deep structure in the brain the hypothalamus as being involved in thou know a function a humor and and certainly when we think about this kind of laughter in in the these kids with tumors it is a mirthless laughter is the the conitexbook phrase a humorless laughter it is just a reflective a almost mom belike behavior and it comes from very small population of naans deep in the brain this is one of the other start a strange a loss of functions you might say as it is it is nice that you and i can sit here and not have constant destructive fits of laughter coming out of our bodies abut that that is an neuronal function that is in a thank goodness to the dean's properly wired and properly functioning and any means that do anything this can be broken and we see this in horrifying cases that from time to time am starting to sense that there are to broad bins of approaches to augmenting the brain either to treat disease or forsake of increasing memory creating superbrains et camera one category lid to earlier which is pharmacology and you specifically mention the the tremendous power that pharmacology holds with a not through psychedelics or through prescription roger wo know some other compound the other approach are these will micro electrodes that are extremely strategically placed e into multiple regions in order to play essentially a concert of electricity that is exactly right to get a quadriplegic moving an that sparks two questions first of all is there a roll for and is nursling interested in combining pharmacology with stimulation not not immediately right now we are solely focus on the extremely hard some might say the hardest problem facing humans right now of decoding the brain through electrical stimulation and recording that is that is enough for us for now omit is i give us a bit fuller picture of this r tuning about a patient who cannot move their limbs because they're have sponge cordage e am the motor quarter that controls movement is in fury fine make a small hole in the skull and through that hole a robot is going to place electrodes obviously motor quarter but then where how is the idea tat you are going to play a concert from different locations you can hit all the keys on the piano in different comminations and then figure out what can move the limbs am what ism alluding to here is i still do not understand how the signals are gingko get out of motor quarter pass the lesion and into am and out to the limbs because the lesion has not been dealt with at all in the scenario for just to clarify there i i have should emphasize were not in the immediate future t talking about re connecting the brain to the patient's own limbs that is on the road map but it is way down the road map a few years i what were talking about in the immediate future as having the person be able to control electronic devices around them with their motor intentions alone right prosthetic hand an arm or just mouse and and keys on a cousin keys on a keyboard for starters you would not see anything in the world move as they have an intention the patient might imagine say flexing their fist or moving their wrist and what would happen on the screen is the mouse would move down and left and click on an icon and bring up their word process sir and then a keyboard at the bottom of the screen would allow them to you select letters in sequence and they could type this is the easy place to start i easy and quits i would say because am the transformation of electrical signals from motor quarters through the brainstorm into the spinal quarter now to the muscles is somewhat known through a hundred years or more of incredible laboratory research but the transformation meaning how to take the electrical signals out of motor quarter and put it into a a mouse or a robot arm it that is not a trivial problem that there that is a whole other s of problems in fact well we are take we are unloading some of that difficulty from from the brain itself from the brain of the patient and putting some of that a into software we are using smarter a algorithms to decode the motor intentions out of the brain we have been able to do this in monkeys really well we have a a small army of monkeys playing video games for a you know smoothy rewards an they do really well we we actually have the world record of a bit rate of information coming out of a monkey's brain to intelligently control the curse on a screen we are doing that better than any one else a and again thanks in no small part due to chrishnachanois and his his lab and the people that have worked for him that have been helping darling a but what you cannot do with that monkey is ask him what what he is thinking you cannot ask him we can ask him body you will not get a very interesting answer you cannot tell him to try something different you cannot tell him to he try their shoulder on this i try the other hand and see if there is some cross body a her on firing that that gives you a useful signal once we get the people a we expect to see what they have seen when they have done similar work in academic laps which is tithe human can work with you to vastly accelerate this process and get much more interesting results one of the things a out of ut of standard recently is a there is a lab that a with christian amie henderson an and other people decode speech out of the hand movement area in the brain a what we know is that there are multitudes of useful signals in each area of the brain that we have looked at far they just tend to be highly expressed for say hand movement in the hand area that does not mean only handmovement in the hand area here is the confidence test there is a long history dating back really prior to the nineteen fifties of scientists doing experiments on themselves not because they are reckless but because they want the exact sorts of information that you are talking about ability to really understand how intention and awareness of goals can shape outcomes in biology if that is vague to be listening what i mean here is that for many probably hundreds of years if not longer scientists have takin the drugs they have studied or stimulate o their own brain or done things to really trying get a sense of what the animals they work on or the patientsthey work on might be experiencing psychotic are sort of famous for this by the way not twenty fingers an anyway but psychiatric are known to try the drugs that they administer and some people would probably imagine that is a good thing am just to that the clinicians could have empathy for the sorts of side effects and not great effects of some of these drugs that they administer to the patience but the confidence test i present you is would you be willing or are you willing if allowed to have these electrodes implanted into your motor quartics you are not a quadriplegic you can move your limbs but give in the state of the technology at nor link now would you do that or maybe in the next couple of years if you are allowed would you be wiling to do that and od be the person to say hey turn up the stimulation over there i feel i want to reach for the cup with that robotic arm but ism feeling had of some resistance because it is exactly that kind of experiment done on a a person who can move their limbs and who deeply understands the technology and the goals of the experiment that i would are you as she stands to advance the technology fastest sire as opposed to putting the electrodes first into somebody who a is operated a number of levels and then try to think about we things are not working i right then again it this is all with the the goal of of reversing paralysis in mind a but would you implant yourself with these mycrelectrotes ye absolutely i i would be excited to do that i think for the first iteration of the device it probably would not be very meaningful it would not be very useful because i can still move my limbs and our first outputs from this are things that i can do just as easily with my hands right moving a mouse typing in a keyboard a we are necessarily making this device as a medical device for starters for people with bad medical problems and no good options a it would not really make sense for a able bodied person to get one in the near term it as the technology develops and we make devices specifically designed to perform functions that cannot be done even by an able body person i say eventually refine the technique to get to the point where you can type faster with your mind and one of these devices than you can with text to speech your speech to text and your fingers that is a unease that make sense for some one me to get it it does not really make sense for me to get one when it allows me to use a mouse slightly worse than i can with my hand currently that said the safety of the device i would absolutely vouch for a from the hundreds of surgeries that i personally done with this i i think it is much safer than many of the industry standard fit approved a surgeries that i routinely do on on patience that are are know one even thinks twice about their standard of care a nursing is already reached in my y mind a safety threshold that is far beyond a commonly accepted safety a threshold alone lines of augmenting one's biological function or functions in the world i think nil's the appropriate time to talk about am the small lump a present in the top of your hand for those listening not watching there is a it looks a a small lump between a doctor my bugles a forefinger and thumb or inner finger in thumb a place it on skin be on the top of his hand a you have had this for some years now because we have known each other for gosh probably seven years now or and you have always had it in the time they've known you what is that lump am and why did you put it in there so it is a a small a citable alibi debag what is an ride what is our if d stand for you radio frequency identification a and it is just a very small implantable a chip that wireless devices can a temporarily power if you approach an antenna i can power and send a small amount of data back and for i most phones have the capability of reading and writing to this chip ism for years it i it let me into my house it unlocked a deadbolt on my front door am for some years it unlocked the doors at darling and let me through that the various i locked doors inside the building a it is writable i can write a small amount of data to and for some some years in early i i the early days of script i had a script private key written on it a doctor a criptocurrency that i thought was a dead offshoot of one of the main i script o occurrences after at fork and i put the private walked on there and forgot about it and remember t a few years later that it was there and went in checked and it was worth a few thousand dollars more than when i left it on their that was an ice finding change in the sofa and the twenty first century and when you see you read it your essentially taking a phone or other device gaining it over the re are if the the a lump in your hand to speak and then it can read the data from there yo usually ye what other sorts of things could one put into these aerified es in theory and how long can they stay in there before you and to take them out and i ye and i recharge them or place them well the these are passive they are voted in by a compatible glass and as an extras ism a rock climber and as worried about that glass shattering i during rock climbing i additionally voted them in another ring of silicone i before implanting that it is it is pretty safe they are passive there is no battery there is no i active electronics in them they could last the rest of my life i do not think it'd ever have to remove it for any reason at some point the technology is always improving i might remove it and operated i that is not inconceivable already there is ten ax more storage versions available that could be a a drop in replacement for this if i ever remove it i but they it has a small niche a use case and it is an interesting proof of concept tiptoeing towards the concept that you mentioned of you have to be willing to go through the things that you are suggesting to your patients i in order to say with a straight face that you think this is a reasonable thing to do i a small subcutaneous implant in the hand it is a little different than a brain implant but yet what is involved in getting that am armed egypt into the hand is it reassuming its an you patient procedure presume whole you did on yourself ye ye the this was a kitchen table kind procedure many anaesthetic or or no i a have seen people do this with a light can injection i for my money i think a light i can injection is probably as painful as just doing the procedures a little cut in that thin skin on the top of the hand r some people are cringing right now other people are say i want on as you last i never where about losing your keys ye for passwords i actually rear it for passwords because ism dreadfully bad it a remembering passwords i have to put them in places a all over the place and then s am that kid in am that remember that we be stand by me where the kid hides the pennies under the the porch an the rases the ma spends all summer turn is i can relate a yes i a little it's just a little slit and then put in there no local amount response no no no poison all well n materials are completely about compatible there on the surface expose on the body no no bad reaction and healed up in days and twas fine very cool nim since were on video here maybe cane just a maybe there it and show us has were you not to point out a that we lump i wouldn't have known to to ask about it but and a any other members of your family a few years after having this and seeing a convenience of me being up open the door without keys a my wife insistent that i put when in her as well she is walking round with one fantasia can we consider them so or our version of wedding rings we it well certainly am more permanent than wedding rings and in and some sense am i cannot no but ask this question though it might seem a little bit off topic as long as we are tying bout implantable devices and am blue tooth and a a if i e chips in the body i can ask a lot about am the safety or lack thereof of a blue tooth headphones i you work on the brain you're brain surgeon am that is valuable real estate in there and am you understand about electromagnetic fields and am any discussion about ye a mast immediately puts us in the category oh li get other tin foil hat and yet have been researching e as for a future episode of the podcast and name's are a a real thing that is not a a valuable statement everything's a real thing at some level even an idea but there does seem to be some evidence that electromagnetic fields of sufficient strength can alter the function of may be the health of but the function of nerd tissue given the girl tissue is electrically signaling itself a all just asses in a very straightboard ways use blue tot head phones are wire phones simply to and you are not a worried about any kind of a m fields across the skull no i mean i think the energy levels involved a tiny that a ionizing radiation aside where were a out of the realm of ionizing radiation that people would worry about a tumor causing em fields a even just the electromagnetic field itself was is very well described in a blue touch a frequency range it the power levels are tiny in these devices and we are a wash in these signals wether use blue hothead pones a not for that matter your you are getting bombarded with ionizing radiation in a very tiny amount no matter where you live on earth unless you live under huge amounts of water a it is unavoidable and i think you just have to trust that your body has the been reparamechanisms that it needs to deal with the constant bath of ionizing radiation that you are in as a result of being in the universe and exposed to cosmic rays a in terms of electromagnetic fields that it is just it is a the energy levels are way way out of the range where i would be worried about this what about heat a i do not use the buds any longer a for a couple of reason once is as i take a lot of supplements and i reached into my left pocket once and swallowed a hands supplements that included of a blue i a period pro am i knew it i swallowed it the moment after i gulped it down by the way folks to please do not do this it it was not a good idea it was well i was not an idea it was a mistake and but i could see it on my phone as registering there never saw it again ism assuming it is no longer my body but am a anyway the is a bad joke there and to be sure a but tin any at i i tend to losemispicem that is the main reason but i did notice when i used them that there is some heat generated there a i also not convince that plugging your ears all day long as you there is some ventilation through the through the sign of systems that include the years it sounds to me you are not concerned about the use of of am your buds but am what about heat near the brain and there is the the cocoa the the auditory mechanisms that sit pretty close to the surface there am heat and nerd tissue are not friends say it'd much rather get my brain cold than hot a in terms of keeping themselves healthy and alive am should we be thinking about the heat effects of some of these devices or other things as anything we are overlooking well think about it this way the it i use cars as an an analogy a lot and mostly internal combustion engine cars cities analogies are start to be a foreign and useless for another generation of people that grow up in the air of electric cars but i using cars as i as a platform to talk about a fluid cooling systems your body has a massive distributed fluid cooling system somewhere to cars radiator a you are pumping blood all around your body all the time at a very strictly controlled temperature that blood carries i it is mostly water it carries a huge amount of the heat a a way or cold away from any area of the body that is focus heating our focused cooling you could put an ice cube on your skin until it completely melts away and the blood is going to bring heat back to that area you can put you can stand in the sun under much more scary a heating rays from the sun itself that contain you v radiation that is that is seasonally damaging your giant a if you are looking for things to be afraid of the sun is a good one your to into the guy that tells everybody get sunlight in their eyes every morning but i do not want people to get burned or or give themselves skin cants a it i encourage people to protect their skin accordingly and and different individuals require different levels of protection from the sun sure some people do very well in a lot of sunshine never get bail sell or anything that some people and it is not just people with very fair skin ism a minimum of sun exposure can cause ism some issues at here ain't one about sun exposure to the skin of course staring at the sun is a bat idea never recommend thinking about the sun just as a theater for for a moment hot to compare with blue tooth headphones your body's very capable of carrying that heat away and and dissipating it be a sweat evaporation for temperature equalization any heat that is locally generated in the year one there is a pretty large bony barrier there but tea there's a tune blood flow in the scalp and in the head in general and deafly in the brain that is goon a regulate that temperature i think certainly there can be a tiny temperature variation but i doubt very seriously that it is enough to cause a significant problem to go back to brain augmentation ism you have made very clear that one of the first schools for curl link is to get quadriplegic's walking again and again what a marvelous goal that is i certainly hope you get succeed well again just just to be very clear the first step is we we are not reconnecting patient own muster system to their motor or allowing them am souse me a agency over the movement of things in the world yes and and eventually thereby and you are exactly right ye eventually their body we would we would love to do that we have done a lot of work an a developing a system for stimulating the spinal sort itself and that gets to the question that you that you asked a few minutes ago of how do you reconnect a motor quarter to the rest of the body well if you can buy past the damaged area of the spinal sort and have an implant in the spinal sort itself connected to an implant in the brain and have them talking to each other you can take the perfectly intact motor signals out of the the motor quarter and send them to the spinal sort which most of the wiring should be intact in the spinal sort below the level of say that the injury caused by carat that an a motor cycle a natant are gunshot wonder whatever and it should be possible to reconnect the brain to the body in that way not out f the realm possibility that in some small number of years that a nursing will be able to reconnect somebody is own body to their brain and here i just one to a flag the a hundred years or more of incredible work by basic scientists a the names that i learned about in my text books as a grades to georgiopolis and a that will not mean anything to anyone unless your nor scientist by georgiopolis a perform some of the first a sophisticate recordings out of motor quarter jugs simply asking the what sorts of electrical patterns are present in motor quarter as an animal or human moves a limb a ecrischenchenois being another a major pioneer in this area and many others then just really highlating the fact that basic research where a a exploration of neral tissue is carried out at the level of anatomy and physiology really sets down the pavement on the runway to do the sorts of big clinical a expeditions that you all at berlin are doing i i an't be said enough that we broadly speaking in industry sometimes are and sometimes stand on the shoulders of academic giants they were the real pioneers that they they were involved in the grind for years and an inglorious in glamorous way nostoc option noses and you know the reward i for all the hard work is a paper at the end of the day that is read by dozens of people and they were selfless academic researchers that that made all this possible an we all humanity and nerving in owe them a massive debt of gratitude for all the hard work that they've done and continue to do i agree along lines of augmentation early on in some of the public discussions about her length that i overheard between plan and very podcast host et camera a there were some lofty ideas set out that i think are still very much a in play in people's minds things for instance electrical stimulation of the hippocampus that you appropriately have worn on your shirt to day ass they a beautiful a looks either a looks a golly or call rendition of the hippocampus em a translates to sea horse in its and area the brain that is involved in learning and memory and a among other things there was this idea thrown out that a chip or chips could be implants in the hippocampus that would a allow a greater than normal memory abilities perhaps that is one idea another idea that a heard about in these discussions was a for instance that you would have some chips in your brain and i would have some ships in my brain and you and i could just sit here look at the looking at each other or not nodding or shaking our heads and essentially her each others thoughts r which sounds outrageous but of course why not what why should we constrain ourselves am to as our good friend edichang and a whose a nurse surgeon w was already on the process once before said speech is just the shaping of breath as it exits our lungs or incredible really when you think about it but we do not necessarily need speech to hear and understand each others thoughts because the nor signals that produce that shaping of the lungs come from some intention i have some idea although mi not seem it about what i am going to say next is that possible that we could sit her and just hear each others thoughts and a and also how would we restrict with the other person could hear well absolutely i mean think about the fact that we could do this right now if you pulled out your phone and started testing me on my fan i look down and started testing you we would be communicating without looking at each other or talking a shifting that function from a pone to an implanted device it requires no magic advance no leap forward it is technology we already know how to do i if we say put a device and the lazy control keyboard in a mouse which is our stated intention for our first human clinical trial or i n against a deliberately interrupting or i can text an entire team of people culture simultaneously and then context me and in theory i could have a bunch of thoughts and five ten fifty people could hear i or am probably more to their preference a they could talk to me ye and and testing each other with our brains as may be an uninspiring rendition of this but it it is not a very difficult to imagine the implementation of the same device in a more verbally focustary of the brain that allows you to more naturally speak the thoughts that you're thinking and have me have them rendered into speech that i can hear i may be sea bone conducting implant silently hear or re not silently i could let say i was getting off the plan and i want to let somebody at home know that i had arrived i might be able to think in my mind think their first name which might cut up a a device that would then play my voice to them instate just got off the plan ism going grab my back and than it'll give you a call on their home elect that is all possible meaning we know the origin of the nerd signals ready gives rise to speech we know the different mechanical and neural apparatus the cocoa your drums et camera u that trains do soundwaves into electrical signals i especially all the pieces are known we are just really talking about refining it you ever fining it in reconfiguring it it is it is i mean it is not in easy problem but it is really an engineering problem rather than a negro science problem for that for that out case for in nonverbal communication you might say am that is a solved problem in a very crude disjointed way i fearsome labs have solved part one of it some labs of salt part of it there are products out there that solved say the implanted bone conduction part of it for the for the deaf community there are there are no implementations ism aware of there pulling all that together into one a product that is a streamline package from end to and i think that is a few years down the road we have some hints of how easily or poorly people will adapt to these butts call them novel transformations a few years ago i was on insygram and i saw a post from a woman u her name is casual jacobus and and she is deaf since birth and consign and to some extent can relies but she was am discussing a neocensory this is a a a device that translate sound in the environment into touch sensations on her hand or wrist a she is a a a admirer of birds in all things avian and am i reach out to her about this device is very curious because this is a very interesting use case of of neural plasticity in the sensory down to the fascination of mine and she said that a yes indeed it it afforded her novel experiences now when walking past say pigeons in the park if they were to make some whatever sound set don pigeons make that she would feel those sounds and that indeed it enriched her experience of those birds am in ways that obviously it would not otherwise i have not followed up with her recently to find out whether or not on going use of into sensory has made for a better worse or and of m equivalent experience of avian in the world which ere hers as anear obsession a she delights in them am what are your thoughts about in a peripheral devices that performing puerperal meaning outside of the the skull a no requirement for a a a surgery do you think that there is a more immediate or even a a a just generally potent am use case for puerperal devices and do you think that those a are going to be used a more readily before e count of brain surgery requiring devices are used ye am certainly the barrier to entrée is lower the barrier to adoption is low a if you are making a a tactile glove that is hard to say no to when you can slip it on and slip it off and not not have to get your skin cut at all am well would again there is no perfect measure of the efficacy of a device have one device compared to another especially crossmodalities but one one way to you can start to compare it what apples to orange is is bit rate in a useful information in or out of the brain was transformed in to digital data and you can put a single number on that and you have to ask when you look at a device that is what is the bit rate in what is the bit rate out how much information are yo able to usefully convey into the system and get out of the system into the body i into the brain an a i think there is what we seem in the early stabs at this is that there is a very low threshold a for bit rate on some of y devices that are trying to avoid you now direct brain surgery cut could you a perhaps say what you just said but in a way that a be people who are as familiar thinking about bit rates might a might might be able o digest that there i ism referring to myself a i understand bit rate i understand the adding a new general of information is just that adding information are you saying it is important understand whether or not that new information provides for novel function or experience and to and an to what extent is the the newness of that valid and adaptive well ism saying more a it is hard to measure utility in the space it is hard to put a single metric single number on how useful a technology is one crude way to try to get at that is is a bit rate think of it as as back in the days of dialog mouths the bit rate of your notum was fifty six cay or ninety six it is you will hear the sound or a did et an the eager that fly that is a bit rate the thankfully kept steadily going up and up and up your your a internal service provider gives you a number that is the maximum usable data that you can transmit back and forth from the internal that is a useful way to think about these assisting devices how much information are you able to get in into the brain and out of the brain usefully and right now that that number is a very small even compared to the old mouths but you have to ask yourself when you are looking at a technology what is the ceiling what is the theoretical maximum and formalities technologies that theoretical maximum is is very low disappointingly low even if it is perfectly executed and and perfectly a developed as a technology and i think the thing that attracts a lot of us to a technology darling is that the ceiling is incredibly high there is no obvious reason that you cannot interface with millions of naans as this technology is refined and and developed further a that is the kind of we band in a high band with brain interface that you want to develop if you are talking about and a semantic prosthetic at and ay i assistant to your cognitivabilities the more spy things that we think about in the coming decades that it is an important caviar when you are evaluating these technologies they really want it to be something that you can expand coffin to the scyphi let us take us a step further because as you are saying this ism realizing that people have been doing exactly what curl link is trying to do now for a very long time lemme give you an example people who are blind you have no pattern vision have used canes for a very long time now the cane is not a a chip it is not a an electrode it is not neosensory none of that stuff what it is is essentially a a stick that has an interface with a surface it swept back and forth across the group it and translating what would otherwise be visual use into some ostensory use and we know that blind people are very good at understanding even when they are approaching say a curb edge because they are integrating that information from the tip of the cane m up through their some outisensory quarters and their motor quartets with other things the changes in the the wind and the sound as a round corner and a from imaging a a corner in san francisco down town whence s you get to the corner s a completely different set of auditory cues and very often we know and this because my laboratory worked on visual repaper for a long time and talk to a lot of blind people used different devices to navigate the world that they are not aware of the fact that there integrating these other cues but they none the less do them subconsciously and in doing get pretty good at navigating with a cane an now cane is not perfect but you can imagine the other form of of navigating as blind person a which is to just attach yourself or attached to you another nervous system the best that we know being a dog a sited dog that can cue you again with a stopping at a curb's edge or even if their some individuals that might seem a will sketchy dogs are also very good at sensing different a arousal states in others threat danger i mean t they are exquisite at it right years what were really talking about is taking a cane or another biological system he bench a whole nervous system and saying this other nervous systems job is to get you to navigate more safely through the world in some sense what neurotic is trying to do is that but with robotics to insert them and chips which raises the the the question woe a say finally a question the question is this we hear about be m i brain machine interface which is really what nerving specializes in we also hear about a i and or example where there is great promise in great fear we hear about machine learning as well to what extent can these brain machine interfaces learn the same way a sene i dog would learn but unlike a sene i dog continue to learn over time and get better and better and better because it is also listening to the nervous system that it is trying to support put simply what is the role for a i in machine learning in the type of work that you are doing that is the verst question i i think it goes both ways basically what you are doing is taking a very crude software intelligence i would say not exactly a full full blown a i but some well designed software that can adapt to changes in firing of the brain and your coupling it with another form of intelligence a human intelligence and you are allowing the two to learn each other undoubtedly the human that has aneling device will get better at using at over time undoubtedly the software that the berlin engineers have written we will adapt to the firing patterns that that the device is able to record and over time focus in on meaningful signals toward movement right if unnerve is fire high firing rate when you intend to move the mouse curse up and to the right it does not know that when it starts when you first put this in it is just a random series of signals as far as the chinos but you start correlating it with what the person what the person wants to do as expressed in a series of games you you assume that that the person wants to move the mouse on the screen to the target that is shown because you tell them that is the gold and you start correlating the activity that you record when they are moving toward an up and write target on a screen with that firing pattern an similarly for up and left down and left down an right and you develop a model am semi intelligently in the soft ware for what the person is intending to do and let the person run wild with it for a while and they start to get better at using the model presented to them by the by the software as expressed by the mouse moving or not moving properly on the screen right it is imagine a scenario where you are asking somebody to play piano but that the sound that comes out of each key randomly shifts over time am very difficult problem but a human brain is good enough a with the aid of softwood to solve that problem and and map well enough to a semi sable state that they are going to know how to use that mouse even when they say turn the vice oft for the night come back but the next day and some of the signals have shifted s you are describing this i am recalling a recent experience i got one of these am rowers for to a exercise am and i am well aware that there is a proper to stroke and there is a a improper ostrich and am most everybody including me who is never been coached in rowing am gets on the ting and pushes with your legs and pulls with your arms and back and it is some mix of incorrect and may be a smidgin of correct type am execution there is a function within the rower that allows you s gesso me to play a game where you can actually am every downstroke you generate a arrows o towards dartboard and it knows whether not you are generating the appropriate forces of the given am segment to the row the initial pull when you are lean back et camera and adjust the trajectory of the arrow that when you do a proper row stroke it gets closer to a bulls eye and it is very satisfying because you now have a visual feed back that is unrelated to this am the kinds of instructions that one would expect owe finger hip a bit more or you misplay your knees a bit more reach more with your arms a pull for rest with your back all the rowers are probably cringing as i say this as a realizing the what is exactly the point which is i do not know how to row but over time simply by paying attention to whether to the arrow is hitting the bull's eye or not more or less frequently you can improve your to stroke and get as i understand pretty close to optimal to stroke a in the same way that if you had a coach there telling you hey do this and you that we we really talking about here is narrowly feed back sire is that analogy similar to what your describing that is a great analogy i humans are really good at learning how to play games i in software someday o games are an some platform for us to use as a training environment for people to get better at controlling these things in fact it is it is the default and the obvious way to do it as to have people and monkeys playvitio games do you play the dames ye sire we be m games bet see i play old ones ism a little nestalject i i the old blizzard game stagecraft and aircraft oman do not even know those i remember the first apple computers i i ma i i hold or you i forty three o gay fortis e have wore now as of a few days ago i havoc birthdays were a lo it offset there i can recall a missions punch out your origin or intend no games to on a in others can hardy a be the game that games you're describing i i do not recall that a minor standing is that the newer games sir a far more sophisticated in some respects i i did recently find time to play cyropunk m which was really satisfying and may be appropriate s ta game where the characters are all fully a mothered out with sibrnatic in plants not perfect but the the root of the game as run around to shoot things i may be not different from dock hunt or whatever from our childhoods reason ask about video games is a there is been some controversy as to whether not they are making young brains better or r worse and i think some of the work from madam lazulis lab at you see are and other laboratories have shown that actually provided that am children in particular adults are also spending time in normal face to what is call them more traditional a face to face interactions that a vino games can actually make a nervous systems that is people a much more proficient at learning an motor execution sure a visual detection a an on anon yet there is some work a showing that surgeons are better if they play to do games was i try to squeeze same as e a professional development activity very well i am sure you regretting cheers from the a from those that video games out there and am some of the parents were trying to get there gets to play the fewer video games are are cringing but that we will let themsettle a they are familial disputes a among themselves that's talk about pigs sure curl link has been am quite generous i would say in announcing there discoveries and their goals at nigh i one o high this because i think it is quite unusual for a company to do this ism probably an earn a few enemies by saying this am despite the fact that i have always owned apple devices and from the south bay a mean of the apple design team is notoriously critic about what they are going to do next or when the next honor computer is going to come out is is is vaulted to am i a serious extent curl link has been a pretty open about their gals m with the understanding that goals change and half to change a and one of the things that they have done which i think is marvelous is they have held am on line symposia where you and some other colleagues of mine from the hero since common can dams a tremendous respect for and melon an others a they are at curl link have shared some of the progress that they have made in experimental animals ism highlighting this because i think am if one takes a step back i mean just for most people to a know about and realize that there is experimentation on animals implantation of electrode and on is it self a pretty bold moved because that understandably evoke some strong emotions a in people and a in some people evokes extremely strong emotions sure a negro link did one such symposium where they showed implant devices in pigs right then they did another one you guys did another one we a it was implant offices in monkeys right i assume at some point there will be one of these public simply were a the implant offices will be in a human what was the rational for using pigs a ism told pigs are very nice creatures ism told that they are quite smart right a and for all my years as a hero scientist and having worked admittedly on every species from a mice to cuttlefish to humans to hamsters to i i confess a very cornoorsh species which i no longer do i work on humans now for various reasons i never in my life thought i would see a implant device in the cartels of a pig sure why work on pigs ye well it mi let me say first a darling is almost entirely composed of animal loving people a the people at darling are obsessive animal lovers a there are signs up all around the office i a spontaneously put up by people within the organization talking about how we want to save animals we want to protect animals if there was any possible way to help people the way we want to help people without using animals in our research we would do it a it is just not known how to do that right now and we are completely restricted to making advances to getting a device approval through the f die by first showing that it is incredibly safe in animals and as is the case for any medical advancement especially ma do one a high this that the the f t e and the other governing bodies am oversee these types of experiments and insure that there done with a minimum of discomfort to the animals of course but a i think there's an inherent species right o in a in most humans not all some people truly see equivalents between a lizard and a human lizard life being equivalent human life most human beings i think in particular human beings who themselves a of loved ones the re suffering from diseases that they a hope could be cured at some a view themselves as species and feel that if you have to work on a biological system in order to solve the problem am working on a non human animals first make sense to most people sure but certainly there's a category of people that feels very strongly in the opposite direction sure and i think we would probably be having a very different conversation around animal research if we were not you know we is a species we as a culture were not just casually slaughtering millions of animals to eat them a every single day and that is a back ground against which that the relatively mniscual number of animals used in research it it becomes almost impossible to understand why some one would point to that ridiculously small number of animals i used in research when the vast vast majority of animals that humans use and and their lives are are done for food for prefer or for fur or these other reasons that people have historically used animals we in in that context we do animal research because we have to there is no other way around it if tomorrow a laws were changed and the it e said o k you can do some of this early experimentation in willing human participate that's be a very interesting option i think there be a lot of people that would step up and say yes a ism willing to participate in early stage clinical research you already volunteered i am and i i would not be alone and that is a potential way that animals could may be be spared a being unwilling participate in this m on that note to whatever extent possible i think darling goes i really really far much much farther than any one give ever heard of any organization have ever heard of an anything of ever seen a to give the animals agency in every aspect of the research i we have just an incredible team of people looking out for the animals and trying to design the experiments such that their as purely opt in as humanly possible a no animal is ever compelled a to participate an experiments beyond the surgery itself i if say on a given day a our star monkey pager does not want a play video games for smoothy no one forces em to ever this is a very important point and i want a few people to really what mad is saying here am obviously the animals are being researched on a four natural link they do not get to opt in to popped out of the experiment am but what he saying is that they play these games during which neural signals are measured from the brain because the have electrode in planting their brain through a surgery that thankfully to the brain is painless right no pain receptors in the brain am and our playing for reward this is very different very different then the typical scenario in laboratories around the world where people experiment on mice monkeys some cases pigs or other species in which the typical arrangement is to water deprive the animals we never do that and then have the animals work for their daily ration of water am and some people rehearing this impavything whole that is barbaric and here ism not trying to point a fingers that the people doing that kind of work i just think it is important that people understand how the work is done in order to motivate an animal to play o video game depriving them of something that they yearn for is a very efficient way to do that we do not do that we they have free and full access to food this entire time they are not hungry they are not thirsty the only thing that would motivate them is if they want treat extra to their normal rations a but there's there is never any deprivation the is never any adverse negative stimuli that pushes them to do anything us say ism impressed by that decision am because training animals to do tasks in laboratory settings is very hard and the reason many researchers have defaulted to water deprivation and at having animals work for a ration of water is because frankly it works it allows people to finish their oh to ear their pooch more quickly then having to a wait around am and trend figure out why a there monkey is not working that day in fact having known a number of people who have done these kinds of experiments i remember n them in my lab am my monkey is not working to day is a a common a and gripe among graduate soon supposed show do this kind of work am end for people work on mice o case to this is am a very important information to get across am and there is no public relation statement a woven into this as just we are talking out the nature of the research but i think it unimportant that people are aware of this yes one of the one of the under appreciated innovations out of drink is how far the animal careteam has ben able to to move in the dire action of humane treatment of these goes wonderful what as an animal lover myself i can only say wonderful why pigs ye pigs are they are actually fairly commonly used in medical device research am more you knowing the cardiac area their hearts are somewhat similar to human hearts how big are these pigs hi seen little pigs an i seem big pigs tether there is arrange there is a bunch of different varieties of pig there is bunch of different species that am you can optimize for different a characteristics there is many pigs there is a yorkshires there is a what lot of different kind of pigs that we use in different contexts n when we are trying to optimize a certain characteristic am ye a the pigs are we do not necessarily need them to be smart or task performers although occasionally we have trained them to walk on a tread mill a when we are studying how their limbs move after some of our spinal cord research am but we are not recording interesting say cognitive data out of their minds the really just a a biological platform with a skull that is close enough in size and safe to humans to be a valid platform to study the safety of the device unlike a monkey or a human a pig i do not think i can reach out and and hid it my a button we are a lever exact power they signaling that they saw or i sense to something yes again the the pigs are really just a safety platform to say the device is safe to implant it does not break down or cause any kind of toxic reaction the monkeys are are we are really doing our heavy lifting in terms of insuring that we are getting good signals out of the device that that what we expect to see in humans is validated on the functional level in in monkeys first butts talk about the skull ye years ago you and i were enjoying a come vernation about the very sorts of thingsthat were discussing to day and you said the skull is actually a pretty lousy a biological adaptation far better would be a titanium plait you spoken a true gurus surgeon a with the already receiver implanted in his hand but in all seriousness drilling through the skull with a too millimeter whole certainly do not do this at home folks am please do not do this but am it that yes a that is a small a entry sight but i think most people cringe when they hear about that or think about that and it obviously has to be done by a nurse surgeon with all the appropriate am a environmental conditions in place to women infection what did you mean when you said that the skull is a poor adaptation in a titanium plate would be better and in particular what dos that mean in reference to things dramatic brain injury i mean our human beings unnecessarily vulnerable at the level of dramatic brain injury because our skulls are just not am hard enough maybe on being too harsh about skull the skull is e very good at what it does given the tools that we are working with as biologic organisms that develop in our mother's uterus a the skull is usually the appropriate size it is one of the hardest things in your body a that said there are couple puzzling vulnerabilities a some of the thinnest bone in the skull is in the temporal region this is nurse surgeons we all know that i am heading toward a feature that sometimes darkly is called god's little joke where the very thin bone of the the temporal part of the skull has one of the largest arteries that goes to the lining of the brain right attached to the inside events this this bone just to the side of your eye tends to fracture if your struck there and the sharp edges of that fractured bone very often cut an artery called the middle manindial artery that leads to a big blood clot that crushes the brain the how a lot of people with a otherwise would be a relatively minor injury and up dying i is this large blood clot developing from high pressure arterial blood that crushes the brain ism in why would you put the artery right on the inside of the very thin bone that is most likely to fracture it is an enduring mystery but this is probably the most obvious failure mode and in the design of a human skull otherwise in terms of general impact resistance i think the brain is a very hard thing to protect and that the architecture of human anatomy probably given all other possible architectures that cauterize from i development it is not that bad really i one of the interesting features and terms of shock absorption the hopefully prevents a lot of dramatic brain injury is the fluid sheath around the brain tattle brain you may know is i it is mostly fat it floats in salt water i n our brains or brains are all floating in in salt water and with rapid acceleration deceleration that a sheath of salt water adds a marvelous protective a cushion against development of bruising of the brain say or bleeding in the brain man i think for any flaws in the design that do exist i you you can imagine things being a lot worse and there is probably a lot fewer they eyes than would exist if a human designer was taken a first crack at it as you describe the the thinness of this temporal bone in the in the presence of a critical artery just beneath it i ism thinking about most helmets am and here i also ant a cue up the fact that well whenever we hereabout am t b my or c t brain injury people always think football hokey but most dramatic rain injuries or things car accidents or construction work i it is not football and hawker that for some reason football an hawker and being get all the attention am what my colleagues that work on dramatic rain injury tell me that most of the dramatic rain injury they see somebody slips at a party and hits their head or am i is in a car accident or environment a miremental accidents of various kinds to my mind most helmets do not actually cover this region close to the eyes an is there is there also a failure of a helmet engineering that am it can unison why you would want to have your puerperal vision out the sides of a your eyes a perfume of your eyes but it seems to me if this is such critical real estate why why is not it being better protected am no expert in helmets but am i do not think we see a lot of spider he atoms in sports injuries i to get this kind of injury usually need a really focal blunt drama the baseball back to the head is a classic a mechanism of injury a that would lead to to a temporal bone fracture and epidraymatoma am with sports injuries you do not often see that especially in football with you know i sharp sharper a object coming in contact with the head it's usually another helmet wright is the the mechanism of injury i i i cannot think off the top my head of an instance of this exact injury type and sports you spent a bedtime poking around in brains of humans m and well i realize this is not yourairy of expert each a you are somebody who i am aware you cures about his health and the health of your family and thing generally people's health when you look out on the landscape of things that people can do and should not do if their desire is to keep their brain healthy do any am any data or any particular practices come to mind i thing we have all heard the obvious one do not do not get ahead injury if you get ahead injury ma sure gets treated and do not get a second head injury but those are sort of a type am answers that ism able to give some trade about the answers that ism perhaps ism not able to give well that the obvious ones at is when they do you talk about a lot a and i see a lot of the the smouldering wreckage of humanity in the operating room and in the emergency room for people that come in i i work my practices in san francisco wright next to the underline and a lot of people that and up coming in from the underline have been drinking just spectacular amounts of alcohol for a long time and their brains are a very often on the scans that look small walnuts inside their empty skull there is much atrophy that happens with can alcohol soaked brain chronically that i would say that is far and away the most common source of brain damage that many of us just volunteer for and it is when you look at them morbidity can the the human harm you aggregate that is done it is mystifying that that it is a not something that we are all paranoid about we him people think that i do not drink at all it'll occasionally have they drink i i could a take our her leave it frankly fall the all call on the plan disappeared i would not notice but i you occasionally have a drink maybe one greater or something that but i am shocked at am the current state of affairs around alcohol consumption in advertising et camera when i look at the date mainly out of the cape brain bank which basely shows that for every drink that one has on a regular basis when you go from zero to one drink per week there's more brainatrophy thinning of the gray matter quarter you go from one to two more thinking to from two to three and there is a near linear relationship between the amount that people are drinking in the mount of brainatrophy and to me it is it is a sort of obvious from the these large scale studies that am as you point out alcohol atrophies the brain it it kills parents and i do not have any bias against alcallar people that drink i know many of them but it does seem to me kind of shocking am that were talking about the respray tall and red wine which is at infantestaly small amounts and i am clear respect trails good for us anyway rather way am a matter of debate i should point out but am algal certainly alcalde excesses bad for the brain sir am in terms of a o case we have head hits bad alcohol bad am your working as you mention year the tenderloin am is the any awareness that am amphetamine use can can disrupt rain structure or function that that is not an variant i spent a lot of time researching and i i incidentally take care of people that have used every substance known to man in quantities that are n a spectacular but i i have not specifically done research i in not dream not superwell verse on the literature i ask him part because am maybe you know a collide or will come across the colleague whose work on this is either us such a am incredible increase in the use of things overall riddle and modaphinal armodaphinal which i think in small amounts in clinical clinically prescribe ism situations can be very beneficial but let us be honest many people are using these on a chronic basis and do not think we really know what it does to the rain aside from increasing addiction for those substances that is very clear well for better work for generating a massive data sat right now well put a i to briefly go back to our earlier discussion about narrow plasticity you you made an interesting statement which is that we are not aware of any am single brain area that one can stimulate in order to invoke plasticity read the salability of nerd architecture a years ago a michemersinic and colleaguesthat you see asap a did some experiments where they a stimulate nuclear psalms and paired that stimulation with a a kilahurt's tone or a in some cases they could also stimulate a a different brain area the ventraltigmental area a which causes release of doping ampere it with a tone and and n it seems every one of these cases they observed massive plasticity a now i look at those data and i compare them to the classic data a i think it was coral rashly that did these experiments with their take animals and they scoop out a little bit of quarter put the animal back into a learning environment and the and will do pretty well if not perfectly o they about a different region of quarter in a different animal and by the end of may be three four years of these kinds of lesion experiments they a referred to the equipotential of the quarter meaning they concluded that it did not matter which piece of the are you took out that there was no one critical area on the one end you have got these experiments that say and i do not really need a lot of the brain and indeed everyone erewhile a new story will come out where am built patient a person will going for brainpan for some other reason or in experiment and the person seems perfectly normal and the missing half their quarter and then on the other hand of these experiments the stimulation of basalts or vitae ere yet massive plastic from stimulation of one area i was have never been able to reconcile these kin s of discretion findings and it'd really just your opinion on this that you what is it about the brain as an organ that lets it be both critical at the level of individual neurons in circuit critical and yet at the same time on it is able to a circumvented what would otherwise seem massive lesions and holes you mean itself yet mean a lot of a lot of it to reconcile as experiments you at first account for the fact there probably in different species right i you take out a particular portion of a pig or a rabbit brain a small amount you might not see a difference but a small portion of a human brain say the part most interested in coordinating speech or finger movement and you can see profound losses or or visual correct right i take out a small portion of v one and you will you will have a visual deficit a and species matters age matters if you take out half of the brain in a very young baby that many has a reasonable chance of developing high a high degree of function a by having the remaining half subsume some of the functions lost on the other side a because they are very very young and their brain is still developing its a it is to some degree of blank slat with extremely high plasticity over many years that can overcome a lot of deficits a taking in adult animals brain that is not very well differentiated functionally to begin with you might not see those deficits apparently there is a lot of redundancy as well right there is a lot of a cerebellar and spinal circuits in other animals that generates teletype behavior patterns and might not need the brain at all to to perform say a walking movement or or some other sequence is of motor activities a it lot of that depends on the e pedimental set up i would say in general adult humans are very vulnerable to losing small parts of their brains and losing discreet functions i going to take the liberty of asking a question that merges across curl linkman tesla i could imagine that course whether not their on autopilot mode or being driven by the human directly am and society generally would benefit from knowing whether or not a human is very alert or sleepy sure i do not know a tesla am perhaps this technology already exists but is there any idea that a simple censor maybe even of just eyelid position or pupil size or head position am could be introduced to a car the tesla or another car for that matter ye and resolve a a common problem which is that when people are lesser not just when people fall asleep but the simple drop in alertness that occurs when people are sleepy is a my read of the data is responsible for approximal a third third it is a credible of a accidents between vehicles and then of course some percentage of those are can be legal accidents som terms of a preserving life this might seem a minor case possess a major case cesarean i i have no unospecial inside under how teslas off to our works i know the have brilliant engineers am when i i have a tesla when i drive it it seems to know when ism looking at the road verses not and it yells at me if ism not looking at the roads how does it do that and what voice does it use there is a small camera a by the reveler and i think it is a simple eye track my my guess here is that it is a simple eye tracking program am and it may already be the case that it is implemented that it is detecting whether your eyes are o n or not obviously it is not a strict it is not stringent because some glasses a and have have seen forms on the introit were people tape over that small camera they they can vasgoodness you know i think they are devil making efforts to try to try to save lives here incredible i saying credible just because i think ism fortune enough to live in a lifetime where there there were no electric cars when in was growing upon now things are moving o fast a no one intended what is your wish for brain machine inter face and brain augmentation the let us let us assume that the the clinical stuff can be worked out or maybe you have a a a apart clinical condition that you just are am just yearning to see resolved the other that would be falling to but in addition to that way that you really just expand out let us ay we can am extend your life two hundred years or am working about the kind of world that your children are going to live in and their grandchildren will live in what do you think is really possible with brain augmentation and brain machine in her face and here please feel no bus whatsoever to answer in a way that reveals to us your am your incredible empathy and consideration of clinical conditions cause that is how you spend your days is fixing patience a and helping their lives be better if it lands in that category great but am forsake of a fun and forsake of delight and forsake of a really getting us the audience to to understand what is really possible here a please feel no shackles ye a well i i love the idea down the road and we are talking a ten year may be twenty year time frame a a human's just getting control over some of the horrible ways at their brains go wrong right i think everybody at this point has either known some one or second order known some not a friend of a friend who has been touched by a diction and or depression and suicide obesity these functions of the brain or or mouth functions of the brain or what drives me these are the things that i want to tackle in my career you know in terms of my kids lifetime ism thinking full human expansion a human cognition into a e i full immersion in the internet of your count of abilities a having no limitation for what you think as bottle necked by needing to read the wickapediarticle first ah to have the data to inform your thoughts a having communication with any one that you want to unrestricted by this flapping air past meat on your face ait is o a means of communication that is ridiculously prone to being misunderstood it is also a tiny narrow bottle neck of communication were trying to send messages back and forth through a tiny straw and there is no reason that needs to necessarily be true it is the way things have always been but it is not the way things are going to be in the future and i think there is a million very sift possibilities in terms of banding human minds together to be even more potent as a as a mufti unit a organism as an option a mufti brain these of things that are far down the road i cannot even directly see how they would be implemented but the technology were working on is a little crack in the door that allows some of the stuff to even be thought about in a realistic way to that to that point i encourage any one who is excited about things that specially mechanical engineers soft ore engineers robotics engineers come to the her link website and look at the jobs we have got we need the brightest people on the planet working on these the hardest problems i in the world i in my opinion and i if you want to work on the stuff come help us i have several responses hat's what you just said i first off it'll get tat the the least important one out of the way which is that years ago i applied for a job at nerd link i the nerd link website at that time was incredibly sparse i it was just said nerd lincoln is that if you're interested give us your emails i put my email there i got no response i the a they made a wise choice in an terrible a regain now a fast forward several years i am ism very grateful and i think very lucky i that you who passed through fortunately for me through my lab at one point and we had some a fun expeditions together in the wild an nerd explorations to talk about some other time as well as ism learning from you as you i pass through your time at stamford i but have arrived there at nerd lincolnd and it'll say that they're very lucky to have you and i folks can dams who have known for very long time a phenomenal her surgeons yourself nor scientists and i vision scientists can and others it is really an incredible mission i really want to start off by saying am thank you to you and all your colleagues there i know that nerd link is really tip of the spear in being public facing with the kinds of things they are doing and and being forth coming about how that work is done in animals and exactly what they are doing am and that is a very brave stance to take especially given the nature of the work but well that is classic ye on right he he does not keep secrets in public too commonly he tells you what he is going to do and then he does it and people are always amazed by that he releases the testlamaster plan and tells you exactly what the company intends to do for the next several years and people assume that there is some subterfuge that he is misdirecting but it is a it is right out there in the open and i think darling follows in that path of we want people to know what we are doing we want the brightest people in the world to come help us we we want to be able to help patience we want the most motive add patience with quadriplegia a visit our patient registry and and sign up to be considered for clinical trials that that will happen the future we will put a link to that by the way am maybe just at the direct call a could happen now you a this is for people who are quadriplegic or who know people who are quadriplegic who are interesting being part of this clinical trial it is a patient registry wright now that we are just collecting information to see who might be eligible for clinical trials that will happen in the future a we are still working with the f t e to hammer out the details and and get their final permission a to proceed with the trial right plus see the note a in the shownote at the incuse me in in the shownote captions for that i i want to think as for your stance a public facing and also doing the incredibly hard work i also think the robotics aspect which you have clarified for me a to day is extremely forward thinking and a absolutely critical a lot of critical engineering that no doubt will am wake out into other domains of narrow surgery and medical technology not just in serving car line mission directly and i really want to think you a first of all for coming here to day and a taking time out of our important schedule of seen patience and doing brain surgery literally happen i time away from your family and time away from your mission at nerllink briefly to a to share with people what you guise are doing as i mention before there there is a lot of mistake grounded and eve am despite e that that a berlin has gone out of the way to trying a rase some of that mistake a this to me is the clearest picture ever a to my knowledge that am has been given about what is going on there and and the the stated and the real mission and what is going on am at the level of of of nuts in bolts and gotten brains and this kind of thing and i really just want to thank you also for for being you which is a perhaps sounds a a a kind of an odd thing to hear but i think as made apparent by the device implanted in your hand you do not just am do this for a job you live in breathe and embody truly embody this stuff around am the nervous system and try to figure out he to fix it how to make it better and you live in breathe and i know your deep love for it i want to thank you for am not just the a brains that you put into it and the energy you put into it but also for the the heart that you put into it thinks for that and apprehend the i we we just want help people we want to make things better well i know that to be true knowing you and am thank you again for coming here to day and i look for to another round of discussion in am whenever the time happens to be when these incredible technologies have a spelled out to the next a major mansion thank you thank you for joining me for to day's discussion with doctor matter my dull all about the human brain and how it functions how it breaks down and the incredible efforts that are being carried out at berlin in order to overcome diseases of brain and nervous system function and to augment how the human brain works if you to learn more about doctor my gall's work and the specific work being done at nerllinck please see the links that we've provided in the shownote captions if you are learning to om and enjoying this podcast please subscriber you two channel that is the terrific zero castaway to

would me to cover on the superman labpodcast or guess that you me to consider inviting on the superman labpodcast please put that in the comments on you tore i do read all the comments in addition please check out the sponsors mentioned that beginning and throughout to day's episode that is the best way to support this podcast not much on to day's episode but on various previous episodes of the superman labpodcast we discuss supplements while supplements aren't necessary for everybody many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things enhancing sleep focus and hormone support the superman labpodcast is proud to have partner with momentous supplements if you to hear more about the supplements discussed on the superman labpodcast please go to live moments spelled o u best dot come slash superman again that is libmomentus dot come slash supermen if you are not already following thehuberman labpodcast on social media we are superman lab on inseam twitter casebook and lingo

welcome to the superman lapse a science science as to fry may druhubermen and om our professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing oral health now when most people her oral health they immediately think tooth health and appearance and presumably fresh breath or lack of bad breath as well and well of course tooth and breath freshness whiteness and health is a critical component of oral health to day you will learn that oral health including the real microfilm the alto of your pallet your tonsils indeed the entire oral cavity is an extremely important component of general bodily health much that to day we are going to add a seventh pillar to the called six pillars of mental health physical health and performance this is not a trivial step to add a seventh pillar to the six pillars if some of you have been listeners of this podcast for a while you may recall that the six pillars of mental health physical health and performance that is the six things that every one needs to invest specific protocols into each day are in no particular order by the way sleep sunlight and light exposure generally which by extension also includes dark exposure nutrition exercise which we could also call movement both party of vascular exercise and resistance training stress management and relationships and social engagement including relationship to health and to day we are going to add oral health and microfilm health and i suppose we could generally call this oral and got health because as you now if you think about it your mouth your oral cavity and your got are contiguous with one another we are going to add oral and got health as the seventh pillar of mental health physical health and performance because as you will learn to day there are many aspects of oral health and daily protocols for oral health that extend to cardiovascular health to metabolic health and indeed to brain health and to staving off diseases in all of those bodily compartment i cannot over emphasize an earth how much oral health influences your general bodily health to day you will learn health oral biology and health we will not go too deep into e biology but we will go deep enough into the biology that you will learn some incredible things such as your teeth have the ability to literally fillbackian cavities that have formed provided those cavities have not gone too deep into the teeth layers yet you will learn that saliva while most people think of it as just spit is an incredible substance fluid that contains all sorts of interesting and important things that allow you to re build the strength of your teeth and indeed to support the health of your oral cavity and got macrobaum and body generally saliva is superinteresting and important and to day you are going to learn many many protocols including zero cost protocols protocols that will actually save you money as well as some lo cost protocols to both restore improve and maintain oral health and in doing maintain and improve your overall bodily health before we begin i t emphasized at this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that time i the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is mating mating makes looseleef and ready to drink carbamate i often discuss yerbamate's benefits such as regulating blood sugar its high and the occident content the ways that it can improve digestion and possible hero protective effects i also drink carbamate because i love the taste while therefore a lot of different choices of carbamate drinks out there i love mating because again they have the no sugar variety as well as the fact that both their loose beef and their can varieties are of the absolute best quality much that i decided to become a partial owner in the company although i must say even if they had not allowed me to do that i would be drinking mating is the cleanest tasting and best carbamate you can find i love the taste of bred loosened mating carbamate and i particularly love the taste of marina's new canned cold brew zero sugar carbamate which i personally help them develop if you would to try mating go to drink mating daccom slash superman right now mating is offering a free one pound bag of looseleef carbamate ta and free shipping with the purchase of two cases of their cold brew carbamate again that drink mating daccom slash superman to get the free bag of carbamate loose beef the and free shipping to day's episode is also brought to us by rock rock makes eyeglasses and sunglasses that are of the absolute highest quality have spent he lifetime working on the biology of the visual system and i can tell you that your visual system has to contend with an enormous number of challenges in order for you to be able to see clearly under different conditions road understands this and designed all of their eyeglasses and sunglasses with the biology the visual system in mind now rock eyeglasses and sunglasses were initially developed for use in sport and as a consequence you can wear them without them s ripping off your face while running or cycling and their extremely light weight oka eyeglasses and sunglasses are also designed with a new technology called float fit which i really because it makes their eyeglasses and sunglasses fit perfectly and they do not move around even when ism active if ism running and ism wearing my glasses they stay on my face most thetimin owing remember them on my face because they are light weight you can also use them while cycling or for other activities if you would to try rock glasses go to rock that is a oke a dock calm and enter the cod superman to save twenty per cent off your first order again that is our o k a dock calm and enter the code superman at check out to day's episode is also brought to us by heck sleep hic sleep makes mattresses and pillows that are of the absolute highest quality have spoken many times before on this an other pod case about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance one of the anythings to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress matches your sleep requirements the relics website has a bright two minute quiz that if you go to it will ask you question such as do you sleep on your back your side are your stomach you tend to run hot or coal during the middle the night as well as some other questions that allow you to determine the optimal mattress for you when i took the quiz i personally match to their dusk mattress to you s k which has allowed me to significantly improve my sleep if you're interested and significantly improving your sleep go to relic sleep dock calm slash superman take their brief two minute quiz and they will match you to customize mattress and you will get up to three hundred fifty dollars off any mattress order and two free pillows again if you are interested in trying helices go to relic sleep dock calm slash superman for up to three hundred fifty dollars off and two free pillows of let us talk about oral health this absolutely critical aspect of locust having fresh bright teeth and no cavities and fresh breath or at least lack of bad breath one would hope but also total body health as i mention a obit earlier oral health is inextricably linked to all aspects of brain and bodily health both in the short term and in the long term and it is perhaps the most overlooked aspect of mental health and physical health to day it'd to start off with a quiz ism going to ask you which of the following three categories you believe you best fall into of the first category is those of you out there who brush and floss every day probably twice to day and who make some effort to try and keep your teeth clean who the feeling of your teeth being clean and who pay a fair amount of attention to whether not your teeth are getting wider or not getting wider if you whether not your breath is fresh or not fresh maybe of these are not requirements for being in this category but maybe your somebody who also uses a mouth wash or uses mince or gums in order to try in keep your mouth smelling and looking fresh an your mouth clean o this first category a does not require the you do all of those things but lets just make a basic requirement of participation in this category that you routinely brush at least twice to day and that you floss at least once o day of if you fall into that category you are in category one and by the way if you are in category one and you do those things and you do a bunch of other things tooth whitening and maybe you go to the dentist especially often more than the recommended twice per year that still puts you in category one of second category o t hose of you out there who are let us say a bit more blast about your oral and tooth care those of you that perhaps just brush your teeth in the morning that your breath is fleshing clean out that kind of sticky feeling inpour mouth that is accumulate it overnight that sometimes brush and may be floss at night but in all lot of times you fall asleep without doing theater you do not feel doing it or perhaps that do not really floss at all toque that perhaps go to the dentist once every six months maybe loess may be once year once everycouple years while there is a bunch of different things that could put you into category to let us make a basic requirement for belonging to category to that you brush your teeth once a day but not twice a day on a regular basis or that you brush twice o day but that you rarely floss o say that would put you into what ism calling category too and then of course there is the third category that may be some of you out there fall into and this is the category of people who are extremely diligent not just about tooth care but also about oral health generally about maintaining the michrobiom of your mouth about making sure that your gums are very healthy about making sure that your soft palate and hard palate is very healthy about making sure that yes your teeth are clean that they are devoid of as much bacterial build up and other stuffing there that can cause cavities but also that your paying careful attention to your oral microfilm and the overall miles of your health in the mouth end the fact that your mouth is linked to all these different aspects of brain and cardiac and metabolic health of if you fall into that third category great but let us be honest most people i would argue ninety five maybe even ninety eight per cent of people or more fall in to either category one or category too as your hearing this your probably think yo o we while film in category one ism good right i go to the dentist twice year i brush and floss you mouth wash i even brighten my teeth i i make sure that if i had a sugary meal it'll rings out my mouth i try not to drink acidic foods things that will discuss to day as to whether not they actually have relevant for cavity formation or not but guess what if you are in category one as i described it or category too chances are you are doing things to really deplete and disrupt your oral health that is right even if your paying a lot of attention to tooth health chances are if you are most people out there simply because you do not have the latest information on what oral health really is and how to best support it chances are you are doing things that yes might be keeping your teeth white and clean and you are not getting cavities or you are not being told you have cavities that need to be filled when you go to the dentist twice a year or more but that you are disrupting your oral health in ways that are depending other aspects of your brain and bodily health and ism not here to scare you ism just here to tell you that if you are category one oke you are clearly doing some things that are beneficial for you but that there is some additional things that you can do in a few things to avoid doing that very likely will improve your over all bodily health very quickly and the good news as listings are also zero or low foster and some cases can save you substantial cost now if you are in category too chances are you are pleading both your oral health and your over all bodily health but here is what is interesting some of the folks in category too that are not doing as much for the let us say hygiene and freshening and whitening of their teeth actually have a healthyour overall oral microbus that is not always the case but often it can be the case wat you are going to discover today is whether you are in category one or category too there is some wonderful and easily accessible practices that are well backed by science and by the way in preparation for this episode i also consulted with no fewer than five dentist including a petiatrictentis i thought to appariodontis i talk to people who fall into the functional dentist category i talked people with a bunch of different orientations who are all heavily qualified to talk about and to make recommendations about oral health and tooth health et camera and what ism going to deliver today is essentially the overlap in the vandiagram of what they all agreed on all highlight a few differences that they each had and that several of them had they do fall into different camps but i was positively surprised how much overlap or consensus there was in terms of best protocols for tooth and oral health and by the way for in that third category of the person that is doing a lot for their tooth health and appearance and breath et camera but also oral health and microbus ism sure that to day you will also learn some new health practices an some things that willow you to expand on your already terrific practices for oral health let us get into the material about oral health focussing first on tooth anatomy and health and some limit about mouth anatomy i promise to not go into this in too much depth but we really need to have a firm basis a foundation of understanding of what the mouth cavity really consists of and ism not just going to throw bunch and names out there for sake of knowing later out on you to cloud your hypicampus with that sort of information unless it is functional information but it is critical functional information for the rest of our discussion where we will talk about weighs that you can really build up the strength of your teeth even if cavities of already stared to form and how to really get your saliva to be the best healthiest saliva for your overall mouth and for your gut and for your brain your heart et camera ocasalit is talk just briefly i promise briefly about the anatomy and a obit of the physiology of the this stuff oke the teeth were all familiar with what teeth are and tongue the tonsils in the back the mouth we have a soft pallet hard pale gums let us talk obit about how all that fits together centering around the thing that most people think about when they think about oral health that is the teeth it is just a good jumping off point for us your teeth are layered structures pretty much every structure in your body is a layered structure s just the way those structures form cells are born at one location they migrate out and form stacks or layers those different layers have different cell types and your teeth are no exception while they're different kinds of teeth in your mouth teeth have an outer layer which is the enamel the enamel believe it are not is not white it is translucent like can make it through but its not transparent not a clear window is translucent can make it through but its a bit opaque beneath the enamel is a structure called dentin dentin is important for to day's discussion because as it turns out cavities form not surprisingly from the outside of teeth inward and cavities as the names suggest are holes that bacteria burrow down through the enamel and if your unlucky make it down to the dentin our goal meaning your goal is to engage in daily protocols that is right daily protocols that are simple and fast and zero or very low cost that allow you to avoid the formation of those cavities yes but also that can allow you to fill in those cavities this is one of the most important things to understand about oral health that frankly i did not know until i start researching this episode and talking all these experts in the field which is that you can repair cavities that have started to form that is right your mouth environment based on its chemistry end some things that are mechanical but mostly based on its chemistry in particular how acidic it is or how basic it is is always in a state of what is called either d mineralization or demineralization now those words are hard to say in their special hard to say fast demineralization demineralizations o a bit of a tongue twister today ism going use a short hand that is a convention in the dentistry field which is demon or semen to refer to demineralization or demineralization demineralization is good it is the process by which within the enamel and to some extent in the deeper dentin layer of the tooth but especially within the enamel there can be the addition of new minerals that form very robot essentially chains of crystals okay if you have ever looked at a crystal of any kind under a microscope or you have seen a picture of it they are incredibly well organized they form a lattice of very strong often although there weaker crystals to very strong bonds and structure its the structure of a really well formed building oke demineralization is the process of putting minerals back into that crystal structure and it is actually possible to fill back in those cavities that bacteria have started to form especially when those cavities have burrow down into the enamel but have not yet made it into the dentin layer of the tooth or teeth o this is very important understand it is especially important understand the context of the fact that typically not always but typically if you have a cavity formed at one tooth and let say it is just half way or three corners of the way through the enamel layer that if you have cavities elsewhere in your mouth chances are that they are at the same depth or level not always but chances are and that is great news if those cavities have not yet made it into the dentin layer wise at great news while i do not know about you but i do not having my teeth drilled i do not having cavities drilled and filled i had a very dramatic childhood with respect too dentistry and aural health it'll talk about it obit later in the episode it is not that i had tons and tons of cavities i actually have this other issue where my dust teth came in behind my baby teeth had of all my baby teeth pulled i that to get a bunch of injections of novice in my mouth an in getting injections into my mouth i opted have any cavities i had drilled without knovicane it is not cause i was a tough little kid although that only tough in me up it was because i hate having strings in my mouth i might have even baton a dentist or too or three i do not bite the dentist any more i thank the dentist by the way i think dentist are wonderful regular cleanings are wonderful will talk about frequency of cleanings but here is the point if you are somebody who enjoys getting your teeth drilled well then i do not know what to say but if you are most people out there with proper wiring of your neurology we then you do not getting your teeth drilled and you can avoid it in many cases bi remineralizing that enamel layer of your teeth now if there is demineralization down to the deeper dentin layers of the tooth then most often you are going to need it to be drilled drilled and filled as they say or is some people say which has a bit more cynical drill fill and bill cause you get charged for that or your insurance gets charged or that o k back to some tooth anatomy and mouth anatomy talks about the enamel layer of the too on the outside i told you that either can demineralize demon or demineralize semen this is a key point your teeth are always in a state of either demon or semen that is right either demon or semen it is not both at the same time it is one or the other and it is largely dependent on the p h that is the acidity of your mouth which is largely dependent on how much saliva you are producing and the mineral content of that saliva keep that in mine i thin it is a very important point now another key point is that next to your teeth you have your gums the gingiva as it is called now the gingiva provides a really important roll in keeping the teeth stable we do not often think of it that but you've though hat stuff seems gummy and soft it is soft tissue it is very important for fixing the teeth to the bone it is not just about the roots that extend down into he jawbone below the gums are very important for keeping the teeth where they are hit i steal alignment too between gums and the teeth thatreside to obit deeper but the gums form a critical barrier between the oral cavity and the deeper layers of what eventually is bone and into the general blood flow or blood stream of the body now this is important to understand that the gums are a seal around the tooth this is why when you go to the dentist they're paying attentionwent that loll pick there saying attention to how high or hopefully low the tenting is the the the recesses or pockets of gums along the the i hear got agave my my the hanging within in my mouth yes it'll try not to do that during to day's episode point to my teeth much that ism then you cannot understand what ism saying that the gums are providing a seal between the oral cavity and essentially the bone and the general blood stream now this is critical because lets just take a step back and think about the oral cavity and what a remarkable place it is think about it this is a gaping hole in our body can we have some other gaping holes in our body but those ten to be spinster base holes yes i realize the price some chuckles as soon you say spinster yes the anal sinter cat were analogous were biologist we can talk about that stay shut stuff is generally not going up there and if it is not very often okay your nasal passages that those are holes but you ow there is a lot of stuff the there is mucus to catch stuff there is a cribriform plate there is a bone there's a bunch of things that acts barriers between the nasal cavities and the brain which sits right behind it the of factory bulb and yes we have eyes and then e have the outside of the eyes and there is a a susceptibility there but we have our blink see flags there is a also an ocular microsome there is a bunch of things there but think about the just this gaping hole in the front of our face that we use to eat and speak and breathe get it is a huge hole and as a consequence it is filled with bacteria from our outside environment all day long all day long sometimes at night although we are going to talk later about the critical critical need to be a nasal breather at night and not a mouth breather not just for sake of staving off sleep pane a but also because turns out the dryness of the mouth is one of the ways that you really can throw off your oral health in major ways back it is one of the leading causes of tooth decay and people methamphetamine attics or if you see be with at your mouth breathers there oral health and the teeth generally but certainly their oral health is severely to pleat it to gathers big hole in your from for face and your talking and eating and moving about during the day even if your nasal breather when you are not talking your eating and all the bacteria's getting in and it is a really moist environment and it is really warm the commination of bacteria moist and for means that this thing is a poetry dish for growing stuff that could potentially be really bad for us but it has this incredible feet sure which is that if the p h is right then the bad stuff is killed off does not make it and our system does not destruct our or health or our bodily health it also as a critical feature which is that the bacteria that are good for us proliferate and supports the sealing process of the gums against the teeth and tooth health and tongue health and pallet health et camera was the re cavity is amazing by virtue of how vulnerable it is but also how robust it is and the way it stays robust is by keeping the saliva healthy now there are other ways too but that is one of the main ones and it is a huge portal into the rest of the body and if the or cavity is into making you already base on what you have heard thus far think about this if you get a cut on your arm or your hand ore your shin unless your one of these remarkable people that always heals up without a scar as long as you are about twenty five years ore older typically you will form a love scar there will be something noticeable there the work cavity also can take cuts and burns and things that unfortunately those things occur but with rare exception heals up with nearly zero scarring sometimes there is a scar but nearly zero scarring which is remarkable why well it is basely an open wound with a bunch of bacteria and and its warm and it is moist clearly there is something special going on in this thing that we call the oral cavity indeed there is and it is anchored in the fact that if we treat it right you can encourage demineralization how do you do that by keeping the saliva healthy how do you do that by supporting the proper bacteria within the mouth and making sure that you are eliminating the bacteria that you do not want or at least limiting those bacteria to day we are going o talk about how to do that and by virtue of doing all the things that support tooth health you are also going toe support gum health can those gums are critical because they form that barrier that if it gets too big if those pockets those recesses get too big and you are not taking care of the bacterin your mouth in you are not getting rid of the bad bacteria those bacteria worm their way down into the deeper recesses near the roots of the tooth sometimes into the tooth will talk about that and can get down into the bone and then can cause serious serious issues his is call periodontal disease and periodontal disease is a social with all sorts of really bad stuff including alsheimers o canthus is not just some wellness culture woo science leap to alsheimers there is literally evidence that the specific bacterias that cause recession of the gums can cross the blood brain barrier if they make it into the general circulation and potentially cause places and tangle some of the hallmark features of nerd degeneration in alsheimers of probably not the only cause of alsheimers but potentially one of the major causes is a new theory but it is one that a lot of people r shine to pay attention to and it is also very clear the bacteria make it down into the deeper recesses near the roots and into the bone that you can end up with issues relate to cardiac health and certainly metabolic health case o again the got to day is not to scare you it is not to spend too much time on all the terrible things that can happen but rather to emphasize the positive which is if you do the right things at the right times especially if you do them on a regular basis that you can really improve the health of your total oral cavity and your teeth and your breath and all the other stuff that people care about for aesthetics and into personal interactions will flourish as well i to take a brief moment and think one of our sponsors and that is a g one a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that also contains adaptions i started taking a g one away back in two thousand and twelve the reason i started taking it in the reason i still take it every day is that it insures that i meet all of my quotas for vitamins and minerals and it insures that i get enough periotic and robotic to support got health now god health is something that over the last ten years we realize is not just important for the health of our got but also for our mine system and for the production of nauru transmitters and nauromodulators things dopamine and ceratonent in other words god health is critical for proper brain functioning now of course i strive to consume healthy whole foods for the majority of my nutritional intake every single day but there are number of things in a g one including specific micronutrient that are hard to get from who foods ore at least in sufficient quantities g one allows me to get the vitamins and minerals that i need robotics robotics the adaptagens and critical micronutriancs any time somebody asks me if they were to take just one supplement what that supplement should be i tell them a g one because a g one support many different systems within the body that are involved in mental health physical health and performance to try a g one go to drink a g one dot calm slash supermen and you will get a year supply of vitamin d three k two and five free travel packs of a g one again that to drink a g one dot calm slash supermen o k let us talk about how cavities form because i think this is the major question that people ask when asking about or thinking about moral health as i mention before cavities are literally hols the registrations as the nerves call them hurts me call them registrations will holes down into the enamel that if they make it down to the dentin layer of the tooth most likely do need to be drilled and filled and presumably billed o k but your goal i think all of our goal is to try and keep our teeth in a state of demineralization by keeping the p h that is the relative acid alkaline balance of the mouth such that the saliva supports demineralization now let us think about how a cavity actually forms turns out that no specific food not even sugar causes cavities cavities are not caused by sugar cavities are caused by bacteria that feed on sugar and tow that is not just a little bit of a twist in the mechanism that is a critical point there is no specific food not even pure sugar not even a hard candy a delicious jolly ranchers those when i was a kid that get stuck in your tooth that causes cavities no it is the bacteria that feed on sugar that then produce acid that burrows down through that degrades that d mineralize the tooth in this very focal area that we call a cavity of now if that is not surprising enough get this the bacteria that causes cavities by eating sugar and releasing this acid while there are several of them the major one is called streptococcus mutant or what it'll call strep mutant for short strep mutant is not something you are born with it is actually a communicable bacteria that is right you give it to one another through how sharing of glasses sharing of bottles kissing on the mouth et camera now i am not here to tell you not to do any of those things ism certainly not here to tell you that however and by the way in researching this episode i did learn that there is a specific category of person out there typically they are a dentist or married to a dentist that have opted believe it or not to never kiss their children near or on the mouth as to help their children not get streptococcus mutant because almost all adults carry it not all but it is communicable a at i or a flue or a cold it is communicated between individuals we are not born with it now that is a whole area of a let just call it biososhoal ethics decision making that i think most people are not going to be to concerned with or at least act on because let us face it most people are not going to change their over all behavior of kissing or usage of bottles or glasses in order to avoid getting strep mutant most people in the world half strep mutant or will get strep mutant and it lives in the mouth it just resides there strep mutant is there and it is hungry what is it hungry for sugar when there sugar present it eats it it produces acid the acid produces cavities taking teeth from a state of demineralization to demineralization or and by the way this is really important if your mouth is already in a state that is for d mineralization mode to speak well then it will capitalize on that and it will cause cavities much faster o k keep in mind that acidity is bad for the mouth does that mean that you should never consume a lemon or and by the way yes ism guilty of everyone smile chi a lemon slice or drinking water with lemon an it or carbonated drinks or it does or tea or anything that has acidic flavor no likewise should you completely avoid in jesting any kind of sugar because strep mutant love sugar no turns out strep mutant sugars in the form of complex carbohydrate sugars too if you e post arise wrote meal bread every once in while as i do on manominivor mean fish and eggs and also starches and vegetables and fruits am an omnivore as most people are well then sip mutant has an opportunity to eat the sugars that come from those other carbohydrates does that mean that if you were to have a zero carbohydrate diet no sugars no strange et camera you would reduce the opportunity for strep mutant to consume sugar and release acid may be may be however most people will not do that and strep mutant is a very clever maybe even diabolical bacteria and if you are on a zero carbohydrate zero sugar die there some evidence that strep mutant will figure out ways to feed on other components of food in order to create this acid to then create cavities in your teeth the key thing to understand here's that cavities form not from foods not from sugars per we but from strep mutants and other bacteria that eat tho sugars and create acid hence the critical need to keep your mouth as alkaline as possible which does not mean that you can ever drink some lemon water r coffee tea heres the key point that every one needs remembrance because this dove tills beautifully into how often you should brush and floss and when you should brush and flow specifically the key point is the degree to which your mouth is in a demon state or a demon state and the degree to which cavities have the opportunity to form is dependent on the amount of time the amount of time in which your mouth is net acidic or net alkaline the amount of time that you are in a demineralization mode or demineralization mode case its the amount of time no one no one can avoid having their mouth be acidic every once in while or investing a sugar or a food that strep mutant can feed on and produce acid the key is to trying reduce the amount of strep mutant and reduce the amount of acid in the mouth that is the best way to reduce cavities and even reverse cavities that have started to form now in a moment i am going to tell you about fluoride because i know their lot of questions about fluoride but in order for you to understand what i say about fluoride an to make the best decision about fluoride both in drinking water and tooth pace et camera for you you have to understand the demineralization process just a little bit just a little bit little bit of demister here lobe structural biology and this will be fun i promise even if you now no biology no structural bilgyou no chemistry you can this part and its very simple those minerals that form the crystals within the enamel and some of the deeper layers of your tooth or teeth rather those crystals form through a specific type of bond and those bonds are very strong think of them legs chains but these are not you know just conventional legochains these are legs chains that when they stick when two pieces come together things are tough to pull apart they are not indestructible but there tuft pull apart and there also spectral because unlike a string of legs like a single string of legs these bonds that form during demineralization of the teeth are interdigitate with one another or rather are at angles with one another that make those bonds especially strong any architect or somebody that understand structural balds you understand that bonds con be weak or strong depending on whether or not there linear wether not their crossed whether not there latices there is the whole bunch of interesting yo angled forces stuff that the architects will understand an the the construction workers will understand at a very intuitive an and concrete level no pone intended and on and on but just think about it a bond is only as strong as the number of different points at which it can resist sheering and pressure the way that these demineralization bonds form is through the addition of specific minerals at specific angels and the actually occurring mineral that is responsible for the majority f these bonds in the enamel and teeth is called hydroxy appetite what a great name if you to about moral health we use the mouth for a lot of things you can think of the small list ore long list of those things than many of them younderpending wo you are and what you to do with your mouth but the point being that we do indeed eat with our mouth appetite is part of eating you just remember hydroxy appetite bonds and that are very strong but there not indestructible avian actually break those bonds ay that is the demineralization process now fluoride is a substance that is not a vitamin it is not a mineral it is not an essential nutrient but that in the last century it was discovered can actually replace some of the hydroxy appetite bonds in teeth and actually make those bonds hyper strong superphysiologically strong now will talk about the safety considerations with fluoride and lot bit because there are some safety considerations but it was decided an mass in the united states in rope that the addition of fluoride to the drinking water and to many toothpastes or toothpowders would be useful because it creates these superphysiologically strong bonds within the minerals of the teeth and indeed it does it does fluoride gets between those legopieces and makes them extra extra strong and this is why fluoride is added to the drinking water but and this is very important emphasize but nowadays there is a really polarize debate about fluoride because some people out there believe that fluoride can destroy thyroid health mighty be disruptive for brainhealth certainly of fluoride levels are too high in drinking water or any substance it can be very dangerous it can be a poison but of course the dose makes the poison it fluoride itself may not be poisonous at very low levels but there really two camps now that have form and it'll just illustrate those wo camps by virtue of what is happening right now right now in the state of californium there is a major law suit against the government because people want fluoride removed from the drinking water because of the long lists of bad things that excessive on highly excessive fluoride can do for bodily an brain health special in kids but also in adults at the very same time meaning right now there is also a major law suit this one in buffalo new york from mostly parents who are suing the city of buffalo saying that there was not enough maybe even zero fluoride in the drinking water for some period of time and as the consequence they're children teeth or oral health or both is depleted and they are suing for damages a case thee this is a really polarize camp now i did a full episode o the human lawpodcask all about water and i talked about fluoride levels which levels are thought by the see my see to be safe which levels are not thought to be safe i talked about some of the theories as to how fluoride might disrupt function of the theroid in some considerations there please check out the time stamp in that episode i link to that time stamp in the caption this episode but the important point here is that if you are at all concerned about fluoride in the drinking water the simple answer is to just filter the water that comes out of the tap if you are concern about fluoride than i suppose you would probably want of void toothpastes that have fluoride indeed there are some i will provide links to some of those in the shoot captions for this episode or a variety of these a zero fluoride toothpaste of start to accumulate but keep in mind that when fluoride is introduce into the bonds of the minerals of the teeth they do make the teeth really really strong but and all the dentist i spoke to emphasize this point the bonds that form are not the natural bonds now the fact that they are not the natural bonds does not necessarily mean that they are not good for us or that they are bad for us but the bonds that form when viewed under what is called electro my cross could be look different they look wavy they are not smooth bonds and they do increase the resistance to different forces including cavities or acid that would create cavities to be specific they make the teeth stronger structurally resistance to chipping et camera but there is a growing concern about excessive fluoride which by the way if you drink a lot of tap water you are going to be exposed to more fluoride than if you drink less tap water that just kind of stands to reason but real do not really talk about this i you wing told about amount of fluoride by concentration and a given leader of water or gallon of water els yo have to ask of how much tap waterage you drinking every day er you have to ask that question ride it is not simply the concentration it is how much you are investing over all and that something that is much harder conto control for again in the water episode i talk about was to e eliminate or reduce fluoride in the drinking water if that is a concern of yours but if you want to know why there is fluoride in drinking water it is because governments figured out eh well if we want a reduce tooth decay what is the simplest low cost method to do that well it is to put fluoride in the drinking water and you now also now know why there is fluoride in a lot of toothpaste but given the concerns about fhierard health potential concerns about brainhealth ow you also know why many pee all including some dentists that i spoke to a not big fans of fluoride both for children and for adults you just have to make a decision for you ism not here to tell you what to do you just have to decide are you pro neutral or against fluoride in your drinking water and if are your going to filter are you going to completely avoid drinking any water may be cooking with any water from the tap and on and on but now who fluoride is in drinking water and fluoride is in toothpaste if you are somebody use concerned about fluoride in either are both of those sources well then what you really want to think about in what most of us probably should be think about anyway is trying to increase the demineralization state of i teeth and mouth in ways that do not create the opportunity for any other health hazard and i will say this as well which is that there is some data not a lot but some data that fluoride might not be great for our oral microbioman as will soon learn the oral microfilm is critical for our oral and overall health i to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker as a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood en can e to help you better understand your body and help you reach your healthicals have long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood last i major problem with a lot of blood tests out there however is that you get information back about metabolic factors lipids and hormones and forth but you do not know what to do with that information with inside tracker they make it very easy cause they have a personalized platform that allows you to see the levels of all those things metabolic factors lipids hormones et camera but it give you specific directives that you can follow that relate to nutrition behavioral modification supplements et camera that can help you bring those numbers into the ranges that are optimal for you if you would to try inside tractor you can go to inside tracker dot calm slash superman to get twenty per cent off any of inside tractors plans again that is inside tracker dot calm slash supermen in a moment we are going to get in to what to do the two dos the behavioral to dos and some of the other to dos for trying to keep your mouth in the best possible demineralization state the best p h for tooth health for gum health for avoiding periodontal disease may be even for reversing some aspects of tooth and periodontal sickness because indeed you can do that if you shift your mouth to the correct p h if your putting it into that demineralization mode eh however before we get into the two us i think it is very important to discuss the do not that every dentist and perydntis i spoke to agreed on the quickest as it'll call it of bad for your teeth bad for your mouth and therefor bad for your brain and body or not surprisingly perhaps alcohol which by the way i did not entire episode about full call its one of our more popular episodes ism not here to tell you to never drink if your an adult is it not colic but the cut off seems to be to alcohol base drinks per weak beyond which you run into trouble and yes zero is better than any but here when we say alcohol is not good for oral health and for tooth health what we are talking about is the disruption that aldol creates to the microfilm and the way that alters the p h of your saliva and places the mouth and the the into a d mineralization state that is very clear it also kills certain cells of the mouth some people i remember this in college would say the all you know you have got a you have got a exscracth in the back your throat you are getting sic an e should drink anlencs o they said you should drink it is con o kill that thing oft welt guess what it does the exact opposite kills off a bunch of things that you want the cells in and around the mucosa layer of the mouth that are actually in a provide a man support and eliminate those bacteria viruses ah that are making you sick et camera always bad or not saying you should not drink at all if you are nonalcolicadulth you have to decide for you but just understand that if you are drinking alcohol the you want to pay extra attention to your oral health and your tooth care practices especially on the days or round that alcohol consumption and if you've somebody does not want to drink all now you have yet another reason do not drink alcohol the second thing on the no fly list or the not good for us list for sake of oral health are stimulants now f course things mathemphedemin which are you a severely diliterias a fictive drugs for all sorts of reasons they kill nobleman uric and other brain morons they are highly addictive om and on and on but also stimulants deal divans et camera those stimulants basely any drug that increases epineferan and foreman felon call a adrenaline in orgentlan or the other names for those are going to have a negative effect on oral health does that mean you should stop those medications if you been prescribe them no it means that you should do some other things to try an offset the negative consequence of stimulants why would stimulants cause such disruption in oral health whole therereally two reasons there is a chemical reason and there's a mechanical reason the chemical reason is that stimulants change the p h of your saliva making the mouth more acidic which make strep mutant an other bacteria more capable of creating cavities down into the teeth they take your mouth and your teeth from that demineralization state or as have been referring to mode to that d mineralization demon mode demon mode that is a way i remember its bad demon mode demon mode not good may be an o vdiogam demonmod is good demon mode not good for the mouth d on mode demineralization mode there is a chemical reason why stimulants disrupt the oral health milk and cause disruption an tooth health and degradation demon of the enamel of the teeth and deeper layers of the teeth and this is profoundly evident in mechanics but the other reason and this was a reason that was shared with me by a physician and em to from university californium san francisco who interacts by virtue of his profession with a lot of methamphedemian attics who have terrible teeth is that stimulants in courage mouth breathing watch a mechanic or watch somebody who's on a high dose of stimulants and they tend to mouth breathe because of the shifts and autonomic nervous system function the tenuto be mouth brothers it is the drying of the mouth that also shifts the mouth from that demineralization mode to demineralization mode if you do take stimulants by prescription i would hope not methamphedeming or list drugs but if you take prescription stimulants and by the way things well burin modapinil they do qualify is stimulants even though to daphnes little bit of a a special case any drug that increases nor up an eferanepanefron any stimulant and yes indeed coffee will talk about coffee as well and tea will make the saliva more acidic and make your oral health potentially less good mouth breathing bad for oral both bad for teeth bad barbet there is just no question about it to day's discussion am calling oral health but that includes oral air way health and have talked before on this podcast about the fact that if you can be in naselbry there be nasalbreather please as longs you are not speaking songs you are not eating trim breathe through your nose if you are exercising exercising really hard that you are running really hard fine mouth breathe i do not this there is any evidence that staying in nasal breathing mod all the time while exercising is best for performance in fact to the contrary there are times when yogin to mouth breathe and their sports where yean to email through the mouth specifically certain marshal arts for instance not saying do not ever breathe through your mouth but as much as possible trying keep the oral cavity moist and closed if this is critical stimulants dry out the mouth they increase the city the saliva that is bad smoking cigarettes and yes also anabas and yes raping does this to it funny any time i told about smoking being scapula well what about anabas well i did not episode about anabas anabas does have certain medical uses that are very interesting and am there is good evidence for those but for many people anabas is not a god idea you can check out that episode to decide for you then bell ask what about raping vapingsnos bat smoking right that is hat they say here there sort of asking saying hoping wishing fantasizing and the truth is that raping is terrible for journal health as well is it bad is smoking probably not but it is bad for bunch of other reasons that off set any gain or gains you would get from raping instead of smoking just know that if you are smoker or a vapor were if you tape rather that you are going to on to pay extra attention to some of the otherprotocalls discussed and that we will discuss going forward in order to try and support your oral and therefore your whole body health a case we have got it'll call stimulant smoking slash raping and by extension dipping tobacco frankly not good for oral health or tooth health in fact they can be precancerous to the gum tissue it is well established and they can also cause degradation the gum tissue and even some the underlying bone if you tend to do it on the same side all the time or often at all that is not good we already discuss that sugar is not good for oral health does that mean you can never in jest sugar no of course not enjoy the sweets you enjoy every once in a while enjoy an ice pastry do as you will am if you are somebody never eats those things great but then understand that any carbohydrate any starch provides a sugar that strep mutant can eat in create acid n and demineralize your teeth create cavities that is avoid sugar in access and if you eat sugar try and rings your mouth after and ideally you would brush maybe even floss after i do know those people that after every meal o run and even the in all the day they rude the bathroom and brush their teeth and floss and that's great but most people do not do that swishing water rinsing your mouth out again plan water may be with a little bit of salt in it it is going t be beneficialwill all about mouth washes later just if you low window into were were headed with that most mouth washes terrible terrible for your oral health especially alcohol base or antiseptic badmouth washes except under certain conditions prescribed or otherwise octet if you eat any sugar and frankly after you eat anything it is a good idea to trying clear as much of that food product from your mouth you may not think you still have food in your mouth and teeth but try it you swish some water may be spitted out may be swallowed that is up to you are you a spit or swallow not my business do not want a know do not tell me do not put in the comments just decide for you but sugar and other food products residing in the mouth for long periods of time not good and similarly acidity foods that are acidic certain things citrus fruits which i love i love oranges have an orange tree my back yard now and i absolutely love it i love oranges great fruit just i love the peal i even eat the peal sometimes delicious and no one telling you not to eat acidic foods or to avoid acidic drinks lemon water or carbonate lemon water some people are really extreme in they decide to just use a straw when they drink those things in fact the dentists i spoke you said yes could you ask people please if they are gong to drink acidic drinks to try and use a straw but then i said will you o hon o straws they destruct the environment most people are not carrying around metal straws or and what about the turtles this kind thing and they said well o a hears the real truth the real truth is it is the amount of time that the mouth is exposed to that acid ifthe're gong to drink it drink it over the course of five ten fifteen may be twenty thirty minutes and then be done with it rings out the mouth with a it bit of water and trying clear out that acidity it is not about completely avoiding acid foods or sugary foods or acidic drinks it is about again limiting the amount of time that the overall miller of the mouth is acidic because of this whole demon demon things trap mutant and the acid created by strep mutant that can dead the teeth in the fact that of your mouth is kept acidic for long periods of time you are going to provide the opportunity for faster and deeper development of those cavities and keep this in mine again any time we talk about demineralization the formation of cavities remembered a sea saw it is either demon or demon but not both any time your demineralizing your teeth you are also not remineralizing your teeth case really avoid alcohol stimulants smoking raping sugar mouth breathing acidic foods acidic drinks but many of us most of us cannot avoid any sugar's any acidic foods the other things can be avoided but some of us are prescribe these drugs and need these drugs some people a drink with alkali in every one somwhile and it is perfectly fine for them or they have deemed it perfectly fine for them in that case try and rings the mouth try and keep the mill of the mouth as moist and as basic or alkaline rather lessacitic as possible to translate this a bit more to the real world if you are somebody me who loves tea i drink coloreds hero sugar your hamate that is my favorite source of cabin i also a nice black doublespreso or coffee every once in a while it is fine to drink that but you don't want to sip on those sorts of things all day and you do not wan to sip on them for hours and hours and if you are going to combine those things with some acidic foods or with any kind of food youon't try and get your meals done wrap em up and rings your mouth and move to the next part of your day and that actually seaways into a really important point that came about when researching this episode that if i had to highlight bold face underline and light up one particular protocol that i think most everybody is not thinking about is that there are certain times in the twenty four hours circadian period in which your mouth makes the maximum amount of saliva one and that the saliva has an opportunity to be the optimal p h that is chemistry for encouraging demineralization of your teeth and that is during the daytime and especially through the middle of the day now there couple things that can disrupt that for instance eating anything i do not care f your carnivore vegan whatever omnivore when you eat you change the p oh of your saliva and your introducing those sugars that the bacteria can feed on one thing that became very clear to me when researching this piso talking to experts reading manuscripts and also reading some really interesting books about demineralization opportunities for the teeth is that having a stretch of time of maybe two for six hours or more where you are not eating anything or ingesting anything that is acidic in terms of liquids can be very beneficial now this is a vote in support of called intermittent fasting this is something that i practice typically by eating my first meal somewhere round eleven a m every morning sometimes earlier sometimes have a breakfast at nine if i particularly hungry but typically i eat my first meal round eleven a m or noon and then i eat my last bite of food by about eight p m not everyone likes to do intermit ant fasting and i realize forsake a weight loss it is probably interchangeable with colonic restriction generally and there is a lot of debate as to whether not interment fasting is going to extend life span whether now it is better from metabolic health and sigil cleric restriction i don't ant to get into that debate frankly ts a barbed wire debate that is been carried out on this podcast elsewhere before and i think is i on going i think it is the of the best way to couch that debate but in researching this episode it became very clear that we have an amazing opportunity during the day especially in the morning and throughout the day to create a lot of saliva that is the right p h to support demineralization of the teeth provided that there is not a lot of food or a civic liquids in the mouth of that time at least to my mind this is an interesting opportunity to place intermit an fasting which again or even just gaps between meals not constantly snacking or sipping on a civic beverages throughout the day as an opportunity to create that healthy miles during which the teeth can demineralize and the overall oral health can improve now does that me you should never eat or drink anything during the mill the day no ism not saying that ism saying that if you are going to do those things thank clear them from your mouth as i describe before now many of you will probably say hey during the middle of the night ism not eating your drinking anything for some of you that might be the only time they you're not eating your drinking anything because you are asleep one would hope you are sleep but here is the interesting thing every cell tissue and organ in our body is on a twenty for our circadian clock i think many of you have heard me say that in the contacts of viewing morning sunlight and other protocols that i it suggest on the huverminad podcast but here is the interesting and important point in the middle of the night indeed you are not in jesting any food or fluids presumably but you are saliva production is dramatically reduced again dramatically reduced and as a consequence if there is food or rather food opportunity for strep me tens another factory to feed on and create acid to a road your teeth the saliva necessary to offset that to combat that is simply not present or at least not present at the same levels that it is during the day this is a sort of two prong protocol on the one hand ism saying you might consider trying to introduce maybe an hour or two hour or longer stretches during the day in which you are not in jesting any food and if you are drinking anything it is not a civic or if you are to trying rings away that acid as much as possible plain water would be great avoiding carbonated lemon water be great but if you those things and indeed i love those things i love carbonate lemon water i love as yerbomate indeed the bromate i as cobra zero sugar but has some lemon an ginger in it e that is fairly acidic but then drinking it down either pretty quickly or if you are go sip on it than ringing away with some water and not doing that throughout the entire and indeed i tend to drink my canine early in the day and not much throughout the a may be a low bit of a mate in the afternoon sometimes ay that is one aspect of maintaining or encouraging the core c oh of saliva to re mineralize your teeth right create these windows of opportunity where there is a lot of saliva for long stretches of time during the day as long as possible while still make at compatible with your nutrition needs in your hydration needs of course the other prong or the other aspect of this protocol is that at night when you go to sleep you need to know you are not producing very much saliva and that is the critical time to make sure that there is as little opportunity as possible for strep mutant and other bacteria to feed on sugars or other food products and thereby to great acid that creates cavities and this is a very important photo call the every single dental and oral half care professional i spoke too supported and indeed champions which is if there is a most critical time of day or night to brush your teeth and floss and clean your teeth it is at night time it is at night time why my saying this with such whispered importance well i think there are many people out there in particular people that fall into that second category that i mention at the beginning of to day's episode that wake up in the morning and brush their teeth maybe even use mouth wash maybe floss and you ill bunch of things to try and get their mouth clean and fresh especially if they are going to interact with other people during the day and to and get rid of all the constickiness and yon your mouth your morning breath that kind of thing but that at night their finishing dinner maybe having some desert doing some work and passing out without brushing their teeth a flossing or simply getting too lazy to brush or flow and by the way ism an a raise my hand at just say for many years i was in that category i know i gross but i was in that category had high motivation to brush and floss or at least to brush in the morning very little motivation to do it in the evening every professional sad if you are going to brush and floss just once per twenty four hours and that is not what they recommend by the way but if you were going to do it just once the critical time the most essential time to brush and floss and clean the mouth and get the miller of the mouth correct for tooth care and mouth over all oral health is at night before you go to sleep because you a ready know the mechanistic backbone for this argument because at night you are producing far less saliva and if there is any food product there that the bacteria can feed on the saliva is not there to combat that because it is a constant battle between acidity and alkalinity your saliva's coming in trying to save everything and the strep mutes is tried destroy your teeth and the acid is the weapon re they use and what fuels that weapon my what provides the more am to destroy your teeth are sugars and acidity if you were going to rush or floss and ideal you do both only once for twenty four hours it would be at night before going to sleep indeed much that i would say that night time brushing and flossing is perhaps one of the most important things that we can do for over all or health care well talk about what to do what to use for brushing and flossing an a few minutes but that is absolutely essential i d do not want that to be translated in to you only need to brush or brush and floss once per twenty four hours every professional i spoke to and all of the data point to the fact that doing it twice per twenty four hours is best or perhaps even three times per twenty four hours but let us be ones most people are not going to brush and floss three times every twenty four hours some well but most will not and now of course have been saying brushing and flossing but i have not talked about the incredibly extensive landscape of how to brush and floss now let us take ourselves back to being little kids right when we were taught to brush our teeth in a particular way and is us suspend a certain number of minute set a time er as to floss in a certain way every time we go to the dentist they tell us to floss in a cart may do this not this what do the data really say what are the modern health professionals in dental and or health really suggestion we do when it comes to brushing and flossing and fortunately here there is a near uniform consensus there is always that outlier that person that says to do things a little bit differently or no is in fact one person very prominent in the dental health space that is not a fan of flossing but they are really the out lie the vast majority of dentists out there all say the same thing you need to brush you need to floss you need to do it twice to day were more and you need to do it correctly now let us talk about what correct brushing and flossing really is o case ism not going to demonstrate how to brush your teeth but one very actionable photo call that was told to me by all the dental professionals i spoke to was use a soft tooth brush now this one hurts i suppose hurts less anyway it hurts my hart a little bit because i enjoy very much using a medium or hard tooth brushing really scrubbing back there especially i teeth in the back is feels good i feel cam doing something good again the backs of teeth the grunts of the teeth an i actually enjoy brushing my meet especially lately ask me why butt i do but every single one of them said that that very vigorous brushing with medium or hard as they are called bristles really disrupts the interface between the teeth in the gums in ways that is not healthy for the gums nasally makes tenting of the gums and those pockets those recesses as they are called far more likely to form and every single one of them said if you are regular with your brushing and especially if you are brushing and flossing regularly that a soft tooth brush that is one that is moved in a circular motion on the fronts and backs of your teeth for all your teeth and that is gentle you are not providing a lot of pressure is going to be the best way to break up that bile film layer each in every time and promote the best tooth and over all oral health suppose say manufacturers who are making medium and hard tooth brushes may be give us some rational for that em because the dental professionals that i spoke to and a can i spoke to a fair number of them all said the same thing soft tooth brush notches better soft tooth brush best likewise if you use an electric tooth brush which i now do sometimes us which back and forth but use an electric tooth brush it was recommended that you not provide too much pressure that you really trying keep the tips of the bristles on the the teeth an gums and yes it was also suggested that people brush their gums this is interesting for people out there who have tooth sensitivity one of the major suggestions from people in the dental and periodontal field at least the ones i spoke to was to actually brush your gums lightly to increase circulation of blood and other nutrients to the deeper portions of the tooth that actually extend into the bone now there is a tremendous amount of blood flow to the gums any one who it is are nick their a gum with a a while while flossing or with a toothpick until you bleeds very readily and that is not a good thing round you do not want to create bleeding of the gums s look about bleeding the gums during flossing in a moment by the way do not jump the gun just yet is at jump the gun not jump the gum by the way if you are brushing your gums make sure using a soft tooth brush if you are using lecture tooth us make sure you are going very lightly on the gums and because there is much blood flow to the gums it does encourage a lot of circulation to some of the deeper cavities of the tooth as it turns out i soft want to revert to tooth anatomy any kind of detailed way now but of course with in the tooth you again namely of the dentin you have got what is called the the pulp or the center there is a lot of nerves enervating the center of the tooth is munch of other tissues and and the bone around it and layers et camera and when you manage or lightly brush the gums around thereof are encouraging a lot of blood flow to those deeper components of the tooth which are really the live and active components of the tooth that require blood flow in neutrino this is a good thing in fact it is probably such a good thing that most people perhaps all of us should do it but most people probably will not take the time to also brush their gums but if you have a la bit of time it can be beneficial especially if you have sensitive teeth the idea that is emerging dow the gentle field is that it can help promote razilients or t less sensitivity of the teeth to things hot and cold and may be even to pressure before we talk about flossing i just want a re emphasize that the reason to brush your teeth than the reason to brush your teeth lightly or without too much pressure that is is that if you are regular with your tooth brushing and flossing the maingoal of brushing is to break up the bile film layer that provides a substrate for strep mutant and other bacteria to layer on thicker layers of bacteria call place that will eventually turn to harder my if we really want grass ourselves out and really mote of a brushing and flossing maybe we should describe that what happens with strep mutant is it forms the strand bacteria they'd little sheilas other attached to the tooth is the be film layer of the little strands of strings but if enough it if accumulates than it gets thicker and kind o mossy as colic you'd thicker it looks t on a sponge of form and that is the place and then if enough of it forms and there is enough acidity in the mouth then it forms tartar which is the hard caked on stuff that require scraping off by the dentist you and some people get a lot of tartar some people less tartar build up depending on how diligent they are at removing the bile film with brushing now you can remove bile film and place with brushing but once it starts to form tartar that is once it is layered on some as has a yellowish tint to it then you really start to run into trouble because brushing and flossing we will not remove that tartar and that is why the dentist needs to get in there and scrape it away it is ideal to be diligent about removing the bacteria while it is still in that strand or platform i dealing within the when it still in that strand form removing that bile film if you have ever bent the dentist you may recall they will do this tooth polishing they will do that thing with a kind of a giddy stuff on your teeth and you wonder is this to make my teeth wider and indeed it can create a bit more shine or sheen too your teeth but the main reason for doing that it turns out is to make the surface is of your teeth smooth after all they do it on your backs over your teeth too an if their good dentist they do on the backs of your teeth as well why would they do it there it cannot be for cosmetic purposes well they do that because the smooth surface makes it tartar for those strands that bile film to stick and form and certainly for the more dense place and tartar layers to build up on top of it they make your teeth smooth that the the bacteria cannot adhere to it as readily but it is the daily protocols of tooth and oral health that are really critical we will talk about dental visits and frequency of dental visits and what a dental visit is really about is always about cleaning or filling et camera but in the meantime brushing and brushing often enough such that you do not get any build up a bile film for very long periods of time eliminating or reducing the amount of place and tartar that builds up is going to be your best strategy for improving tooth health now what about flossing there is little bit of debate about flossing in the dentistry field some people say if your gums bleed when you floss you need to floss more in fact most dentist i spoke you said that but they also emphasize that you need to floss correctly you canthus pull the floss down on to the gum in between the tooth you need to lie down the side of the tooth get we will bit underneath the gum and use a circular motion and then lift up from between the too teeth which frankly is a lot easier if your teeth are not very very close together right some of us have teeth that are very close together and wenyou try n to bring it up through the teeth it is more of an effort quiet but they really all emphasize trying to knot drop this rather sharp floss and here we could also be talking bout the toothpick baseless war there is a little arc with a with a we will bit of floss across from it the one you can buy some beach use toothpicks r old fashion method a frankly most antis i spoke to do not want people jabbing their mouthing gums with toothpicks how you can decide for yourself but almost all of them except for one felt that flossing is a great idea for tooth health and that if your gums bleed when you floss correctly as i just described what correct flossing is that you ere best strategy is to floss at least twice a day between all of your teeth and if you are not in floss twice a day for whatever reason in protest or for lack of time at least once a day and when with that once a dare it would be at night before going to sleep for the reasons we talk about earlier and several dental i spoke you said that using a water pick is going to be better than using more typical floss or for or using those toothpick baste floss approaches because it is gentler on the teeth i personally have not used a water pick but ism rove entreat by the the concept because it sounds i gits a much harder to damage the gums and teeth by doing it and that it is at least as a fishing as standard flossing for those of you that have the disposable income and the interest in using a water pick sounds like it could be really god idea for the vast majority of us me just getting some traditional a floss and using gentle floss a at least once a day at night and i really also in the morning after brushing that seems the most direct and low cost strategy i should just mention that the pediatric dentist that i spoke to mention that flossing is really about removing food product from between the teeth and therefore children younger than six who typically have big spaces between their baby teeth and their adult teeth have not yet come in infant that wit those spaces are about by the way unless your me and when you were a kid your teeth were too close together and all your adult teeth came in behind those teeth was really miserable experience for me most kids their baby teeth are spaced out a bit an in order to allow the adult teeth to come in to erupt as it is call such a dramatic word lovereenthess literature when the boulders erupt its wo now it is is come up through the gums those spaces are really there for the adult teeth to come up through the gums and it was suggested that children who have those spaces between their teeth and the spaces are big do not need to floss between those teeth because it could cost some damage to the gums rather they should just focus on their brushing now let us talk about some protocols that involve changing the chemistry of your mouth not just immediately after meals are during brushing or flossing but really around the clock and one of the key protocols that it'd to discuss is the use of an artificial sugar called zylotall zlotall is a very low carry sweetener i can place it among the other locator sweeteners aspartame surely stein et camera but what is unique about zylotall is that very much standard sugar or any kind of carbohydrate sugar the bacterias strpticocus mutant loves to eat zylotol but when streptococcus mutant eats zyolotol it does not meaning it cannot produce the acid that normally would demineralize the teeth and create cavities in addition to that when streptococcus mutant eats zylotol it kills streptococcus mutant what this means is that if zolotoll is present in the or cavity after a meal say in the minutes an hours after a meal then any strep mutant that happens to be there is going to preferentially feed on the zyolotol not other sugars and it will not be able to release acid and because zylotol can actually inhibit the growth and that is the proliferation of more strep mutant we have got a tuner were got a situation where strep mutant cannot release acid to demineralize the teeth and potentially cause cavities and the total amount of strep mutant that can grow that can proliferate in what are called colonies literally the bacteria colonizes on the teeth in that forming that biopic or then that cannot happen zalotol is a very potent tool for improving oral health in this way in addition zyolotol reduces inflammation of the gum tissue and other soft tissues of the mouth and atoll is providing in a ray of positive benefits especially when its present the mouth immediately after a meals and for that reason their number of different dentist that created ziolotol products in the form of gums or in the form of once specifically to be used after meals by chewing a few of these kiloton mince where by chewing a ziolotol based gum immediately after a meal your taking substantial steps towards improving the chemical milk of your mouth and inhibiting the proliferation of cavity forming streptococcus mutant now you can also find some literature on other proposed benefits of zyoleotol such as improving over all microfilm ah such as reducing inflammation in other tissues besides the gums and within the mouth there is some evidence that it can support the gotmicrobyom because of course the oral microfilm an the gutmicrobiom or contiguous they have different compartmentsimy might even be surprise to learn that within your mouth there different niches as their called for instance there is different microbiota that live on the gums verses the hard pale verses the zophpalot back in the throat and then as you descend into the gut et camera and it does appear that violator has certain positive benefits for all of those different got microfilm riches but the literature on that is less well substantiated than for instance the literature showing that if ziolotol is put in as a suricate sugar substrate for strep mutant that it disables strep mutant and to prevent the formation of cavities now as far as i know when consumed in mint form or gum form ism not aware of any specific side effects or bad effects of zolotol provided that its not consumed in excess but as with everything dosage matters if you are somebody who wants to explore the use of zylatol gum ere zalotol mince after meal i would not suggest going from consuming hero zalatoll mince to consuming fifty a day or something that even tenancy you might start off slowly and just consume one or two after a meal ay be just your morning meal may be just your evening meal something of that sort rather than chewing amatol gum all day long et camera et camera it'll just mention one other positive benefit of zalatoll gum which is if you u amatol gum after say your noon meal or your early day meal it further increases the production of saliva which as we talked about before is a great thing because one of the best ways to support oral health and tooth health is to have a long stretch of time in the middle of the day where you are producing a lot of healthy saliva in large amounts because again saliva this incredible stuff that supporting demineralization of the teeth lots and lots of reasons to think about may be consider using amatol gum rzalatoll mince their number of different ones available out there i have zero again zero financial relationship to any of those mint or gum companies it'll provide a lion the shownote captions to one source the company and the products were developed by a dentists doctor belly chilies who is quite prominent in the public health education space around dental health some of her views or little bat controversial her views on flossing other of her views i find frankly quite a head of their time in that she is been talking about a number of these things promoting the health of the ora microfilm and the potential value of zalatoll gums and mince et camera for some period of time i think most of the information that she puts out there is supported by other dentists and she still suggests regular dental visits o am nothing renegade out there or heretical ah again there are other sources of amatol gums and mince that you could consider ism simply putting a link to the one that i use because i happen t use them and them i to use the discussion about zilatall as a seaway into a discussion about toothpaste because there is a lot of controversy out there about which toothpaste are better for us may be even bad for us and best for us i think it is fair to say baton what we all now know about amatol that if you can find a toothpaste that contains zalatoll as a sweetener that can only be a good thing and indeed there are a number of the malt there will talk about specific sources and li bit but let us just put amatol on the om short to not short list of things that would be great to have in a toothpaste for all the reasons that you now understand the real big question with toothpaste is always should i use a toothpaste that has fluoride or avoid toothpaste that have fluoride and in order to answer that we hae to go back to our earlier discussion about fluoride it really depends on whether not your somebody that thinks that florae is great because it creates the superphysiologically strong bonds within our teeth the crystal structures are that much stronger then when forced by hydroxy appetite or whether not your somebody who is wary of fluoride that you are concerned about potential brainhealth issues or thyroid issues and here i think people really do fall into either camp or the camp frankly of i do not known should i be worried i do not know if i should be worried i personally grew up using fluoride toothpaste i we have the con a standard namebrand fluoride toothpaste am in our bathroom i bushmen tooth those for years whether not that negatively impacted my health or not i do not know get my blood work don my thidwoard harmony are normal a my brain o works at least reasonably well but i do realize that some people are very concerned about fluoride and they just do not want it anywhere near their kids they do not want it anywhere near themselves if your somebody who's going air on the side of caution with fluoride and you are seeking a non fluoride containing toothpaste there are such toothpicks out there and most of those if not all of them contain you guessed it idiocy appetite they contain the minerals that naturally form the bonds that create that additional enamel that can potentially filling cavities and by revitalization of the enamel and some of the deeper layers of the tooth if one is seeking toothpaste and you want to avoid fluoride you would want to find something that ideally had hydroxy appetite and something that had zilethall and they often also contain some sort of mild abrasive ocaynota not a really scratchy brace of substance a but a mild abrasive that can really allow for breaking up the bill film that we talked about earlier nowhere provided links to a couple of sources for such toothpaste and also for of these toothpaste tablets am that have been using lately as well sometimes switch back and forth between the too these are tabletsthat you chew up and then you a brushed tooth immediately after with your wet toothbrush both of them work quite well again i want to be clear that the companies that have provided link to in the show no captions are companies for which i have absolutely zero financial relationship i do know some of the people that started these companies i i shall discovered these companies because these people are dentist or periodontics or other people in the oral health field a but i also want to be very clear that there was no exchange of promotion of their products for information or otherwise i simply tried and the products and i just happen to have learned somethings about oral health care from these people separate an away from anything about toothpaste or ziletolls et camera o so want to be very clear that i do believe these are quality sources these are the toothpaste and tooth tablets that i happen to use gums mints that i happen to use large part as a consequence of researching this episode but i playful price for them ism certainly not suggesting that anyone else has to use them they just represent one option if you are looking for nonfloride containing tooth pace and some other things to promote oral health and ism sure there are other sources out there and if you to refer the various viewers and listeners of this podcast to those sources cause you feel very strongly about those other sources just put those in the common section on you too o say let us talk about mouthwash we mouthwash is floral at the beginning of to day's episode i said let us determine what category of oral health you are in are you somebody who pays lot of attention to or health you brush and floss at least twice to day you are using mouthwashes tooth whiteners perhaps ps as well or are you in category two or three well here is the deal most all most all not all but most all mouthwashes especially those containing alcohol or terrible for or health simply put they deplete certain components of the mucosa lining of the mouth and they disrupt the healthy components of the oral microbic for those of you that rely on such mouthwashes i would really encourage you to learn more abaft them you are about to do that now you are already doing that now and the really con side whether not they are helping or harming your oral health now am not suggesting that you create a scenario we your breath is causing other people to dissolve into a puddle of tears or back away from you quickly that is not what you want that is not what i want that is not what anyone wants but i think it is important to realize that these alcohol base mouthwashes are not good for us in addition there are antiseptic mouthwashes some of which contain author some of which do not which sometimes are proscribed for very serious bacterial overgrowth and infections of the oral cavity if you are dentists or physician or pariodantis proscribes those i certainly a not going to try and get in the way of that prescription that is between you and your fault care professional but you would be wise to ask them whether or not these cloraxidine the mouthwashes et camera or potentially bad for other components of oral health or microbioda in the gut generally because in some cases they have been shown to be not good for us at the same time we do not want over proliferation of really bad bacteria in the mouth we soft want infections to run wild either most people however are using mouthwashes to freshen their breath and to kill off additional bacteria in the mouth that they might believe they could not get with brushing or losing if you are somebody who really wants to use a mouthwash for that reason i encourage you to try and find a mouthwash that is not alcohol based and that is not a strong antiseptic or that if it is an antiseptic that it is not alcohol based tuque such mouthwashes exist out there there little bit hard to fine it'll provide a link to at least a couple of them in the show note captions here i have to say i have not tried those mouthwashes yet they do come from sources in which they were developed by license dental heath care professionals but as is always the case when somebody selling something it is worth while to do diligence now as we talk about tooth pase and mince and gums and mouthwashes i think it is worth taking a step back and also asking the question are there any zero or very very low cost or even costsaving alternatives to any of this and the great answer is yes there are actually a number of things that you can do with basic over the counter stuff from the grocery store that all the dentists i spoke to said yet that is a pretty good option it is not the best option available perhaps but it is a pretty good option and in many cases it is better than the typical commercially available toothpaste or mouthwash for instants i would imagine based on everything i now know about the structure of teeth that using something baking soda to brush the teeth would indeed scrape off the bile film perhaps even whiten the teeth a little bit although it is we talked about early are not really whitening the teeth yroughashu just changing the a reflectiveness a and some of the composition of that enamel which is translucent that you can see the underlying components better well i talk to several dentist and they told me that baking soda actually as fairly low on the a abrasiveness rating scale they have a specific rating scale for this we do not have to go into but it is actually considered quite safe for the enamel of the teeth especially if you are brushing with a soft toothbrush and you are not really grinding the stuff against your teeth at maximum intensity or even near maximum intensity turns out that baking soda and water is actually a pretty good toothpaste if you are not going to go by a toothpaste that is good news now you may have heard that you can make a sort of mouth wash or mouth rings with baking soda water and a little bit of hydrogen peroxide i not emphasize a little bit but ism also going to emphasize i do not thing this is a good idea at all why is not not a god idea at all well first of he when we were kids we used to take baking soda and hydrogen provide and put them together to simulate volcanos on that tells you right there the kind of chemical reaction that you are going to get but in addition to that it is pretty clear that hydrogen peroxide unless there is a specific medical recommendation to do is not something you want to introduce to the oral cavity now this is something that ism very familiar with because when i was a poststocxso this is in the two thousand five to two thousand ten stretch i started to get some pretty bad canker sores i do not know about you but canker sores feel awful to me i hate them when you eat they hurt you swallow they hurt when you do anything they pretty much hurt and some one gave me the recommendation to use a little bit of baking soda dissolved in some water and a little bit of hydrogen provide to use that as a oral rents and of course then to spit it out and i did that and actually what happen to me as i got almost quarter size colors on the roof of my mouth and on the sides of my mouth it took those little canker sores which were annoying and count of painful and turn them into full blown lasers i know this because when i stopped using it those healed up almost immediately and then when i spoke to some dentist and perydauntis is it okay hydrogen provide is just far too a brave for the mouth cavity and the reason i raise this is because i do not think ism alone in that if you want have venture into some of the am let us call it alternative recommendation space for oral health a you may hear that things hydrogen provide can be useful for gargling with or swishing with if you are trying to get a la bit of a throat tickle may be an infection and turns out it is a really bad idea now if there are physicians or oral health experts out there that strongly believe in the use of hydrogen peroxide princes were gargling with it to promote oral health for my reason let me know in the shown captions i do not want to go against any of those recommendations but this now considered kind of old school recommendation of creating one's own mouthwash with a la bit of baking soda some hydrogen provide and water does not seem a good idea not just based on my experience but every one of the dental professionals that i spoke to that said it does seem that creating a high salt solution o case of taking some salt putting into water dissolving it and then finding the point at which it will not quite dissolve because you the concentration of sodium is just high enough and using that as of course not something to swallow but rather as a dental ring putting your mouth and swishing it around and then spitting it out and at scan a taste very salty and then taking a swig of water just plain water and then swishing it around and then spitting it out that actually provides a really nice milk for the production of healthy mouth bacteria it is near zero cost dispose you need but a salt low water in a glass to put it in but it is basically zero cost and if you think about it that high saline or high salinity solution is a lot the sort of brings and the liquid that comes from these low sugar robotic foods that earlier i was suggesting in an other episodes have suggesting to be really healthy for swallowing for the gut microbioto but again i want to be very clear do not do not swallow high salt concentration fluid were tuning about a swish and then a spitting it out as a way to improve the overall milk of the mouth to get the path it to promote the proliferation of healthy microbiota components o case we have talked about some commercially available gums and mince containing file at all we talked about some commercially available tooth pace indeed some toothpaste that you almost fall into the very boutique category because they have all these things that are known by dentists and a perydontis to be great for oral health but those kin run some cost night and i do thing it is important that we also talked about the use of just baking soda with a soft toothbrush and some water and gently brushing the teeth as a great way to disrupt the telefilm and clean your teeth and a high salt solution as a swish and spit followed by a swishing spit with clear water clean water no south in it as a essentially very low cost or zero cost mouthwash far and away different from the heavily scented alcohol based antiseptic mouth washes that are commercially available and that we know are basically not good for our oral microfilm in addition a lie to point out that those alcohol based mouthwashes that many people in the world use are also known to reduce the amount of nitro oxide that is produced in the oral cavity and that is very important for the production of nitrocoxide elsewhere in the body whose that important will nitrocoxide promotes vast dilation not just within the blood vessels that line and feed the oral cavity but also the throat also in the know also in the brain also in the heart what we are talking about here is a substance that is indeed increased when we for instance nazelbreath we know that dramatically increase as nitrokoxide we are talking about a substance that when the oral microfilm is preserved in its healthy state tends to increase in production and we are talking about a substance that is really good for small capillary vain and arterial health because it allows for the passage of blood both for the delivery of oxygen and other nutrients to tissues but also the removal of waste products from tissues we do not want to do anything that reduces nitrokoxide unless there some specific medical condition that leads us to want to do that for most people increasing nitrocoxide or keeping nitrocoxide levels stable is the state that we want to seek and the call base mouthwashes are known to deplete the production of nitrokcoxide there is yet another reason to avoid the use of these alcohol based more typical over the counter mouthwashes by the way this is not a scare tactic against malkhuashes ism sure that if you use mouthwashes you are still producing some nitrocoxide but i thing nowadays many hopefully all of you are interested in doing whatever you can to improve your mentalhal physicahealth and performance and if there things that you are doing that are inhibiting those in any way that you potentially want to at least think about those may be removed them from your protocols especially there is a cost of them that you can remove in other words you can save on costs again lots of reasons to move away from the alcohol base standard antiseptic mouthwashes a side from the improvement in your breath that by the way can be better achieved by supporting the oral microfilm other ways that we have discuss there is really no clear advantage as to why one would use one and there apparently are a number of disadvantages now earlier we talked briefly about canker source there really uncomfortable there a lot of theories as to we canker source form and there lot of products and theories as to how to get rid of canker source well indeed there are some ways that we can prevent the formation of canker sours and accelerate their healing and that actually has to do with promoting the health of the gut microfilm the is a clear link between got microfilm and or microbyom in a way that can either promote or reduce the formation of canker sours and can actually help heel canker source and to my knowledge the best way to support a quotunquote healthy got microfilm is to consume at least one for servings of low sugar tormented foods per day i mentioned what some of those are lobe earlier i also did not entire episode about got microbaiom we have posted expert guests on the microbyom including just in sonumberg from stamped school of medicine and for sake of time i can just briefly list off the things that are known to promote a healthy got microfilm and that would indirectly support the healing and prevention of canker source and those are consuming one a for serving of lo sugar fermented foods per day for instance consuming enough periotic fiber consuming a fiber in the diet through fruits and vegetables or perhaps supplementing robotic or robotic fiber and in some cases if somebody is really despotic or if you ben taking antibiotics actually taking a pill form or capsid form robotic but it is not something that i recommend people take consistently and i certainly do not i think by investing those low sugar fermented foods on a regular basis by trying to make sure thatyou regretting en tough sleep each night this is key probably should have mention this earlier in the episode a but you one of the folks who have great respect for in the public health discussion around dental health is doctor mark between he goes by ask the dentist on integral he is a actually a retired dentist a but he is been deeply involved in the kind of a valuation of the consumer product space as it relates to dental and oral health care for a number of years am and markberhen in addition to discussing all the various topics that we have talked about to day such as zilatall and fluoride yes or florid know et center et camera is also been a big proponent of people paying attention to that first pillar of mental health physical health and performance which is sleep imprinting out that when people get fewer than there necessary a loment of sleep each night typically most people needs sit eight hours some people see more some people need less but getting at least sixth eight hours of quality sleep per night which supports the health of the gotmicrobium and oral microfilm and thereby indirectly supports the health of the entire brain and body am doctor been and others have talked about this but i really appreciate that hes champion the importance of sleep among other things but certainly sleep as a way to support the oral microfilm we talk quite a bit about teeth and gums a little bit about mucosa lining and throat one thing that we have not talked very much about the tongue the tongue your tongue is obviously a very important component of your mouth and as i mention earlier different niches different locations within the mouth have different microbioda living on them both good and qotenquote bad meaning ones that we would to promote the proliferation of because they reduce bad breath ad promote oral health than all that good stuff and corticate bad bacteria because they make our breath smell bad and because they depurate the various tissues of the mouth i looked pretty extensively into this issue of tongue scraping and it is an interesting one and every licensdental health care professional i spoke to in preparing for this episode agreed that yes it can be a good idea to scrape the tongue and each one of them coded the fact that a number of unhealthy bacteria can build up on the tongue cross the course of the day and throughout the night much in the same way that big film can build up on teeth although through a different process different bacteria and that scraping the tongue er brushing the tongue can be advantageous for removing that bacteria what was interesting is that several of them pointed out that lightly brushing the tongue may in fact be better than scraping the tongue because they argue that especially when people use those steel tongue scrapers that few people know how to use them with sufficient force to remove the bacteria but not much force that they do not damage the tongue tissue and the tongue is a very fragile soft tissue the recommendation that they relay to me was to suggest once or twice to day brushing of the tongue but here is an important point they all suggested that you use a separate tooth brush to brush your tongue than you would to brush your teeth f things were not complicate enough already i might using a separate toothbrush why well they gave two reasons one is they want to prevent cross over of the bacteria between those too different tissues especially if one is brushing the tongue to vigorously you soft want to introduce bacteria from your tooth brushing unit your tongue of course you can since it in between but the ideal situation is to use a separate toothbrush for the purpose of brushing the tongue now that opened up a whole exploration and discussion about tooth brush care do all episode all about tooth brush care but we will not suffice to say that when you brush bacteria off your teeth or tongue and presumably the tooth brush gets moist if by no other means certainly by means of your saliva being on it then you since it off and then even if you were to dry it off with a clean a some sort of clean towel or something that an you set it out a lot of bacteria are going to purlifrate on that tooth brush this open up a whole discussion about should you cover your tooth brush or let it dry out in the air should you use use irradiation a to sterilize your tooth brush and frankly it took us me down the rabbit hole of tooth brush care far that one point i just i a just scream uncle enough i i think one has to decide how much bacteria they are willing to tolerate living on their tooth brush and between tooth brushing a anywhere from zero were house a new tooth brush or tooth brush head every single time you brush that seems in reasonable or least economically unreasonable for most people verses replacing it once a week verses once every two weeks really there is no specific recommendation i can make all i can say is be aware that bacteria growing on the both brush head trying of void contact between the tooth brush head and any a unsanitary surfaces try in rite and dry off the tooth brush head all these things are recommendations that were relay to me and that just make good common sense now prior to this episode i put the call out on social media for questions about oral health and one of the cushions that came back from many hundreds of people was what about fillings what about mettle fillings what about sealants are they safe well most dentists will tell you that sealants are safe they are now made from compounds that are generally not thought to cause any major i sues to be on i did not do a deep dive into the chemical composition of different sealants because it turns out the different dental practices use different sealants ism sure that if i looked hard enough i could find ism some really bad stuff in sealants ism sure i could also find some reassurance that at the concentrations and conditions that there introduce to teeth that they are better alternative to having see cavities into the teeth and that actually gives me an opportunity raise something that i perhaps said earlier but i want to re emphasize which is have been talking bout how you can demineralize the teeth and how that is critical if you want to maintain and build up your tooth in oral health but it is very clear that if the cavities get down into the dentine layers of the tooth that in most cases there is no remaining opportuniteeth to demineralize the teeth using the sorts of practices we are talking about to day and that indeed it is very likely that those cavities need to be drilled and filled and now that is not always the case and this is one reason why i highly recommend that if you have listened to this episode and if you are here this point i the episode then you have listen to the episode that you talk your dentist ask them if they say you have a cavity how deep a these cavities do you think there is an opportunity for me to demineralize the teeth if i do the following things and if they tell you look you have a cavity or cavities and there are simply too deep into the tooth that you cannot demineralize your teeth and fill those in well then you know you should trust them there the dental professional if you do not you should find a different dentist however they may be surprised and who knows pleasantly surprize for you to i say hey i heard that you can assure demineralize teeth and if have got a cavity but it still not through the enamel layer oh if ism really diligent and o yousumsileatall may be some ism hydroxyappetite and avoid certain things and due certain things discussed in this episode that i could real a demineralize and fill in those cavities that said there of course will be situations where you need to get those cavities drilled and filled especially if they make it into the deep deep layers of the tooth and you do not want those cavities to persist and for back try into proliferate in those deeper layers of the teeth and down into the bone that is oh bad for reasons we talked about early or nucleus for your mouth in your teeth but for your general health and brain health included for that reason and also because the history of dentistry with such that join that early part of the last century if you had a toothache in a cavity what did they do they pull the teeth they extracted the teeth than at some point this business of filling teeth became industry standard people would get metal fillings now the types of metal fillings that people had and have depend on when they got those fillings there were believe it or not lead fillings as is not good you do not want lead in your body for all sorts of reasons it is terrible for brain health it is why it is now e legal to contain and paints and many household goods you do not want lead fillings but some people had lead fillings or silver fillings or commination of lead sit over and other things and many metal fillings that were given and sometimes are still given depending on where you live in the world and country and the kind of half care and costs that you have available to you contain mercury now i ask several dentist about this and said well if somebody has a met filling that likely has mercury in it do they need to have that metal filling removed and all of the dentist i spoke to said it depends but generally the practices to leave those fillings in and try not to disrupt them now they also provided a important recommendation which is if you have metal fillings that contain mercury or that you think might contain mercury to avoid interrupting those fillings to the use of things mastic gum we have not talk to much about mastic gum a i e used mastic gum before not for long periods of time it is a very thick gum ah the original use of mastic gum and the the kind of origins of mastic gum or a tree sap the kind of to substance that you chew on as ta strengthen your jaw et camera am i do not use it any longer i use it for a short while does not taste much of anything some people believe there are certain anti inflammatory and other health benefits of mastic gum i have not really explored mastic gum and enough depth or detail to comment on any of that but a number of dentist said well if you have metal fillings chewing on things mastic gum or hard candies where you really chewing on on that hard candy which by the way your puss to stuck the hard candy the jolly rancher not up to chew on them but that some people will do that they are just naturally chew on those can actually disrupt and liberate some of that mercury and that would be bad and keep in mind also that when mercury is contained in a metal filling it is not really inactive in that mode but if it is liberated then it can get into the blood stream and potentially cause other issues this is a somewhat controversial topic much that in certain countries and i believe in the e use somebody check me on this by believe that in the not too distant future metal fillings will no longer be used in the european union perhaps elsewhere in the world there sometimes still used in the united states is a lot that is changing in this landscape around fluoride around metal fillings et camera soothe very dynamic landscape right now i think suffice to say that if you have metal fillings currently try not to disrupt them in a way that could liberate that mercury however if you have them in your really concern about them talk your dentist ask what the various options are see whether not that could be replaced with something safer and if the process for replacing them is really worth the trouble and again to just go back to the larger point of wether not you should get cavities filled whether not you need that route canal that was a very common question a lot of people said do we really need route canals do we really need to drill cavities yet my observation based on now having talk to a number of different practitioners in the space really pay a lot of attention to the pure reviewed research the old school practice is the new practicing where everything is headed is that you there are indeed instances where people need rout canals there are many cavities that are just too deep into the teeth that demineralization of the teeth through the sorts of photo calls that were talking bout day is not going to cut it that they really need to be drilled and filled and of course we hope those dentist are doing that as little as is required to maintain dental health i also would hope the dentists are talking to their patients about ways that they can improve their oral health and indeed they're a lot of cases reported on line or people will go in get ax rays and in exam they will talk about all these cavities that they have than they go home and they do a bunch of practices and they are able to demineralize their teeth and too essentially reverse those cavities and i certainly do not doubt those stories but it is simply not always the case that we can demineralize our teeth an fill back in our cavities if those cavity recesses are too deep into the teeth they need to be drilled and filled now that raises a final set of questions and points which is do we really need to go to the dentist twice a year every six months that is the general recommendation and this is the tricky one asked dentists because of course dentist are highly incentivize to see their nations and ism not somebody that believes that everything is at as an attempt to make money but look when money's involve hangs can get complicated now what was really great is that the feet back i got from dentists was very balanced i mean o i must say that the community of dentists seems a really wonderful community i know how they treat each other but they were very kind very generous with information with me and at the end of this episode just before wrapping it'll refer you to a couple a on line oral health and dentist educators that i think are providing some really useful content on a consistent basis and it'll provide links to those in the shoot captions but here is what the consensus was this business of going to the dentists twice a year makes sense it make sense from the perspective of coming routine cleanings but every one acknowledge that those routine cleanings while they can remove tartar that is built up that would be very very difficult for people to reverse or eliminate at home and while they can i identify cavities and tell you how far cavity has developed into the tooth et camera every one of those dentists agreed that those routine cleanings are not actually going to help demineralize your teeth except to the extent that they remove existing bacteria place and tarter and all of them said that they wish for and that they really strive in their own practices to promote more oral health daily protocols of the sort that we have talked about to day which i thing is just great i think obviously at believe in medical professionals providing routine care i also believe in each and all of us doing things for our health not just oral health but sleep health mental health physical health et camera to trying not just maintain but really bolster our brain and body against disease and also to bolster our vitality to feel really great energetic focus sleeping better et camera it was refreshing to hear that they feel that way as well and in addition to that all the dentist i spoke to said that setting aside situations of li reconstructive a surgery for the mouth or periodontal surgery which often is needed if that those recesses into the gums and gingivitis and and worse have started to really develop in proliferate all of them emphasized that the twice a year dental visit is not just about getting the cleaning it is really the check up to a valuate how those daily practices are emerging it is worth going to the doctor for a check up on your be ami on your blood pressure but also things blood tests things that typically we do not do at home unless we are accessing those through on particular sources but all of them emphasize that going to the dentist twice a year is not just about those cleanings it is also about establishing what the baseline level of health is in one's mouth and teeth and having that on record and in a very detailed way that one can check back routinely twice a year and discover whether or not in fact they could get away with perhaps one cleaning a year because you are diligent about your brushing flossing lie t hall a not being a mouth breather and on and on or perhaps if you are not being very good about those protocols or and this is important if you have some of the genetic variance that create an over proliferation of certain bacteria that predispose you to gingivitis or that predispose you to excessive build up of tartar this is the reality that some people have genetic variations that create a susceptibility to certain things both bacteria and other conditions in the mouth the make it such that those people perhaps need to go to the dentist not just twice a year but perhaps four times a year or six times a year indeed their some individuals for whom either because of lack of diligence to protocol and or genetic issues actually need to go to the dentist every single month for major cleanings but fortunately if we are diligent about these daily protocols night time protocols and we really are paying attention to the components that can create healthy saliva and demineralize the teeth and that can fill in any cavities that begin to form and were having off the production of stmutans and were scraping way that big film on a regular basis that we are going to prevent the need for many routine cleanings and even if we are still getting those two a year routine cleanings for those out there that are fortune enough to have that covered by insurance or can afford it well then all the better because as i mention the being of to day's episode oral health is not just about having clean straight white teeth and fresh breath it is not just about that all of those things are great to have but oral health is about all of that and it is also about reducing party of vascular disease it is about reducing irritable balilsindrom yes i know that we have not done an episode about this yet but i get oh many request to do episodes about irritable balilindrum and other colitis type a bowling got issues that people have and it is clear that oral health and promoting oral health has been linked to promoting positive got health as well maybe even reducing and possibly eliminating som of the symptoms of irritable bad disease because again the mouth and the gut are contiguous with one another they are related and a lot of the bacteria that can cause things got issues are making their way into the body not directly through the gut but through the oral cavity because of the richness of blood flow to that region again to day we have talked about a lot of different protocols ranging from cut saving to zero cost to low cost to let just be frank higher cost products and protocol such as water picks et camera the point of today's discussion was essentially threefold first of all to really tamp down in our minds the importance of oral health not just tooth health but oral health on the whole because of its relationship to brain and body health on the whole much that ism placing it right up there next to the other six pillars of sleep nutrient movements tresmodulation relationships and light as the seventh pillar of critical to attend to on a daily basis in order to promote our mental health physical health and performance the second point is that there are many things that we are probably doing currently that we could do differently either by doing them more or perhaps less or eliminating them altogether things considering whether or not these antiseptic call base mouth washes are good for you or not they are not we're bad for you in my opinion but you can decide for you how often you brush when you brush whether or not you decide to puzzle its all et camera as ways to improve your oral health and of course in doing the strength of your teeth the brightness of your teeth the freshness of your breath et camera but through some means that i think for most people they were not aware of i certainly was not aware that we could demineralize our teeth at any moment by changing the acidity the chemical mill you of our mouth and that their very straight forward cost savings your costs in lowest ways to do that and then the third point is that today's discussion by no means was exhaustive right you may be exhausted but it was by no means exhaustive meaning we simply do not have time to go down the rabbit hole of all these other promoted health practices such as for instance oil pulling a lot of people out there believe that if you take olive oil an swish around your mouth and spitted out that is good for your mouth and indeed some dental health care professionals i should say license dental health care professional said yet i think there's some benefit to that there is the whole story about vote him indeed and whether not we are getting enough i this indeed can indeed impact our tooth health mature your citizen deelevels are sufficient i you're getting some sunlight again this tisinto some of the other six pillars am i suggesting that everyone do oil pulling no i do not think the pure reviewed evidence on oil pulling is sufficient to suggest that people do that but as a practice considering that it is essentially near zero costs muon taking limit of olive oil swishing round your mouth and spitting it out couple sense may be am youknough that something that you feel benefits you great if you are aware of some terrific purereviewed research on that and you want a p a link to that in the comments on you tore great please send them my way at love to review them but my point is that there are lot of different practices that have been promoted including royal pulling and a bunch of other things that start to get prate far into the esoteric which does not necessarily mean that they do not have merit but to day have really tried to focus on the major ones the ones that relate to what most everybody could and should be doing brushing and flossing ringing getting the oral microfilm healthy reducing the amount of strep mutant than the opportunity of strep mutant to create that acid that is going to repeat the enamel of your teeth and lead to tooth decay trying to limit the amount of recessing of the gums and periodontal disease and for all the reasons that we talked about before keeping a healthy mouth including healthy teeth healthy tom healthy gums healthy pallet and all the rest is so important notes for your mouth notes for speaking and smiling and licked the way you want to look but also for your heart also for your gut also for your believe

welcome to the german late science science pace to for i and your supermen and om a professor of neurology and opthemology at stamford school of medical today we are going to discuss sugar in particular how our nervous system regulates our sugar intake and are seeking of sugar we are also going to discuss how sugar regulates our nervous system and as you will soon learn sugar really impacts our brain end body by two main mechanismone of those mechanisms is based on the sweet taste of sugar which it self is rewarding even if you are not much of a sweet tooth i confess ism not most people enjoy sweet tastes more than bitter tastes and the sweet taste of sugar and its various forms is strongly reinforcing meaning it triggers the activation of neuron's nerve cells in the brain and body that make us want to consume more of that sweet substance incidentally sweet taste also make us want to eat more of other substances as well you may be familiar with that phenomenon now sugar also trials mechanisms in the brain and body based on its nutritive content independent of its sweetness what that means is that the actual colonic content and the way that sugar interacts with your nervous system at a subconscious level without your awareness also impacts your craving and seeking of sugar and other foods to day we are going to discuss what happens when you invest sugar in terms of your body's reaction and your brains reaction we are so going to talk about what happens when you do not invest enough sugar is it turns out sugar is such a powerful fuel for the brain that under conditions where people do not invest enough sugar or whether call blood glucose which is basically blood sugar of our particular form gets too low there neurons do not function as well that said there conditions of very low blood sugar in which neurons conjunction even better to day we are going to talk about the ins and outs the ups and downs of sugar as it relates your nervous system and by the end of this episode ism confident thatyou have a much clear picture as to how much sugar you should be investing whether not you should avoid sugars that your currently eating and you will certainly understand much much more about the energy and fuel sources that your brain relies on which ism certain will allow you to make better inform choices about the foods you eat and avoid toward mental health physical health and performance before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i tho thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens a let i greens is and all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athleticgreens once or twice a day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional ends it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which or vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the probilics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen and claim a special offer the give you i free travel packs plus a year supply of videoed three k too therefore too stand ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitemend three and k too is also important because it regulates things carevascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the free travel packs and the year supply of vitamin three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar of talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues in organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that you are getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do cam slash supermen and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do am slash supermen of let us talk about sugar lets talk about how sugar impact your brain and how your brain impacts your pursuit or your avoidance of sugar let us get a few things out of the way first the first thing is that there is nothing inherently bad about sugar i know the word sugar gets a bad rap nowadays and indeed you arguing to hear over and over again during the spot cast that consuming a lot of refine sugars in particular hyphroctos corn syrup is known to have a very large number of bad effects on the brain and body i do not know that there is any one that really debates that any more even if we just agree and i think we should all agree on the called calories in calories out principal rite it is a principle of thermodynamics that if we in jest more energy than we burn we are going to wainwright if w a in jest less energy than we burn we are generally going to lose weight and if the two things are in balance ingestion and burning of energy well then we are going to maintain weight everyone agrees on that i agree on that but beyond that there are a number of ways in which particular nutrients and the case of to day's episode sugar impact the way that the brain works such that we tend to seek out more of particular nutrients for instance if we eat sugar there are too or at least two mechanisms by which we will crave more sugar think most people are aware of that experience but to day am going explain exactly how that works but also that when we invest sugar it has a bunch of different effects on the way that are curl circuits work that can allow us to be more or less focus more or less agitated more or less happy more or less depressed in some cases to day as we explore this thing were calling sugar we are going to explore that mainly in the contact of the nervous system but also in the contacts of how the nervous system regulates many many functions and behaviors that are important to all of you your ability think your ability to exercise your ability gain weight lose weight whatever your rolls might happen to be sugar plays a critical roll in achieving those goals and in some cases if you're investing too much of the wrong times of the wrong forms sugar can actually impede those goals in fact sugar can pretend all the right behaviors from allowing you to achieve the goals that you want to day we are going to place sugar into its proper contact the way i want a start off by doing that is to tell you a little bit of what happens when we eat and a little bit of what the brain does to respond to those events what happens when we eat well have done an entire episode on metabolism if you are interested in the full cascade of hormonal and curl events that occurs when we eat please check out that episode but for sake of to day's discussion let just take a what i call top contour view of the hormonal response to ingesting food now any time we eat that is the consequence of a number of things that happen be for we at there is a hormone in our brain and body called gremlin spelled g h re e l i and gremlin is a hormone that increases depending on how long its been since we ate last o case of the longer its been since we had a meal gremlin levels are going to be higher and higher and higher and it essentially makes us hungry by interacting with particular neurons in an are o the brain call the arcuate nuclear of the hypothalamus and some other areas as well the lateral hypothalamus you do not need to know the names those brainareas but if you to know them there they are gremlin increases it tends to make us hungary and then when we eat typically what happens is gremlin levels go down it is a very logical system now when we eat assuming that we eat carbohydrates but even if we just eat some proline and some facts we will experience a slight or in some cases a large rise in blood glucose blood glucose is simply blood sugar and the body and brain we should say particular the nervous system doesn't function well if blood sugar is too high or too low as a consequence we have another hormone which is released from the pancreas which is called insolent which helps regulate the amount of glucose in the blood stream even if you were to invest and entire a cup an right lance cup of pure table sugar which would sendyour blood glucose very very high assuming thatyou have a normal insolent response that you are not diabetic that insolent response with help clamp that blood locos level that it did not cause damage to your brain and body because if blood sugar goes to high its actually toxic to anurans and other cells of your body can kill them off and neurons of the central nervous systemeaningthe brain and spinal sort once they are dead they do not come back your a biological systems under stand this at biological level that is and prevent that death of cells due to high blood sugar by keeping insolent around in order to clamp blood glucose diabetics we call them type one diabetes who do not make insolent have to take insolent when they eat in particular when they eat foods that raise their blood sugar specifically to avoid that neurotoxicity and the other dilitarious effects of high blood sugar cases o grellenis a hormone that goes up the longer its beencents we have eaten intends to stimulate hunger when we eat gremlin is suppressed blood glucose typically goes up especially when we eat a carbohydrate containing meal when blood glucose goes up its regulated in the body meaning its peaks and its valleys are more less smooth out and that glucose is sequestered it is taken away where it needs to be taken away and in certain locations its delivered to cells that the cells can use the glucose now one of the chief organs for glucose utilization is the brain neurons are tremendously metabolically active and there preferred mode of metabolism is glucose metabolism in other words neurons basically run on sugar which is not to say that you should eat a lot of sugar as you will see to day there are states of mind em body for instance fasted states in which people report having immense amounts mental clarity and their blood glucose is actually quite low it is simply not the case that the more sugar that you invest the better that yourbrain will function but it is the case that for most people meaning people are not on a quitogenic or very carbohydrate diet they're not adapted to locarbohydrat dits that neurons in their brain and body are using glucose in order to function that is what allows to neurons to fire electrical potentials that'hil we refer to it firing meaning sending electrical signals down their length to communicate with other grants to illustrate just how important glucose is for brain function it'd to describe a study that just recently came out that sits on a long history of similar studies but the one that just came out is particularly in interesting now i want to point out that unless i say otherwise i am going to refer to typical diets meaning i have to believe that most people out there are investing some starch or carbohydrate i do realize the are people following very low carbohydrate diets or moderately carbohydrate diets i even know there sand folks at there on the local carnivores they only meat and organs may be a little fruit but am going to assume that the vast majority of people listening in jest prolines and carbohydrates unless i say key biogenic we i emphasize due mitosis itself which i will ism referring to kind of typical diet where people are consuming fats prolines and carbohydrates i count myself as of one such individual some point i might try the carnivora who knows i might try of pure vegan diet who knows but for my entire life on until now in forty six years old give been a proud omnivore meaning have trite high quality as much as i can unprocessed foods i try and really avoid highly process foods but i do eat from those three macrnutraint groups prolines carbohydrates and fatal i an assume that most of you do as well the study i to emphasize recorded from neuron's nerve cells in the brain in particular in the part of the bring that responds to visual images called visual quartan and neurons in the visual quarters are beautifully tuned as we say to particular features of what we see the primary example of this the kind of classic example is if you put a electron next to a neuron in your visual quarters or if we put you into an ever f am our e skin or machine which can detect neral activity and i were to show you a bunch of a just little lines in bars of light they can be dark bars of light that count be a light bars of light on a screen in frond of you some would be vertical sone would be horizontal some would be at forty five degrees what we would see is that some neurons respond best meaning the fire a lot of electrical activity to vertical lines other ones respond to horizontal lines and others respond to forty five degree lines and this called orientation tuning meaning because the orientational line is a cardinal classic feature of the way that your visual system is built and everything that you see whether it is a face or a dog or a cat or a landscape is built up from these very simple neuron responses in other words when you look at a face there are neurons deep in the brain that respond to faces but the only reason that those neurons can respond to those faces is because they receive signals from neurons in your visual quarter some of which respond of vertical lines some of which respond to horizontal lines and some which respond to forty five degree lines and all of those are built up in what we call a hierarchical representations just fancy language for those are the building blocks by which you see efface and you recognize a faces man's really an amazing phenomenon happens very very fast you never notice that your doing this but everything is built up from these fundamental orientation used neurons now orientation to neurons are fundamental that they or the building blocks by which you make up all other things that you see it is the way you read it is the way that you recognized faces as i mention and everything else experimentally it is quite straightforward to measure how sharply tune one of these neurons is in other words if i were to show you a vertical line and find an neuron in your brain that response to vertical lines i could also ask whether or not that neuron fires an thy electrical activity in response to a line that is not quite vertical may be just ten degrees off vertical or twenty degrees or thirty degrees and what i eventually would find is that that neuron was orientation tune over a particular range of angles it is not only going to respond o vertical lines it is also go in respond to lines that are about ten degrees off vertical in either side but probably not much more may be twenty but usually its can be anywhere from vertical to just tilted slightly one in the recent experiment that was published in the journal neuron sell press journal excellent journal the authors asked a really interesting question they asked whether or not the sharpness of tuning the precision of orientation tuning of these neurons is dependent on blood glucose level just a cut to the chase to give you the answer what they found is that when subjects are well fed neurons that responded to vertical responded very strongly to vertical but not very much at all to other angles of what we call stimuli to lines that are ten degrees are twenty degrees off if they looked at neurons that were primarily tune right that preferred horizontal lines they found the same thing toque was not something unique to vertical lines what they basically found was the sharpness the precision of tuning of neurons in the brain was best when subjects were fed and conversely when subjects were fasted the orientation tuning of these neurons became much broader what it meant was that a neuron that normally would only respond to vertical now responded to other angles of lines as well you might say well that is great right these neurons that at one point could only do one thing are now tune to other things but it is not great because what the means is that in the fasted state your perception of the outside world is actually distorted it is lured it is not as precise as it is when you are fed and when i say fed what i really mean is when glucose is available to neurons now for some of you may be many of you and including myself interment an fasting or some variant thereof is actually a state that i it allows me to focus for instance i as i mention before and even earlier in this pokes i tend to eat my first meal sometime around eleven a m and then i generally at my last meal i some time around eight p m plucermanus an hour on either side ism not superscript about an occasion ill wake up really hungry and it'll eat something before eleven a m ism not superscript about this intermittent fasting thing it just seems to be how my appetite works best given my schedule et camera in the morning i tend to be most focused and i always associate that with the fact that i was fasted i just water in some affine about ninety minutes after waking up by drink by caffeine but a hydrate from the time i get up et camera et camera and i know a lot of other people have had the experience of being fasted in feeling lie the have a lot of mental clarity when you are in a fasted state typically you are going to use fuels that are available to the neurons based on your intake of food the day before may be its you are using some glikeagin may be are using some fat maybe are using some blood sugar that is derived from other store sites in the bod you do not actually use fat as a fuel source for neurons under typical conditions but there are ways in which prolines and fats and gliadin et camera are converted into fuel that neurons can use what is interesting about this study is that the study says that when well fed meaning when blood glucose sugar is at a properly elevated level in the blood stream it can be delivered to the brain in a way that allows neurons to work best which is really all just to underscore the point that i made earlier which is that your nervous system is extremely metabolically demanding and it loves glucose neurons love glucose the take away from the study is not that you should avoid fasting the take away from the study is that there are elements of the fasted state in particular that elevations and things epinefran and norepinefran also call the adrenalin and noradrenalin that can give us this kind of clarity of mind that many people are pursuing when they fast that is cold one of the reasons a lot of people fast they the way that they feel mentally an physically but i think its only fair to point out that glucose is the preferred source of fuel for the brain and this study that i mention is one of many study is that of explored how nutritional status or blood luck status in the brain embody influence coronal tuning in neuronal function and it really points to the fact that ultimately your brain as an organ is a glucose consuming machine now when you eat a food that food is broken down and if it contains carbohydrates going to be converted into glucose and that glucose cannot get directly into the brain as a fuel source it actually has to be carried across the call blood brain barrier the b b b and the actual metabolism of of glucose and the delivery of the glucose to the neurons is carried out by a different cell type and its the teletype that you should all know about because its the most abundant teletype in your brain and may been in your entire nervous system that is the called astrogate atrocities are one of several types of plea the word plea means glue but many people have taken that name plea glue to think that oh the only thing that the exorcises are doing i just kind of holding things together actually the excites are involved in delivering glucose to the neurons they are critically involved in shaping your coronal function and brain plasticity the brains ability to change in response to experience these exercises are the little waiters and waitresses bringing glucose to the turns and the neurons are going to do the heavy lifting that is involved in perception in behavior in action if prior to this episode you did not already realize that glucose blood sugar is vital to the function of your brain and other neurons of your nervous system now and for those of you that have experience the increase in mental clarity that comes after a properly timed properly composed meaning has the right maccronutrians in the right rations and the properly sized mum well then now you have justification for eating something in in as a way to improve the way that your brain works it turns that your brain is going to work best when it is got glucose available whether you to fast or not that is just the reality of things the same thing is also true for the neurons in your body the way that you are able to move the limbs of your body the way you are able to perform exercise or movement of any kind for that matter is because neurons called motor neurons send electrical potentials to the muscle fibers they release a hero transmitter called a see to calling which causes contraction of the muscle fibers and allows you to move your limbs those neurons are also very metabolically demanding especially when you are doing demanding types of physical work and that to be cycling or running or weight lifting or yoga whatever it may be those neurons require a ton of glucose if you have ever had the experience of having to think very hard about how you are generating a movement or force yourself to continue to endure in a given exercise you might have thought oh ism running out of fuel that is why ism getting tired it is hard to do at'sectually the case sometimes but that is not always the case one of the reasons that it fuels work is because t you are called upper motor neurons toughen the control the lower motor neurons in your sponicort which control your muscles they have to be very metabolically active it is one thing to engage in a reflective movement here you just walking around or if your running continuously but when you suddenly have to focus on what you are doing and you have to generate specific patterns of motor movement well that feels demanding because one it increases the release of a adrenalin in your brain and body which makes you feel lutomie agitated in more alert but also deliberate thought deliberately controlling the way that your brain and body is moving requires more glucose uptake more energy in those very neurons and this is also why after doing a long boat of exercise you might be tired but also if you do a bound of skill learning of any kind or if you have been reading and thinking about what your reading or if you had a intense conversation with somebody were you really forcing yourself to listen and hopefully they are listening to you too and your rally trying to parts what they are saying and may you're doing that ray now and you are trying to really tract something that is work and that work requires glucose up take by neurons both in the brain and in your body now that we have establish that glucose is the preferred source of fuel for the nervous system i to concentrate on a few of the other types of sugars that we ingest on a common basis and the impact that those have on brain function and body function it'd particularly to focus on fructose fructose of course is found in fruit is also found in the infamous high fruits corn syrup which we will talk about to day it is worth pointing out that the concentrations of fructose in fruit is quite low compared to the concentrations of fructose in hifructos corn sure hifructos coinsure is a proximately fifty per cent fructose which turns out to be enormously high per centare of anything really especial when we contrast that to the concentrations of rectos in fruit fruits have other types of sugars in them as well a you the sucrose content of most fruit and fruit juices is low a although there are some fruits melin'speaches pine apples and forth they contain a li less than ten per cent or of sucrose a things mangos can have a lot of sucrose but typically the amount of fructose fructose i i think its the proper pronunciation that people are always correcting me frug to is anywhere from one per cent too about ten per cent right it is really gan a very quite a bit and many of yow have probably heard to the call glyceric index which is a basically a measure of how fast blood sugar rises after eating particular foods at several were gan set aside the glycol mace index for now we will come back to it it has some relationship to the concentrations of fructose in fruit but the point id to make is that fructose as a sugar is handled very differently in the body then is glucose but i also one to emphasize that because the percentage of fructose in fruit is rather low especially compared to his fructose corn syrup many people have demonized fructose saying that fruits makes you fat or that fruit makes you fat if you look at the data that is not really the case the fact of the matter is that the concentrations of fructose and fruit are low that unless some one is consuming a lot of fruit or there consuming a lot of fruit on the backdrop of a highly process diet or a die that has a lot of other stuff that they might not want to be in jesting you cannot really say that fructose is fattening i do not really think that there is any basis for saying that fructose itself is bad now high fructose corn syrup is a different issue and too much consumption of anything but fructose included where the nut comes fruit or otherwise can be a problem for the ways that it impacts the neural circuits that process sugar notches glucose but fructose and will illustrate those neral circuits in a bit and will become very clear to all of you regardless of whether i have a background in biology or metabolism nutrition or otherwise why ingesting very high concentrations of fructose is not going to be a good thing for the way that your brain functions one of the key distinctions between glucose an fructose is that fructose most likely cannot directly access the brain it actually needs to be converted into glucose in the liver and the way that conversion occurs feeds back to a set of hormones and curl pathways that we talked about earlier which have a lot to do with appetite in ludic summarize what is now a lot of very solid data fructose and specifically fructose has the ability to reduce certain hormones and peptides in our body whose main job is to suppress gremlin as you recall grellanis a hormone that increases the longer it is been since we have eaten and gremlin makes us hungry by stimulating particular means in our hypothalamus it actually makes us really want to eat and in particular really makes us want to eat sugary and fatty foods fructose reduces the activity of the hormones that reduce gremlin and the neck consequence of that is that fructose increases gremlin although i and i think pretty much everyone else there save for a few individuals agrees that calories and calories out is the fundamental principle of weightless mate weight maintenance a weight gain investing fructose shifts are hormone system and as a consequence our curl pathways within our brain the hypothalamus to be hungrier regardless of how many calories we have eaten ski now i also on o be absolutely clear this does not mean that eating an apple or eating a melon or eating in at couple of tricots or something is going to make you hyperopic meaning tin son to make you just one to eat an eating that is simply not the case but if you compare fructose and you compare glucose not only are they metabolize differently in the brain and body but in addition to that fructose has this impact of reducing the hormones that reduce hunger hormones and curl circuits and fructose does have this kind of twist in its a tintype right are or its i guess if fructose had a dating profile this would be a kind of a red flag in a in that profile because fructose itself while it is actually a pretty good fuel source in in many ways and it is often packaged in things fruits which bring along fiber incitements and minerals that i think for many of us are are things that we should be eating more open investing more of it can suppress the pathways that suppress hunger and as a consequence it can increase hunger current recommendations for most people are to eat more fruits and vegetables but for those of you that are trying to control your hunger ingesting a lot of fructose is probably nocking be a good idea certainly investing it from hyfructos corn syrup is not in to be good idea because of the enormous percentages of fructose in hyfructoscornser fifty per cent or sometimes even more but even from fruit some people will find that fruit really quenches their appetite other people will find that fruit stimulates their appetite and i suppose if your think stimulate your appetite than in jesting more fruit might actually a be advantageous to you fructose provides a bridge for us between a particular kind of sugar hormone function in this case ireland end the hypothalamus which leads us to the next question which is what is it about sugar that makes it such an attractive thing for us why do we it much and the obvious answer that most people arrive at is well it just taste really really good but that is actually not the way it works the rewarding properties as we say of sugar whether not they come in the form of sucrose or fructose or foods that increase glucose to a very high level actually is not just related to the taste of the foods that produce that elevation in luck sucrose fructose it is in part but that is only part of the story and the rest of the story once you understand it can actually place you in a position to much better control your sugar in take of all kinds but also your food in takin ways that can allow you to make much better choices about the foods you invest an actually at this point i should probably give a confession said today and it'll say it again and have said it on previous pod gas that do not have much of a sweet tooth and indeed that is true i i can can pass on chocolate or ice creamer things that seems with each successive year am sweet things are less and less appealing to me of course savory foods a anything that is really fatty salty savory of those do not last long a in my presence but i way say it do not really likes sweet thing much and i do not i sweet people but i do not tend to sweet foods a which is true but there is probably one exception and that is mangoes and turns out that a mangos have the highest percentage of sugar in them in particular fructose as well as other forms of of sugars a what i do because i love mango much is i will have mangoes probably twice a week but it'll have them after some sort of resistance training or hard on or something that because it is the case that after you exercise hard in particular exercise that is of the high intensity variety that your body is more efficient at using circulating blood sugar it is able to store that or use that for fuel and the what it'll typically do as just take the manguashe eat the peals to i know the prole some people gin a cringe when they hear that i find them delicious i just bite into those things apples i do not eat the pits however now i want to take us on a journey into the nervous system to explain the pathways in the brain and body that regulate our appetite for sugar keep in mind what i already told you before which is that when we invest foods the broken down in to various components and glucose is going to be shuttled to the brain and of course to other barons and our sponalcort and elsewhere and to our muscles et camera in order for all of those cells and organs and tissues to be able to function the fact that many sells and organs and tissues require glucose in order to function has led to a situation where you have dedicated neral machinery pieces of your brain that are almost entirely if not entirely devoted to seeking out of sugar or foods that contain sugars and to make sure that you not only seek those out but you now where those foods are and that you invest more and more and more of them and their two main ways that these nerd circuits work in fact we can say that there are two nerd circuits entirely that work in parallel and this is a common theme throughout the nervous system and that is parallel pathways parallel pathways are the ways that you can distinguish light from dark parallel pathways of theta's that you can distinguish high pitch sounds from low pitch sounds parallel pathways we the ways that you can fleet your muscles verses extend your muscles for instance if you move your rest closer to your shoulder your flexing your bicep and your actually inhibiting your action preventing the action of your tried if you move your you are risk away from your shoulder you are essentially using your expense or your triceps and your inhibiting the activity of your bicep for every function in your body that you might think is controlled by one brain airy are one nerd circuit almost always there are two or more called parallel pathways that insure that that particular behavior happens now in the case of sugar consumption the two parallel pathways involve one pathway related to the actual taste and the perception of sweet taste that lead not just you but every animal that we are aware of to seek more sweet containing foods the other parallel pathway is related to the nutritive component of sweet foods meaning the degree to which a given food will raise blood glucose i wont a repeat that one pathway in your brain and bodies devoted to getting you to seek out sweet tasting things that you perceive as sweet and another parallel pathway is devoted to getting you to seek out foods that lead to increases in blood glucose it just happens that the foods that lead to big increases in blood glucose typically are associated with that sweet taste now this is distinctly different then the curl pathways that control seeking of savory foods or salty foods or spicy foods for that matter or bitter foods the sweet pathway is what we would call hard wired it exists as far as we know in every mammal that even exists in fruit flies hence fruit fly basically getting sweet stuff into the body might seem has a lot to do with the taste but it has just as much to do with the nutritive components that sweet tasting foods carry and the fact that your nervous system and many cells in your brain an body run on glucose if you re call earlier i said even if you invest rectos fructose can be converted into glucose in the liver and i mention of course that fructose may actually work directly on the brain that still unclear for humans yon the jury still out on that w will see but the fundamental thing to understand here is that when you think you want a piece of chocolate or you think you want a piece of cake or your craving something sweet you are both craving the taste and your neurons are literally craving the neutralize components that arrive with with that taste and simply by understanding that can allow you to circumvent some of the sugar cravings that you might otherwise be a complete hopeless victim to also in this episode i will talk about ways that you can sort of undermine or short circuit these circuits if you will in order to reduce sugar cravings on a regular basis if that is your goal two parallel pathways one of the parallel pathways has to do with conscious perception animals of all kinds mice rats and humans will prefer sugary taste to non sugary taste when we eat something that taste sweet we register that sweet taste by way of sweet receptors literally little ports or portals of a neurons on are tongue end on our palate lot people do not realize us but therefore a lot of taste receptors on the soft polite and around the mouths on the sides of the mouths we you're actually tasting things not just with your tongue but with your entire mouth in your polite when you invest something sweet very quickly their signal sent from those anurans in your mouth to brain areas that cause you to seek out or at least pay attention to the source and the abundance of those sweet things they literally change your perception in fact there are beautiful narrowimaging studies that show that when people invest a sugary drink their perception of images of food change very much to make those foods appear more appetizing and not just foods that contain sugar results of those studies do show that threes an increase for instance in the a perception of detail and images of ice cream after you injustice sweet drink or even t a put a hard candy into your mouth it will make you seek out sugary things more it will make sugary things look more appetizing but also other foods more appetizing i think it is important that people recognize that fact that when you have a sweet taste in your mouth or when you have tasted something sweet within your mouth i should say your perception of food has immediately shifted these are fasceneral pathways and will get into some of the brain structures in a moment but these are fasceneral pathways that shift your entire self toward seeking more sugary stuff and more food generally does that mean that you should never invest anything sweet no certainly them not saying that everyone as to decide for themselves what the appropriate amount of sugar in take is but i find it remarkable when people say o no i need to get my sugar fix re i need to have my chocolate i need have a little bit of something just cannot take care of that sugar appetite because in taking care of that sugar appetite may be for the very discipline of view you can just have that one piece of chocolate its great and can relish in it but it does shift the way that you perceive other foods as well and the way it does that is through are probably if your listener of this pocks now old friend but incredible neramotulator dopamine dopamine is a molecule that is released from several places in the brain there is a called mess limbic reward pathway which is a whole set of places in the brain or circuits design to get us motivated and craving and in pursuit of things and then of course there are areas of the brain that are involved in movement that are linked up with those areas involved in motivation that makes perfect sense why would you have a brain area involved in motivation if you could actually do something with that motivation the way that your brain is designed is when there is an increase in dopamine in the musolymic reward pathway their signal sent tenure of the bring called the stratum where n a spend a limit of time today in the stratum it is got a dorsal part meaning in a upper part in a ventropartmeich means a lower part and the dopamine sent to those areas places places excuse me into modes of action to pursue particular things sugar or sweet tastes i should say to be more specific have an incredibly patentability to activate dopamine release within the esolymic reward pathway this has been shown over and over and over again in animal models and in humans this is especially true i should mention through the ingestion of sweet liquids now this becomes a very important point to us a little later on when we talk about the proliferation of sodas and sweet drinks and there i even say non sugar or diet sodas we are going get into that elicit later the on perhaps one of the most third rail topics in a nutrition but when we ingest something sweet the perception of that sweet taste increases dopamine and the metonymic reward pathways which then are convey to pathways for motor behavior and in general place us into modes of focused action toward getting more of whatever was sweet again for those of you that are very discipline you can probably eat that pet one piece of chocolate and be just fine but if you understand the way that dopamine works what you realize is that when this dopamine pathway is triggered it tends to create not the sensation or the perception of satiety of feeling something is enough but rather to produce the sensation of wanting more as described in the episode that i hosted with my phenomenal colleague from stamforet school of medicine doctor onolympkiti is an expert on a diction and dopamine pathways the dopamine circuits of the brain have what we call a pleasure pain balance and there ism peraphra sing what doctor on alempky has said and has written about in her beautiful book dopamine nation if you have not read that book i highly recommend it whether not you have issues with a diction or people that do or you do not it is an incredibly important read especially your interest in understanding motive ate behaviors and ways to channel your behaviors in life toward healthy motif attend behaviors and make sure that you avoid some of the common pitfalls that people fall into noxious addiction but things over use of osociamedia or a wasting time in general it is a phenomenal book in that book end of course within research articles you will find evidence of this called pleasure pain balance that exists within our dopamine circuits nobody has dopamine circuits that allow them to escape this pleasure pain balance and the way this works is that any time that we engage in a behavior or we invest something that increases our levels of dopamine there is a subsequent increase in the nerd circuits that control are sense of frustration pain and lack you can actually notice the phenomenon if for instance your somebody who really likes chocolate or you really something else pay attention to the way that you experience indulging in that thing if you eat that piece of chocolate and you really focus on savoring its amazing taste you will notice that it provides some quenching of your desire for lets a sweet stuff or chocolate or both but right as you stop experiencing that wright is that chocolate in take tapers off as you swallow it down your throat are you just pause for a second afterwards what you will notice is that your brain and body actually orient toward wanting more and that wanting of more is really the action of the nail circuits that underlie pain and are pushing your dopamine levels back down and when these circuits go are or i should say when people fail to control themselves within the contacts of that pleasure pain balance the typical behaviors to reach for yet another chocolate or to then look for something that will quench that desire and get dopamine levels back up now the way these pleasure pain circuits work is diabolical cause it turns out that were you to take another piece of chocolate yes your doom levels would go back up but not to the same extent that they did the first fit of chocolate that you had in fact we can say that the longer it is been since you have indulged in something that you really enjoy or would the greater the dopamine you will experience when you finally engage in that behavior or indulge that thing in just that thing and the grater the dopamine increase the greater the subsequent action of those pain circuits this puts you on a very complicated cease a it is a very warily precarious state to be in which is not to say you should not have a piece of chocolate is just to say that the sweet taste of sweet things in particular things that we crave very much and we wait an wait an wait and than we allow ourselves to indulge those trigger changes in our narrow chemistry and or normal circuits that place us in a very vulnerable place to either want more and more of that thing or to seek out other ways to fill that kind of emptiness that we feel or that gap ah i would love more but ism not can allow myself more now again ism not saying that you should not presume pleasurable things i mean this molecule dopamine exists for reason it is the frankly because of its involvement in secs and reproduction it is the reason were all here in the first place because last time i cent the only way any of us i got here was one way or another per met egg and there was conception i still believe the know a exceptions to that am that ism aware of anyways that is a process or i should say the events leading up to that process typically involved dopamine and one way or another there are exceptions to that too but you get the idea these dooming pathways are not evil there not bad but once you understand the way they work you can leverage them to your advantage as opposed to them leveraging you to their advantage o case when you invest something sweet you perceive that sweet taste and a cascade ensues within your brain that makes you want more of the sweet thing that is the conscious pathway for sugar perception for sweet perception now there is the second pathway the second pathway is what is called the post injustice reenforcing properties of sugar which is really just a fancy nerd speak way of saying there events that happen when your with in your stomach and below your conscious detection that are also driving you to seek out sweet tasting things independent of their taste and foods that increase blood glucose independent of their taste in order to illustrate the immense power of these subconscious circuits for sugar seeking i to describe and experiment and this is just one experiment of many of dozens or more experiments done in animal models and humans which essentially illustrate the same thing and as i describe this experiment i think you will come to understand the power of these circuits it'll provide a link to the study a in the caption the first authors freemen ah the paper wish published in frontiers and by science but there's been others am papers in nature nor science papers and neuron express journals it see of many many journals many many papers if subjects are given the choice of drinking plain water or a sweet tasting fluid their preference for the sweet tasting fluid is much much higher sweet things taste better than plain water at least for most people and certainly for animals now if for instance you take an animal which completely lacks sweet re captors and you can do this through some a molecular genetic tools and gymnastics in the laboratory we call these knock out mice where you can knock out a particular receptor for sweet taste you can confirm that there no perception of sweet things or at least no preference for sweetthings a in those animals in humans you can numb the mouth or other a pharmacologic ways that you can eliminates sweet receptors in the mouth and by doing that you people will tell i cannot taste anything sweet is just thereat you could give them ice cream you can give them pure sucrose give them table sugar and they would not be able to perceive it as sweet if you eliminate the perception of sweet tastes in the mouth and you offer people or a laboratory animals a water verses some sugar containing solution they you eliminate the preference for the for the sugary solution which tells us that the perception of sweet is important for the for the preference for sweet tasting drink this is also true for sweet tasting foods i should mention however in both animal models and in humans after about fifteen minutes subjects start preferring the sugary water even though they cannot taste that it is sweeter i to repeat that if you eliminate the ability to sense sweet to perceive sweetness in foods then you eliminate the preference for sweet beverages or sweet foods that is not surprising but if you wait about fifteen minutes the preference for the sweet beverage of the sweet food comes back now that does not mean that they can perceive the sweetness in fact you the way these experiments or done as very clever you offer people a various cups of different things or different food items and they just look at what they eat more over what they prefer to eat more of this experiment is crucial because what it says is that the preference for sugar containing foods is in part due to the sweetness of those foods but in part due to something else and this something else is what we call the post digestive effect and as i mention before it took about fifteen minutes and you have actually experience this whether you realize or not this phenomenon of post digestive rewarding properties of sweet foods meaning what happens in your body when you ingest something that increases your blood glucose very much has no doubt controlled you from the inside below your awareness this was happening to you and din realize it heres how it works we all have neurons within our gut these barons have a name they are called uropod cells uropod cells were famously discovered by professor doctor ego pohorcas at duke university and these cells respond to among other things to the presence of sugar within the gut when we invest a sugary food or drink or we invest of food or drink that simply contains fruit sucrose clucks er some other form of sugar that later through metabolism will be converted into glucose the uropod sells are able to register the presence of those sweet or luck stimulating foods and in response to that send electrical signals because electrical signals are the way neurons communicate up to the brain i the called vaguest nerve the vagus nerve of course being nerve pathway famous for its roll in relaxation that is kind of the than the assumption out there that is always involved in relaxation that is not the case it is valved in a lot of things besides relaxation but none the less these uropod sells send electrical signals through a particular highway within the vagus to the call nodes gangland this is a cluck cluster of gangling just a cluster of neurons and then the nodes gangland sends on information to the nucleus of the solitary tract the nucleus of the solitary tract is an area of the brain that we are going to talk about extensively to day it is very important for understanding sugar preference these nuripodsells also trigger activation of dopamine pathways within the mesolebic reward pathway in other words there are signals conveyed from the gut meaning stomach and intestines to the brain any time we invest sweet foods but it has nothing to do with our perception of them being sweet has everything to do with the fact that sweetness of food is almost always correlated with an ability to increase blood glucose and the net effect of this is a parallel pathway by which dopamine is increased further now the experiment that i described before of animals are humans investing something that contain sugar but not being able to perceive its sweetness and yet after a period of time still preferring that food or drink to non sugar containing food or drinks even though they cannot distinguish their taste is dependent on these uropod sells and related pathways what this means for you is that any time you eat something sweet that substance is actually causing our got your stomach an your intestine where to be more precise i should say that substance is food substance is causing the uropod sells in your stomach and intestines to send a parallel set of signals up to your brain saying eat more of that or simply eat more eat more eat more and preferably eat more sweet foods we have all heard of hidden sugars meaning the sugars that manufacture have put into foods and disguised them with other flavors i talk about this in the episode on salt using salt to mask the taste of sweetness that people in jest more sugar that is not an accident that hidden sugars are often hidden with salt or with other flavors it is done that people will meaning you or me will want to invest more of a particular food independent of how sweet that food taste a in fact some crackers for instance chips for instance you might think oh well chips that are not sweet their salty an savory gan will mention a love salts the savory foods including certain food that love kettle chips for instance at cry not to walk by them in the grocery store i should have to eat one bagel in the store and then another later the savory foods are often laid in with these hidden sugars that we cannot register as sweetness but trigger the uropod cells which then further trigger dopamine which make us want more of them now we may be able to resist eating more of them but it makes us crave more food in general now we will talk about ways to regulate this pathway the sort intervene in this subconscious pathway but for now ism hoping that just the understanding that we all have this pathway this is hard wired into our body could potentially allow people to better understand why is it that their cravings are intents that it is not necessarily just about the taste of that food and when you consider this in concert with the fact that we have this dopamine plain pain pleasure balance souse me that i referred to earlier you start to realize that there re multiple mechanisms hard wired into us that make it especially hard to not eat the sweet thing or to not eat the for that were craving and indeed that is the case we have two major accelerators is a car with two accelerators and we will talk about the breaks but two ways that really get us into forward motion toward pursuing the consumption of sweet foods now if it does not array seem diabolical enough that sweet things that we perceive as sweet make us want eat more of those because of dopamine than then send us down this pain pleasure pathway i mention earlier and the fact that we have this subconscious circuit coming from the uropod cells and our gut that are registering the presence of sugar or glucose increasing foods in our got an sending those signals to the brain for yet more dopamine pain pleasure challenges there is a third layer to this whole thing and that has to do with how sugar is metabolized in the brain or i should say how glucose is used without getting into two much detail some of the more beautiful studies of burro imaging and a valuating which brain areas are active when we eat certain foods were done by doctor damn a small slab at yell university end in some of her previous work when she was elsewhere and of course by other laboratories to and they use an approach called positronomission tomography and they and others have used pet scanning as it is called positronomission tomography along with the tool called to doxy glucose two doxy glucose is actually involved in the procedure of seeing which brain areas are active when people eat foods or engage in other types of behaviors but the way that two doxy glucose sometimes shorten too d g the way that it works is to block glucose up t are from neurons and instead bring along with it a marker that one can see through imaging in other words a tool for looking at what parts of the brain are active when eating particular foods actually prevents foods such as sugar from allowing glucose to get indue particular neurons now that might seem a bad situation you say well wait you shine understand how sugar works in the brain and then you block the ability for a sugar glucose to a blind to or be used by these neurons because of the thing that your using for the experiment exactly it is a huge problem but it turns out to be a huge problem that led to a great insight and the great inside is this the preference for sweet tasting foods and liquids is actually blocked by to doxy glucose what that means experimentally but also in terms o what it means for you and me in the real world is that there's yet a third parallel pathway that is related to the use of blood sugar the use of glucose by neurons that further reenforces our desire to eat more sweet things and the preference for sweet foods can actually be eliminated through to doxy glucose now i definitely do not want people going out in consuming to doxy glucose this is a laboratory tool it is not something that you should be ingesting us do not go look it up in trying get some there might be other uses for but that is not the point the point is that it is the sweet taste of sugary foods it is the signals coming from your gut from your digestive tract to your brain and it is the use of the metabolic consequences of sugary foods that our acting is a three prong push on your desire to consume more sugary foods this car analogy that used beforeawere it is some weird car that's too exceleries it actually has three accelerators and with three accelerators all pushing the system hard we can say while there must be something really special about this pathway n indeed there is this pathway is the quickest source of fuel for the brain and the rest of the nervous system it is the preferred source of fuel for the brain and nervous system and i realize as they say that all the the quitonise does are probably go no actually queitones of the preferred sorts oke i acknowledge that there are conditions under which you can bring your blood glucose very low and there reasons to do that actually amitoses has been a terrifically successful treatment for a lot of forms of epilepsy in particular pidiatricep epilepsy many people do derive benefit from quitergenidit ism not nocking hereto genadiats but if you were to look at what neurons normally prefer meaning in a typical diet regiment it would be glucose and the fact that fructose is eventually converted to glucose the fact that when we invests sucrose it is eventually convert into fuel that anurans can use that is very much in the glucose pathway what you basically arrive at is the fact that your nervous system is a glucose consuming machine and you have got at least three pathways of which i have described that are pushing on your brain consciously and subconsciously to get you to seek an consume more sugar now that all sounds a pretty depressing picture least for those of either a trying to reduce your sugar and take and of course we can all reduce sugar in take by way of sheer will we can not have those foods at home we can restrict ourselves from those but there are some things that we all can and perhaps should do in order to regulate these pathways such that we do not feel controlled by them but rather that we control their output and of course they are us and we are them this gets into all sorts of issues of consciousness and free will that i certainly do not want to cover in this episode but none the less i think once you understand that these circuits exist and you understand that their simple substitutions and modifications that one can make to their food in take that can work within these pathways and even by pat some of these pathways you start to realize that you have a lot more control over sugar in take and sugar appetite than you previously thought now many of you have heard of the call glyceric index the glyceric index is a measure of how quickly blood sugar rises after investing particular foods and very broadly speaking we can say that there are loglycemic index foods of less than fifty five typically is the measurement or medium glyceric index foods which go from about fifty five to sixty nine and then called hypoglycemic foods which are above seventy and of course there is additional wants related to glyceric load and many more features of the glyceric index a couple of things to understand about how the glyceric index is measured and then it'd to just briefly talk about how the glyceric index can be leveraged to short circuit some of the neural circuits that would otherwise lead us to crave and perhaps even invest sugary foods first of all measurements of glyceric disease of food are typically made by having people invest those foods in isolation and in general we can say that any time we invest fire and or fat limits along with a particular food it will reduce the glyceric index of that particular food either the absolute level of blood glucose that a particular food causes or the rate at which that elevation and blood glucose occurs and this is why there are some seemingly paradox aspects to sweet stuff intros the glyceric index for instance ice cream has the lower glyceric index provided ts i scream than includes fat which i hope it would costs the good tasting i screw in my opinion compared to something a mangoes or table sugar right guy semi index is not something to hold holly in most cases because most people are not in jesting foods and isolation and there's actually a lot of argument as to whether not the glyceric index as really is a vital as some people claim there is also the context in which you in jest particular foods as i mention earlier after i do hard training of any kind meaning training that ought to deplete glykages a hard resistance training racially make it a point to invest some very sweet hihglycemic foods a mango also injestsum starches cause ism try to replenish glykage animals transit spike my blood sugar little bit because that can be advantageous in terms of certain strength and hyperturfrephroto calls et camera but most time ism avoiding these higglycemi foods and my sugar foods i should point that out now why am i telling you about the glyceric index well if we fume out and take our perspective on all of this discussion about the glyceric index through the lens of the nervous system and we remind ourselves that neurons prefer glucose for energy and that all sweet things or things that we perceive a sweet but also sweet things that are invested and registered by those neuropodsells in our gut trigger the release of dopamine and trigger these neural circuits to make us want to eat more of these foods will we start o realize is that a sharp rise in blood glucose or a very high degree of elevation in blood glucose is going to be a much more potent signal then will a more moderate rise in blood glucose or a slower rise in blood glucose if we think about the analogy of three accelerators meaning three parallel nerd circuits all essentially there to get us to seek out and consume more sweet tasting and sugary foods well then the glyceric index is sort of our measurement of how hard we are pushing down or how fast we are pushing down on those three accelerators and those of you that are trying to reduce sugar in take and you want to do that through an understanding of how these neral circuits work and you want to short circuit some of the dopamine release that is caused by investing sugary foods it can be advantageous to invest sweet foods either alone or in combination with foods that reduce glyceric index or reduce glyceric load that might mean making different food choices paying attention to sweet tasting foods that can satisfy sugar cravings but do not have as steep or i should say do not cause as steep arise in blood sugar or it could mean consuming other foods along with sweet foods in order to reduce the glyceric index and thereby slow or blunt the release of dopamine you might think well why would i want to do that i want the maximum dopamean output in response to a given sweet food it'd i do not just want the in o level ten i want the level one hundred output of dopamine but you really do not because of the pleasure pain balance that dopamine causes and in fact if we consider some of the non food substances that really push hard on these dopamine pathways we can come up with a somewhat sinister but none the less appropriate analogy the drug cocaine causes very robust potent increases in dopamine within the brain and typically causes people to want to in jest more cocaine because of those sharp increases in dopamine but within the category of the drug cocaine their various modes of ingestion some people inhale it some people will inject it interveneously some people will smoke it and those different forms of taking cocaine actually impact the dopamine circuits differently and it turns out that crack cocaine the movable form of cone rock increases dopamine to a very high degree but also very very quickly and it is the sharp rise in dopamine over time not much the absolute level of dopamine that makes crack cocaine absolutely addictive sometimes you will hear sugar is crack well and that is getting a little extreme because even though i don't think the measurements have been done in the same experiment i think it is reasonable the thing that the absolute level of dopamine cause by ingesting sugar least for most people is not going to be as hi es the absolute level of dopamine cause by smoking crack course it goes without saying please do not do cocaine in any form by the way it is appropriate to say that the rate of dopamine increase over time has a profound effect on how people will and if people will go on to want to pursue more of what cause that increase in dopamine what am basically saying is if you are going to invest sweet foods in order to satisfy a sweet craving insulting sweet foods for which the glyceric index is lower or in which you a busted those glicimiccindecs foods through the congestion of fiber or may be fat might be beneficial is this justification for putting peanut butter on that piece of chocolate or for having a bowl of ice cream along with the mango that your craving in some sense yes however there is also the issue of how sweet and how delicious something taste highly palatable foods the absolutely delicious foods trigger that one normal circuit that one accelerator that were talking about in terms of our analogy of three accelerators and the more delicious something taste within our mouth the further increase in dopamine if you really wanted to adjust your sugar cravings and you really still want to in just some sugary foods you probably we better off combining fire with that sugary or sweet food now i do realize that it somewhat unusual hen you problem get some strange stares if you decided to consume rocky for ins ants along with your chocolate or with another desert that would otherwise cause a steep increase in blood sugar and has a hygglacimicandests but none the less if your goal is to blunt your sugar cravings what you really need to do is blunt that dopamine increase what were really talking about here is trying to reduce the dopamine signal that is the consequence of investing sweet foods and we are talking about doing that through these different parallel pathways locust by preventing sweet taste but also by preventing the posting festive effects of sweet foods and of course the backdrop to all of this is that most of us again most of us not all but should probably be investing fewer refined sugars certainly there are exceptions to that but i think the bulk of data point to the fact that investing these highly palatable certainly highly palpable highly process foods or foods that contain a lot of hyfroctos corn syrup can be really militaries to our health especially in kids and ism not in sit off a bunch of statistics you have all heard them before that for hundreds of years we invested you know the equivalent of a few cups are pounds of sugar per year and now people a nesting hundreds of pounds of sugar per year the major culprit always seems to be sugary drinks meaning soft drinks and i think indeed that is the case i do want to point out the incredible work of doctor robot lusting who a pediatric under chronologists at universe californium san francisco who is really early in the game of avoiding the dangers of soiled hidden sugars and highly process foods the other people of course now talking about this his laboratory has done important work showing for instance that if hyfroctos corn syrup or even just fructose is replaced with glue costs even if the same number of calories is invested that therefore are important meaning significant reductions in type diabetes some of the metabolic centrums associate with hypos cornsyrupand on and on anon and of course there other culprits in typtudibedes there are other factors that are going to lead to city but i think the work from lusting and others has really illustrated that we should all be trying to reduce are in take of highly refined sugars and hyprotoscorn syrup and certainly trying to reduce are in take of very sugary drinks not just soft drinks but also fruit juices that contain a lot of sugar now even for people that are of healthy weight and who do not have metabolic centrums there may be an additional reason to not want to invest very sweet foods and hilly refine sugars and this has to do with a new and emerging area of new trivial negro science and i want to point out that these are new data right it is not a lock the double blind placebo controlled studies in large populations have not been finished i want to a i want to make sure that that is clear but i also one a m clear what some of the really exciting data coming from doing small slab at male and from otherlaboratories are showing and this has to do with what is called condition take preference using a kind of pavlova paradise what they do is they have people and these studies were done in people invest maltidextran which increases blood glucose does not have much flavor but even if it does have a little bit of subtle flavor the maltidextran is cloaked by some other flavor and by closing it with that other flavor or paring it with that other flavor what they find is that over time because the maltidextran increases blood glucose and their investing a particular flavor along with that multiedextran they can then remove the multedextran and the flavor will induce and increase in insolent the increase in insolent of course is the consequence of the fact that any time there is arise in blood glucose provided the person is it diabetic there is a parallel increase in insolent now this is very interesting because what it says is well at a first pass it says that we are very pavhlovian in terms of our physiological responses to foods and particular flavors come to be associated with particular patterns of blood glucose increase and hence patterns of insolent increase because of course insolent manages glucose in the blood stream as i mentioned earlier this also has implications for understanding things artificial sweeteners and here i want a high light that this is still very controversial work a needs more data but none unless i to share it with use for consideration the small laboratory is done studies inhuman both in adults and children showing that if the flavor of artificial sweetness is pared with maltedextran and then the maltidextran is removed that the artificial sweetener taste itself can subsequently increase insolent in the blood stream in other words taking something that in increases blood sugar attaching a flavor experience to that having children are adults invest that thing a lows the nervous system to associate that flavor with that increase in blood glucose but then you can remove the glucose increasing substance and the flavor alone will increase insolent because insolent typically follows blood glucose this is a conditioning effect now the reason these date are controversial is severalfold first of all the landscape around the discussion around artificial sweetness is definitely what i would call a barbed wire topic and i want a preface what i am about to say next by saying i actually invest artificial sweetness i will have the occasional diet soda not every day maybe ounce once or twice a month i do not particularly the taste but it'll do it just cause its around and once in caprine and i i the carbonation from on a plain or something i do invest plant base non colonic sweetness to mi y knowledge there have not been high quality studies of plant bastes non colonic sweeteners in the contexts that am referring to here oi none the less these study showed that particular flavors can be condition to cause an insolent increase and the flavor associated with certain artificial sweetness is included in that category of flavors that can induce insolent even in the absence of something that can increase blood glucose now the simple take away from these studies would be the following and this is actually the one interpretation that a data small has offered to her data but she offers other interpretations as well one of interpretation is that if people are going to invest artificial sweetness and they do that along with foods that very sharply increase blood glucose then there is the potential i the potential for those same artificial sweeteners to increase insolent even in the absence of food in other words less to straw the sanariout in the real world your having a dietsoda along with a cheeseburger and fries you do that every day for lunch orcas some whale extreme example but natural world example you that every day for lunch and then you just have a dietsoda alone the extreme interpretation of the data they have collected says well that diesoda alone will increase insolent even though there is no increase in blood glucose because you have not invested food that because you condition that taste of artificial sweetener to the experience of a risen glucose and one insolent now the counter argument to this would be well that is a very unusual situation multidecser n causes big increases in blood glucose that is not really a a fair experiment or it is not our natural world experiment and i think that is o a decent assessment although i will point out that one of the reasons why this study is controversial or why these data are controversial is that the experiment actually had to be stopped in particular the experiment in children had to be stopped because the changes in insolent that were observed early in the study were detrimental that the institutional reviewboard quite appropriately said we cannot do this to these kids there experiencing these odd shifts an insolent that are not healthy for them when they are just investing artificial sweetness in the absence of these glucose increasing foods once again i do inn jest artificial sweeteners ism not saying that they are dangerous ism not saying ah that they are not dangerous ism sayigthat you have to decide for yourself in previous episodes have high lighted that artificial sweetness have been shown in studies of animals that when given in very his dose is sucres in particular there can be fairly robust disruption to the gopmicrobium which is vital for a mine health an brain health et camera et camera but thus far our knowledge of how artificial sweetness negatively imp acts or positively in pacts i should say the microfilm and other dilitarious effects on the body has mainly been explored in animal studies again the work by data small has been done in humans there some parallel work by others in animal models i bring it up to day to illustrate the following point normally we have a pathway that we do not have to condition at all it is there from birth whereby ingestion of sweet foods causes increases in dopamine and there are parallel pathways by which neurons in our gut and elsewhere in our body trial further increases in dopamine there is no need for a condition response or to become pavlova about this right your hard wire to want to eat sweet things by at least two an probably three parallel pathways now the work from data small slap and others that have illustrate this condition flavor preference i think beautifully show that any flavor that is associate with a luck spite or a long sustained increase in glucose can also be condition in other words the circuits for dopamine that reenforce the desire to eat particular things is not unique to the sugar pathway and this is one of the reasons i believe why ingestion of sweet foods does not just lead us to want to eat more sweet foods i think that is absolutely clear based on animal data and on human data i think that robot his actually the stuff of text books now but in addition ingesting sweet foods end our foods that raise blood glucose but that we do not perceive as sweet for instance foods with hidden sugars sugars that ben massed by salty or spicy tastes increases our desire for glucose elevating foods and food generally i think that is the only logical interpretation of the data that i can arrive at for people that struggle with regulating their appetite or with regulating their sugar appetite i think the understanding of condition flavor preference while a cubit complicated ought to be useful in trying to navigate reducing sugar cravings and sugar in take as a seaway into tools to control sugar and take as a means to both regulate sugar an take itself as well as food an take over all and steer us towards healthier choices and to talk about some of the special populations out there that might want to be especially wary of having a deregulated sugar appetite system and the group ism referring to specifically are those with attention definite hyperactivity disorder or why should they and or people who have issues with focus and attention generally and i think more and mornoutdays ism hearing that people are having a hard time focusing this probably has something to do with our interactions with electronic devices is always say if a picture is worth a thousand words an move is worth a million pictures and the fact that we can access many m vies in just by scrolling with our thumb is something that the nervous system has just never contended with before in human history and confident of that and it is not that it cannot deal with it the question is what is the trade off and what are the consequences of that attention an ability to focus is obviously key to success in school success in relationships success in the work place and success in life we could provbleving go far as to say one's ability to succeed in anything is proportional to one's ability to focus and then deliberately refocus when the time comes to refocus trip as we all need rest in we need a disengage in then re engage if you look at the sum total of the medanalysies and the clinical data on eighty eight it and nutrition you arrive at a pretty clear answer which is that sugar consumption in particular highly refine sugars is just not good for people with eighty eight year the tensional issues now as i say that i also want you to recall the earlier study that i referred to whereby the tuning of neurons in the brain is highly dependent on glucose this does not mean consuming no glucose is going to be a good idea it does not mean that a the quitogenic diet is necessarily the best diet for eighty high it although there are some people pursuing that an exploring that and it will do yet another episode on eighty eight she at some point that goes aloft deeper into that because there re some new data i did do a very long and a fairly extensive a episode on eighty eight she you will come to look that up if you in our area excuse me in our archive at huger manlabdat come a it all time stamped a you don't because the number o people said oh it said an episode on eighty eight seen mate two and half hours long yes we did because we wanted to be as comprehensive as we could at the time but it is time stamps you can just jump to the particular topics of interest in their short little a assets there now if you would to know upon what ism basing the statement that sugar consumption and highly refine sugar consumption i is potentially bad for eighty high it a basing this mainly on the conclusions of a of a really nice paper that the title of the paper is sugar consumption sugar sweet en beverages and attention deficit viper activity disorder a systematic review in reanalysis and this is a paper a well put a link to this in in the caption this was a publishing complementary therapies in medicine which is a bit of an atypical journal in some sense but i really this reanalysis a the the sum total of of this medanalsis is really that when especially kids get beyond four sugary drinks our week for sodas of yon typical twelve ounce soda a when they get past four twelve ounce sugary sodas they did not a as far as i know look at artificial sweeten sodas that is when you start to see a shift towards a more negative outcomes more symptoms of existing eighty high it now where the controversy comes in is weather not sugar consumption can actually trial or cause eighty eight sh and i do not think we can conclude that at all at this time and this review if you decide to check it out review slashmenanalsis i should say if you decide to check it out goes into some of the new aunts around that what is also interesting in terms of eighty high it and sugar an take and probably as relevant to all of us is that they also cover some of the interesting data showing that supplementation with omega three fatiacids can actually be beneficial for people in regular kids with eighty eight have talk before about the utility of omega threes that is been shown in various studies that have compared omega three fatiacid an take to say prescription and to depresses accessorizes prosaic loft and similar fluidity and there is all of those studies are pretty clear at least to me that provided that one gets at least one gram of e p a essential fatiacid it is not just getting one gram per a but one or more grams per a of the e p e form of mental diacid can rival some prescription and a depresses and or decrease the amount of and to deprecens that required to take which for a lot of people can be a very useful thing because of the sidifect profile of many of those antetoprecents of course talk your sychatres talk your doctor but the megatheres are no doubt powerful and then of course is all story about o megatheres in heart health and of course anything else there some controversy around a megatheres but i think the date are clear enough to me around moon party of ascot health that certainly i personally in jasthemb as always i always say any time you are going to add or remove anything from your nutrition supplementation exercise or other while your life style defy consult with a board certified physician i do not to say that to protect me i say that to protect you you are responsible for your health ultimately omega three supplementation has been shown to be beneficial for eighty eight it why my talking about this in the contact of an episode on sugar and the nervous system well if you remember those uropod ells those cells in your gut that respond to sugar and send signals up to the brain to cause the release of dopamine well turns out that pteropod cells also respond to a mind acids and to fatiacids in particular essential fatiacids these cells that we call nerropod cells have three jobs one is to detect levels of sugar in the got the other is to detect levels of a mind acids and to detect levels of particular essential fatiacids and communicate that information to the brain and i should point out whether i said communicate that information there not actually sand he there is a mind acid r oh there sugar here the there is essential fadiaids because the language of these cells is somewhat generic it is just the firing of electrical potentials but that is the key point it is generic and all three or any of those three sugar essential fatiacids or aminoacids will trial these grants to signal to the brain to increased opening and it is not coincidental that megathere diacid supplementation can help ameliorate some of the symptoms of eighth by way of presumably increasing dopamine in this sauropod to dopamine pathway that we talked about earlier the whole thing has a very nice logical structure to it and points to yet again the immense value of bringing the proper amounts may be even supplementing the proper amounts of megathere fatiacids and the proper amounts of a monoacid into the gut as a way to supplant some of the stimulation of these pathways that would otherwise be caused by sugar there is actually aversion of this where one could say if you want to reduce sugar cravings you might consider increasing certain forms of a monoacid in take or certain forms of fatiacid in take what are some ways that we can reduce our sugar cravings and ideally wags that we can do that that also benefit us in other ways both metrically and from the nauru scent standpoint well these sauropod sells that respond to and signal the brain when we invest sugar as i mention also respond to a monoacid and essential fatiacids we already talked about the essential fadiacids i make it a particular point to ingest anywhere from one to three grams that is grahams of epic essential fatiacid per day i make it appoint to do that with the digestive high quality a megatheres for me the simplest way to do that and i think for most people the lowest costly to do that is to use some liquid form of fission or some capsid form of fisiaoil you really do have to see how much a essential facial in the form of pie is in those if you trying do that only through capsids that can get kind of expensive depending on a which particular a bran to use somehow more pe some less you can of course also do this through foods you can do this with non fish sources through things ally in their him other forms you can look it up on line now no plant base sources of a es you do the with with high quality fisciaoil in any case that does seem at least based on a modest amount but none the less solid literature to reduce sugar craving somewhat but that could easily be by mere replacement of calories right we do not know yet based on human studies whether not the ingestion of those eyes is specifically activating the sauropod sells which specifically active its doping release and by passes the need for out where the craving for sugar we do not know that yet but but logically holds up a to assume that the fact that these sauropod sells end i should say other errands within the gut respond very robustly to the presence of particular aminoacids is also a potential lever by which one could reduce sugar cravings and there is an interesting literature around the monoacid glutamine in particular supplementing with the monoacid glutamine as it relates to sugar cravings and certainly y as it relates to other aspects of the got in particular leaky gut the use of supplemental glutamine to try and treat like got is not a new phenomenon there are other approaches to of course but there are many people who are experimenting with supplementing with glutamine several grahams per day often even five grahams distributed through three or four different servings throughout the day in as a way to blunt their sugar cravings now there has not yet been a large scale clinical trial using glutamine to reduce sugar cravings but the results of the few studies that i looked at as well as my understanding of the logic of these neral circuits in gliding the neuropotcells brings us to a conclusion that it makes sense why if there is a population of anurans within our gut that responds very robustly to the presence of sugar fadiacids rooming acids that the intake of particular eminoacids would allow the dopamine pathways that might otherwise be triggered by sugar to be triggered by something glutamine which has very few or no calories and in fact having talked about this previously a number people that i know went out and tried this now this is of course is what i call panic data right this is not a does not a a quality per reviewed study this is anecdota a many of them have reported back that they actually feel as if their sugar cravings are reduced i know some people who actually take glutamine and mix it with full fat cream and take a country shot o full fat cream which sounds absorb delicious by the way glumes ill but cocky it is not that great tasting to invest with sugar i should mention if you do try and take this approach of en jesting glutamine to reduce sugar cravings you want to increase the amount of glutamine that you take somewhat gradually it can create some gastric distress if you just you i certainly when take a big tablespoon of it thrown and water and shut down three times a day some of you with very hearty stomachs can provably tolerate that n i year my a my bulldog which unfortu in passageway but costello i always imagine that if ever we did otopsyon i he have a license plain a a human being in is gut cost you could invest anything with no issues but of course many people have can a sensitive guts if you are going to try taking glutamine as it means to reduce sugar cravings just now that the studies are still on going some people have achieved benefit please also realize that there's an entire literature devoted to the potential hazards of increasing gludomie if you have a are existing cancer if you have cancer your cancer prone i i would really discourage you from this approaching in any case has always talk to your doctor the logic none the less is there why increasing monoacid and take we diacid and take might decrease sugar craving now there are other ways to reduce sugar craving and there are certainly ways to reduce the sharp rise in blood glucose that can occur when we invest sugary sweet foods or even just an abundance of carbohydrate foods and there are huge number of these things am on i sort of layer up through the the ones that you might finding your covered at the grocery store and then get into some of the more a extravagant er i should say a esoteric ones many of which however a can be quite potent the first of which a is simple lemon juice right or lime juice there was an old lore and actually some papers pointing to the idea that the ingestion of vinegar a either white vinegar what or wine vinegar could somehow blunt blood glucose after the ingestion of sugary foods or theingestion of a lot of carbohydrate foods are evenest a big meal i she him ferries i should say the great tinperris cause i do have great respect for the fact that he seems to be about ten years ahead of everything a both an terms of nutrition and skill learning in things that sort many f the things that he predicted in his books a the for our body and the for our shelf actually a turned out to be true based on scientific data some of which only exists in the animal models but now a also some predictions that a that played out to be true in both the animal moths and and the human model i think that him certainly deserves a i a hat tip a for the fact that he a experimented with these methods and a and reported his experiences with those methods and that now a some of them many of them have been validated by what i perceived to be quality science he talked about the fact that t least in his experiments on himself a the ingestion of vinegar did not seem to blunt blood glucose and he was using continuous glucosponders these incidentally and other example of ware of arris was early to the a to the game and the rest of u are kind of just in his wake he talked about the use of of blood glucose monsters those i think at the time were implanted below the skin nowadays their lesson vase of blood locos monitors s levels and forth in the are rashly becoming pretty popular have warn one of these before the actually pretty informative a i learned forces that when i going the sand that i experiences sharp rise in a blood glucose and that make sense because of a the dehydration associated with being in the son lot of sweating ye concentration of sugar in the blood stream goes up a there is some other things at certain foods affect my good glucose one way or another kin of interesting in for experiment that some of you might be interested in doing his swell regardless there are now data pointing to the fact that lemon juice and lime juice couple tablespoons are if invested before or even during or even after consumption of sugary foods or i should say foods that sharply increase blood glucose or large copahydrate meals can actually blunt the blood glucose response and i did see that when it did my own experiments on myself with continuous glucosponder this kind of funded you those experiment experiments a i preferred to do those experiments by eating somewhat larger meals of things that did not contain a lot of sugar saw some big increases in blood glucose and certain instance and then i would in jestsome some lemon juice or lime juice typically mixed in with water and sure enough you could see a blunting of the blood glucose response and of nurses was real time a blood continuous hance continuous blood glucose wondering for those of you that are interested in blunting your blood sugar response certain foods that is a simple low cost way to do that if you will not explore it i will say if your are fasting an you already have low blood glucose and you invest lemon juice or i should say some lemon juice and water lime juice and water be careful because you can actually become hypogli seems right for the very same reasons that these a that lemon juice and lime juice can blunt blood glucose when your blood glucose levels are moderate to hi you can also reduce blood glucose levels even further when blood glucose levels are low now that is lemon juice and lime juice there a but we cannot say that as to you with acidic things generally and just as a side ointment of view of publishing the store called adjusted p h waters or foods and drinks thersplus to adjust your p h hate to break it to you but your p h is very tightly regulated throughout your brain and body you do not want this to change it is entirely impossible at least in any safe way that you would become quotiquo more alkaline by insulting and alkaline water something that it is true that your that p h your alkalinity an acidity varies in different compartments in your body that is important unless you are a emerging or vomiting or the something badly wrong with you healthwise in your n really dire circumstance you do not want big shifts in your body p h in your body has all sorts of ways of buffering against changes in p h a anchorage you not to fall on the or yo hop on the ban wagon of adjusting p h in becoming lass acidic in that kind of thing when you unjust lemon juice or lime juice the mechanism by which it blunts blood glucose is probably twofold one is probably through the post in jest of effects of glucose in the gut meaning the way in which sugars are interacting with neurons and other components of your got circuitry to impact things gastric emptying time to impact things the firing of those sauropod sells an their signaling to the brain but almost certainly it has something to you also with the perception of sour taste on the tongue we did not go into this too much to day but you of course do not just have sweet tastes receptors in your mouth you'll have bitter taste receptors you have salty taste receptors you have sour taste receptors in your mouth and on you and of course that means your tongue and palate and those are interacting if you unjust a substance that is just sweet or mostly sweet that causes a certain set of effects on your blood glucose but all your brain dopamine and the other nail circuits of your brain if you also in jest something that sour lemon juice or lime juice it adjust the output of those nauru circuits in your brain again we have a situation we have too parallel path as one that is post intestines coming from phenomenon within our gut neurons but also thinks gastric tempting time that clearance and the transfer of food and the conversion of food into particular new transcend the circulation of glucose in your blood stream and how it gets into the brain but also simply by investing something sour you are changing the way that sweet things impact your brain and i think it stands to reason that the lemon juice lime juice effect is not going to be magic it is going to have everything to do with the way that investing sour foods can adjust the taste souse me can adjust the neural response to taste of sweet foods and in fact we know based on the beautiful work of charges hooker at colombia medical school that that is exactly what happens they have measure the the activity of neurons at various locations in the call taste pathways of the brain and they found that when particular tastes just sweet or just bitter or just sour evoke certain on nombles of neurons to fire in particular sequences when sweet en sour contested when bitter and sourer contested you get distinct on nombles meaning distinct patterns of activity of those neurons and of course distinct patterns of downstream activity within the brain and body while it is still somewhat mysterious as to how exactly things lemon juice and lime juice can reduce our blood glucose spikes when we invest this with sweet foods or carbohydrate laden foods are with big meals you can use us as a tool with the understanding that there is a grounding in the biology of the way these circuits work now some of you have probably heard that cinnamon can be a useful tool for controlling blood sugar and indeed that is the case it is very clear that cinnamon can a just the rate of luck sentry into the blood stream possibly by changing o the rate of gastric emptying it might slow the rate of gastric emptying and thereby also reduce the glyceric index of particular foods i suppose if i ran eat a mango and i had not just done a bunch of hard training a might sprinklesome cinnamon on it here i ways enjoy con to coming up with new ideas of ways that i can eat foods during these podcast in any event there is some debate out there if you look on line as to whether not son cinnamon casino summon cinnamon souse me or salon cinnamon is best for purposes of at of blunting blood luck spikes but i think the at least by my reed of of the data and from what i found it does not really matter provided it is real cinnamon and you have to actually look and and make sure that it is real cinnamon because a lot of cinnamon the you buy is not real i do want to provide a cautionary note about cinnamon however cinnamon contain something called comedown which can be toxic at high levels you do not want to invest more than about a teaspoon may be a teaspoon and half of cinnamon per day o because you will start to exceed the threshold at which cinnamon could on start to be problematic but certainly if you our going to have a big meal or a meal that has a a lot of sugar in it or a lot of carbohydrate am laden food and you do not want an increase in blood glucose you could a put cinnamon in a beverage you cold put sentiment on food in order to blunt that a blood glucose increase reduce the glyceric index by way of reducing gastric tempting time again just making sure that you do not get out pasted that one and half teaspoons per day cause you really do not want to a start dealing with any of the toxicity relate to commie we have talked about lemon juice and lime juice and citizen these are kind of commonplace in many kitchens then of course we can venture into the more so ceric or i would say the more advance tools for adjusting sugar in take and the one that comes to mine is of course berberine berberine is a derivative of tree bark and is a very very potent substance for reducing blood luck much that is on par with met formal or glebencleminde which a prescription drugs specifically used to reduce blood glucose using berberine is a serious step you should absoluluy talked your doctor about it i know of a number of people that use it to lower blood glucose when they eat really large meals i know a number of people that are using it to get to some of the other effects of met formal that people have discussed things a activating or tapping into the called a main pathway of reducing more these are people that are a aiming their activities tat a increasing longevity a somewhat controversial approach still but i know many of people are doing it it is true that if you in jest berberine your blood locos will plumate and i point that out because have actually tried it before it gave me brutal headaches and i felt really dizzy and i felt i could not see straight and actually i could not see straight why do do that well it made me hypo glyceemac city actually drove my blood glucose down too far and the reason to did that is that i took berberine on an empty stomach i know some people can tolerate it i would say be very cautious about in jesting berberine on an empty stomach or if you are in a low carbohydrate diet unless you really know what your doing and you have a medical professional the kind of guide you through that if i took berberine along with a very large meal that include a lot of carbohydrates n i can recall the days in which costello and i would eat a couple of peat as and then we might get ice cream that kind of thing then i felt perfectly fine on even up to seven hundred fifty milligrams are a gram of berberine it has the kind of unique property of making you feel not overwhelmed by the amount of blood glucose increase that your experiencing from eating a big meal do not quite know how else to describe it it is almost as if you can keep eating and eating and eating and of corse you have to am protect your a gastric volume right in mean you only have much space in your stomach in just food a i was not using it to gorge on food i just hard about it i was interesting experimenting with it i do not have any am chronic blood sugar issues but again when i took it on empty stomach it may be hypoglycemic with on a low carbohydrating take hypoglycemic not a good experience o and again an experience i think to avoid but provided there is a lot of glucose in your blood stream and certainly if you are of the experimental type or you train to regulate blood glucose berberine might be a good option but again talk to your doctor it does have some other interesting effects terms of lowing total collateral that a research supported of om reducing insolent a little bit when that is not surprising if you reduce blood glucose are going to reduce insolent because of course insolent manages blood glucose in the blood stream i would place berberine and of course met formal and globanclomide in the kind of the heavy hitting potent tools for regulate regulating blood glucose now this is an episode not about sugar per say but sugar viewed through the lends of the nervous system and what is interesting about berberine met forming globanclamade and related substances is that some of the effects are of course on gastrictemptying or buffering good glucose within the blood stream et camera but there appear to also be some neural effects of having chronically low glucose or blunting blood glucose through things berberine and some of those neural effects include long standing changes in the hormonal cascades that are the consequence of having low blood sugar and thereby changes in the neural circuits that manage blood glucose over all the simple way of saying this is that by maintaining low to moderate blood glucose either by not in busting heavily carbohydrate satin foods here ism speaking to the low carbon of the keetorgenic types or by blunting blood glucose through things met formal or berberine even if inviting carbohydrates may been some sugars over time it seems that there is a adjustment will we call a homeostatic regulation of the nerd circuits that control things sugar craving and indeed some people report feeling fewer sugar cravings over time now i did not use berberine for a very long period of time have never used met formal i have experience the somewhat odd but welcome phenomenon of with each progressive year of my life i have fewer in fewer sugar cravings why that is i do not know i suspect it might have something o do with my sleep and it'll talk about that in a few minute but if you are going to explore berberine or met former or otherwise in addition to working with a doctor i thing you should understand why your doing it right i think that many of the effects can be quite potent they can happen in both the immediate vermin terms of regulating blood glucose they can send you hypoglycemic if you are are not careful they can also cause long standing changes to the nor circuitry that regulates blood sugar over time some of which might be welcome changes right reduce sugar cravings for instance and if you are really really serious about modulating blood glucose through things berberine the typical dose range again as anywhere from half a gram to one point five grams daily that is the typical dosages that have been explored and there are some other substances am sodium karate am which are known to augment the effects of berberine via the a my pathways they easily can increase the ability for berberine to have its luck lowering actions but that of course is getting into the really potent what i would call sharp blade tools for controlling blood locos and listen any time you are dealing with locos you are dealing with the brains preferred source of fuel and any time your dealing with the brains preferred source of fuel you have to be especially cautious about depriving the brain of what it needs whether not your low care high care am qidovig and carnivore these substances berberine are very very potent and you need to take them seriously there is yet another tool for controlling sugar cravings and the neural circuits that regulate sugar craving and its downstream consequences and this tool is what i would call a high performance tool but it is one that you probably did not suspect and that is sleep done extensive episodes about sleep and we actually have an episode can master your sleep o you can find that episode easily at superman labia cam into available i all the versos formats you to baplesbodify et camera and provides a lot of tools and on social medioprovi a lot of tools often we have a news letter the provides tools a hat of maxim sleep what is the roll of sleep in sugar metabolism sugar hunger and the way that the brain regulates those things well there is a really exciting study that came out just last year the study was publish in the journal sell report sellpress journal excellent journal and the reason i love the study much is it involved having people yes this was done in humans sleep in the laboratory that is not unusual there is a sleep habit stamford their sleep lavs elsewhere but what they did was they actually measured from the breath of these people and they extracted from their breath the metabolites that would allow them to understand what sorts give metabolism was occurring in these people's bodies at different phases of sleep and this is really remarkable study they actually did this every ten seconds throughout the entire night in little tiny tensecret been meaning it very high resolution they could evaluate was the metabolism in the brain and body that people experiences they go from remissly rapid eye movement sleep to slowwave sleep and on and it'll go deeper into the study again in the future because it interesting and i think important but what they discovered was that each stage of sleep was a social with a very particular signature pattern of metabolism and particular phases of sleep are associated with sugar metabolism or more with fatmetabolism or more with other aspects of metabolism and the reason we i think the study is important to discuss in thecontexts of to day's discussion about sugar in the brain is that many people have experienced the effects of disrupted sleep on their appetite and in particular its been reported that when people are sleep deprived or the quality of their sleep is disrupted that their appetite for sugary foods increases now that was always assume to be due to some metabolic need that was triggered by the sleep deprivation or by the poor sleep but in reading over the study some of the more importantmpoints made by the authors relate to the fact that well sleep is known to have incredibly important effects on brain an body a variety of systems immune system nor functioning et camera this very organized sequence of particular forms of metabolism being active during particular phases of sleep which are very very well orchestrates we know slowwave sleep and remsleepeing orchestrate in ninety minute called of trait an cycles and on and forth is thought to perhaps set up the brain and body to be able to regulate itself in the waking hours and therefore when people are sleep deprived or deprived of certain forms or states within sleep such as rapid movement sleep that it creates a disruption in a particular set of metabolic pathways now we do not want to leap too far from this study to sugar metabolism in the nor circuits controlling sugar metabolism but i will say this if you look at the sum total of the data on obesity or on typtudiabetes or on metabolic syndrome of any kind you almost always see disruptions in sleep now some of those could be due to sleep apnea caused by even just the size of somebody is neck or the weight of their body another wars we do not know the direction of the effect right metabolic centrums could disrupt sleep which disrpmet metabolic centrums and indeed the authors point out quite appropriately that they do not understand the direction that of the effects that they observe either but there is now a whether of date pointing to the fact that getting qualities sleep each night helps regulate not only appetite but also the specific forms of metabolism that drive specific appetites the take away is while there are extravagant and potent in a interesting ways to regulate blood glucose everything from cinnamon to lemon duce to berberine to sodium corporate to a behavior tools to the mure understanding of haw the direct and indirect pathways go from the got to dopamine et camera if you are not establishing the firm foundation of proper metabolism all of those things are going to be sort of rearranging deckchairs on the titanic as as sometimes described we cannot overstate the importance of getting regular sufficient amount of high quality sleep at least eighty per cent f the time not just for sake of immune system function for clear thinking et camera but also for properly regulating are metabolism including our sugar metabolism thank you for joining me for this

welcome to the hubermanlapodcans the a science science space to i m indrhubermen and ism a professor of neurobiology an opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day i have the pleasure of introducing doctor anna limpkin doctor limpkin is a psychiatrist and the chief of the addiction medicine duel diagnosis clinic at stamford university school of medicine she's a psychiatrist who treats patient struggling with edition she has successfully treated patients dealing with drug edition alcoholediction and behavioraledictions such as gambling and secs edition as well as other types of edition in fact during our discussion i learned that there are a huge range of behaviors and substances to which people can become edited to and that there is a common biological under pinning of all those editions i also learned that there is a common path to the treatment and recovery from essentially all editions doctor temple explained that to me and explained how to think about and conceptualize our own editions as well as the editions of other people who are struggling to entreatment move through treatment and stay sober from their editions in addition to treating patience doctor limpkin is an author and was featured in the twenty twenty ethics documentary the social dilemma ism excited to tell you that she is a new book coming out called dopamine nation finding balance in the age of indulgent the book comes out august twenty fourth and is an absolutely fascinating read into a diction and ways to treat various types of edition have read the book cover to cover and all it'll tell you is that at the very first chapter and throughout you are going to be absolutely blown away the stories about her patients are extremely negation it brings forward the real struggle of edition and the incredible i think it is fair to say heroic battles that people fight in order to get through editions of various kinds and all of that is woven through with story with science and ways that make it very accessible to any one whether not you have a science background or not i cannot recommend it highly enough again the book is doom nation finding balance in the age of indulgence it comes out august twenty fourth of this year twenty twenty one and you can reorder that book by going to amazon we will provide a link to that in the so caption before we begin i just want to mention that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first spencer is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one victim in mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve ism delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there in i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of m y basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which or vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called dopmicrobiom and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and socially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you i free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of data ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carevascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fire travel packs and the

function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off

sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do cam slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor anna empty are i great to have you here thank ye for having the an excited to be here and i have a lot of questions for you i i and many listeners of this podcast are obsessed with dopamine and what is dopamine how does it work we all hear that dopamine is the small acute associate with pleasure i think the a the term dopamine hits a getting a doom hit from this from integral or from likes or from prase or from whatever is now om commonly heard what is dopamine and water maybe some things about doom that most people do not know and probably that i do not in ow either opening is a narrow transmitter and narrow transmitters are those molecules that bridge the gap between to turns the essentially allow wonder on the presonaptic neon to communicate with the postsonaptic neon a opening is intimately a associated with the experience of reward but also with movement which i think is really interesting because movement and reward a linked right if you think about a early humans you had to move in order to go seek out the water or the the meat or whatever it was a and even in the most primitive organisms opening is released when food is sensed in the environment for example see elegant a bit a very primitive worm a opening is this really a powerful importance molecule in the brain that helps us a experience pleasure it is not the only narrow transmitter involved in pleasure but it is a really really important one and if if you want a think about something that most people do not know about opening which which i think is really interesting is that we we are always releasing opening at a kind of tonic base line rate and it is really the deviation from that base line rather than hits of opening in a vacuum that make a difference when we experience pleasure our opening release goes above base line and likewise downing can go below that tonic base line and then we experience of kind of pain interesting is it fair to say that one's base line levels of doping how frequently were a releasing opening in the absence of some too drop or food or experience just sitting being is that a society with how happy somebody is ta kind of base line of happiness were level of depression there is evidence that shows that people who are depressed may indeed have lower tonic levels of opening that is a really reasonable thought and there is some evidence to suggest that that may be true the other thing that we know and this is in a really kind of what what the book is about is that if we am expose ourselves chronically to substances or behaviors that repeatedly release large amounts of opening in our brains reward pathway that we can change our tonic base line and actually lower it over time as our brain tries to compensate for all of that opening which is more really than we were designs to to experience interesting in is who is it am the case that our baseline levels of doping are set by our genetics by a heredity well i think if you think about sort of know the early stages of develop an infancy certainly that is true your kind of born with probably whatever is your base line level but obviously your experiences can have a huge impact where your your opening level ultimately settles out if somebody is disposition is one of u constant excitement and anticipation or easily excited i et these a i think about the kind of people you say you want to check out this new place for talks and i can the be great and other people are am a lo more cynical idea a judge my boll don costello the very very stable low levels of dobbing with big inflections in his case u is that do you think that a sat in terms of our parents and obviously nature nurture interact but is that is dope mean that the course of our temperament i do not really think we know the answer to that but i will say that people are definitely born with different temperaments and those temperaments do effects there ability to experience joy and and we have known that for a long time and we describe that in many different ways one of the ways that we describe that in the modern are is to use psychiatric knowinclature this person has a dyschimic temperament or it of this person has chronic major depressive disorder in terms of looking specifically at whose vulnerable to addiction that is an interesting sort of mixed o bag because when you look it on the research on risfactoress for addiction what kind of temperament of a person makes them more vulnerable to addiction you see a interesting findings first you see that people who are more impulsive are more vulnerable to addiction what is impulsivity that means having difficulty am putting space between the thought or desire to do something an actually doing it and people who have difficulty putting a space there whoa who have a thought to do something and just do it impulsively our people who are more vulnerable to addiction interesting could a in terms of impulsivity is a something that relates literally to the startle reflects i for instance has a a labderacter ism familiar with walking round my lab and when i decide deciding on to talk to my people course when they knock on my door it is always wait why mi beg bother right now you've o i love to to them but i walk around my lad from time to time and some people i knows it'll say do you have a moment and they will slowly turn round and say or no something s and other people will jump the moment i say their name they actually have a a kind of a heightened a startle reflects that related to impulsivity or is what you are referring to an attempt to a with whole behavior that is very deliberate under very deliberate condition yet i do not think that that startle reflect is is necessarily related to impulsivity that that can be related to anxieties of people who are high anxiety people will tend to have more of a startle reflects impulsivity is a little bit different and by the way impulsivity is not always bad right am impulsivity is is that thing ware there is not a lot myself ad sting or worrying about future consequences you have the idea to do something and you do it and of course we can imagine many scenarios were that is absolutely wonderful there can be a sort of a let us say in admit am interactions between people where you would not really want to be superhibited about it right you would want to be disinherited and and impulsive om there i can also imagine sort of fighter flight scenarios battle scenarios right where where it would really be good to be impulsive and just r no who do were ha station can calls when i at yes that is right that is right but and i think this it brings up a really wainstnng that have come to believe that after twenty five years of practising psychiatry is that what we now conceptualize in our current ecosystem as mental illness are actually traits that in another ecosystem might be very advantageous there just not advantageous right now because of the world that we live in and and i think you know impulsivity is potentially one of those right cause we live in this world that sort of you have to constantly be thinking sort of rationally about the consequences of expire e and in such a sensory rich environment right that we are being bombarded with all these opportunities the sensory opportunities and we have to constantly check ourselves and impulsivity is something that right now am can be a difficult trait but is not in it of itself a bad thing i scan it is i begin o realizes the fine line between spontaneity and impulsivity a what is pleasure and how does it work at the biological level and if if it feels right at the psychological level i think we and if you do not mind a painting a picture of the the range of things that you have observed in your clinic or in life that people can be come edited to but just to start off really simply what is this thing that we call pleasure why think it is it is actually really hard to define pleasure in any kind of suspect way because certainly there is the seeking out of a a high or a fora or or i thinks the kind of experience that most anybody would associate with the word pleasure but but all am the seeking out of those same substances and behaviors is often away to escape the pain for example when i when i talk to people with addiction sometimes they are initial for a into using a drug is to get pleasure but very often its away to escape their suffering whatever their suffering may be and certainly as people be comaddicted even those who initially were seeking out pleasure are ultimately just trying to avoid the pain of withdrawal ore the pain of the consequences of their drug eyes i i think it is very hard to actually defend it as this unitary thing in its certainly not just getting high there are many ways in which people sort of want to escape which is not the same thing as through this hedonic we no wanting to feel pleasure some one could decide that they want to go out and dance or get up and dance because of the pleasure of dancing i can imagine that but a and maybe it is very difficult for them to state seemed when a particular song comes on for instance but am seeking what we would call pleasure in order to eliminate pain that jokes a different picture in my mind that evokes a picture of somebody that u feels lost or depressed or underwhelmed i wilfully want to get into the precise and general description of a diction in what that is but in a previous conversation we had you said something that really wrung in my mind which is that many people who become addicted to things clematis have this feeling that normal life is not interesting enough that they are seeking a supernormal experience and that the data day routine am balance which is actually in the title of your book a opening nation finding balance in the age of indulgence that the word balance itself can sometimes be a bit of the a aversive m and i ism struck by this idea and the reason i want to explore it is because much of what i see on line is about generating a lack of balance about being tilted forward at all times really leaning into life hard experiencing life you a living a full life a even the commencement speech given by stove jobs on this campus was really about finding passion digging in that much in the narrative now maybe you could just tell us a little bit about your experience with this a association if it really exists between a people's sense of the normal see or maybeven how boring life can be and their tendency to become attics of some sort ya well i mean i i think that life for humans has always been hard but i think that now it is harder in unprecedented ways and i think that the way that life is is really hard now is that it actually is really boring m and the reason that it is boring is because all of our survival needs are met right i mean we do not even have to leave our homes to meet every single physical need you knows long as sure of a certain level of financial well being which was frankly i youknow that we talk much about in the the income gap and certainly there is this enormous gap between which and poor but that gap is smaller than it is ever been the history of humans am even the poorest of the poor have more a excess income to spend on leisure goods than they ever have before in human history i if you look it leisure time for example people without a high school education have forty two per cent more leisure time than people with am a college degree am mine my point here is that life is hard now in this really weird way in that we do not really have anything that we have to do we are all forced to make stuff up whether it is being a scientist or being a doctor or being an olympic they or climbing mount severest and people really very in their need for friction and some people need a lot more than others and if they do not have it there really really unhappy and i do think that a lot of the people that i see with addiction and other forms of mental illness our people who need more friction there unhappy not necessarily because there is something wrong with their brain but because their brain is not suited to this world and do you think they have that sense my brain is not suited to this world or they simply feel am a restlessness and their constantly seeking stimulation i think that is right ye i think it is it is not really knowing what is wrong with me am why am i unhappy how can i be happier and of course is you talk about what what is pervasive in our narrative now is finder passion am men finder but whatever it is to save the world and in a way that is good because it has people out in the world than seeking am but but in a way it can also be misleading in the sense that i i think people are not entirely aware that that the world is a hard place and that that life is hard and that we are all kind of making it up you know i mother's i tell report in if callnuport's work but at yours i i very symbiotic in your messages bit i he is a professor of computer science at at georgetown at yes at georgetown and wrote a book some years ago really had of its time called good they cannot ignore you which is about not i meditating or a doing much work to trying figure out what once passion is by thinking but rather go out and acquire skills right and get develop a sense of of passion for something by your experience of hard work and and getting better and man lot to the growth mine tat the mar colly carrots week but he is gone on to write books i deep work and which is all about removing yourself from technology in doing deep with and he is a in a big proponent of the evils of contact switching too often throughout the day for sake of productivity mostly his new book is called am a world without meal any realizes i side off these books and your book dope nation a finding balance in the age of indulgence that a maybe of the reason why you two do not know about one another is because neither of you are on social we ad et right into of the most produce if people tit i know ism including productive author that is a discussion into itself but i find this fascinating i let us talk about the pleasure pain balance and a diction an offer to use this a seesaw or balance kali i analogy before and i think it is a wonderful one a that really for me clarified what a diction is at least at the mechanistic love yes but to me one of the most significant findings in narrow science in last seventy five years is that pleasure and pain a collocated which means the same parts of the brain that process pleasure also process pain and they work a balance when we feel pleasure or balance tips one way when we feel pain at tips in the opposite direction and one of the overwriting rules governing this balance is that it wants to stay level it does not want to remain tipped very long to pleasure or to pain and with any deviation from neutrality the brain will work very hard to restore a level balance or what scientists call homes stasis and the way the brain does that is with any stimulus to one side there will be a tip in equal and opposite amount to the other side to give principal laws of physics yes rights right i to watch you two videos when i watch you to videos of america right all it tips the side of pleasure and than when i stop watching it ism i have come downright which is at tip to the equal in opposite amount i on the other side and that is that moment of wanting to watch one more you to video right ye and i i just want it mum direct there this moment of of wanting to watch another that is associate with pain i think is are we always aware of that happening cause you just described in a very conscience weights but when i ism indulge in something i enjoy ism usually thinking about just wanting more yes thin don't think about the pain i ya about more right really excellent point because we are mostly not aware of it and it is also reflects give we eats not something that consciously happens or that we are aware of unless we really begin to pay attention and and when we begin to pay attention we really can become very aware of it in the moment again it is a falling away that will not younger your on social media and you get a good tweet of something and then you cannot stop yourself because there is this a awareness a latent awareness that as soon as i disengage from this behavior ism going to experience a a kind of a pain right of falling away missing that feeling a wanting more of it and of course one way to combat that is to do it more right and more and more and more i think i think that is really what i want people to tune into and and get in a awareness around because once you tun into it you can see it lot and when you begin to see it you have and if you you keep the model of the balance in mine i think it it gives people kind of a way to imagine what there experiencing on a nauru biological of one understand it and in that understanding get some mastery over it which is really what this is all about because ultimately we do need to disengage right we cannot live in that space all the time where we have other things we need to do and there are also serious consequences that come with trying to repeat and continue that experience out that feeling a f i understand this correctly and when we find something er when something finds on that we enjoy that feels pleasureful on social media of for right sex gambling whatever happens to be we will explore the full range these there say some dopemein release when we engage in that band then what your telling is that very quickly yes and beneath my conscience aware there is a tilting back of this scale where pleasure is reduced by way of increasing pain right and have heard you say before that the pain mechanism has some competitive advantage is over the pleasure mechanism such that it does not just bring the scale back to level it actually brings pain higher than pleasure could you tell syllabic more about that yet yet what happens gain that e the hallmark of any addictive substance or behavior is that it releases a lot of dopamine in our brains reward pathway right rocky just does not release a lot of dopey just does not right i i no no no a sign i it an i n i stop is cause no brut brochley's good it can really t but only is never amaze right role's never neverlis as antigen honestly we can probably find somebody on the plan at noon brickle is many and of course if ism starving broiling brochley is not nothing rich real rich callas big on a and he and he has a good relationship to plants ice i tell us ha i man a rocket an aging if anyone can do it any a m but but what happens bright after i do something that is really pleasurable and releasesill i soft mean is again my brain is going to immediately compensate by down regulating my own doping receptors my own dope mean transmission to compensate for that toque and that is that come down or the hang over that after effect that moment of wanted do it more now if i just wait for that feeling to pass then my dope mean will deregulate itself and also back to whatever my chronic base line is but if i do not wait and here is really the key if i keep indulging again and again and again ultimately i have i have much on the inside right that have essentially reset my brain to what we call an hedonic or lacking in joy type of state which is a demean definite states that is really the the that the way in which pain can become the main driver is because have indulged much in these hitherward behaviors or substances that my brain has had to compensate by way down regulating my own dope mean such that even when ism not doing that drug ism in adopenming demos it state which is akin to a clinical depression is anxiety irritability an some diplopia and a lot of mental preoccupation with using again or getting the drug and s that that is the piece there there is the single use which easily passes but it is the chronic use that can then reset really a foreman thresholds and then nothing is enjoyable right that then everything a sort of pales in comparison to this one drug that i want to keep doing and that one drug could be a person right i mean i yes i know people in my life that are still talking about this one relationship this one person that was just great despite all the challenges of that thing that is almost there addicted to the narrative ha o the word maybe your still are addicted to the person so it can be to any number of things vedic gamesects a gambling a person a narrative to me and because of the way you describe this mechanism this pleasure pain balance that all speaks to the kind of generalizability of or brain circuitry and this is something that fascinates me and i know it fascinates you as well which is that nature did not evolve twenty different mechanisms for twenty different types of addiction just anxiety is a couple of courses of hormones and arrow transmitters in pathways and one person is triggered by social interactions another person is triggered by a spiders but the underlying response as identical sounds with addiction is well there there may be some new aunts but that there sort of a car set of processes it does not really matter if it is gambling or video games ore sax or a narrative about a previous lover or partner whatever it is the same addictive process underneath that is that correct yes exactly and that is where this whole idea of cross addiction comes in once you have been addicted to a substance severely addicted that makes you more vulnerable to addiction to any substance and when you say substance at does the same did is what you just said also true for behaviouyes when a you went i use the word drag her ism talking about substances and behaviors dimly and be an tike mi behaviors gambling sac i horn gaining corn absolutely sabin we you virus ours further ahead a and a doctor love give in eased me not accuse me has ism doggone me a outside the coin and a playful way of being work addicted you are probably right it'd the first thoughts i have when i wake up or typically about work sprang within fifty mill a seconds or of waking and ism play the last thoughts i have i would hope or not about work but i work constantly i i do not i do other things but i at actively turn that ayes that is exactly right and you are certainly not alone in that and let stamford not none an i me here in that i no rights timely rewarding rights o that kind of that kind's imbedded in i absolutely and and there is this other city a thing it is called new york where they also and it is heavily rewarded am i once said and ism sure that ism not the first person to say it but i i was thinking about addiction and i was thinking about the underlying circuits and and i posted something to the a to the to social me do at said that a diction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure that was the way that i can have crystallized the literature in my mind and then we met and and you of course came in i give these amazing lectures in the a an at my course for the medical students and and the rest as history but i a i tossed out a kind of a mirroring statement for that as well which was a bit am overstepping i admit which i said addiction is a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure and i say dare i say enlightenment is a progressive expansion of the things that bring you pleasure not that anybody knows what in l but it as my attempt to take a little bit of a jab at the fact that nobody knows e an how why not why when big threw honer by logical explanation just just on a sample the waters i and people had varying levels of response but i would the reason i bring that up is that i would imagine that being able to derive pleasure from many things would be a wonderful attribute we know people this that i can experience pleasure in little things and in big events i not just the big mile stones of life but also the subtle as the the the meoguso say the subtle ripples of life but if such an ability exists would do think that that reflects a healthily tuned dopa mean system one that can engage and enjoy but then disengage is that what we should be seeking and and to underscore know nothing about enlighten went meditation or or any of it i just and i use these as opportunities to explore yes it is a great question an am an and i i understand the question as where what should we be striving for right where where should we settle out and you know in my book i really hold out people in recovery from severediction as sort of modern day profits for the rest of us because i do think that people who have been addicted and then go get into recovery do have a hard one wisdom ism that we can all benefit from and in the wisdom i guess to distill it down i mean its its many things but in terms of you a dope mean that the wisdom is there are adaptive ways to get tor dope men and there are less than adaptive ways and in general am you could describe the adaptive ways as not too potent not tipping that balance too hard or too fast to the side of pleasure does that mean never allowing myself to be absolutely incomplete bliss what does it mean not allowing myself to stay in that state too long the latter i think the latter and that than that gets to temperament some on o get that to a second in general what we want is some kind of flexibility in that balance and the ability to re easily reassert homing a states w do not want to break our balance which is possible if we over indulge for enough period of time and end up with a balance tip to the side of pain the opening defies at state we been talking about we want at we want a flexible resilient balance right which can be sensitive to things going on in the environment which can experience pleasure and a preach which can experience pain and recoil right this is all adaptive and healthy and necessary and good we would never want a balance that does not tilt right that would be a disaster right we would not be human on the we would want that we really really boring on the other hand what people in recovery from addiction talk about is to some extent having to learn to live with things being a little boring a lot of the time right trying to avoid some of this intensity and thrill see in and escapism that really is at the core of addictive tendencies a sorting trout we i say boring i can we add stressful and boring yes because there are days were ism not exit have to i wen they'd to have to remind myself to have fun because is sore forgot what the term yes rank as have i to think that i experience a lot of pleasure in little shan't what i ism pretty hard driving guile i rolls and big milestones all enough anyway i the point being that many days ism not bored thinking there is nothing to do but i am ism overwhelmed by the number of things that are really not pleasureful then i have to do right i will not mention what they are m legs it's why you do not ye on males not just your remailum not yours in a other in any event anxiety and bored can hang out together no i pectin oh for sure i man actually boredom is highly anxiety provoking o get as wellie is good to know cause i cant able her bored om me hang others nothing to do here a air's not and i you we have a ton to do we just do not really want to do i as appose to somethingthat were excited to do right o case that this gets to sort of some of the door things also we were talking about earlier about finding your passion some n try to link at all together i but but basically is a boredom for boredom is a rare experience for modern humane because we are constantly distracting ourselves from the present moment and we have an infinite number of ways to do that right i but boredom is really i think in important and necessary experience but it is scary because when you allow yourself to be bored an lets say you were had that list of all things you hate to do when you actually got them all done imagine that and you got your forthcoming book don how you did all your inner yes and and et open likening ta and you d watch your dog and you cleans your house and you went shopping imagine that for a moment you would be sitting in your house and my guess as you would be terrified because well what am i supposed to do now right there is nothing i really have to do and that is really really serve that can feel freewill and yet that is really an important and good experience to have and i think that is an experience out of which pecan have a lot of creative initiative but also really consider our priorities and values o we here i am on planed earth what the he halm i going to do with my life what do i really care about how do i really want to spend my time when ism not distracting myself in order to to spend it and the then this getsbeck to our conversational earlier about finding your passion i think that one of the big problems now that is very misguided about this idea of finding your passion it is almost as if people are looking to fit the key into the lock of the thing that was meant for them to do and then everything will feel a natural right and then everything will be wonderful in a less to the that that is not how it were ya endeavor right and that you will have all this great success or and here here is wear i really think the answer lies and i really really believe this stop looking for your passion and instead look around right where you are stop distracting yourself look around right where you are and see what needs to be done not what do i want to do but what is the work that needs to be done and more importantly it does not have to be some grandioth's work does the garbage need to be taken out right is there some garbage on your neighbors lawn that some one through that you could actually bend over and pick up and put into the garbage can look around you there is much work that needs to be done that nobody wants to do that is really really important and if we all did that i really think the world would be a much better place and this is what people who have severe addiction who get into recovery realize there it is not about me and my will and what ism going to will in my life or in the world it is about looking around what needs to be done what is the work that i am called to do in this moment which also as incredibly freeing because i do not have to search for the perfect thing there is a lot of burden ow on young people that they have to find that perfect thing and until they're found that perfect thing they arguing to be miserable you do not have to do that look at the life you were given look at the people around you look at the jobs that present themselves to you and do that job simply and honorably one day at a time in with a kind of humility i think this is really what whats striking to me about the wisdom of people and recovery there is this incredible humility that comes out of that experience you feel broken ashamed but you pick yourself up one day at a time and you build a life that is around what can i do right in this moment that might benefit another person and thereby benefit me that is a really important point and m and if you are willing it'd to shall stay on this issue of passion because i think the doorman systems i understand them correctly the doorman systems merge with this work that your earn to this immediacy of things calling to us taking out the trash which sounds frankly really born no o the honest i i taking out the trot i do it as i a clean home and loud that round the smells good ya armor at least does not smell tat ah we do these things and am not that we want to offer some larger carpet as a consequence of doing those things but if i understand correctly what your saying is in the act of looking at one's immediate environment acting on that immediate environment we cultivate a relationship to these circuits in our brain about action in reward that at least to my mind seen the range of small things being rewarding and then lead us to bigger things being rewinding it is nobly all we are going to do is take out fashion and tend to house we eventually will venture out and we vend eventually will find careers and and work a this but if i understand correctly you are talking about getting into a sort of functional or adaptive action step and it is the action step that these days we tend to overlook because most of our mine sad is in things that are truly in outside of the our immediate reality do i have that correct we have i was beautifully said and i would just add to that i see a lot of young people who for example spend most of their waking hours playing video games and they come to me in they say i am anxious and depressed i majoring in computer science i hated i thought i would it if i could only find that thing that i was really meant to do my life would be better and my first intervention for the many many people that that i see in clinical cares you have it backwards i do not say it quite that you were waiting for that thing to pull you out of the video game world and you never gong to find it as long as you are playing video games cause i video games are powerfully foreman uric that you have this distorted sense of really pleasure an pain and you you will not be able to find that thing that you enjoy and of course the intervention is abstain from video games reset your reward pathways start with a level balance and what invariable happened tat have just seen it over twenty years many times i become really in a believer in this i all risen it is o wow my computer science classes interesting this quarter slip o we you you have a receptivity then to experiencing pleasure in reward in a way you just do not have when you are bombarding your reward pathways with these high opening drugs very interesting am and just to underscore this notion that tending to the immediate things can lead to superperformence i i may mention it earlier this havisode but if i did not i mention now chichis have the the great privilege of having some close friends that were in the seal teams in doing some work with those communities and it is a remarkable community for reasons i think most people do not understand people think they see the images carrying longsdown the beach an a blongstuff on all the all dyestuff that is that is for forgot that but ah all the eyes i know who are in the seal teams have this see nice of duty about immediate things ad not just holding the door and doing that helping with the dishes in moving round they are constantly scanning their environment for what can be done they essentially conquer every environmenrand they are also some of them the most competitive human being in i the world and they do it unless there there in the act of worfighting which is the the real job a they do it in every environment in very benevolent w and it is a remarkable thing because it i think it is what is part of what there selected form and u any that there is a range there but i think when we hear about tending to the immediate things o were this phrase a how you do one thing is how you do anything that is a try tricky one for me because there certain things i just do not do well a but but should we always be trying i i think that the tending to setting the horizon in closely an tending to things in one's impede environment i think it is very powerful and translates yet as again i think the nervous system it performs algorithms a d has actionsteps the brain does not evolve to do one rang it is also to be able to use the same approach to doing lots of different thing yes a i what just what n want even beyond that cause at that totally resinates for me and is very consistent with people in recovery from addiction who learn to take it one day at a time which is one of the standard lingo from alcohols anonymous another twelve see groups but but i think also as you say our brain is really wired for the twenty for hour period we are not very good at sort of the ten year twenty and ware we have this youtronalodes and yes for great planners and we can but if we live too much in that space we can really get very anxious and depressed and lost and either catastrophism or get grandiose but if you can chunk down to a day what what people in recovery talk about is how if i can just do to day right then i will get a chain of days that seem insignificant in their individual units but after six months or year two years of those good days have got too very good years right and i look back in a whole we i guess i i did all that but think that is really one of the keys is is really taking it one day t a time which which your seals and also this connecting with the environment right being awaken alert to your environment and connecting with your environment not trying to escape it and of course escapism is what we all want an desire that experience of non being and we get it from the inner natter from drugs or whatever it is but it is it is the booby prize because ultimately it takes you further and further away from your media environment which is were we really have to connect to get that sense of boundedness and authenticity and of being in our own lives i think the unit of the day is something that comes up again and again of in my discussions with colleagues who are extreme my a successful and who also have balance live i o thisussion came up in the discussion with carl i so off who is also it is a successful scientists inclination and and you don't manages a family et camera the unit of the day i think is fundamental and those stack up as you mention along those lines have heard you say that in order to reset the dopamine system essentially in order to break in addictive pattern to become addicted thirty days of zero interaction with that substance that person et camera is that correct ya and and thirty days is in my clinical experience the average amount at of time it takes for the brain to reset reward pathways for doping transmission to regenerate itself there is also a little bit of science that suggest that that is true some imaging studies showing that of our brains are still in a opening definite state two weeks ism after we have been using our drug and then a steady by shuck it in brown which took a group of a depressed men who also were addicted alcohol put them in a hospital where the they have received no treatment for depression but they had no no access to alcohol in that time and after four weeks eighty present of them no longer met criteria for major depression again a this idea that by depriving ourselves of this high open e in high reward substance or behavior we allow our brains to regenerate do not opening for the balance to real equillecrat and they were in a place where we can sort enjoy other things that progressive narrowing of what i as ones pleasure actually expanse it'd ti ism dissect out that thirty days a finely i and i also one to address how does one stop doing something for thirty days if the thing is a thought is i put that on the shell for at moment days one through ten i would imagine will be very uncomfortable yes they are going a sock racially to be quite ones a bayou the way you describe this pleasure pain balance to my mind says that if you remove what little pleasure one is getting were lot of pleasure from engaging in some behavior that is gone the pain system is really ramped up and nothing is making me feel good i tosceuse myself as example ism not in recovery but you do not that ten days is going to be miserable anxiety trouble sleeping et i physical agitation he have the point where you do not i they be impulsive angry would should one expect all of that should the family members of people expect all of that ya what i say to patience and it is a really important piece of this intervention is that you will feel worse before you feel better ism for how long it is ai at es i i ma astray and and i say usually in my clinical experience you will feel worse for two weeks but if you can make it through those first two weeks the sun will start to come out in weekthree and by week for most people are feeling a whole lot better than they were before they stopped using their stub in substance i yet you have to it is it is a hard thing you have to sign up for it and i will say obviously there are people with editions that are severe that as long as they have access to their drug or behave you they are not able to stop themselves and that is why we have in o higher levels of care or residential treatment this is not going to be for everybody this invention but it is amazing how many people with really severe addictions to things heroin cocaine very severe pornography addictions i posit this and i do it is an experiment i saidyou to let let us try this experiment ism always amazed number one how many of them are willing and number two how many of them are actually able to do it they are able to do it and that little huge is sort of just what they need and the caret is there is a better life out there for you and you will be able to taste it in a month you really will be able to begin to see that you can feel better an that there is another way the way you describe it seems it is hard but it is durable for most people not everybody right and we will return to the that category of people who cannot do that on their own well then day's twenty one through thirty a people are feeling better the sun is starting come out as you mention they it which translates in the narrative we have created here and spot by biology that dopamean is starting to be released in response to the taste of a really good cup of coffee yes e exactly whereas before it was only to insert addictive behavior ightthat is what whichever worse copy can be addicted to but will lejunor i ye i coffee has a kind of am consumption limiting mechanism built in were at some point you just cannot intestacy more yet but maybe that is wrong sorry to give let to have antics nothing as i class i of my my one am days twenty one through thirty am have seen a lot of people go through addiction and addiction treatment i spend a lot of time in those places actually am looking at it researching o got friends in that community am close with that community one thing have seen over and over again sadly often in the same individuals is they get sober from whatever they are doing great you people with family is these are people that you discard your normal image of an attic and insert the most normal topic all whatever healthy person you can imagine cause low these people you would not know were attics and then all a sudden you get this call and sos back in jail and sos wife is going to leave him because he drank two bottles of of wine and took a canal at seven a m crash is truck into a poles got two beautiful kids how did this happen again to the point where by the fourth in fifth time people are just done i mean not maybe people you might be able to detect the frustration my voice ism dealing with this with somebody that is i do not even know that i want to help this time it is been many times to the point where ism starting to wonder is this person just an attic this is just cine to what they do and who they are and i and you never want to give up on people but i and ism hanging in there for them bat i will say that ism many people have given up on them and would it'd to talk about in this contact is what sorts of things help other people that we know that are addicted what really helps mi not to not what could help what really helps and are there certain people for whom it is hopeless i may i do not to hold the conversation that way but i would not be close to the real life data if if i did not ask is it is it hopeless are there people who just will not be able to quit their substance use or their addictive behavior despite i have to assume really wanting to yes there there are people who will die of their disease of edition you known i think conventionalizing it as a disease is a helpful frame there are other frames that we could use but i do think given the brain physiologic changes that occur with sustained heavy drug use and what we know happens to the brain tit is really reasonable to think of it as a brain disease and and for me the real window of lets ay being able to access my compassion around people who are repeat relapses even when their life is much better when they r no yet yes its i do no brain or right ism is is to conventionalize this balance and the opening defies it state and a balance till tilted to the side of pain and to imagine that for some people after a month or six months or maybe even six years their balance is still tipped to the side of pain that on some level that balance has lost its recipients and its ability to restore homy states and toll sit the hinge on that blames no exactly and i mean for for some one who is never experienced addiction yourself that be one one way to conventionalize it is i did not say the o is i oui was i referring to myself but i i in this example was given i if i were i would i would i come clean i i would reveal that i but i i think that especially after hearing some of your lectures and descriptions of the range of things that are addict if i hank have been fortune t i do not have a propensity for drugs or algal right ism yet ism lucky in that ray that frankly if they remove all the all call from the planet it'll just be relieved because nounal offer to mere rest do not send me any alcohol an on lit go to me ram but i but i do not have that i i to think i have the compassion ism but i do not have that i empathy for you know taking a really good situation and what from the outside ray glowing it rash yet can sold self hut let them and this is really i think important because i i also had to come to an understanding of this and i feel that i have in my twenty years of seeing these patience and of course addiction is a spent from de sure right ins you have get the severe and of things ism imagine that you had in itch somewhere on your body oke and it was i mean we have all had that in whatever the source it was super superior you can go for if you really focus you could go for a pretty good amount of time not scratching it but the moment you stopped focussing on not scratching it you would scratch it and maybe you do it while you were sleep rat that's and that is what happens to people with severe addiction that balance sensually broken ho me stacks does not get restored to spite sustained abstinence they are living with that constant spatter of that pull it never goes away the me we there are lots of people with a diction for whom that does go away and it goes away t for weeks for many of them but in severe cases that is always there and it is lingering and it is the moment when they are not focussing on not using it is a reflect fall back into it it is not purposeful it is not because they want to get high it is not because they value using drugs more than they do their family none of that it is that really they they they cannot not do it when given the opportunity and that moment when they are not thinking about it does i make sense of great description and actually in that description i can feel a bit of empathy because the way you describe scratching in each in your sleep ye in have have done that if the mosquito bites la watching i r scratching that mama mosquito by and i also have to admit that have experience not feeling i want a pick up my phone because it is rewarding but just finding myself doing it yes f or i do not gan us missing on i uses thing and and then just finding myself yet what a ma rang here right of the how did i get back yet again right and i i know enough about brain function to understand that we have circuits that generate deliberate behavior and we have circus that generate reflects of behavior and one of the goals of the nervous system is to make the deliberate stuff reflective you do not have to make the decision because decision making is a very costly thing to done act decision making of any comrade right that does really help the i i want et just trying weave together this this dopamean puzzle however because if by weedless o first phase of this a thirty or forty day demons is a dopamine fast right might o kit first tends are miserable middletendays the clouds about there may be some charge of sunlight coming through and then all a sudden sun starts to come out and gets brighter and brighter why is it then that people will relapse conscious after getting fired from a job or their spouse leaving the but when things are going really well is it this unconscious mechanism cause have seen this before is a they have a great wind have a friend who is a really impressive creative ism i do not want a real any more than that but a and relapsed upon getting another really terrific opportunity to create for the entire world an is how can that happen but now ism beginning to wonder was it the dopamine associated with that withal open the spirit on this dopamine system because i it happened in a phase of of a really great stretch of what right yes you you raise that great point about triggers right and triggers are things that make us want to go back to using our drug and the anything about triggers whatever they are is they also release a little bit of dopamine right just thinking about mum whatever the trigger is that we associate with drug use or just thinking about drug use can already release this anticipatory do mean this mew little many spike but here is the part that i think is really fascinating that many spike is followed by a many definite states oh it goes up and then it does not go back down to base when it goes below baseline tonic levels and that is craving right that anticipation is immediately followed by wanting the drug and it is that doping definite state that drives the motivation to go and get the drug many people told about do mean is not really about pleasure but about wanting and about motivation and it is that definite state that then drives the locomotion to get it and earlier your description of dopamine be involved in the desire for more giving the sense of reward but also movement why i have to assume that those things are bragged to we again nervous system yo have or the specific intention of when you feel something yes good then you feel the pain ya you do not notice it that don the next to you are pursuing more of the things and i life the way you uses the word traded together that is beautiful and let me also just say san the i o find also fascinating in my work with patience and i see this all the time there are people for whom that life experiences lost win any forms trusts in many different forms that is a trigger but there are absolutely people for whom the trigger is things going well and the things going well can be the reward of the things going well but very often what it is is the removal of the hyprovigilance date that is required to keep their use in check it is the sense of i want ta celebrate or i wonder this reward happened i one ut put more reward on there and it is really really fascinating because when people come to that realization the bout themselves that there most vulnerable when things are going well that is really a valuable insight because then they can put some in things an place or barriers and plays ore got to more meetings ore whatever it is that they do to protect themselves along those lines i have a friend a forty years sober was a severe brogan it'll call optic for a very young age really impressive person as a lot of important work in the con of at risk youth community out and why and he said something to me he said a as former antics often do they got these great sayings but i think it fit is very well with what you are destroying he said no matter how far you drive you are always the same distance and an and i said that is kind of depressing and he said know that is actually what gives me peace ye because what would happen is for many years of relapsing and relapsing getting recovering and relapsing he felt it was hopeless and then somehow conventionalizing that the vigilance can never go instead of making him feel burden ya it made him feel relieved i often thing about that that statement no matter how far you drive you are always the same distance from the ditch because in my mind i conventionalized that as gosh that is a that is a tough way to drive down the road but actually on a road where where the ditches and meou know where the lane lines are it is shall pretty nice drive it is when you do not know where the shoulder is that you constantly have to be looking around there is this where it were speaking now an in analogies and an imagery a an science but i one of things i find incredible about this community of twelve step in their her variety of them or the am the communities that they create for themselves i and some of these things which i do believe link back to really for biological mechanism yes yes i do don't ask about those communities ai have a question which might be exhibit controversial a faints which is is it possible that people who were addicted to drugs or call or som gambling or some other behavior get addicted to the addiction community because one thing that i think i observe over and overs that there is some circuit in the brain of human beings that has to tell you about the dream they had the night before for one of er reason om there is another circuit that leads people to a wake you up if they themselves cannot sleep i do not kin mane physical here but there does seem to also be a circuit in the brain of attics to discuss and want to toucan talk about their recovery a lot and i mention this not to poke at them but rather the opposite because i think that one thing that is challenging t least for me and having friends that that have a propensity for drugged you call addiction not all hon ut certainly some of them is when there time at the recovery i feel it is all they talk about this meeting that mean them how are we what ism really asking here is am is that someday we become addicted to sobriety right this is a great question and it links into some of the other things we have been talking about having to do with where do we settle settle out what is the way to live between pleasure and pain and i implied earlier that ultimately we want a resilient balance that sensitive to pleasure and pain but that can easily restore homeostasis after we indulge even when we indulge greatly i but the truth of the matter is that people with severe addiction i believe temperamentally want those extremes and their wired for that kind of intensity that is more than just these slight adjustments around the full drum right it is they want the big higher an the big lo they will say great meeting yet i own segrasins where they find an a vein a group in a location ye tike we si this is almost an inside joke in those omens again ism not report ism not time not a friend in quotes is not me reporting with the i they will take about how attractive people already given meeting or how how bonded they feel at a give eating a meetings it themselves rag on their own form of doom ye yes end and again om not being disparaging not i i will not understand a yes a lot of time's patients ill say me oh i do not want to go to a it is a cult and my response to that is because it is a cult is exactly why it works oke because yes it is much better for you to be addicted to a a and to recovery than almost any other addiction i could think of and we know from rabolinka's work is here ant stamford that ox tost in am is the hormone that indulged in human pair bonding and relationships in love and it directly links to done me neurons and causes the release of do not mean yes when we connect with other humans especially in a kind of transcendent spiritual way that is a huge dope mean hit and it does replace the do not mean that people get from drugs and for people who have this addiction temperament they need it on a more intense level they are not going to be generally satisfied with kind of an a sort of acquaintance ship right they they they want that intensity of the intimacy that you get with people when you are cathardically exposing worth an all yes people can get a diced to recovery and good for them go for it and of course this can be disruptive for friendships and an relationships where the one person is not in recovering you are going to many meetings you are always i to recovery but what much better than them being intoxicated right i mean although you may tire of your friends talking about there there you nomuniles me ism sure you would rather have them do that than than be in their addictions now absolutely and am this now the second time you have done ta especial to now i have empathy because the way you describe they are enthusiasm about meetings yes is probably the way that people feel about me y r it and my in nor science i mean have been getting up in front of the class since i was eight years old and talking about things i read or we can now i just happen to have this thing call the podcawns at it seven new in since is all and in mannose a lot of people right have learned to suppress in a a some people it but i ism poking for of myself just to say that i now can i understand that the way i feel about their reports about yet another amazing meeting for and for for this a different form of this but they're some people for which they just love intense experiences yet they are always turn of pull me off to belly because they have talking about how sensual it is all dim sure belly's wonderful if there is this kind of rationing up it is seeking burning men all hang have never been wavering man no desire to go to burning man am am but inside of macadamia i mean if i were to just turn the me at myself inside of macadamia or here insult con towed work and the peri of more success even if money is and of divorce from that sometimes it is sometimes it is not academic work is forsake of pursuit of knowledge it sounds to me the same mechanism and that it feels to me very much the the the same mechanism drew hearts what i love about you first of all you are willing to bring your own flaws and foibles to this conceals there ester ow no who it is wonderful and then you really open and curious and wanting to understand cause i cannot tell you how many people i have met who really see addiction as some kind of other nets but the truth is we are all wired for addiction and if you are not addicted yet it is it is just it is right around the corner you k ow what i mean especially with the incredible panoply of new drugs and behaviors that are out there i love that you are willing to take a moment and really try to understand this because it is it is we can all relate and you are relating it to your essentially your work addiction is right and an apt you just happen to be addicted to something that is really socially rewarded you figured that out in n early age oh when i do ex my and zee allthse people go look at that smart kid or whatever it is yo were me made me feel safe o i felt ye i just felt this and at austere causes it is peace ism i can relax for a moment when you are talking about narcs on wo know or just when ism when have when i feel ism on the right path ah and ism on to some thing or if i see something that ism excited a ism i feel filled with it must be doyenne have you will lot in with pleasure merely headed to a and then my next thought is more tour youareyou are you're really you are day at o yen you aren't you you are but you just got really think i you really got lucky win a fact that that way what you are drawn to is is adaptive essentially i men an then your challenges going to be that your life does not get too out a balance in the sense that your twenty four seven work and you do not stop and do some other terms or think about it and o life and my life ad widely is somewhat e metric i mean it has other components of physical health at setter but is around someone ass metric i which is why got a dog although i talk about him an awful lot but the dog is good because that drop you out of yourself in a little bit away from the work but again i think the key here is for people if feel they do not they have never experienced addiction they do not know anybody with a dictionary if they do they do not get it just think of that one thing that is the most important thing in your life that you do that gives you pleasure and meaning in purpose and then imagine if you could not do it i yet let us not talk about that why appreciate that the feed back and not you can send me able em what is the most ridiculous sounding addiction that you have ever witnessed that was actually a real addiction along these lines mum because i i think we all know the standard heroine pilot you have been very i should mention because it is important your previous book i and will prattling to that as well focussed on the olio crisis and what we thought was medication turned out to be just as bad if not worse than a lot of called street drugs a we understand those though you gambling sedation prediction now video games will talk about social media will bet more in depth but what is the most wow i did not realize people could get addicted to that water really really i had a very lovely patient who was had a severe alcoholidiction and she got into recovery from her alcoholidiction am for many years but she kind of had a sort of a polydipsierra and urged to be drinking something a lot and she drank a lot of water and slowly over time she realized that if she drank enough water she could become phony uremic and delirious and be out of herself who dive from it right which is which sh just wanted to be out of her own head and she would periodically intentionally over dose on water in order to to i know it was ti sad sad what happened her she eventually took took her own life who as really anurous she was a lovely woman of she was bright she had many interests and passions and and of course it was very sad when when she died but but i that was awhile to me it was while if you have this disease of edition you cant even get addicted to water well and i thing it just underscore the the generalize ability of these circuits right is there is not a brain circuit for addiction to water that she happen have there is a brain circuit for pleasure and pain and radiation and water plugged in to that lasers it right well that is it that is intense am in your book a dope nation you also describe some amazing pas to recovery people that am from reading it i would i will not say which ones and who cause there some great surprises in the book to both am tragic an and and triumphant as they say am you have often describe your patience as your heroes ye have let's also tit more when you think about how hard it is to give up a drug or a behavior that you are addicted to how much courage that takes and fortitude and discipline and stick positiveness these people are really amazing people i mean that is i i do not know that i could do it what they what they do it is and liken we talked o a little bit about i just the constant ever present urged to use even after sustain periods of absence for some people that is really really hard and of course than you double down on the shame that that they feel because of that urged even when their lives are much better mean these people are really really remarkable and you take the remark remarkable accomplishment and then you imagine the world that we live in now where we are constantly invited and tempted and really bombarded with opportunities to become addicted legatilian itch everywhere oh ye ism you cannot escape it you cannot escape it that you get i ye mail in your into inviting you to do expires the and if your addicted to that thing and you tried to to lead all your abs and not to here all the sudden you are work in bore you are getting those images let us say really really really hard and yet these people find a way to do it i think it is absolutely amazing and they are really wise people they have much wisdom to for they have taught me lot you know as i talk about my book i have my own editions and i really just took a page read out of their boy o pay what do i do now a i chatted this patient to at about caw wen a try that is is in amazing community ya the people the they are very sage i wanted to on just touch on something that you mention which is of the shame h you cannot go to a meeting or talk to antics without detecting or or hearing about lie shame et camera i heard you say on in interview with somebody else recently that truth telling and secrets our serf at the core of recovery and om et tell us more about that yes one of the things that i found really fascinating about working with people in recovery was how telling the truth even about the merest detail of their lives with central to their recovery and i became really curious about that why would truth telling be important and course there is the obvious thing that when people are in their addiction they're lying about using part of getting into recovery is to stop lying to the people they care about about their use but it is really more than that because what but people in recovery have taught me is that it is not it is not even just not lying about using drugs i have to not lie about anything i cannot lie about why was late to work this morning which we all do ah i hittraffic now i did not hittraffic i wanted to spend two more minutes reading the paper and drinking my coffee write or just lying about i do not know where i had dinner people with addiction will get into know the lying habit when they are lying about random stuff cause they're sort of in the habit of line and how recovery's really about telling the truth in all ways an one of the things that i what i had a lot of fun with it in writing the book is sort of exploring in the narrow science around why truth telling is important to leading balance life and we know every religion since the being of time is all about telling truthful why writ and there is really interesting narrow science behind it that suggest that when we tell the truth we actually potentially strengthen our prefrontal court cortical circuits and their connections to our limbic brain and our reward brain and of course these are the circuits that get disconnected when we are in our edition it our balance in our reward pathway or limbic brain our motion brain is doing one thing and our cortical circuits are completely disengage from that ignoring what is happening which is easy to do because it is reflects give we do not need to think about that balance for the balance to be h opening but we have to reengage those circuits anticipate future consequences think through the drink not just how my gong to feel now if i use but how mi can feel tomorrow or six months from now and that telling the truth is in fact away to do that to make these connections stronger and there i talk about some studies in my book that that kind of indirectly show that i find that really fastening plus at they just that being open and honest with people really does create very intimate connections and those intimate connections create opening we are talking little bit about how you you do not know about to people who need intensity in their lives for me i need a lot of intensity in my human connections ism really not interested in and bored by and made anxious by ism casual am interactions but having this kind of discussion with you that is very intense and also intimate and self disclosing is very rewarding for me that is a important source of down thank god i became a psychiitron i apsolri i i cannot dis of all my stuff but i am quite transparent with my patients which is a slightly on orthydoks ism but when i think it is right ism also transparent with them that that is that is a source of opening to when we are honest and we disclose and that you think people are going to run away from you if you tell them about all your weird neurosis but really they do not but there is all think god ism not the only one ray well what i love about i love many things about your book i read it in one sweet and and else wow is i i was a unpleasantly surprise but i was wot she is really opening up in this look from the very begin i and i do not ant to give at that away but it is yet your your very open i where it is appropriate and i and also i think that this question about truth telling i i ways ting about tell the truth the a hundred per cent about the truth but there is also the element about do you report previous lies right what about prior behave an ism fastening by this us to me telling the truth is has many fascist but that the three sides of this thing to in my mind are one is reporting everything accurately the other is what you with hold what you not withhold right because some people say ism tell the truth or at least do not line that sort of i lies of lies of omission as i has of mission i lies of mission and then there there is the what i have to assume for most people is a small to enormous batch of things that they lied about in the past that still thread into the few car how important is it for that the addict or that every person ray to i cause it sounds cultivating the circuitry between pro one protects in the dobermans is tom out be great for anybody since were all antics right as we want you do it but in in all seriousness it sons a a good thing for everybody to do how how much work needs to be done on all the priors all the stuff we have hidden i me not me but all that all the stuffs at everybody aaaayes the the steps of the twelve steps of alcoholicanonomis a good number of those steps are about that very thing the past the ways that we have harmed people in the past and one o the fourth step is about making amends by admitting the ways in which that we have contributed to harming others and it is a really big piece of recovery how important for people with edition it is really really important to go back and make amends and you teethe the key idea there is you just go back in you apologize and you do not you do not have to get any particular kind of response or you do not need to be forgiven it is the act itself of apologizing about the ways in which we have harmed or lied to people o in the past that is cathartic and renewing and allows us to kind of shed this skin and be be new in our lives and begin again sort of absolved of past sin to speak it it is really importance are their situations when it is may be not a good idea because of and that person or the nature sure there are always going to be it does not have to be it is not where hung about not not costs idea about it never live ut an robbers in your house and you on your to away you cannot lie even about that now therefore probably situations oration i forsake of other people say right ones right right regtonming there there you can think of a million sand areas but but but in general when we are taking stock because i do not know about you but i have a lot of regrets and guilt about a lot of things in my life and and and the kind of haunt me it omens it'll have nightmares right and i think that is true for most people and n i occasion will meet somebody was li do not have any regrets an i waw i i cannot relate to that at at all the idea of catharsis and well i mean in the twelve steps it is telling telling god or your higher power telling another human being the ways in which you have wronged others considering your own character defects and how those have contributed to me that is really important piece and something that we do not do enough in our current culture especially in psychiatry frankly where there is a a lot of eternally em empathizing with patience but not a whole lot of s going well actually you kind of mess the at up warlike that was really bad on you and id in my work i don't ne surely use that language met patience many life i i really feel badly about this thing o b ye i get it i i understand that you feel guilt's it is aright there is a circuit for that to right and is it is important right and it is all important to i recovery and to not becoming addicted a experiencing a certain amount of appropriate shame for things that we have done and you know feeling f the pain tat comes with shame which is an incredibly painful emotion right and i think that may be the one that we all try to avoid more than any other is that shame u of not being liked or not being accepted or not being work anathema we did is is really despicable right it is o really yet all mi got that horrible thing right right and then i mean i done horrible things that i i have not gone back and said i did this horrible thing but i maybe have tried to pay it forward have told my kids when i was younger i did this horrible thing and it still haunts me if you are ever tempted to do something what i did you might think about my situate some kind of way now but i think resting with that is is important i i think it is a really important element all this and there is not a i love that there is narrow science being done on truth tell we ad value of truth to had i think a it if i were to predict it a new and truly exciting area that people are you may really curious about and in this huge sphere we call narrow science i i hope they will continued you more we ha a speaks ism glad more that is happening here at staffer i know that is that that the a the the the literature that i look at is not to standard work but due but there is work it re might be might be peopleaver gales a word doing yet a more of that and all the rest yelled mum don't ask you about using drugs to treat drug addiction m these days there is a growing interest or at least discussion about i begin people going down at going out of country because i think it stilly legal here i more is legal here going out of country to an either i injected or smoke it or whatever it is or people going and doing i was a journeys or ism empty a may which is still any legal drug in this country but there clinical trials there are people on this camp is doing experimental studies i do not know of clinical trials but it johns hoping there clinical trials et camera this i this is a vast area right different chemistry's for different drugs and different purposes but the the rational as i understand it is take people who are in a pattern of edition launch them in to a experience that is also chemical and extreme often of the extreme ceratoneen and or extreme dopamine type empty a man ran easy friends nuns of her toned down tons of opening dump how nerotoxic if nerotalkic debatable et celebrate center not the topic for now but a lot and then somehow that extreme experience rapped inside of a o a supported networking there whether not there is just someone there or whether not they're actively working through something the patient is supposed to eject the person into a life where drug use is not not as much of interest this violates at t at at a rash purely rational level this violates everything we have talked about in terms of doyenne biology it would if this arrangement is the way i described it cause more addiction is anything but a opening fast its a dopamine feasts we hereabout successful transitions through this at least anedotelyan ma not may be someclinsite what neon what i o as a many s tanks women ya ye ya i think it is good that your skeptical am i think we all should be skeptical having said that am there are clinical studies showing am n these are small studies in their short duration small number of subjects but your taking people for example who are addicted to alcohol and then having them have this unless a psychedelic experience in a very controlled savings rather typicalates a his do filicide an or or three dose as i sit it for the mapstudy of of my ma fantasy those a sort of the the into be the kin of typical i a red in butter of right kind of right but the think to really keep in mind is that this is completely interwoven with regular psychotherapy and that these are highly selected individual and clinical trials r rain as are a leguocland right right and and and i will not i think the metaphor that i that that helps me think about this is there are many ways to the top of the mountain and these are sort o taking the gondola instead of walking up its sort of instead of doing a year of psycho analysis where your sitting on the couch every week reflecting on your life it is a condensed version of psycho analysis or psycho there be plus my ma which gets you there fast cremes the intimacy presumably reckisnuss i think the mean thing that happens when it is beneficial is it just allows the person to get outside of their own head and look at there lives on a much broader sweep and to consider themselves not mired in the quotidian sort of details of their life but rather as a human on on the large planet earth in the vast universe i think it takes it it is when it works it is a transformational experience because it gives the person another ho lends through which to view their live their lives which which i think for some people is positive and powerful because they can come back from that in be oh gosh i care about my family and i do not i want enquires for them and i realize that my continuing to drink is not going to achieve that it is it is almost a spiritual or values based i think it can be very powerful but but having said that i truly am quite skeptical because a diction is a chronic relapsing and remitting problem it is hard for me to imagine that there's something that works very quickly short term that is goon to work for a disease that is really long lasting yet the two antics i know that that did eddy in it empty a manasisted psychotherapies fard as part of this o thing both got worse ye but the people i know who had severe drama who did this who took this approach seem to be doing better and i i think that the discussion as we hear it now is ja sort of psychedelics which is a huge category a right that includes many different drugs an compounds an different effects and we hereabout roman and diction lump together and i think that am ma splitter not a lumpen as we say in science not a and i think it is can o be important for people to know that this is deftly not a one size fits all kind of thing but it is selselike it may have some utility under certain conditions ye i think think it's trying to be very open minded about its potential utility for certain individuals but i can tell you in my clinical work what is very concerning a unintended consequence of this narrative is i have a lot of people who are looking for some kind of spiritual awakening who on their own not in the context of any kind of therapeutic psycho logical work mycrodose or want a try in sylicithen or empty a may with a friend or wherever they can have the anal spiritual experience that they can figure out their lives that that is a disaster and an almost never works out while and i then had people who literally supposed you cannot get addicted to psychedelics because something with the bi chemistry which i do not fully thanks that does not make any sense to me but i have patients slenderly who definitely are addicted to know emdyamay to mycrodosing that is very concerning to me cause poles how to change your mind that that i i respect that work but on the other hand it is penetrated the center alien's book yet yen an ani do not knower and i i do not have a problem taken it taken a stance m all to say my stance on that is the narrative of popular authors can expand and sickout fast yes that pretty soon people are essentially taking their mental health an to their own hands and i actually f i have great optimism for this a business of of clinic use of i psychedelics including m d m a matter johns at johns hoping is doing fabulous work on this and and there are others too of course but those are controlled stings rand the pharmacology is being tuned up and one thing that i think is coming i there several papers publish recently an great journals nature and science et camera where there are scientists who are removing the hallucinate genic components of these drugs and finding that they still have the antidepressant effects and the experience of a psychedelic and the long term effects of the psychedelic might actually be disco and i gain i and ism always carefurtal say i ism neither for something or against it i i just think that i treading carefully is what is important i i i agree with you and i can just tell you that the the downstream of facts for the average person i it'd for many of whom present in our clinic is that they have misconstrued the data on the use of psychedelics for mental health conditions ism to this idea that they are say for that anybody can take them any circumstance and have this kind of awakening and that that is not what the data shall write the date are these highly controlled settings i you said carefully selected patient o that that is my work sure and ammine sitting down with matter johns and at some point and will discuss this and i think that a that care and that i that cocoon of of real clinical care does seem to be an important weave on it it's glad we could touch on it and de at i'mshurei'll get a bunch of comments tell me but u i but i think it is important to explore things from all sides and that is that is what we we do as yecientisan if michael palm wants to chat we can do that too that is my re very much enjoyed the book actually but i think that a people run with ideas that is right they do not walk with them that he parent ram there couple other things i just won at touch on i but they all relate to social media ho you were featured in the social solemn is a powerful move i think many people avoided seeing that move because it it reflects back on us just how addicted we all are and how manipulated we all are yes but it does not seem to changed behavior much i have to say that that the move changed my understanding in my perception but not my behavior r too much if we look at addiction as a maladapted o think something that is making our lives were for a are us less functional at work an in relationships i could imagine aversion of social media ware it is making me more connected i mean this is a pod cast after went i pop yes be the use at this will show up on me to and m and elements of it on instrogramas well much o sugar or om other things i have to imagine that we need to regulate not necessarily eliminate this behavior once o bat what that looks and i want to talk about what you have referred to as this narcissistic preoccupation that social medias creating that we are all far more keenly aware of how we look and how we sound and how we are being perceived than we were ten years ago right first all social media i how addicting is it really and what is healthy social media behavior the first message i would want to get across about social media is that it really is a drug and it is engineer to be a drug i and its spaced on potency quantity variety the bottomless polls the likes the way that it is enumerated all of that which does not mean that we cannot use it but we need to be very thoughtful about the way we we use it just we need to be thoughtful about the way we use any drug i and that means with intention and in advance planning or use right and trying to use it in as as a as a really awesome tool to potentially contact with other people and not to be used by it um or get lost in it and of course people are going to come with different propensities for addiction to any drug and that is true for social media to some people will have no problem using it in moderation or using it in a way that is adaptive and other other people well immediately get get sucked in and the anything about getting addicted as when it is happening wet we nobody who is getting addicted thinks they are getting a dick at right let us face it it is only after the fact that we go whaps yo know what was that i it'll remember taxing and driving there all these books about taxing a driving ow terrible was ye even the governments have largely given up you see these you have billboard terrific do not than driver any ten can after not worth dying for right er anybody's extend right and if you look at young people deyteen eaters i mean their basically ciburnatically enhance that the phone is there it is their talking to you and testing twelve friends at the same time and there is no stopping and i mean the genie is at of the bottle where you know is not not going back right now we we do need to figure out how to make this this tool something that is you are going to be good for us and and not alternately harmful and i i do not have all the answers at by any scratch of the imagination but i do think some of the wisdom that we have learned from using other drugs also applies to social media which is to say that we have to again put barriers in place that allow us to remain in control of our use which means not not too much not too often not too potent i you think in going back to this idea of that the unit of the day being a good attractable unit a manageable unit of time for most people ism your saying in advance or allocating to hours in which you are going to allow yourself to have are rain use of the phone an all its as in ills things or am even more restricted than that meaning i cam ism only can allow myself thirty minutes a day to post in comment and then that is a close out completely yes i think it is it is depends on the person and sort of a commination we talked our there about having an itch and scratching yourself at night we have got into appoint with smartphones people are pulling them out and they are utterly unconscious of doing pulling hem out couple taxes to couples the do not kin o orang any who works in shadows delivers babies yet and ism many pregnant mothers will not actually deliver without their phone in hand and this use to be the hand that was acted to their i be a commontoan y houses a more than non phone am but i it sounds there is it is a kind of a security blind is on a transitional object ye actually never reminds me you have referred to ism the phone i think it is the phone but maybe it is our online persona or our selves as we have become sort of infantile in our need for it a baby in a bottle r and i do wonder if if we have a regress and i do think we have regress a bit ism in terms of our online behavior our inability to contact ye have south in adult was somebody the conccontrol their behavior have us a different e din a baby in a none you have to be in well tell nor about is from not unperson a young organism cannot control its behavior an older one can to me i a mature organism mature in years organism that cannot control ts behavior is a baby it in it is in immatureeran o itself and there is cool there is no science to support that statement ism i look in my own behavior with the phone sometimes and i think ism a groans man i no wan is the role here i am you knit only baby food but ism acting a baby we a phone i ism in the sense that ism reflectively picking it ism ism not being intention in deliberatewoul i ism do need a full thirty days et that is other i ow that is my fall thirty days to reseteral i t if you are if you are severely addicted that the i recommend the three days but if you are just a little bit addicted most of us you probably do not need thirty days in fact a single day not only would be challenging but m but probably maybe sufficient my phone is off for substantial sidementson o cannot that is cat and it drives other people crazy people expect me to respond a but i do not care two right and actually take a lit bit of pleasure ye in thatawell because i think the point ism trying to make is the right one which is that is not just right for me but why ad it i do not see a class on text messages or males that say must be responded to with in i ex amount of time or else sits i or else we so i take the liberty of the recline when i when ism able to ye that is right went want toyed i right which touches on one of the big challenges about social media is that as more and more of us are spending more and more time on social media were divesting our rabidness energies et camera from real life interactions that means even when we want to choose to not be on mine connecting we go outside and there is there is no there there right there is nobody else there i think our collective challenge and it should be our mission is to make sure that we are preserving and maintaining off line ways to connect with each other cause if if we do not do that then will be very lonely right if we were not on mine but if you have a tribe of folks that you can be with none of whom are on their phones while you are together for that discreet amount a time then it is wonderful and liberating an nobody's distracted and i think that is really the key and i think young people are figuring that out they are trying to create these spaces or tryma let us say instead of doing it do not mean fast by yourself do it with your friends right then there is that photo is less the fear of missing out because o you are all doing the don't mean fast together these are some of the tricks that in a pecan come up with but a that pecan li i do not allow i have a home him and i i love working out i just enjoy it and always have and i i do not allow my phone yen my him any more right and i liven an are where i do not get any reception two meters outside my car all my dog walks now or just i they were boring as ho ell have the dog he does to what is real es love o and it was boring for a while yes cause i was used to takin calls a walkers superficies can i do that the walks your some of my favorite part of the yet a and if the phone were if i were to get a call on one of those in tor caption f the air yes it'd be very assimade a i can attest to this and i i do not think ism a phone attic be ut i do put work into regulating my yes o this is the key you have to with intention prior to being in that situation think of literal physical and meticognativ barriers that you can put between yourself and your phone or whatever your your drug is to create these intentional spaces where you are not constantly interrupting yourself essentially and distracting yourself because i really do think an i think we talk just just before we we started with the interview were we are losing the ability to have a sustained thought right and m we we get far and then then you get to that point in the thought where it is a little bit hard to know what is coming next and it is very easy to check yourphone or check your male or look something up on the inner net and then you never get that opportunity to finish that thought which is really the source of creative energy and an original thought right you are to just reacting to and something a an contribute to the world that is a am a big i may be believer that your either consuming or you are creating r an the there is i should mention a it is important i do believe in neutral time i think sleep is crate i on be proponitivein talk lot about on the sarcastic carrot about sleep an not just for sake a performance i shan't jisreally sleep i think that being a constant consumer of visual information and the e information of all kinds can can be a prom but but there is some really great sources of information on the strand a and i i certainly benefit from from the fact that that those channels exist car sadistic preoccupation am i anarsisis i for fall there there is there is heart or as e fat in i can is that in ta no o our sh is no as that g o yes highly sophisticated in ourselves and not on arms of this there is healthy your sissy which means that we all in vest are personal energies into things that we care about and if our competence in that arenas threatened we we would all experience in our fistic injury and that is normal and healthy but but but we are living in a narcissistic culturing that is not news this preoccupation with individual achievement and individual self worth and individual self confidence and i think all of that is just fuelled by social media where we are not just seeing ourselves but were seeing people's reactions to ourselves in everything o thing we say or do we get likes in this and that it is really insidious and it contributes i think ultimately to a lot of personal shame because we are not really meant to be individuals bouncing around in the universe wore social animals and we we are we are probably generally happiest even for a rural front contrarians among us when we are part of a tribe right and if we do too much to kind of separate ourselves from from that tribe i think that the brains natural and instinctive corrective mechanism against that is self clothing in shame it is ironic because that the culture tells us if we just achieve more we will ourselves more but the truth is actually the opposite that that i think when people get these pinnacles of personal achievement you have things the imposters in got or what whatever n just you do not we are at tampered after a lot of high achievers you right us phenomenal amazing people yourself and o other colleague of on that is m always in awe this systemizing the mean it is shifted highland also people have amazing store paths to get here on coming from very little accomplishing much but it is also the pressure right am the way that this career was described to me the day i got my job was one colleague of mine the late ben barrisaid welcome toss a frenzy and never n o e only conplyany voting without eating interrupt id not o as partially true of have created buffers and the other one m very a successful sign dis not a member an ashracabmy et camera said to me i just remember it is pinball you never when the best you can do is just enplane yes and i thought i was o we o we and then you just go right but i think that as we achieve more not just academics of course t as any one achieves more there is the relishing in the accomplishment there is often the desire for more but there is also the pressure of well now i have to do this for the next thirty years even though i love it it is the pressure of well if the mountain is this high than how do i get here and here and here and then you start shoveling more dirt on you can keep ahoy and it is a lot of work yes and i think that the the perception of success is that there is a roar of the crowd and you cruise you do not cruise in that they just give you more to do right or you give yourself more to do what i think is at least in my my life experience have heard this from other people as well it what it is that prize that were going for that if we get it it is unsatisfying and it is the prize that we never imagined that we cannot go how did that happen but g that feels good and ism very i it is cure what is that is o manage n ya s a i a let's on the one it is almost lake nobleman can create these mirage yes that there is som place that a right and if i gent it is that pot of gorge right bit i constant dying right still right an that is right know and and i think this minor this really i think is related to our our taught our discussion early about this taking it one day at a time or paying attention to that twenty four period in your environment i am absolute fascinated by the ways in which we accumulate success when we do that totally independent of the desire for success it is really process oriented it is where am i to day how can i make to day a good and meaningful day a little bit better or as good as some other days have had constantly tweaking and experimenting with this experiment that we call our human existence and when we do that in a way that is authentic and paying attention and value driven whatever are values are informed by it is very very interesting how those days again accumulate and you find well i guess i contributed something of value there but i was not trying to do that i think that is really i mean what what litmus amazed by as twenty years ago when i went to stand for medical score twenty five years ago om i just i was happy just be a good doctor i was i i guess ism just an a try a figure out how to be a good doctor ism here to learn that and now i see these medical sunshine they're wonderful their brilliant an there thereat there l intention to all that but there how can i right the great america novel do my start up go to africa apply for that grant me it is really i was just trying if learn how to be a doctor and it is as you say it is a lot of pressure on them and it is also kind of a weird leap forging of the real way to accomplish something right by which is not about oh how can i accomplish something it is what can i do to day that would be of service right and then finding that of trying to be service a you and and not really going for recognition can sometimes lead to what people call success although that was not what you ware aiming for and it is all the more beautiful when it is not what you are of much better much better no ism a be believer that when one can om a line there compulsion with some greater good yes i service to humanity or the planets or animals whatever it is that om that is that is where tithe really good stuff emerges because there is a lot of reciprocity there the world starts to you are supporting the world and than it starts to support in away that feels very and the it comes back it anilin that speaks to you your generosity to me these of the my book and i have to si of the book i know is it s outward a not in a business heal folks it is just purely that i heard an a lecture in my course i want to learn more about dopamine she taught me asked her if she would come on the pock ask turned up she wrote this amazing book she send me a it is copy of the book ice read in one sweep it is incredible and i love it just the eight year old version of me a now the forty version of myself i cannot stop laying about the things i love we then it is arson but i have to say i have been surprised by your generosity it is not something have encountered frequently o that standard i which is a wonderful place chart it the there are there is a general sense that if i give away to somebody else have lost have lost something i which is not the right way to think about it not how you are and also not how the world works cause when we give away to other people we we get back much more but it it takes a long time and it might not come through that path i never think about the about reciprocity i but i was wean by good advisers that is very name thing i just his or got drilled in to me that the more the more you give the better your immediate life yes ye and i also do not have a long term vision i no just ism ism just excited about the book i make si that people are are learning about the brain and dopa mean have to it having grown up in narial science essentially i did not understand that pleasure and pain were orchestrated the way that they are ism very mindful of it now i om and it is change in number of my behaviors i know a number o people can have questions and when i getting contact with you you are not on social media that is correct were true toast you are true to your i apology that was great and then the reason for that is just i would not be able to control myself i men that really would be my drug people are my drug intimacy as my drug and and i would not be able to manage it and just it was just easier for me to not do it at all rather than try to moderating well the book as you ism mention before as i can attest to is and has a certain intimacy people get to know you through the book that only check out the book ism if you have questions about the book at setter you welcome to send the my way i i will buffer you from all this questions i fill through them i and doctor empty i i should be a formal forgive me have been referring to you now know that way your things were colleagues but thank you much for sharing this information and ism i know i learned a ton and i know everyone ease's go learn a lot more about addiction and the good side of do me that is ray thank you for having me it is been

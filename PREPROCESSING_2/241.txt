a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in to day's episode of the show if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our website this america life outwork couple years ago michael wrote a book about miry street then it did fine good reviews it the best seller less for couple weeks and mi cold did something that i guess is a normal thing to do if you worked on anything for a year and a half clouding a book i what occasionally check it is ratings on amazon but occasionally i mean all the tine and i would say most of them were great the lot of people really liked the book a right now has almost three hundred customer raiding on amazon i let just look at up a young enthroned than yes i have two hundred ninety five customer raiding forty six per cent of them are five star readings twenty three per cent are four star ratings that is two thirds of people who raised it loved it right that is nice but with this other people the eight per cent who gave h one star the nine per cent who gave him two stars those wore the people he found himself getting stuck on i have to say i ism not proud of any of this i not proud of talking bout that i wish i was the kind of person who just floated in a cloud above my amazon ratings but ism not i means some of that some of the things that people of an amazon just kind of cut to the bone in this way is some much just as boring a book a book critic is not going to say boring but if an average customer goes on amazon says this book is boring boring boring one star i think is worse than as for smart book critic explaining why something dinterdid not work boring want hated it no there's one that just at no and it just makes you feel terrible i would i would check my amazons were an unhealthy number of times a and sometimes before i went to bed which is really bad idea is then you would just drift off to sleep arguing with these people in your head but then michael stumbled on to this strategy something he could do to deal with those feelings this just happened i was just spending too much time thinking about who these people were and at some point i just clicked on one of their names it one of people who who hated your book ye and that brought me to everything else they had reviewed on amazon and i realize that when you do that you see what they liked and once i saw what some of these people loved on amazon it completely neutralized them i lit tho though some of the one that you saw o catchy gave me two stars she says disappointing too much detail about people other than mail street and not enough about marly herself what did catchy a a cupcake stand that comes in lavender with picadors five stars and she just writes perfect what is to say you that she has a that she has enough cupcakes that she needs to arrange them on a cupcake stand in picadors and that makes her happy you do not my book cannot speak to that sort of u i let me let each other perfection to catchy is this cupcake stand filled with cupcakes from picadors and my book did not give her that same feeling and that is socket the reader had given one star a said about his book a at o words but not interesting give five stayed to bright had yarn the person who gave him the on word review ouzo gave five stars and a rave too a tin kazoo e person who said boring boring boring and also the author is consumed with his lofty vocabulary that the reader falls asleep give a bravery view to a book predicting the end of the world by twenty fifteen woman me windy give one star telling potential readers to move on what did she love of as the windy gave five stars two an amazon dot come e gift card which struck me as not why is anyone rating amazon gift cards on amazon it is to saying yes this twenty dollar bill is worth twenty dollars why rate this thing this thing could not possibly be good or bad a ah a o o a eve you done the flip side of this have you looked up the people who loved your book to see what else they love no i do not want to know anything more about them their angels will we have done that let me read some of them to you ah this is woman who gave you five out o five stars interesting she says this book was well written in very interesting marl's life has been full of interesting people in experiences and i enter learning more about her she also loved five out five stars the game of comes garden come throne for the throne room cracks me up every time i look at it as in my bathroom where my throne is and here is a picture of the gnome ye that's that is come ye she puss us in her bathroom it is in my bathroom her with she keeps this come in her bathroom and she gave it five oud of five stars and she also loved my book i see with you are saying it it does not it is not great if you do it the other way around get one more this person five out o five stars we chronicles for relationships on stage off giving us a clear unique portrait of a professional a also bought not one not two but three amazon gift cards yes the wish rate the she rated on five out of five stars do not tell me this she is one of the amazon gift cared people just by something by something that you a cup cake stand anything get a real thing and rate that ism stage why the way michael sees it the fact that every single thing on amazon every gift card garderobe every light boy ben you as bee cord and mop is measured against every book every classic film against every bit of journalism an fiction against the bible in the corn and the bogovod get all on the same five point scale it is perverse those things are different and of course these kinds of re views are everywhere i mean the way the world is now there is just constant feet back about everything when you take an user your ask to rate the uberdriver mean were just constantly leaving stars for thing is leaving customer reviews that there is yelp every one is constantly assessing everything that is true everything here for example is a review of the great wall of china one star too crowded too much climbing miss the greatness of it threat was a lot of steep climbing time the parthanot one star it us the big bunch of column that lack artistic tace the statue of liberty one star imagine a combination of prison and the worst report security if you want a feel embarrassed to be in america then you can find it here the bushtits concentration camp in pollen one star total disgrace there no places to rest in reflect for peace surely a sight the witness one of the largest mass murders in history deserves some space for reflection falling apart and not well maintain a to bye easy chico it we this america life from our glass today in our programmed in this world were now every one is a critic we visit places where reviews really should not be happening and the story of somebody who very much does not want o never review and someone else bigots to say no to all the reviewers and heaters of the most hated and worst reviewed thing made this past year and what that is say with us i gin their eyes were not watching god for some things it just reels wrong when they reviewed and i now just read you a bunch that but on her one more i know i do i get this when is for the national park at gettysburg one o the pivotal battle grounds in the civil war one from my army give three stars and wrote quote i guess it is a little moving when you think about freedom anal that stuff but really it is a field self i other think it feel strange to review or read reviews of churches one of our contributors b a parked or in this recently i had not been to church any church and over a year and it'd lost myself i was miserable a career was struggling relationships restrained little by little i could see myself fading and going to new church felt a last resort one of my room mate suggested a church that she ha been casually attending down the street first current the an baptistchurch the first sundae i went i noticed the line half a block long mostly of like people and cargo shorts waiting patiently behind a rot olde black man with church fliers in his hand could see i was confused he waved me to ward the front door and greeted me as if he were god's bouncer it is a big place an old moving theater bout two thousand seats marble floors ushers chandeliers i walked down the crowded isles and interrupt sitting next to an elderly woman dressed in her sundae bast with this broad brimmed regal had she mined me of my great ant louis when i slid into the pew she hugged me i then realized how much i needed that hug until my eyes stared to cheer up sis s its the service began with guided meditation and ended with communion and the choirs singing frank bevelyan mazes happy feels seven's arm b with the blood of christy i thought secular music looks of young black people i master and genes i found my owns there was only one problem above me and the far back of the balcony were torso the white people in line from outside hundreds of them snapping series and locking hovering gaggle of anthropologist studying black baptists in the natural habitat every expression of worship every tear i shed every hug i gave every arm i outstretched to god i felt this i was on display for them i felt expose they were baptisms some of the devout being baptized a overcome great odds what in particular got the holy spirit and sopped in the pool something unnamed and sacred had led them to that moment and all i could think about with the white people upstairs taking pictures of some one's life altering spiritual journey they could cheer them over brunch is really messing with my worship white tori is sitting black churches is a thing especially at garland showing up for free music it was my first time hearing about it but i had never experienced it before sure there were some white congregants sprinkle throughout downstairs but they are members for lacktabeter phrase they are voted to the cook out the horst in the balcony it just want a song i kept going to the church every sundae but i thought i was unwillingly participating and the gospel concert i struggled to focus somewhat matter to me most my own relationship with the big eye upstairs i was navigating all that my learned about the reviews honest critique the church were line it mi views on websites yell band trip adviser some were fine seem i love the experience and thanked the church for welcoming outsiders others were not nice vote the music was loud repetitive and vacua churches to elevate us to god not bring him to human leveling two stars from france this is a scam the children singing our circus animals one star from italy do not choose this place if you are expecting the gospel style of sister at one star and this one is meant to be a compliment that i bristle from spain i will definitely repeat this experience if i go back to new york do not be afraid to go to garland win your own the lot of white people lived there four stars our worship was being grated on a gentrified curves i got angry i do not the tourist but i do love the church it has the familiarity and the warmth that i grew up with but none of the conservative and tolerant baggage the kind that is hesitant to let women on deacon boards and had strict dress coats my old church was more insofar more of an old school black back to space big if you saw a white person during service tat required a whole quizzical discussion in the car tried home were they lost they some ones special friend f c b c had none of that and i found it liberating kept going to the church as on to make the best of it but it was not easy h one recent sundae at church engrossed in a fifteenth tradition of the blood will never lose its power i sway to the song it meditatively out the words with the chair over and over again i was losing myself and feeling god's presence but out of the corner of my eye i noticed it the glowing of phones in the dark the old european man with the healthy stick the back pack leading tourist stepping out before the sermon three or four at a time were we no iiiii wo y an o two o o being the visitors as the church instructs us to do during the welcome and immediately afterwards over forty five tours up and walked out before the sermon had even begun all i could think was the audacity ruined listen to the sermons i felt torn and distracted by the tourist at have to be there at all why do i care much i asked thou the contradance of having the tourist there ever made them feel uncomfortable if they thought it was a bit odd they ever got self conscious if it was only me one thought the tourist for fabulous i other said they did not think about it when woman said mi not wanting them there was blasphemes yet seems it was only me it was confusing yes i do not want the tourist there but what kind of christian a i to behaving when people doing a church survive went to head of the church my pastor pastor mike warren to ask why these tourist here why we liking is happen and how mi suppose to deal with it and see passed it why do you want the tourist it i soft know s anything not wanting tourist we welcome everyone i do not i do not new say who want this these people her i want those people wherever comes i celebrate and we open i know that church is that an say did they when allow tori or when they do make the tori pay it once on money the come in they will take the money right but for us i think every one here's a tourist and lit i see you i know the power the word and how the word can spread and how people can take what they here here and it got places your words well go to places it she will never go and that always look at it it is a opportunity to spread this word an to get the message oldy the doing and expand and broaden our rage and sometimes of people who expand and brought our rage happened t be tourist pas to mike also said my sensitivity about the tourist though he understands it its generational different than the older black congregants who perceive the tests of having essentially a section for white people and a more i iodic way that i do the see to tourist wo count we white in balcony cause they know listen not to know it us different cause history was flipped what that was the practise country for years after america has bitten balcony and not worship with white people because after america relegated balcony ad could not engage worse your experience he knows the tourist or not what everyone ants but what paste to mike wants me to know that the tourist aren't just in the balcony and there are not just white e says the balcony is for large groups of visitors and it just happened to be european he insists the largest number of tourists in the church are not white they are black they blended sitting down the mainfloor with all of us they puts i back to me is my problem with tourist or with white tourist it is white tourist he tells me do not be prejudice it is wrong and we start looking at people and to our spaces of worship and because is strange treating them and because the obviously strange because of the racial dimension then we under ourselves as followers of the teachings of jess and as people call ourselves christian and i know that but i cannot stop feeling expose it looks the way it looks white people staring down on us praising god the objects are all wrong is ti guess cause i feel i certain protectiveness because of the shared experience that we have as black people i to protectiveness o you we are intoxicated by perceptions an image and objects and objects communicate no substance the question is not what appears questions do i cere i question quite answers no i cannot be consume with people's perceptions of our space because they not be trying at could tell we do to to respond of people's perceptions i that is not who we call to be i cannot the objects of it me nothing to me past mi k knows what hit looks making white people sit in ha sectioned off aria he knows is provocketed he is fine with it is not intended to be punishment but that does not answer my question how do i black them out when i worship mi worship i engage god i could car who's a one person what two thousand i do not care whose present is about me in that moment's sacred space i doing the present others wo as celebrated god but that is the sacred moment for me and my sacred moment can not be intruded on my any body tors on not eras her mikes words helped a little ism aspiring to a new level of clarity in my worship well his but ism still working on myself ism not there yet i little on people there staring at us were all some source of entertainment for them but going forward i what a try to do what i can to get the tourists out of my mind and out of my way starting with this review of f c b c from me parked from baltimor white f c b c on sundae and then kept coming back holy when i really needed it and if you re a tourist reading this and wonder what the black congregants thinking you taking photos during baptisms and baby christenings after one do not love it please stop he'll make a great church better five stars be a parked in new york if you go go the first crinthian baptist church it'll take you to the website f c b c and why c with their videos of sermons a we speakers and assorts of other stuff think we are not going to i we their address mi i n i i i i i n coming up a story bat somebody who is studiously trying not to give a review think it is not too much to say that his very freedom depends on that that is an a minute from ciao pubigradio when er program continues is magician life mara glass tadspergram everyone is a critic talk from a world where everything gets rated and reviewed we'varrived deduct to of our show at two mister can goes to wooden sot's next her is but somebody who studiously trying not to be a critic cause of where he lives and what he is doing is name his can shows sure

center of the crone of iris epidemic when shows up looks around gathers in formation and post videos on line with the truth of what he is found which is risky because china of course is in authoritarian country with tight grip on in formation an total control over the media government's version of realities which reported in newspapers on t v and o wine inside china's hard to get foreign new sources which is why when when does all this he tries very hard not to be a critic not to venture an opinion reported why young fan has been watching is videos with fascination for a while now have been writing about china for years ism from there i never never seen anyone when this was not a professional reporter or political activist as far as i know he was just a guide from the mainland who read about the hon con protests an the state papers a wondered is that the whole story what is really happening and went to see for himself we shall we at i cento tutti such i she cut

his video sort of feel an extension of was speech competition bestead of talking and explaining things on a stage he is doling it out in the world a a i o o i o e o hi o i i a e in honking chess coverage is painstakingly neutral he goes to a prodemocracy protest and also to a probating rally at both he tries to estimate the crowd size and the age of the artisipence he spends one video explaining subtle differences between factions of the movement he no point is he hint in his own political stance in fact he emphasizes that he will not take aside which a lousy the penalty in the fossa he big he cellar done the title that pile that was a condole tip see saying i will try my best to put my prejudice aside and stay neutral about what i see this neutrality thing is i portent because a cross china most people support where at least go along with the party there scepticle of people who defy the government those people are seen as trouble make cars in dissidence thee regarded with suspicion and their ideas are easily dismissed when did not want to be dismissed but what is more he did not act a distant he does a state new paper as in aspiration for his trip and declares his loyalty to china watching him he seemed genuinely curious about the things he was witnessing and completely sincere you are gestural li on saw yet it cesinin join than comecolin the word

trees been silent ever since then he would given his social media passwords the french in case he disappeared one friend says that the police told his parents he would been put in a medical quarantine but people in quarantine are usually low to keep their phones and to stay in touch with people outside no one's heard from when it is been twenty two days when who tried strenuously to avoid becoming a political accident is now being treated one of everything that is happened to him i suspect what would pain the most is the side of his mother looking caused and afraid on video pleading for his return thong fan she is staff wit agree must love cats in anyway it was comforting that in these dark and device of times there was one thing that a fraction america could agree on this past year the move cats bast on the enderloyd we we musical what everybody agreed was that was trash fried called it quote i had digested hardball of amity quite said it quote always feels its two seconds away from turning into a sure orgy and a dumpster one of the producers on our programmed benin beset see found one of the very few people who felt differently than every living review are everywhere somebody love the film which actually can became a problem in her house son one of the many problems with cats it does not really have a plot but do e g disco it all makes perfect sense a bunch of cats known as helical cats are auditioning to be the cats selected in sort of this cultic ritual a to ascend to the heavy side layer and be reborn and the show is just cats auditioning one after the other to be the one selected they addition to die am is basically what they do everything about the film that alienated people the were s g i the clumsy writing the bazaar choreography mason to rouleau none of it alienates eh ay which honestly does not surprise me have no see a for years she is reporter at rolling stone she is always struck me as dodged some one who perpetually bears witness to the things other people do not really want o take seriously things that are widely misunderstood or a re understood differently i always want a know what is the other story here with cats it was very obvious from a second that i saw it this is goes o be everybody in a call us the wisdom the ever made but it is also just this very earnest this this sort of very simple earnest story about the importance of inclusion ripe the cats learnt a lesson about inclusion left that out do you think you are being a contrarian now ism telling you it is the same reason why musicals in general because it is a way for made a sort of access the parts of myself that are in sort of voted and cynicism and z are an automatically skeptical of everything in questioning everything gum it is just it is one of the ways that i can sort of experience the most earnest parts of myself i guess and when she saw cats that is how she responded to it earnestly she could not get it out of her hat the day after i saw cats my eye my husband was taking a shower and i wen n and i was i just need to talk to you about this sorry wile he is in the shoes you going to the bather mister magma cats yes i mean i was just talking at ham about cats i was just and then visit with as e d i look and here is what old ronomyes id an old my god they had they had even my gallon lacking up milk and i the end jury deny breaks the fourth wall and she says that cats is not a dog and i just need to tell you just because i do not know how to make sense it how often were you talking about it constantly constantly how often is she talking about it every day lot of the time this is panda's has band ale he looks grad career and the moves regracanearis the good guy also he looks really tired but he is kind we we after the first day or to it just it became clear that this was in new obsession and it was here to say an handed but make you feel i sorry for myself what are the kinds of things that she talks to about when she talks about wit this move things about the producers that i can even remember how much money drew lord weber madam how much more wealthy is the palmacartny which cool astounded me is that the kind thing we you in medilyg you do not care about any of this yes yes but was there period of time where you were humoring her elfrshir it would definitely try to change the topic play any other music that i could think of play other music because day started playing the film sound track for the only other member of the family their son solomon the three year old and solomon love dead loved in immediately and how often do you guys listen to it almost every day ale easily went from living a life blissfully free of cats to living in in all cats house hold all the time he will just come up to me an say and i want helical cats or i want rumpleteaser something that now i have to know what that means ale could not understand his life's love of this move which everyone else on the plant seem to love to hate days went by then weeks he definitely was i cannot her about this anywhere it and he has sin said multiple times that it it is berlin as life if alecdadn't what ta talk about cats any more each ay wanted to me a would partner she went somewhere else she announce then you plan in a tweet welt my husband could not listen to me talking about it any more ism doing a pod cats about the move musical cats it is called pod cats are you blind when you reborn can you see in the dark which chico hoses it with her freedman can you say of your life that it is worst in your bark if you were and you are with a target audience for pot cats wore its pretty yet it is kind of deeply embarrassing that people wite i gan a listen to the pod cats an be who is this woman when you say pod esteeming this america life both i primarily pod cats pod cats the pod cats we are also going to answer all of your burning questions about including but not limited to what is a helical catboat a helical cats cats cats cats cats cats cats cats chis it true that you told each day that cats as ruining your life bui've probably said that we gets little time to ourselves now we have a three year old and we both work crazy hours this is the way that you choose to spend your free time be going to see cats and in making a dog cast abut it like how can you make that your free time ale as he wont to talk to his wife about the thing that she lives which i gat except for one thing he is passing all this judgment but he is never actually seen the move i set it up for all three of us to go see cats at the one theatre within two hundred and thirty four miles that still playing it i silent we get to the theatre just after nine and takes three seats in the back e ja and ale next to each other ism next to ale i figure the theatre would be empty it was not all three of us take turns remarking on the surprisingly good turn out which including us totals nine it the on s led the norther pul in front of us are four tee waters snatched in their seats they laughing throughout the previous which makes me thinks they are probably stoned e ja notices tail people a or here for the film opens with a burlap sack tossed in an alley way which obviously is full of alley cats dozens of themcircle the disposed sack his saying also doing perhaps and just to be clear by cats i mean human adults with fur digital attached to their skin one of them rips open the still moving bag allowing whatever inside of it to break free and what it is inside of this bag also a cat oh nan t the cannot drag n look ism nock an upper ten cats isn't a train rack ale covers his mouth with his hand when he is hiding his abject horror but then about fifteen minutes into the move wen rebel willow start singing and dancing with the parade of cock roaches i realize something e ja and ale are normally at date for most of the move they hold hands ale kisses eye's palm three times which coincides with the number of times she calls something the best part of the move e cospasthe i think what makes us a good date has nothing to do with with their doing that instead with the fact f their doing it together when duty bench his old heteronomy shows a who by the way is for some reason wearing a fur coat a top her little coat of fur ale hums along with the rest of the cats who are there to welcome her because of course he knows the music it is been playing in his house non stop for months the move ends just before midnight e says they need to get halm back to their sun and cater we split a cab and i ask ale how he this move that to quote hin has ruined his life i likes it all more than i thought i would and why i liked whit to a mugging the railway cap imply shamble thinks she us its killed something you told me before we went in is that part of he really does think that ism e is contras being contrarian an liking his move and ism wondering if you sill you at wife do you sit feel that way no i i do not unfeeling think i kind of heaven understand i can just i can see how despite o beg horrible move you can genuinely appreciate it just can o feels good this kind of joyous better and ism kind of ye am meager to unpracticed with ye mod i think moonlit n a feel that if for a limited period dag that is probably true when move's end the lights are still dim the credits for all there is this moment it is just before people star genning up or every one's quiet it is waking up from a dream and then suddenly he check back into the reality of your own life i figure that is the moment ism catching ale and the lights have not totally gone back up yet this is not how he really feels but then a week later i get a necks from each a she says that last night while she and her son were listening to cats ale

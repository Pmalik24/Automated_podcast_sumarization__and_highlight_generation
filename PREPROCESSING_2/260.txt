when dais turning his life around in trying divert things and firing out what to do next one places he looked was to the coward's stern show i think there was a really good chores i know everybody is not fan of coward's stern but i am and i think that one of the best things about the show is that it is always been a place where people talk with this kind of brutal and funny honesty about themselves one of towards innovations is that he took the strain of crude dark confessional comedy that is always been a big part of stand up ever since wen my brush toward forget out he way to turn that into radio daily radio anyway to get back to his give he loved that about the show and in twenty fifteen he was a few months sober in his early forties working as a waiter t cat's belly in new york sit when he was younger he would worked in television posting an interview show for collage kids but ruined that career with a heroine diction now sober in recovery he needed a project he decided to a podcast about drugs with the feeling of the toward tern show he remember the years when commettionarty gangway on coward's stern definitely my favored coward's tern won milady would come on every day he would talk about his own drug problems he would tell crazy stories he would talk in the very real way about the mistakes he was making in his life at that time that he was not able t stop and have wanted to shoot for that he would callhost the show with the frank cross to he had met chis years before in behave there woad been towards in rehab smoking cigarettes and talking about the crazy things o the done on drugs that is what they wanted to podcast to be peopled come on tell wild drug stories and very important to have no re cover talk which have found to be sanctimonious and annoying this show is not as slowly about recover it is bet drugs they be eventually it will be we its this show is ever about recovery yet get somebody else in the put me o o gate cases is not clear in the recordings have is the one with the deeper voice in the loud opinions chis is the other god the show is about drug story is not about recovery it is not about doing the next rat thing it is not the last wrong thing the lady with the evolution of you recovery that is what the show will be notice ow at the another chis is not agree in hi day chis is ten years younger than have but started drugs in drinking at an earlier age he is just eleven or twelve and his anymore extreme stories about it putting a year in prison his alias pent way more time in rehab and at this point he would been sober for nearly two years firs his four months for day and all that gave him a different feeling about re cover and sobriety he was came to talk about it but have was at am it brits is not all that entertaining at first and foremost he wanted the podcast to be entertaining it i shows ago recovery sand ben la they tell drug stories was men to be good for you was mean to be fun hey listened in the comedy section of his tunes not self help if he once self help avid said go too meeting it will do not call the show war stories but there was already podcast called for stores was about nor actual war with tanks and guns and stole they came up with dopy with really captures the spirit of the show perfectly as chis put it two dopes talking about do listen i grateful to be sober an om grateful to be able to u talk about drug in in a way where ism not feeling bad about it you know is it is not even you for recall it is shut funny day get why we got along as we felt safe sort of doing that with each other times he had a feel little judge is people i you sort of recount funny stuff that is happened yet dozy the is can be no judge in the drug news past or present they recorded the first episode on a laptop no microphone or anything her a fish tank in waves apartment in men hat maybe yo could hear the hum of the tank an at e ring but between this episode episode one and episode one hundred forty three of dope just two and half years later there lives of going to changed drastically bapisoded one forty three dozy wit on completely different and the episodes i between the chronicle the story wish much happens to them and some others things lots of drug ears of face but because the to podcast an radio or intimate at all gets documented in the most filter way than chis one of there show to be just for fine but an end up being much more to day when i have a two stories this stories about a kind of am d i we radio a very different kind of the i i radio but in both stories its amateurs inventing how to talk about what it is that they are going through and really both stories are dispatches from two very different battlefields i knowtits on the little ground but but really by this story from the opioid epidemic and then the other stories from a small town in servo in the middle of the war that is going on there and we hear about life during that word in this way that is much more personal and coop than we usually gat from the bee as chico is this america my on our glass s say with us at one two dope kings oke remember the premise to eyes have and cries they have this podcast its called dope thin he chip us from our staff listen to dozens of hours of the podcast spending two and half years and tells the story of what happened quick working before we starts since his is the podcast internet version of our show we have removed the beeps that we use when we do the show in the radio if you prefer weed version of a show is sad our website and hers data even talking about this posts for five minutes already in thewhole point of the podcast is to tell crazy drop stories is get right to one this is from the very first episode christy tells the story i am i relapse a it one on say re last i just started using again after week period of abstinence and i took a lot of damned about sixty bars for those without of hours no period about three for days see to a hundred and towing on as over fort it yet and that blocked out for about a week and during that black out i robbed to ten narial i went into the vary clastic i told him my cab as having clears and i needed been o barbertall hay a p i they told me something was you no we do not just hand out medications for the asking please also paperwork an can we see your cat obviously i had no cat with me i did not have a cat at home i didn't a cat at home smuggle and on i fellow the paper work and am while is ting of the paper work and a putting it down and storming into the back knocked over the nurse in the even varying came into the medication saerytrm and tried to stop me am i got out the police came i struggled with the police and south them and got once o the salts in the police officers there was a hack for the seen it was big big a us say something about chis he is berlin chis is yearly six feet t he is one of these mastachanses croton white eyes is very big and broad and and i would be scared if chis got that i but on the gentle per very gent very gentle soul a lamb if chis is the lamb and a drop optic's closing have is the border colly convexly circling cross hurting him between drug stories nipping at his ankles there is boson a fen we you you invite all your face to friend to done no and the certain worcertain her which certain once you rent up to your room resist certain a a ran up to my room a for chis is raping habit was the flavor this laver is the milk inspired by momofroke h this facing b eyes e and of the work thees chis on the other hand comes he crosses is sweet also kind of do ho find settle ways to her day ala man mess a on episode fifteen it is as easy as the word tools a noodles non we don canoodles which have hates christart saying it at the end of every she noodles the tasaonbles they do very little editing except they do bleep out people's last names hey want the show to be anonymous which is why ism not using last names either by the way the they use non traditional bleeps this one dozy is not the kind of show you bring home to meet your parents davit christy swear a lot for one thing and obvious they their talking about heavy druggies it is not just that they can be insensitive and insulting too tit is not politically correct by design they use the kind of language you might forgive your grandfather for using but which is harder to stomach coming from a thirty or forty year old to day and then sometimes there is also language you would not forgive your grandfather for using ism not con play you that stuff on the first few episode of dope they run through most of their favorite drug stories how christy made wine from orange us at re had hat have once stayed up all night doing cop heroin and ecstasy before appearing on toward stern how christy shot christen mes while at a brain an duty clinic they're not suppose to be engaging in recovery talk tut of course the only reason dopy can exist is because davit chriserbles in recovery there would be no dopy without it recovery keeps slipping into the conversation even have does it we rashly in a hurry is hat i have to o cacti owns nans may the is a live at is toe dopes grass for rase on recovery samomeners trial e at just let get ocean fingabout of this best way to do it the christactually has a scholarly knowledge of twelvestep philosophy and now and ten he quotes by memory from the big book which is sort of the bible of alcoholics anonymous an the ad the pennies to the book we to we games o says it the ha mutual a sprees of the educational i that is whet you talking in exaction the beginning for the first twenty episodes or they get five hundred downed an episode barely an audience but they stared hearing from people right away they get their first animal from some guy name troy three weeks after they outward the first episode they cannot believe any one is listening to them they call their new found audient the dopy nation their people start emalighg leaving reviews on i tunes some listeners voice mills with their own lar stories they are downloads group i a tower they average about a thousand downed and episode ever the depredation is not say strong dopes there is a readmit thread about dope a few people even get dopy tattoos with the shows logo and the were noodles underneath it on guy takes stave chrisom to a stake dinner he tells them he did not get sober n till he start listening to their show davit christy try to write back to every meal they get they respond a comments on face book and twitter people are not turned off by the recovery talk they listening to sober guys having fun enjoying life and recovery they give them hope chis says the listener's come for the debauchery and say for the recovery he calls this marketing strategy rope ado heaven christnow they have a finite number of drug stories between the two of them they develop a roster of recurring guests friends of theirs who were also sober the rest celebrities robriner's son nick waves at fallen than then there is a guy name tot one of date's best friends from college they got addicted to heroine together and their twenties have always said of tod got sober he could be the third host of dopy an taut really wants to be on dopy but tat is never sober a e i give six months o bride time on jo ya he is down having serve since tat is getting back please he is going bad a what us give some to claim time you come to to i o ta a a a a a what we we i y ti you awe the us a a i i to dos one of the few recurring guests still actively using drugs his life is in shambles he is forty two and he cannot hold down a job he spends all his money on drops lives in his parents apartment in man rattan he often just watches deny does all day how you down to a that is chis talking to tod on episode fifty for o doit all right miserably miserable as at a related two wast substance of yes a a at i less an my live e on this episode tod tells a very dopy story about getting high on heroine who passed out in subway station and then slept through a meeting at the unemployment office the next dam got feel there is the end of the story the call drops and have says to the the for thin t ever a my i thought of is fun for a second and then i realize poor this in big trouble as a listener to me it seems tod has a specific purpose on dopy he is a caricature of how not to treat your diction an example that davit chis can hold up to their listeners and say do not do it this my when davit chis talk about recovery they often talk about abstinence in twelve step programs that is what work for them but the science shows that poor dedication is best treated with medications saboxone and methadone which are associated with ha sixty eight per cent decrease in death for a while on dopy have was pretty clear that he thought medications were dangerous that you should learn to live without any substances chis was more middle of the road waves opinions of change by now he feels whatever works best for you is what you should do less an y year to making dopy have moved out of the apartment with the fish tank and in with his partner kinda and their midyear old daughter chis eventually move to boson and started working towards the doctoral degree in psychology he was dating a me student named any they live together at a dob he was also working part time for his sisters company which helps people who are struggling with the diction another issues find treatment en he was working every other week end at a sober living house by episode ninety six of dopy they abetting about three thousand listeners a show they decide to relabel the show they move it from the comedy section on high tunes to the self help section mainly because they thought they could compete better against their self help podcast rather than comedy outcasts but also because by now they have admitted to themselves they are in fact a self help show but anyway back to tot on dopy tod is the foil to the sober good life to their successes where he locks control davit chrisom exercise restraint where he is depressed they are content where he cannot hold down a job they are raising children getting advanced trees making a pod cast every week do something good for yourself tomorrow just do a just mot as do something one thing that we it all builds on each other i we at whatever i but i love you i ha i take for on tod i a i a i d butut is to is tad a to alow e o wit ingoing on what is o et on up said one twenty six last march gods on the show again this time though he sober he is been to detox and moved into a sober living house he refused a good to rehab sun davit chis arrange for him to move into the sober house where cries works in wester massachusetts son terribly just wake up ta a r out try house i turn tat frown upside downside this is the first really sober gallon dozy let us take he keep saying how nice it is to talk to tod when he sober he

is sad me tat ah he never guess it be sober and he never gets it be free never free e it is if you are out there and you think you can get away with it you might not you known a mean in you i should really fucking now that it can all in somehow after twenty years of heavy drug news avid never had a close friend die from an overdose tod as his first one it changes things for hand before he laugh at the work stories all these absurd situations and bad decisions that should kill you but did not he would had the upper hand but now he did not any more those things had killed one of his best friends day as a one who introduced christian tod they were not close friends but even still have thinks chis is a little cold about his dead and have noses is unfair but he fells a little resentful towards cries tod was in chrism's sober living facility right before he died why did not he look out for him better god's death last summer just happens to coincide with an up taken downloads on dopy

this sad on on soft be soon me ya a the worst thin that could have ever happen happened an ad chis we lapse in dad an harm along an my dads am one my croon plugged into the mixture chis over as three days after episode one forty two he would been secretly using drugs again probably for weeks after that last episode they reported together davit chis fought first chis put the show on line without bleeping out date's last name have was pissed he wanted an fixed it but inadvertently inserted ten minutes of silence into the middle of the episode which made chis mad that money their fighting over ten message all day have could not make sense of what was going on with chis he told chis it was fine if he did not want do dopy any more but chis said no that was not it at all he loved making dopy have believed him but meanwhile his was so fighting with any she left their apartment and went to stay with her parents chis was distraught crying he asked have to call in check in on him have called him after midnight and told him he check in again in the morning went to bed he woke up at six a m to a ten from any she sent it in the middle of the night asking have if he check on chis at six thirty have sent chis a ten message a minute later chis wrote back ism god is you to here i'msleeping but not totally god alive nothing to worry about we can talk later hat ten thirty any called have and told him that chis was dead in the next few days have had to decide if he was gin to do the show that week or ever again in the two an a half years of making dopy together they would never is a show de thought if he skipped this week he would be letting the dopy nation dow he be your drug dealer not showing up an besides drug users should know if somebody dies from a dug over less three days after chrism's death he recorded that episode of dopy and he called any a i your the your ha at you are no on the show a h a i i feeling a e er they start to piece together the mystery of chrism's death avid completely is red his behavior in rettresbact he was probably high in the last episode of dopy he was probably high when he made that we ad phone call to his sponsor he was probably even high on the army lying episode avid been operating off the wrong story that chis was not interested in dopy any more but any had not she had noticed the strange ways chis had been acting he kept taking the dog for walks for instance when the dog did not need go out he as staying up all night and sleeping during the day she got suspicious he was you in again she and chrism's sister arranged for surprise drug test on money a my showed up at their apartment and did a saliva test that night any told him she was going to stay with her parents chis left before her mamarrived to pick her up now she realized it was because he could nitwit any longer to get high any sleeted her parents house and went to work the next morning but soon after she went home to check on chis an i don't n yo a i a are o on a i w wat wain a a it a mi your a a to not you might as what i i a an a i er a a a a a i e an a a e there e are a a a a up o a a a a a bad i a were an o a i a at a mi a a a o a a a a gang an a a a a a a bat o ah i a bat i a a a a it ah at i ye a i i bat an my a a at i a o e et i one a a a a a had a e i a a ai w narc is a medication that can reverse an opioid over dose he sprayed up a person's nose and i a a a e a e i o tit i a a o i an a a e e e a do a a a women chis had cocaine canal alcohol and sentinel in his system he was thirty three years old soon after a packet derived for him at their apartment he was filled with drugs purcsette cocaine cracocane heroin any scoured the apartment in chrism's car she found a bunch of drug pair finally needles some of which were used and clean p he ordered on line also she found a small medicated patch that was not in any package she sent a picture of it a have they could not be sure that have thought it was probably retinal any is a theory about chrism's relapse he had recently injured himself doing a high corral kick to try to impress her something in his leg popped he was in terrible pain the doctor he saw was not his regular doctor and she thinks crisp pan killers fold himself into thinking he could just take them for the pain and stop there if nanny's theory is rate than chis started using again two weeks after god's best and was dead three weeks later i mean that when when the news came i i got angry about it and than the next morning i woke up and that and i felt the day at between the last time i had spoken to him and i mean i felt the distance and is it just felt it was becoming real and then this morning i woke up and i could hear his voice in my head we went we were doing this shell i could hear his voice and that and then i can woke up and it was another day since i had spoken to him and it just an it is it is liquid becoming solid an i mean in it start you move away from this liquid feeling to this cold solid truth that he is never get to come back and and it is over have hangs up with any i know his got at and this episode of dopy without chis for the first time just and et to a be always and will say a stay strong donation and tam i said i would never say this but a chis is dead it'll say turtles for chis and that we love you and that everybody out there please try to take care of yourself have still makes story by himself now he is pulling in bigger guests that the comedian mark moron and the rapper killer mike he gets about six thousand downloads and episode now this not the same show toy as the nectar knew it is gone along with chis it is not a body comedy any more it's more of a straight interview show there a few or wore stories and when there are the tone is different have is different this his one moment in episode one forty two the last episode day in christen together that i keep thinking about chis a displayed a voice tell from a listener name mike who tells a story about hiding his p in the closet of his bedroom important wide and afterwards they get into a conversation about whether it is okay o laugh at drug stories in the first episodes of dozy have was a solid ass on that how's the whole point of the shew but now they flip sides chis says yes it is fine to laugh and have says this i in it o but the o at an in my it ma may it might be be and in done ray i it out i i gat oi i de i e mike every one laughing a everything there down and then main is drat at but what tat be wat tit wat that morbid reality the hie of a o do i i it many tin e year i won i tin a it it e there but mi it man laughing on the drain at an thing the piggy dray i be morbid reality that a horse a i ta at u know we laugh on the train tract but we have the right to laugh on the are fact it be much hippie it moon at never struggle in the trust is that when we were struggling the person who up toll story that pul terrify in laugh at it might have a better chant at reaching out

in i tat no everywhere and killing everybody that not ta o t a now of course sol have told me he always thought dozy was good for him in chis for their sobriety he thought their creation would protect them but it did not chis is gone dozy it turns out was its own worse story playing out week by week now on the show date's mission his changed the dug stories are not just in service of a laugh now there in service of an urgent message you could died tod died chis died you could die thenachevis is one of the proves of our shew the dozy podcast an you can find in wherever you get your podcast coming out what happens when you go on the radio and make fun of a militant isles group who also happened to run your town because you are in servo that is an minute imago bublagradio went our prom continues to smack to life from my r glass he tree on a program of crime which whose e theme bring you different kinds of stories on that theme to day show wore time radio people in battle fields of one kind or another using very and de i why grasp rules level radio or podcasting to try to make sense of what is happening around them we have arrived o a two of our program act two did morning saffron bell back my twenty as a volunteer reporter at a community ratio station an washing in d c a p f w a great station that really did reflect the community a decay was two thirds african medical back than and and also hat emigrants from all over the world and the most pop u wisher in the station i member was the mama hour was going jury washington whowould places and talk a at about his knees there were carabin central medical shows hit was a show made by agrarians who missed the former shaw of ram and then another show with a radiant who hated the former show of a ram there's a coin poetry show listen is wo calling and read the on pass and it was daily this was a daily call poetry show that in my memory anyway never seem to have any kind of trouble getting course that is commune radio wit this nextoryis about somebody sitting up a station that a community station only the doing it in a worzown in syria in small town called cafranbell that is cafranbells spelled with say in the north west part of the country not far from the furnish border rural town signed by all of trees in fig trees they thousand people wire there i promised eight years now a caframbos ben in a kind of no man's land where it different factions afar and now militant idleness are in charge repute a can a ballute i heard about the station years before she ever listened to it i crossed paths with the founder of the station bachwhen i was covering the warren syria for the waste journal his name is had had fades he lives in cafdanben we never met in person i was based across the border and lebanon because america press was mostly not allowed in syria but when the regime struck a town near cafdanbid or sis was advancing and i needed to know the details from the ground we in my colleagues would pull out our giants spread she of contact and go through them rides was one of those names id slype him to confirm a death counts or verify a location then move on rides was an activist before the radio station he was sort of famous for these banners these home made signs written in big block letters on white sheets he would bring them to protests post pictures of them on casebook and twitter i always saw them in my feels they were witty this one from thanksgiving a holiday syria does not celebrates black fridge special offer whoever wherever you are bring your enemy and come to fight in syria for free limits ad time offer one of the most viral of these was after clan gene announced her new name batman spells with ha sea and not a say the other woman's names in her family rides gave her this shout you wasteland he writes spelling it with a sea we would write catenoid with a sea if it went you we could be free i knew rides had his own radio station radio fresh though i never tunes in back then but around thanksgiving last year i heard rads had been killed that me harder than i expected saddened by the news i listened for the first time you can stream radio fresh on son cloud there is hours and hours of programming listening through was reliving the war from the inside seeing it in a totally different way from deep in the small town was incredibly alive viper local sometimes utterly ordinary people complaining about their neighbors but other times radical i could not believe they got away with it here is an example of that one of the first things i heard the satire program called coed did at es back stage with the president where an actor an personating president be shaded assail has made up conversations with an officer in his army bad for sh the futon syrup even gosiesiv o oo o o labia what i a o woman are o the were the de e we that theater making fun of the president slip which is very pronounce here pretty soon all e the to to e the a o before the e for e be e i was shocked when i first heard this impression my newer reaction was o my god how did you not go to jail for this because in the pas that is what would have happens before re listening to radio fresh i had literally heard of two other places in the whole air world where any one had tried to do political satire one was lebanon wramfrom and the other egypt where for a while told the government ran ham out of the country they had their own version of john star and now there were these guys out of a small town in northern servo it completely blew my minds i talked to a bench of rads friends an kafenben they told me he was always a rebel before the uprising against the serin regime he would curse the president and away no one else dared he mocked religious figures too his cousin told me this always made peoples super nervous every one in town knew him as the guy who got kicked out of met scold trades was a burly guy in his mid forties clean shaven warm eyes mischievous face he was sharp taught himself english ran thriving small business one of his best friends radial deal told me how had started the radio station be gan i is the do a the orca whatsits in almost they have that speakers these are the speakers for the call to prayer five times a day at one points early in the war the syria military showed up in kaftenben and started shooting protestors rides wanted to get those soldiers to the felt he loaded up a bunch of recordings on a us pes stick and had some friends at the mosque blast them over those speakers anti regime slogans and is on you parcadion is on on that in con the is he mistaking you is he is using you is hemiskilling yo family then notes he everybody is seining his the how be la a to the tot o a the the take ago to the and that yes from you and that was why my emitting himself to moscolmy why do not he start a radio station were could to just take to people on in i e a to you shortly after when had found himself meeting with international groups including the we state department he pitched them his idea for a radio station there are always opportunities in war and this one would be an unusual chance to push back on the rules make fun of people they could have never made fun of before and opportunity to blast out ideas free speech d democracy to whoevortuned in to ninety pink i to that that o nohow a an e than omen we es be in i san since on who e i toot ma gin e foin as on e this is a clip from the station's first few weeks on her august twenty thirteen radio fresh was based out of an old government

what with you lav i he you a we u as you us e e must the saying in the beginning there was a lot of talk about how the money for the radio would have been better spent on aid for families in need people were hungry they don't have clean water or electricity it seemed extravagance and frivolous to spend money on a radio so but prettyerly on the station came up with a program that became indispensable throughout the village it was called the observatory radio fresh put twenty four seven watchmen and tall buildings to keep an eye out for air strikes as soon as they saw one they radioed into the station which would interrupt programming on say the nutritional benefits of letter then w a we a blown and the have a ma y on adage why am not with an air rate sirinupsid best tat tan was a

as ta ha a chaos we have the begin beg he saying if these restrike warning saves even one life that would be worth the whole cost of the station before the observatory people used to jerry rag their own version of the alert system buying a walk talky and eavesdropping on the regimes frequencies it was expensive over a hundred dollars and parents hated how much the regime thugs would swear and cuss on the frequency they did not that the kids overheard the observatory was a clean version for the cost of a basic radio five dollars the tirade warnings they were just one of a she of superpractical you live in a warison and hears how to survive kind of programs there is a medical show that teachers people how to administer firsts or that show has episodes on chemical burns men in did us and kids how to treat head injuries and that is to bet would would wiser see i don duma or undevahol makes here the hostess saying when you think your scold is broken and when you see blood or

what i love about these programs is how the people teaching the language are actually not at all fluent in the language their teaching but you can hear how hard their trying thelinas we conto day an so of tax english every one i talk to about radio fresh brought up this one program called the complaints show it was radio freshen version of a collins show except they mustn't actually have a collins show because the regime had cut off all the phone lines they put up a bunch of little black boxes with a radio fresh sticker on them all around town people would drop in slips of paper with their answers to quit shows their comments and complaints the host would choose one complaint ice week to talk about aboard become the a mamas shako often it is very specific stuff at one points early on a faction set up shop inside a school building using it as ha police station parents were worried about sending their kits to school in a building shared with criminals and feevesplus the police

emiitan security people complained about the price and equal y of their bread some one brought up their neighbor using a hole in the front yard as a bathroom while his actual bathroom was broken the neighbor heard the episode and fixed his toilet when i first heard the complains show it felt pretty familiar we had a similar programmed in legend although not quite a small town as the neighbors toilet but listening hour after hour would i realize was that this complaints show was doing something besides solving practical local problems it was also spreading a revolutionary idea that you could voicour concerns and hold people accountable and get results the guys at the station confirms this was at s original mission for the show this in a place where the rules were recently non negochabl and who just had to keep your head down and do with it the complaints she was just one of the many programmed debates kits shows a series on thenar doing this kind of work one problem people had with the station from the beginning was the it was funded by the america which in the middle of a war where the guess was not being particularly helpful was not a good look it is true almost all the money for the station has come from the estate departments it is around forty thousand dollars a month these days which covers the salaries of fifty three people it is a pretty big operation when listeners accuse the station of being a mouthpiece for the america had was happy to address at head on this is him on the a ale debus he the a be mad you son sone she betas let i gin of became mum i o won wiggles of imagine he says the response is very simple have you heard anything on radio fresh that sounds were supporting the america we are always trying to prod them on the radio with our banners we have opinions about them and we do not hide them rides vision of democracy meant every one in caffrenbid had an equal saying what was happening including women he wanted their voices on the radio to although that was such a daring idea for cafrenbid even his friend had wondered whether it was possible let them look not a caw all den ye must as a a easily fine women we hide in we train this was bold because almost no women in the village worked outside the home they took care of the kids and the homes that was it under was bold because of who was running caffrenbid at the time had

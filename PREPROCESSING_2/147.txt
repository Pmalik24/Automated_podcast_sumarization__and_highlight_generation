minute review of the filming which i went through it point by point take by ha terrible the film is and it is truly awful if you want to know how bad it is just listen to the sundae episode of this show that we released this week in which i go through pretty much all the aspects of the move that are particularly bad and a lot o the refvyours knew that it was bad going in you could see it in the

and has height parties therefore it is wonderful i do this review i put out this tweet and everybody loses their mine i me loss their mine there articles about my review of this move in sources as diverse as newsreel noisy news the daily beast a everyone is covering the fact that i did not this moving that i made a video in which i periodically of and timer bar the barber materials i take like a match and i the barber stuff on fire and this apparently is terrible how no no it cant be the reaction to me burning a barber car with bargeman candidate is the reaction of the atomic world when some one burns a moron in sweden it is totally crazy i do noting it a us wow an there is an article in envy we enemy news bacon the intranet its roosting benshippero for hate watching barber well

par of genes and an a black shirt when i go out yet it at in any case ends ne says polarizing conservative commentator bench paper hated barber much he erred his complaints in a forty three minute revisit review which included an edition himself setting fire to barber dells in protest but the internet has been flaming so pure instead my favorite thing is when they declare the internet sike when they say history has judged the internet the entire internecties did that i been sure ninety eight persentof the internet is people watching porn right now but the entire internet is very very upset

promise you it is way more than we spend to go by those barbs and so matches and a barbie you i promise you and and then people re t atwertreats of bench thopuro is forty years old right ism i may admit what thirty nine ism a thirty nine year old dud with a very very popular show who reviewed a cultural phenomenon that is barber en unlike all of these single women with wine and cats who went and loved this move i have four children ya i have a very full and product give life and took time out my busy schedule to watch this two hour leap show and it was bad was upset that it'd spent two hours watching a very bad move that has been told we have been told is the greatest movie all time the daily beast of this to the daily beast has an entire article mesh pure roasted roasted but the real question i have were and that this is a serious question and actually have some fairly serious ranvications is why the outrage over me not liking the film ism just confused is i understand the we were ought everybody on left has this face tattoo sin from nonsense where you put something out that is wildly culturally controversial barber was i said in their you baby is hay move that was marketed to children it is a move that though it is peachy thirteen was clearly marketed at moms in their eight year old girls us who plays with barbs eight year old girls i know bees have a nine years girl its o it was clearly market at that cup and then who's a bat and switch because the entire move is a heinous die a try about the evils of the modern patriarchy and they do this they they they man stream they main line in a bunch of left wing social gobbled gook into a move that is supposed to be sort of a fun from through barbeyville and then when you notice they get very upset that is the face tattoo see from that eve talked about a thousand times on the show y when you going to startups the some weirdo wit the face tattoo hen you look at them the what do you look in at lo ye

additional fifty percents off your first month because again haul care about you and do not mayor god's pure talk dot come slash shipper to get started to at o say what exactly happening here it'll get to understand yet t understand that great earwig is now representing of an actual religious world vie when i made the cut kind of corky comparison between the reaction to me burning the barber dolls in this re view and flaming the move and the reaction to fund mentalists muscles over the burning of a turn it it is not all that frivolous comparison there is an actual religious world view that cannot be attacked and if you a tack that religious world youth you say that religious world you is bad and wrong hen this means that you are a heretic and you must be punished is a really serious undertones to lot o this of human i actually got an de threats over the barber ism not getting you there people on twitter we are literally treating out about can we do something about the ship unlike over a baby move an yo hove to wonder why well the answer is because there is an ideology it is the ideology of the sexual revolution tat has been primula gated by the social left in this country and it lies at the censor of everything they think everything they feel and if you question it then you must atone you must you must be brought to heel punish inquisition style it really is fascinating that ideology places at the center off human life the the sense of self identity that cannot be abridged by anyone else if you say for example that mom in should have children that they should get married that men should get married that men should have children if you say that the height of human aspiration is not in fact sexual pleasure or on n what individualistic pursuit of subjective success tat actually there things you should do in this life that are higher and better if you do that that is a violation of the agreement that we all have which is to place at the center of our being an narsicistic view of self ah how do i know this because greater says and this is the reason the gretagerwig is now relied figure for left i mean truly now ta worship an an allternolic that show bring her sacrifices or something that but in the sense that if you violin the idolatry of gretegerwig if you if you say the gretagerwig is an operated director and an operated writer and that her ideology is false and does not ring true and that it is not even cohesive that if you watched the baby move one the great ironies the baby movies there is a deep unhappiness that floes throughout it why because the very beginning of the film is p is is little girls discarding dolls that teach them motherhood for dolls hat a about consumerism andthn the entire movies about all the unhappiness that results there from hem and then the very end of the move is baby actively embracing the parts of her that allow her to be a mother and that there is this keno bear undertone of greater rig's own unhappiness with her life and gretagerwig's actual view of what it means to be a happy woman in to day's life gretagerwig has a religious world view and me she truly does and she talks about it it is not me tong thaw this gretagerwig the director and writer the film talking about it gretagerwig did not interview with vogue in which she talked about writing baby and she takes about to writing this film with no abomback here's e long time at romantic partner they they there not married they belie hey her complicates together and due and she said that before she made the move she wrote an abstract poem about baby she she would not read the poem to vogue but she compared it to the apostles creed it is her language not mine the apostles great of course for those in familiar with christian doctrine is at in affirmation of certain quart christian beliefs it is been part of christian liturgy for centuries at this point gerbil apparently wrote her own version of the apostle's creed but about baby and she is sh written apostles creed but about baby not only that apparently she saw the the baby move as a way of rebutting certain presumptions about the bible itself for example the vogue article points out a biblical parallel with baby according to slash film tat come it is notable the barber was invented nineteen fifty nine but her boron ken was not invented until nineteen sixty and the film itself neater narrator heller mean points out the barber has the great day everyday but can only has a good day of baby looks at him it would see that ken was begat of baby created specifically to be her companion and worshipper girlie draws a direct parallel or perpendicular to the book of genetic mikvot ken was invented after baby to burnish baby's position in our eyes and in the world that kind of creationmith is the opposite of the creationmith in genesis again there is there's something that is deeper than mure sort of cultural stupidity happening here and that is the great girlie is channelling a reverse biblical morality into a moveyou baby that is directed it children that is the thing that has happening here andyou are not most to notice that and if you do notice that it makes you bad because this is in fact i religious impulse modern society has got rid of the saints modern society has got rid of gedocriscian traditional values or to mean them as completely superfluous in fact entire barber move is about our relationships between men and mom women and men are actually stupid and i possible and fraught with tension and basically separation is the only separate but equal is the only way to do a proper barbeyland in the in the bazar barber world that has been created by gredagurwig and know a comeback her long time romantic partner comeback of course is also famous for having written a a marriage story which is bout too absolutely self absorbed incur sadistic people when not getting divorce betas they want to pursue their petty careers in new york and hollywood and hey do not give it a damn about their kid i you these these are people both thing drink deeply from the well of sort of secular humans leftism and that is and idolatrous world view in not itself but it to man's that you be part of the idolatry and you say no actually the morality they're promulgating is stupid and count her productive an the when you primal get it to kidsactually bad when you say that sort of stuffy you have violated religious precept people are treating this as tough you've violated religious scruple because you have and there is they are lot of boilers in yesterdays review of barber the week ends review a barber but there is one speech that america for era makes in the barber move that basically is the apostles creed of feminism and it is spill right out there in the middle of the movies not goose hiding the ball here there is no subtlety to this movie being hit in the head with a sledgehammer repeatedly with the nostrums of thruway feminism america former gets up one point in the move an she says this i found the exact quote quote it is literally impossible to be a woman you are beautiful and sosmarche is talking to barber at this point and it kills me you do not think you are good enough we have to always be extraordinary but somehow we are always doing it wrong you have to be thin but not tooth and you can never say you want to be thin but you also have to say you want o be healthy but all you have to be thin you have to you have to have money it you cannot ask for money because that is crass getting now none of this is true by the way they're women of all shapes and time is who live happy marriages we have happy lives the notion that that women cannot ask for money because that is are you have to be a boss but you cannot be mean you have to you have to lead but you cannot squash other people's ideas you are suppose to love being mother but also do not talk about your kids all the daytime by thegwai'm not your who whose this is describing every to my now talks feather gets all the time is whats wonderful you have to be a career woman but always be looking out for other people you have to answer for man's bad behavior which is insane but if you point out out you are accused of complaining you are supposed to stay pretty for men but not pretty you tempt them too much or that you threaten other women because you are always suppostobe part of a sisterhood but always stand out in always be grateful but never forget that systems rigs toll find a way to acknowledge that but always be grateful you have to never get old never be role never show off never be selfish never fall town never fail never show fear never get out of line it is too hard it is too contradictory and nobody gives you a metal or says thank you and it turns out in fact not only are you doing everything wrong but also everything it is your fault ism tired of watching myself an every other single other woman tie herself in to bottle people will us and if all of that is also true for at all just representing woman then i do not even know that is it that is the the apostles creed apparently that a peers in the middle of the film i mean mercer for a lit literal says this hair's a hero shot of her an upshot of her doing all of this an cargo lobby looking on adoringly as she says all these ridiculous silly things that is impossible to be woman in modern society yet bribing your grandmother seriously bribing your grandmother operation without a washing machine with six kids in nor home worship it is it is her shop to makes sure that everything runs on time yet you you are real victim but it is it but this the whole thing the whole thing is that if you violate these religious scruples i people think on the left that they live without religion they do not they have a religion their religion is second let left ism and the apostle's creed of it is the apostles creed of the sexual revolution and if you cross them they become just as angry as any other inquisition the compost is upset if you trigger them by pointing the stuff out they get extremely upset another they play it off all ye that ah mooch i cant believe you all you looks it when we make a review of a film that is for he threepence long and we put that entitle when pettesere we know were going over here when we set fire to baby's you know for the shock value of it and because it is funny we know we are doing the joke is the job you can pretend not to get the job whore can just be offended by it which is really what's happening here have a question for you why you's upset just wives it i do not to move you tho move o we we have those differences why ours upset what it is make what is getting your goat much i understand why ism upset when ism upset about is the lie ism ma set the you created ta move tat is specifically designated for little girls you see it and then what you decided to do sliding a bunch of left wing image re and propaganda atom how terrible little girls haven't the united states i thing that is awful thinks an awful thing to do i her see limit the hundred sins white europeset your move are a crapper money over the we gan this moving made a hundred sixty million dollars over the we gan it blew the does off the box office opening we can now i don't not can have the kind of rape business that that it is on one to have anythings can having foreign businessbut that's a different story what you sups about one person who you already did a growth politically did not the film and yet you are upset why sit ever cured you because your more religious than i ham ism h when your where in the funny little had that has tings my believe in god but you guise are wearing your baby shirts in adaptation to your idolatry of a sexual revolution moment that is played out and is rift with deep unhappiness that you re fuse to acknowledge once for can externalize that in to i cannot believe somebody say something bad must protect the precious that is what is happening here it is a form o idolatry and it's amusing to watch i is try to spend it away in the you hear people on the left say things my kid is not on to pick up on all this message in o but what do i care you now it is it is subtle an it is first fault it is not'suttle at all and there certain movies where things will just fly right over gets has i know i have four of them now there there certain things where your watching n your the job kit is maybe does not hit maids there is no subtlety to the film at all i mean it is right in your face there is literal my speech about it there multiple speeches about it in that same scene there's a line in which in which baby sad either you have to be weird and terrible or you have to be ignorance essentially an those your choices in life out have to pretend that everything is fine or you've to be weird and terrible weird baby and weird baby who is played by tape my kennel who no is a is playing essentially let been baby i that it is hurt specious nods knowingly that this loves not subtle does this have an effect on on little girls sure any move that tells kids that if they have a particular situation in life that they are there for bound to be put and harmed a patriarchy that is not good for kids and it was specifically directed at kids and it is amazing to me that studio bossing mate decided to hand over e billion dollar property to great earwig who is an idea logical warrior of behalf of the second were left as nonsense anna and then we are supposed to pretend that means nothing get i andiron am upset ice dourer sow i rope set that ism upset and well what it what use upset about what is getting your goat here maybe it is that if somebody crosses your apostles creed this makes the maheredac and the heretics must be burn and just sandals thing b another heretic there attempting to burn first you may have seen the so of innovation recon toward

cultural news of the a mason alien continues to be ripped to up an down for the great crime of crating a song were he says that in a small town people do not tend to stand for riots this apparently is incredibly bad the media have been on him for a week about this an mason alpine is doing the thing that you must never do he is re fusing to apologize good for him over the week and mason alien did a concert in which he blamed the b as of people attacking him over this good for him wait a good for him good for him hes again he violated the thing that you are not supposed to say which is that may be small town community life has something going for it whet your suppose to believes that cosmopolitan values left doing social values that come from new york or san francisco ore a that these are the things that are supposed to govern everyday life that their view of the universe ought to be your view of the universe and if you say went hold up a second i actually think that people very often live a better more fulfilling lives an small communities with community to hesivenest that is a thing the you are not supposed to say at all and you are certainly supposed to apologize if you say and just now dean is not doing that and they came after him the tried to trump up a charge that he is races that of course is not true and he rebutted it and he said no good for him but this is what the left is is into these days if you violate their precept they just lie about due that is their thing now is the they just truth is of no consequence the only thing that matters is the agenda a gender sober alias for these folks you can see this in the current controversy over the florid curriculum with regard to african america black history if you look at the black history corricuon in the state of florid it was written by a couple of black scholars and the curriculum there is nothing long with it have looked at its joker toll pages long it is it is basically a series of guys lines and a couple of the guy lines thou controversial as one side that slaves some times developed skills that they could use for themselves and this was red falsely by comment arris on the rest a left to suggest that in florid peopleare being taught that slavery is good that is absurd literally what the curriculum says is that slaves took advantage of even the worst situations in order to better themselves which is about the merit of the people who are being held in bondage not about the greatness of slavery that is stupid in fact doctor willing b allay who's and when h black scholars wrote this he explain the agenda here it was there ears said that slavery with ban visual to african what was sad and anyone who eats this else this with cate it is the case that africa to re solo religion and a taken and were able to develop skills and attitude reserved to there both clean slave and act statement you would say that you are get you are standing by these standards am even though the bast president is very for most yesterday am i will repeat to is to the candy an a notion otiose than certainly willing to stand behind the work of my embers in tassporse and the stand behind the donated cases i have then of course of the standards i am quite continent in there the limit an istoricof across and there motivations into the metro are just glossing right over this from the most art in order to prompt in or to prop up the lies that come arris is telling and again comely arris is lies or directed against to cantus and the reason that coma arris is telling lies against to mantis is because as of one knows there is that quite a a decent possibility that there is some extraneous events in the election of twang twenty pouring comely garrisons up the top thedaget triton does not look good he looks he is clapping in on himself and whit that means if he is not healthy enough to run is that comely arris becomes that fact of democratic hominy if that happens she thinks she may have run against to cantus and she is been trumping up this garbage the de mantis is some sort of cruel vicious races a last week should a whole speech claiming the blacks were of that black history was going to be taught in such a way that slavery was upheld as some sort of higher good in the stator floor which has ridiculous in a sort here is onto mantis responding those charges of the weekend in i did not do it and i was not involved in it a but i think a i think what they are doing is i think that they are probably gin to show a some of the folks that eventually parlay i you don't being a blacksmith into into doing things later later in life a but the reality is all of that is routed in whatever is factual they listed everything ow and if you have any questions about it just ask o the apartment of education you can talk about those folks but i mean these were scholars who put that together was not anything that was a that was done politically nagana this is not about the actual contents to the program hir'snoting long with content o the program the entire thing is a trumped up charge in the same way that the attacks on alpine a trumped up charge he attacks on ta san to s on race our trumped up charge that are design to uphold comely arris that is really what this is about about propping up arris who is deeply in popular with the america people because she is the least talent to politician of our generation or maybe any other bid campaign chair sand re gretchmen as she went on cannon with him costa and ladies find you somebody who loves you let toe macostale of ja costa and was generic richmon then blasted on to cantus for contain what attacking comely arris what your response to what for the governor to cantus had to say about this clearly factually i he is wrong slavery was an abomination and utterly evil an at had t seer redeeming quiet not link that of it further illustrates how far i this republican party in these candidates are going i to the right and to water an landed to extremeness an outer to get some port and i think that i governor i to cantus i his campaign has been floundering he is been looking for at mention and i think that he is i now i am bark on going as far to the right as he possibly can just to see if he can be the extremest cannily again they are trumping this up in order grafter to since that this one of thing you've to understand is that if you are seen is an enemy of the regime if you r seen is an enemy of the ideological receive again the charges will just be trumped up it does not even matter it doesn't even matter which brings us to the canary sixth indictment against a dona trump now as i said before doll trump when it came to the classic document stuff on a statutory level there is very little question that he probably violated the classic document statutes does that me show be rescue now and he here is the thing the are bee own the right to san the real reason or going after trump is because he violated your scruples not be us your actually afraid of violating the wall the thing that trump has done that offended you much he did by running in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen he is your best friend until then you are handing him me wards until then another you turned on him because he violated your religious precept while this is the perception of the right and they are not there not wrong again when you look at the contrast between the treatment of donate trump and the treatment of mobile which wren to get to an a second because there is now breaking news on the jo bison business corruption front which is warhorse than anything that trump has ben accused of were when when we organ get to that in just one sit when you see that double standard this is why people on the river

save to day o gate speaking of the donate trump incitement it is suggested that it is going t come down some time this week according to the wallstratrnal it is still unclear how soon trump will be invited but jack smith has has sent him a target letter apparently they did that on sundae jury sixteen token four days to say whether you a peace before the gran jury granjuris have continued to here witnesses in recent days at could be this week it could be next it is unclear what exactly trump will be charged with here but according tote wallstraturnal person familiar with the target letters that at re verse to three statues that could be the basis for the prosecution conspiracy to defraud the government obstruction of an official proceeding and a civil rices violation that is offer used in voting fraud cases all three of these unless they have serious evidence of obstruction are really really really week conspiracy to defraud the government is usually tried to steal money from the actual government of the united states when comes to obstruction of an official proceeding you actually have to show the dona's trump called somebody up and told them that he would say bribe them to change their testimony a civil rice violation used in voting fraud cases is typically i stop you from voting or i actually falsified balls and shoved them in ballboy it is not me saying something about a vote that i didn't particularly according t the wallstrturnal trump could be target with the least one of s yous statutes pass following the civil war and originally signed to prosecute conspiracies to keep new we freed black people from voting but he did not keep anybody from voting again is can be very difficult to see how that works when it comes to the conspiracy to defraud the government again that that particular statue was chiefly written to stop people from stealing money from the government the probably written statue prohibits agreement to obstruct a lawful function of the government by deceitful or dishonest means one federal judge had suggested from violated up ut again it is her have never seen it interpreted in this particular way on a practical level and when comes to obstruction of of a official proceeding again they are going to have to prove that trump essentially try to bribe somebody it is pretty clear a this point the same people went after trump on everything else all of the all f the false take russhob garbage all those same people are very very excited about this including of course madam chef here is atishoo tatthefected adamshift is still treated as a sort of a person worth talking to over on emisonbes he demonstrates the full corruption of the media concerning that to like for four long years about having the smoking gun n his back pocket showing the trump was actually a paten cat's paw here is a adamscheff i think he sis an most ss charges said he track is yet yet the the the scrangeror i treader i ay o the mar limo dickens case was a the torose very is iris serious lovely the multiple u this is trad ta count to new york officers to this is a as sensibly as tat charges revolving or outs that prison mesial transfer power the victim has the charge imagine a press than ay in all in work serious is conduct he is tiresome he is tiresome and this is the game right that the game from the left is it does not matter what you charge trump with yet a charge him with something and then of course if we do that then if you get is defend true from even spurious charges this means they are bad that the gall of people unlock is to junsocculver an emsemesy she says maybe this campaign is going to turn into keeping trump out o prison well i mean you are ones trying to put him in if it does thou's be on you not on anybody else am confused on an cotton on re publican saying the eruption go to prison when you are the one's literally trying to putrid in prison no washing to pop published a pace that realest ta to to ma about how enter twine the of times sampan has the cow mic as leal the facts tatcorting the pace just over half of the money he rase last quarter wen to an affiliated pay that its footing has legal else the republican college contains ta red i of corse but if this campaign be coming increasingly about keeping him out of present at hosted even aloud for him to his much but money for is on local the fact it is it is it is all it is all again it feels a game it out i feels a game and the reason o feels hi he game also is because we now have some pretdamns good information that jobidon is really really

fresher on you frame and an ego to hunter and archer on nonmember second twenty fifteen one month before the speakerphone call pucarsky explicitly demanded they used their influence to close down the criminal investigation against beriszma this is inset by by the way this is the second hunter bison business partner whose testifies this another former business partner twenty babolinsky re calls hunter offering to get his dad on the phone during a meeting by the poet the schateo maroon in alien bablinsky says him also were of other biting family business associates confirming job would take phone calls from hunter in the middle of business meetings and would weigh inti a speakerphone in other words here it seems to be the that here is the way that this work the way that this words is that everybody knew that hunter was a go be tween for jo job get onto phone an save vague phrases and then hunter would spin that into an amazing amount o money for himself and for his family members which presumably he would then distribute to his dad now by the way the money doesnashaft to hit dad's bank account for hunter be spending money on his was expenses hunter could e covering house expenses hunter could be covering car expenses enter could e covering all that stuff and all jo hassium get on the whoever often and say very things i o my son hunter ago and an hntrybylike thanks dad hang up the fun turn to his friends of breeze best it dad's the vice present he will take care of it and then as i turns out jobidon did take care of it in a way that help bedesman you have here is the motive the means and the opportunity and the thing that actually happened hat'swhat you have here according to not one but two witnesses rite toning bobolink has already talks about this damn archer is now also talking about the remember that time than hunter hunt that jobidon said he had no knowledge of his sons business activities remember that and he was lying remember that cause he clearly is lying at this point and again all of that is coming at the same time as that other memo suggesting that's love cheeky told enough gain formal and twenty sixteen that e paid a ten million dollar bribe to join hunter widen to insure the choking was fired s love cheeky also e venereally claims have two requiring of conversations including bison and another fifteen recordings in solving

mel to hunter and bobolink join business partner names pillar outlined percentage equity in s is which pad a magician dollars t hunter bison with ten per cent held by h i be hunter for the big guy this is insane a by the way do i think all this gin o break wide open i do should thinks is all going to brink lit the meals its vested to to squashing and pretend none of its happening board have mason be sees all welsh just blowing off all the investigations they're waste of time according to alybelshi tax you thought of hearing with two press whistle lowers was can be tan you would be wrong that hearing quickly devolved when the cores woman barely tailor green displayed explicit photographs of hunter biding the committee this is the reality of the republican investigation into the called bison crime family it seemingly riddled with stunts and conspiracies another ass it of the hunter widen investigation enters around his business dealings with the you cranial national gas company called melisma that little part is true hunter bison was on the board of melisma and jo bison did push you crane to remove its to prosecutor but that was because the prosecutor was seen as vatic logically corrupt by the international community of well lot of people are we in his categorically corrupt by the international committee including half of you crane ante join putting lot fresher on that did you this one just happy to benefit his son and you now have multiple sources where testifying to the relationships on bereezma hungering job yous can a plow all that away and all about donate trump in canary six were till doing thus he knows the president right now t of were talking about know who occupying the white house hunter you still walking run he wite house after pleading guilty to crimes amazing amazing stuff came meanwhile we are supposed to believe that the situation in israel is about to break into civil war the s all the headlines to day bet me explain was happening when benjamin it know who current coalition in israel took over it to right wing coalition it is second plusssome right wing settler parties plusses right wing religious parties the most for right win coalition that is that is ever been elected in israel they propose some changes to the israelejudiciary as have discuss before on the program these relyjudiciary does not work the america judiciary the america judiciary is there to interpret a written constitution there in written constitution in israel the judiciary in the mid nineteen nineties basically decided under the auspices of man into honor broch that they were going to simply weigh in on every debate and one of the tools they we going to use to do this is they would simply overturn any waw pass by the legislature in israel the they said was unreasonable now that sounds vague to you it is because it is wild and insane in vague it is literally the court o saying i not a law were throwing out it is con that unreasonable imagine if you had basically nine mouth water ginsburgs on supreme court and any time re publicans pass any law she just said unreasonable an thought out that is basically house working in israel there are the problems of the supreme certain israel including the fact that effectively the supreme court select its own successors sere can never be a political shift on the supreme sort when the new coalition came in to place they vow that they were going to remake the judiciary and there are several things they wanted to do one of those would be change how those judges are selected which has corrected make the more answerable to the legislature that was benisons at least for the moment because a protest the current pease that the that was just passed in israel by the caressed by themajority the caressed was just saying the judiciary still has the same out of power at ever had butt is not allowed to just throw out laws on the basis that they are unreasonable does that sound crazy you it unsound crazy dits seems pretty obvious you should not have a judiciary is not a legislatures and unelected body of people we are a pointed by their predecessors they should not have the power to simply say i do not a law therefore it is not a law that is what you normally all it a tutorship if you have a person who as unelected who sits there and said that basion any reason whatsoever i can simply sale a law until we are just not kin to do it that is effectively dictatorship it is effectivelyaditatorship pretty clearly what happened the cannesset the major the caress have tried to pass this after months of protest and after they would already water down her original proposal which was a lot more ground breaking they watered down to just this provision which is incredibly miles and the protest continued because a basely turn into a big party in thestreet to tellefeve and a lot of people in israel serve are enjoying the spent tackle of being able to shut down streets and the sort of enjoying the idea they can shut down the government and whatsit is turned into what is mort in to is the opposition in israel has effectively tried to grant a redo right two people who are against the elect the elected government of israel one of things that s happen is that israel has a sort of bazar military system where everybody is drafted but then their certain groups of people whore volunteer reserves it to particularly true in the air force son the air force their people o have to volunteer to come in once a week in order o keep up on their training in case of a war and then if there is an emergency they canal to be called back into curate the can be activated s the still part of the reserve but their volunteereservice they said we are not on to come in for our training unless the government backs off of this proposal and ten the re ten thousand volunteereservice we are we are not on to come in for our training unless the government backs off this proposal now imagine in the united states for a second that members of the military large numbers members the military simply said that if jo widen for example passes a law with congress not even a blades active words the law with congress we are not showing up for duty and not only that we are going to shut down all the streets and not only that the the major labor unions of the united states decide to shut down a malls all the schools everything unless the elected government of the united states stopped passing a law this would not look very democratic what it inf fact to look the opposite of democracy because democracy is where you actually elect the leadership and then the leadership that to pass things an if you do not that you have another election and believe you me sirens had lots elections five in the last four years they do elections lot over there since notion the the people's volts is never heard is not true they hae an election again every five seconds over there your bunch people in the streets claiming that they are standing and favor of democracy by obstructing the workings of the elected majority in the asset which is absurd and the the boycott of the military by members the militaries on unprecedented even going a the way back to if you if youknow lower of is rally history in two thousand six the is rally government under the auspices of arelcheron pushed forward a pull out from the gossip strip they are they are ten thousand or news living the northern end of the gossip strip and the chevron government decided they did not want yous living there and they handed it over tote calcimines an an up beautifully chomostic over but when they did that the called got that is engagement the are mass protest people did this they shut down the streets but no one said ism not going in for military duty that is a new thing and no one said indefinitely were gin to shut down the country that is also a new thing and there is a difference in civil disobedience and we shut down the country for weeks on end we shut down the malls we shut down the banks we shut down the schools imagine this happen in the united states would be utterly in democratic now the way the the rest covers this in the united states that the protestors are actually prodemocracy and saying that judges cannot simply strike things down on the basis of reasonableness that somehow now anti democratic which is totally crazy and if the current coalition in israel were to acquiesce to this if they were to say your protest mean that we will not pass a lawfrom now on then they obviously do not hae a government ant that point the protestors rum the government they could see we want a talcum another protestors go back out in the streets and the revers the reserves they were not serving and the you one nastily have an elected government in the state of israel they really really had to do this they'd have a choice at this point they try to bunch of compromises they offered everything there is been no budging no movement from the left the the the coalition i gain water down their own proposal over and over ad over and over and the left simply said no they are intransigent well this being used now as wedge by jobiton who wants to sort of attenuate connections between israel and the united states jo bine is now using this as a wedge thou's are tending that he standing with the s rally left by standing against judicial reform now again it is kind ofay ironic his jobinon's own party in the united states has proposed things packing the united states supreme court jo bit himself has said that the supreme court his undermine its own credibility here in the united states he would you rest power away from the supreme court you maybe member but in israel when they try to do that on much more solid ground to anti democratic it it's really about is hoiden is trying deliberately to under cut a lot of these strong ties between the state of israel and the united states he is abetted in this by idiots commas freedmen an incredibly stupid commentator whose only merit in commenting is apparently goes to form countries and he listens to a taxi driver every homes foreman colonies i went to a i went to i went to iron i talk tor taxi driver apparently taxi drivers elect greatest source of information all over the world if ever user ends or taxi's and and go to automated driving homes free man will peal grade columnshas an entire peace however called only biding can save israel now with ism say is just a ridiculous statements sexing only biding can save france or only bide and can save the up name another country where somebody would save this kennigarbage it is just silly it is absolutely ridiculous homes freedmen who is a joke of a commentaries fifty years after the nineteen seventy threewar this jewfish democracy urgently needs another airlift to save it from being destroyed from the inside it urgently needs re supply of hard truths something only you can provide oh yes mobile has counprovide hard truths to the asrailies about how to run their internal business ridiculous supposedly he wants the secretary states secretary defends treasure secretary comers secretary secretary of agriculture everybody to call up nittinawho and let them know that if they pass a judicial reform that says that the judiciary count rapidly strike downloads for no reason at all that this will under mine the herd strategic interest in the idealist just to be clear this an administration that is currently trying to make common cause with the arannian of atlas where trying build a newcleor weapon and homes freed an it is encouraging the bide administration call up begin into whoa tell him that unless you do what i want you to do on the judiciary in internal matter that we are going to start cutting ties essentially credit that by the way i gain the idea t that israel bout to slide into the tutorship is just crap it is just not true but it is been promulgated by the left that because when you suggest that your opponents are about to actually enter into dictatorship easily justifies you doing pretty much anything up to an including apparently advising members of your own community to divest from banks and move their money out and get out of the military an clothe rest of the kenninonsense it is really really stupid the government had to do it they rely don't have a choice because once they are once once your government is basically down to your passing the law or you give up all control to protestors in the streets and to unelected powers i mean one of those things looking mworelike fashions to than the other and it is not the people who elected to a position to pass what is by any measure incredibly my old rebuke to the judiciary and by the like you nor this gormand in the judiciary apparently the the yet you are raped is the leader of the opposition he is already goes a file lawsuit a and he is gan go the judiciary and the is every shot the judiciary will strike down the wall as unreasonable an that is the stupidity of this there is every possibility that after all this is done the judiciary is going to step in and say well now that now that they have said we cannot rule on the bases of reasonableness we think that is unreasonable and hey just trike it down unbelievable oke time for a quick thing i and then some things that i hate things that i today melon musk it is apparent he has now changed the logo of twitter to acts i assume to to sort of unify his brands because of course he is am the space ex guide and twitter acts it is apparently going to now be a a more full sum immediate ego system which you'll good for him if he can find own monitsties that the be good because of course he is far more free speech than many of the other outlets e better out there his goal is to presumably start doing video streaming and to monetize all of that bring in house aught people are talking a little while ago about the threat that casebook was going to provide to a even threads to twitter because they pick up my ten million voters in the first week or something and i said at the time that is not a come because there just porting over everybody from histogram two threads and it turns out that as most situations i ways right rights is already losing it is a lure for users handing urgency for new features apparently data show user engagement has fallen seventy per cent as executives focus options a chronological feed the reason for that is of course it is not where the newspapers go if your newspaper he got twitter and musk knows that well now it appears the threat is tho going the other way twitter's can a star getting much more into the video business and that is going tothraten casebooks strangle whole on a lot of video entities and in short form video and all of the rest he'll be interesting s to what melon must us he is doing some see to the pants flying here but it is work form far a time for a couple of things that i hate hard something that i hate number one have absolute craft all over baby land and the baby move because it is bad and it and values are terrible and as have said gredigarwig is essentially an icon of social left wing thinking who better then to direct the chronicles of maria ism not kitting you according to entertainment weekly the barber director has now been tape to right hand's erect at least two films for netflics base on we us lots is novels she says i have no in start wrapping my arms round him ut ism properly scared of it which feels a god place to start i think when ism credits always good time maybe when i stopping s scaritill be ambition do that one no ism terrified of it it is extraordinary and it is exciting i ism just on to point out here that the chronicles of maria are heavily christian in content see us lewis of course one the great apologies for christiania of the twentieth century the chronicles of wanna are a very very finely failed retelling of the gospels and the line the which in the wardrobe is aslant is jess i mean there is clearly and everyone knows this i mean it is is that as those hidden in the same way that the subtext of baby is not subtext just text the subtext of thechroniclesof maria is not subtext it is just text well why would you take somebody who is apparent social ethos is ghyll left wing feminism and then hand that person the chronicles earring what is the see us lose estate doing what do they think they are doing by handing this over to great gerbil ones to godwits the caving spike we direct pride and prejudice but what are you doing that is not his ideology what didn't prejudice has him come interesting ideological perspectives spikcalea is not mirror those perspectives only holly wood would think well what if we took great gerbil and we handed her one of the great christian novels ever written forbids let us do that i very much look forward to learning that the white queen is victim of the patriarchy and that she actually who victimizes a child by oilmen and that is why she became cruel and which and the only way that she can truly be healed is by aslant sacrificing his own patriarchal nature on the alter she can be queen once again i look for to learn about that thing of perversion of a children entertainment the new snow white is going be an abomination how we knows can be an abomination whole first we have those pictures that showed that dome snow whites seven dwarfs are actually six large people normal size people and one little person a but now we actually have some verbiage from the a from the lady who is rachel' juggler who is playing snow white i get is kind of weird because the left is very big on the distinction wet on white and brown ay there there very big on this racially speaking and rachel' egger is of course diverse she is a person of diverse background because she is as tannic as have said before snow white is a story about a woman whose skin is as white as snow that is not racist it is just in the story in the same way the finochio is about a wood and all and if you make the dull out of a aluminum it is a kind of different story well ism i i i noticed that done now she is saying some things about what snow white is going to be that calling kenned the entire crew over at at the at dinner headquarters have decided and never again will they do a traditional fairy table because traditional fairy tells hare very often about boy's being heroes and girls falling in love with boys and that cannot be that cannot be it all no no more of this every main character will now be a female and every man character will ben empowered female hero who is a tickets lady anna and this is what reaches egger says you said you are bringing a modern age to it on say regimen better i just mean that it is no longer nineteen thirty seven me absolutely erotic so way and is tot in to give by the parents not in to be thin bit the prince once she is not on to be dreaming about true love she is a dreaming about becoming the leader she know she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless fair brave through and it is just the really incredible stay frothing young people everywhere to see themselves then wit is running for present an as a login i campaign another the is right the right running watching mi get it is all political it is all political why not why not take a piece of i pee an elect son no white first of all one f the great animated we pies ever and reck it you can do that also toucan take a fairy tale that has been disable that it has lasted for centuries and we will just destroy it we will make it the same female empower went story that every single dishy move has been for the last twenty years we will do that except more she is not dreaming of truth be because it girls by the way girls should definitely not dream of true love it be very very bad for girls to dream of true love instead what they have to dream o is being a single wine slashed cat lady at forty years old and maybe making partner at the big firm before realizing its relation should a role eggs that is what we can all aspire to be no more of the true love talk love bad now it is weird is it no matter how much you tell little girls that they shouldn't aspire to true love he still do and then when they do not find it and very unhappy ism sorry to break it to you but feminism has been a giant fail along these lines he natural orientation of woman he is too fine man and to settle down with man and to have children with man and he natural plantation man is to find woman and leave his father and mother and cleave to woman and have children and protect them ism sorry to break it too dis not et that this is the case and that no mater how many time to to to re engineer of the children it is going to fail it all fail not because they will not listen if they will but then they will be failures because they will have listened to bad advice she is dreaming about the leaders she knows she can be yes she too can be a girl blow snow white the try of girl blessing i think we can all very much look forward to the magic of single wine slashed cat lady and these six average sized people of diverse racial and sexual orientations plus one dwarf i know it'll be looking forward to that with with bated breath it'll be it will be phenomenal and ism trumping to review of it that you'll govirel because again you are to

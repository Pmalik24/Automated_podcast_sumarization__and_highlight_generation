town of thirty eight thousand on the western side mischgan right on the wite thesis decide the going to republic of this discovery busk his rob thinks if some day this officer puls over a black couple in does something horrible it is one i wish that he had said something was to warn people rob by the ways black manas mexico america officer andiron is white the post about it on face boy and pop up people come forward they say they have had troubling running with this officer in the past officer andiron is suspended on the police department investigates o a sow a last time on our show a bencalhon one of our editors producers here told the story of the thesis and we heard the testimony that officer andiron gave to police investigators about the whole thing and we heard from andiron's wife about how and why they got that csc application base heard from a former pastor named dukes stalling we do not a story about what officer andiron could be as a cop or andiron showed up at his mother's fifty ninth birthday party and en did a pepper sprang a bunch of his older relatives o people for lacking a her bat i begin in that a run in y dey would not calling any hard to have at all i nobody's crate enough for hitopose wo have we not crazy high is do not put the hands on a police officer an than that to day ben turns to the story of the city's investigation ant officer person which quite out in a strange and surprising way that had serious consequences for the pachisis ben starts with tact one chief outsides it up here is ben there was the official investigation into officer andiron by the miskigan police departments internal affairs team as you might have heard last week that investigation went kina soft on him the investigator literally invited andiron to quote explain away the situation u while that investigation was unfolding the police chief eff lewis was taking his own look at andiron a harder wore critical look turn out louis had questions about andiron before any of this happen in fact a year before the math's is post a tidy had popped up on line the made louis worried about wanders we watched us together it was a selforin video taken at night with the women being pushed into the back of a miskigan police hard andiron is standing behind the officer doing the pushing and then you see two women walk out one younger and then elderly woman writ next to her both black every one in the video but wanders andiron turns and he sees the women ism sure he has hi did e story which you see he spends round an just without even trying to verily de as later pointing he dis shoves this elderly woman to the ground which is just interpropriate it is won is just to about s why i me a ma mi a play ma a me mi o a i just cannot justify that i just cannot any way i look at it i cannot even say he was tactically right cause i do not remember ever throwing down a grandmother and my career ai just not feel thrown a gramadown a complaint was filed about this incident and louis took note he is concerned that undersea was kind of a cowboy and aggressive then the very same week themathisis posted he heard another story about andiron a black business owner he knew told him about a disturbing run an she would had with him that he would been buried and aggressive and told her to shut up then once all the started to blow up louis says some officers started to come to him discreetly and tell him they had concerns about andiron which prompted him to tally up everything he knew about andiron there is the rules johns shooting i talked about last time where undersea killed an on arm black man that was before louis arrived in miskigin and undersea was officially cleared of any wrong doing but louis question underseas judgment and the decisions that he made that led to the shooting he added on top of that two other shootings undersea was involved in an addition to juries johns if took the national average a have been a police officer for forty years involved in no shootings the vast majority of police officers go through their career an never shooting one something the public knows that nobody keeps national statistics on the percentage of officers that shoot people a pew said he says only twenty seven percent of police officers have even fired their guns but that includes warning shots and shooting animals anything else when expert told us the number of police who have actually shot and killed some one is almost certainly less than one present i couldn't even find a statistic we are department this and you are involved in three shootings and the is an outlier in that way you give be either you have the worst lock something is going on here and then when you looked at his history there was a progressive a i guess glaring a performance with him when it came to you know dealing with africa america especially another words he seem to have a lot of proms with africa medical through his career louis said andiron would have these kind of problematic interactions with black people but over and over again he would be cleared found to be within the bounds of department policy his whole career things would happen and he would connacmot the other side and ism not sure why i mean not gift cobecklok of every instant have had officers a good correccens and let a you haven officer this in five correccens and none was his fault as a chief you go lo we it appears is not your fault but why are you in five not a fault accents when the other that i present the officers on heavens what are you doing that you keep getting an accidents in it to of fault we would a much big policarga fact which never fault chuck is one one kind f things were its is pass this good things in her m i take this way from i start to see an a pattern that he just was not effective with our can medical silence he just was not what he gan do louis says he knew pretty quickly what he was gin it din he wanted to fir wanders partly on principal pupils to his for told me undersea has a problem with black people there was no doubt in my mind but also on top of that lots of people were telling louis he had no choice he had to get rid of this officer the city's social justice committee the city's vice more who also the president of the local end of policy p every one was saying if andiron stayed there would be back lash protest hostility and not just towards andiron but towards every one on the force would in danger him an other servant at officers and matter fact ism not to be part of his tigers if that is howrgin o be its i can not and good conscious bring him back here and put him back on the streets of this town to at this point in our story you have got a town were lots of people think o police officer has a problem with black people the white police chief looks into it and agrees seems a clear cut case fired the officer call out his bad behavior apologized the public and yet that is not what ends of happening which brings us tack to the way it actually happen tout of the breaking news out of the sign we a police officer who had who cluck clanmemrobilian as all has been fart when the news ha the chief louis did what he said and fired officer andiron there was no explanation why he was fired the closest they got to that came eleven days later when the city released their official report on andiron the results of the investigation chief louis ordered this report it is one of the reasons i got interested in this it is over of four hundred pages it seems its going a bee kind of a reckon it of the kind of officer undersea ad rendering is two decades on the meskigan police force and clue all the ins dents you have heard about settle some big questions about the kind o officer he was but the report was nothing that the report almost entirely portrays officer andiron as well a pretty great police officer it is hundreds of pages clearing him of wrong doing and showcase things he done well in his career it much that the first time i read it i did not even understand how this was used as justification for andiron being fired much of what had come up and what people were talking about was not even address there is an analysis of andersen's traffic stop showing it did not appear he was targeting non white drivers here is a big section about his commendations there is ten interviews with officers white and non white talking about how they think andiron's fair and a good officer and they wish he could come back to work some seem boiler plate but others seem heartfelt one black officer without prompting talks about how undersea has gone out of his way to help him at work and been a guest at his house he is been your house the investigator asks he has says black officer he help me put a roof on my house and his father and while spent the whole day at my house many of the things the chief found disturbing that convinced him andiron had a problem with black people they just were not in there the tidy of him pushing the old woman on to the ground or louis is concerns about the number of people andiron shot the only interview where anyone says anything negative about andiron is the interview with the offices and they only talk about the flags an the ceca application the local activist ebony dais summed up the report this way he was a great officer he did not do anything wrong but have memorabilia and they fired him to keep us happy how did we get to this from a police chief who believes this officer has a problem with black people to this mammoths report that does not say that at all chief louis is investigators handed him a report that comes to very different conclude signs than he had it is the report you would issue if he wanted to keep andiron on the streets i never got in answer to why the reports just as rotatory stuff i ask to talk to the people who did the investigation n the city said no as chief louis surprisingly he told me he thought the report was critical honestly it seemed he had not read it in a while andmaybe did not remember what the hack had happened inside miskegan city government they could possibly connect those dobs the best answer i got is here enact three how to fire a police officer oke let us go back to that moment when chief louis decided he wanted to fire andiron not because of the official investigation he had not even seen that yet he wanted to fire andiron because of his own analysis after he decided that he met what the cities lawyers and they talked about how it would be tricky to fire andiron and be tricky because of the reason louis wanted to get rid of him it hard to prove a police officer treats black people differently and has a pattern of discriminating they said if louis tried to fire him for that he really might fail take the video of andiron shoving the old woman anderseen to argue it was justified or maybe was an accident take any of these incidents one by one he could say that there was some reason cause here is always a defense mister andiron had a defense mister andiron had representation chief louis as he called around to the police chiefs the police union officials before around the state ye went you will never sustain that an in the union world i was told by a lot of people my de vision was to terminate that it would not bustle that you would not have grounds for termination i would it'd probably lose it later on down down the road it it happened i me there is it just since i been ho would say there is probably three different times people been fired and awarded their job's back miskegin city mandate you frank person he was in these meetings with chief louis and miskigan's lawyers and we just did not want that to happen in this case some of the cases were okay with it if but this one was under no circumstance could be for to have him be awarded his job back it is hard to fire a police officer that is to pretty much everywhere in this country as he probably know police unions are powerful they've lot to protections in their contracts and the instances where police officers do get fired for racism there been a bunch o cases over the last could years wellington north caroling albino new york for in michigain and the thing is in all those cases police were not fired from his treating people of color on the job they were fired for things they set because they wright races comments on line where they get caught on a recording saying explicitly races things there is a caught red handedness to it and the way those departments fired the officers was by arguing the races comments violated the basic cot of conduct for their jobs the cote of ethics and wellington says officers cannot do things that reflect on favorably on the department or themselves and chief louis after puzzling for a while over what legal argument he could use to fire andiron he had kind of an ahamoment an h count a stumbled into a strategy that the other cities used in our pulse procedures one of the things you have to do is you yourself have to have the community trust if yous in our pulse procedures the community has t have some kind of trust you to curry out your duties i looked it up and indeed this was in some technicality jerid deep in department policy e was right at the beginning in the chief's preface that louis rode himself he refers to the public trust when louis told me that this was his argument and he was going to try to fire andiron for losing the public trust i could not help ut think if this was the bar every were for every officer a lot o officers would be fired tomorrow the is and half of america say they have confident in police these days one benefit of this strategy was simplicity all they had to prove was that andiron had the stuff in his house and the people said he could not be trusted because of it louis would not have to argue all these individual incident that the lawyers told him he might lose on another appealing thing about this plan it would be fast louis wanted to send to message by acting quickly and in fact from the day the mafficks posted he was only five weeks instill andiron was fire amazingly quick for this kind of thing but to mature andiron would not fight him and try to get his job back the chief did seems to give a few things away at the bargaining tableley for starters he did not really fire andiron in actuality andiron signed a separation agreement he agreed to walk away voluntarily not say anything bad about the city not to keep his job it was just going to be over in exchange the city would let him leave with his pension and retirement held care benefits after two decades on the job this strategy for getting rid of a police officer is not unusual a former police chief named dance oats wrote an article in the washington post where he said in nine years running the department in a for colorado he had sixteen cobs he wanted to fire he only fired four of them he was reversed on three of those but the other twelve he says he quote bent over backwards to negotiate their departures with creative severance packages not because he wanted to he felt he had no other choice in the negotiations between the city and officer andiron the complaints about andiron's history did come up but his kind of a bargaining him louis told me he made it clear to andiron and the unionshat the case for his termination was based on what was in his house and how he lost the public trust but he said if andiron fought that most it could become about a lot more sister it could become about andiron's past and other things that he done and i was i was prepared to show this pattern the had other complains the for in the hopper that were coming forth that i was going to quire in those vast in the union knew it oh if you win this one this has come next then this could become next and that is why i was decided we would just in this relationship and he would move on in other words if andiron took this deal the city would not dig in to text stuff andiron to walk away without a real reckoning over his past that is the best explanation i have for why the four hundred and twenty one page report is the way it is and why it does not really dig in to andiron's mistreatment of people i should mention in his preface to the report the chief promises more he said there will be further investigation into additional complaints against officer andiron's behavior on the job now that this part ton that did not happen though and it is been two years the department spokesmen told me there are no additional investigations in to andiron in the works bancohin coming out the way the cities deal with officer andiron affected machines who woke that that four hundred twenty one page report i had something totally surprising about themselves and that that is a minute scagopubligradio when on programmed continues this a samaritan life om or a glass with our story about policing a muskuigan michigan to day's episode a city walks into an investigation i the police chief made a trade off believed officer andiron had rob black people he believed a completely affected the way he did his job but he thought he could not fire him for it he forced him out for quote losing the public trust with that ice we plication and is part of the de o the city's official four hundred twenty one padre port did not say anything negative about out andiron treated black people on his job that trade off andiron at we've but he kept his pension the city's official investigation our traded to is a outstanding officer that trade off had consequences for the people whose face book post began all of us the pachisis and for others bank hin picks up without for people who got the short end of andiron steal best i can tell the public at large just kind of accepted with the city did andiron was gone maybe he grumbled that he got his pension but fine get but it was not that way for duke's stalling at all just have remind you of his experience with officer andiron andiron was called to his mama's birthday party because of a noise complaint and escalated things until he ended a pepperspring a bunch of old people an arresting duke in one of his uncles they filed complaints with the police department a tried to raised the alarm about andiron but nothing happened know never reached out to hear their side of the story years later when the pachisis came forward about the stuff in andiron's house duke thought finally every one's on to see but the way the city handled it it did not go that way because the city's report did not talk about the pattern andiron hat with black people what would it have meant to you if the police chief as part of this process would have said essentially he had the sky was a problem oh everything oh my my hope was that they was one looking to carcass again whole right innocent naiveness i hope that they reach out to me hop they look into carcass hop they looking juliau's case hope they look into all these cases an something really happens and ache go to the families and make a mans with these families that he terrine that we your oping that you are goingtog got once on most ephod i thought that is what invescasion is you on looking every situation that he had a ant interaction was but the investigation hey say was on have that was just to get us hopeful right gulls people hopeful don't you rid an anger saw poise can be on the streets whit o nobody one to doing things to our polices well say everything we need to say to make them come down transit hat's really also about it is a weird thing about the story all that stuff that chief louis said to me about how he was convinced that officer andiron had problem with black people and a pattern of incidents is treating them he is never said that publicly not in the report not in comments to the press no city official has said anything that not until now this story i was the one to break that to people duke's stalling i mean that would ha make me for a whole la better if he would have said what he say to you behind closed or an public about this officer to hear that comes from with in that you agreed and you felt the same way he had a history of a heroin or effecting and as sad group of people and we fired him and got rid on because it have reason to let us know that we on e saying page her i mean that is how you build at trust with the community when it came to the way that andiron treated his family duke would always felt that race was a part of it they did have acted differently if they were white but it was this slippery part and it was hard to prove which happens all the time person accused of races m can say i do not have a race his on in my body or ism the least race's person and then all the sudden conversation is this dead end every one's just must throw up their hands and be guess you cannot prove wits in their heart this i in everything yes have know what in a roast i i offices self that would the and o know was a racial bag but i could not take it to court and we am because they never misstifily say anything that li you really to a cause embody an you early got o cities i things in order can treat you an ut never call i can treat you one never quite you the touchy editor on races but you knew was one was you it is a trap door and ten years earlier duke would watched andiron slipped through it and when the city released their report it was he had to watch andiron slipped through it for a second time i went back and i told chief louis would duke another said to me that if the city and louis saw a racial pattern of bad conduct and mistreatment by officer andiron the city should have set it honestly and i see when the con fro i get but when it came time for us to do the investigation i felt i but everything in there to sustain this case and to get him to end his employment here to get the outcome that you felt was importance for this and and i can prove it to day i can look back go see we did it right but there can som misses should say it is not complete until the chief put the racesyou do not the can were i guess work in i gust live to day to disagree i don't feel that was new sorry what i felt was ne sees in that report and worked for what i would call a correct outcome but but i guessed the question that ism asking it is just why not a a public statement there sharing your take of there there is a pattern of problems here why not a public statement saying you get a right there was something wrong here i i think we did i make a public statement of that we went you cannot be employee and and mat effect you should be a place offer the went around and around louis was adamant they made the right choice to get andiron out act five no good deed goes unpunished the people who were the most effect directly effected by the city's decision never to publicly comment on how andiron treated black people where the people who stuck their next out and set this all in motion robin rain a math's he mat the is were already being harassed i laid out the details of that last time threats to their childrenand people in town shouting slurry at them people stocking their house but when the city put out its report it made all that worse because of something surprising it set about them it was something day even know and it was something that changed the way people in miskigan saw them towards the end of the report the masking police department revealed that that day when robin ran a toward officer andiron's house that was not actually the first time they crossed pass with hem in fact over the years they interacted with him a few times robin rain a found this out the day the city report came out i believe he's in a car ran somewhere in a somebody sit is the reporter sometime that yo wen on a way up side or something and randan is a it was one of these incidents they caught every one's attention especially the machines it was from two thousand eight robin rayon totally remembered this thing but they never put it together that it was officer undersea in fact both ta and undersea told investigators they know each other for the mat theses this particular incident had just cone a mushed in with other interactions they had with police they did not remember a particular officer it was just some random cob who treated them badly i went to tell you the whole story because of the outlandish coincidence of this if you remember the reason rob felt compelled to go public about the flags and the cakecake c application was because he imagined some day somewhere officer undersea would pull over a couple and things would get ugly turned out robin rayon had been that couple a delicate earlier it was the fourth of jury and he douse and are robin ranch had grabbed a bite at burger king they were on their way home and rob had to pe really bad he was going a little fast but not that fast even according to officer undersea who says in his police report that he clock them going between thirty one and thirty eight in a twenty five finish over andiron pulled them over pretty much right at their house he flit the lights and i pull up right at my sad door we literally right in front of our house get literally park right in front of our house officer undersea comes up to the car and i you what yous you spent us e for i had go to bath when ice is garage bathroom bad you is is going sake a seen my wife was end got talk to bathroom he shut up madam a a la rob says he and rayon were shut ut officer undersea went back to the car rob was in much discomfort he was afraid he was get wet himself after a few minutes he got out and he tried to signal to officer undersea to plead his case have i rains an you not have money as with different officers on occasion in some on e being a we hard a sometime but i was being respectful and is officer you can t look i

minutest go by then twenty robin rains kid see the police lights and they come out to see whats happened now there standing on the lawn after bit neighbors come out too we sat there for a half an an our git do not take day long to run a body name sat there sat the sat the sat i stay of time about open door to get out get back in ta car just a see it'll be her in a see stay in ta car stay n ta car

ass back in ta car get in ta car at this point wanna got out of the car to talk to their kids officer undersea turned his attention to her when he did he count a gave up on rob and rob was able to run inside to pay then wanders walked over to myna he told me to get my aback in the car and i was standing at the door was not out all the way out of the car i was the door was open and i was standing there telling my kids that everything was going to be o mayor whatever am he was telling me to get my aback in the car and ism telling him ism talking to my kids there scared whatever it and i do not remember wanna was she wast kind of pin between the car and undersea and that is when he try to put me in the headlock and a i did was try very i do not want him to however he did it he did tissue muss my nose are what ever my nose was leading but when i went back this to pertain to myself that is when he got hid year says she lifted up her arms to block undersea and her arm hid him rob in t e middle of this comes back out of the house to find wanna with a bloody face and officer undersea wrestling her to the ground he searched to walk up what is happen when is come to sad the gate yes say does that deftly put his and en what yous do not plus gone out som stand why ran just be cool be cool coo and the he grabby what were they saying what were they saying when you came at la he was you resist in e rest you resist in t e rest my hose just had to go to base i told you to stain to car told just tan car he grabbed er and he master here down on the car you rest odor wild is to trying to get away from and you having to stand there on the other side of the hance with your kids and watch this holes and olden i was word at is wont o shooter in front o of me in a is once undersea had myna on the ground he put handcuffs on both of he rest saying i told you to get her asked down ah now you are going to fucking jail stuff that and my kids were screaming at this point we surprised that that happened all this no i g ate the way the aggression he had i knew something was can happened i was not surprised that it did happened i was more mad because i happened in front of my kids can they were terrified cause they were younger than just treat rate the issue here to start was driving about thirty five an a twenty five andersen's report from that night described more or less the same course of offense the key difference is that officer undersea says synod did not hit him inadvertently he says she swung around and slopping wanna was charged with resisting an obstructing a police officer i charged the curry's potential prison time when my husband found out i was facing five years in prison he said no he said were fight and this cause they got ointment to take a deal am he said no were gin to get a lawyer were in to fight this he said i want the disport cam as evidence he said because that will see exactly what hat everybody was see what happened the aliases say their lawyer requested the dash camp footed from the stop according to the atlases they were told the video could not be located and then suddenly wanna was offered and knew much reduced plea deal she decided she jiswanted to be done with all this and she took it ut the night of the traffic stop back in two thousand ate robin synod did not think it was about race do not a just being a dig or he is had a hard mind maybe o the the previous person may be pooled over something gave hard time and he just taken you on everybody else he is own a powertrain i have a bade om ism on ti control that is what i thought i don't think anything about him be in braces i just thought ye he was a cop on a portrait i mean have seeing medical cops do the same thing to pelicans and black cops do the same thing to blacks it is just some of em have their power trips i just thought he was on a poetry that was how they sought when it happened but now after seeing the s things in andersen's home a decade later they both looked at it differently i do not think he would have did that with a with a white cub wunikar he en like oka go use bathroom or om is going lets you off cause he was just just is respect in hind slight looking at it everything he did was a races act from when he first looked at us he did not have good intentions tics a man is races and i know that now but had i known it back then probably been bladed then i was pissed i catnap i d wish i would have probably assaulted him before insulted me that is the truth if the city specifically chieflewis would have said publicly some version of what he actually thought about officer undersea that he had a pattern of being overly aggressive escalating situations especially with people who were not white then i think when people found out about this traffic stop they might have seen it in that lite but without that contact andiron's version is the one people believed it is andersen's account in that four hundred twenty one page report the city issued he stopped robin wanna ran got out of hand she assault him because of that this revelation that they would had this run in with officer undersea years earlier it really did change how lots of people saw them thesis that is when more threats came and the people sin all year you are out for officer andiron because he put your wife in yer because it s because of that then may was all your might just a good gat because you out it officer andiron for having a confederate fag in a clan application this because we were holding a gods against the police offs of course robin wanna had not sought out andersen's house on some vendetta the realtor sent them the listing but this version of the story took hold that is was still outfit that that report that a city had put out it is me an my wife had a probe we in we went after when we were talking i told rob what chief louis said to me that undersea had a pattern of behavior and a problem with black people just would duke stalling robin had no clue no clue louis felt that way no clue louis saw the same things in undersea that he did and the fact the city left that out it made rob mad why when you say that in the report in the begin it would a changed everything everything me an my wife would not be looked i as some liars that we would after you you soon up here create is falseness it is just room tell the truth manage police she want to tell the truth but the matters done what truthfully the intimation that show just got from chief lewis if that would've been put into report then they would say the mas part he in a great job thank you the way the thesis see it even if the chief removed undersea for betraying the public trust even if the reason for the firing was not the way he treated black people the city could have removed andiron without also giving him a clean bill of health the cut a said we have looked into this were troubled by the way he treats people it was not oka we do not want officers acting the way that he did a six was it worth it is hard for robin ran had to out curate the ways this changed their lives the rest they took was a single act a single moment but the impact of it is still happening even a couple years later the cost for them are still adding up some of what all this has cost the maththis is are things that have ended up in no report no investigation official or unofficial the harass men the threats the conspiracy theory now floating round out there the robin wanna were out to get officer andiron the last time i saw rob i asked him how he looks back on all tit given the result ism just glad that ye ran round the streets he is not last no more mine worries and nobody will get ruled by all ernes it'd be a justify shoot cause he can make a would he want to because he killed o worse you do you feel it was worth it it'll feel us i me my wife save lives but non will we de panda did not disagree choose glad andiron lost this job really pretty fast that doesn't always happen but the practical cost she can help it look at those too the then with all the a back lash that was n that that all the negative stuff it just made me second guess what we did i felt i did but mot wrong maybe we should not did maybe we should is kept our mouth shut but that the end of the day who as to say that he would not still be working in another young black man gets killed or there's another wanna who goes to prison for five years because he says that she assaulted him and it it i ism complicit because one minute ism we did do the right thing we did do the right thing but then when you go through everything that we have been going through its kind hard maybe we should know though robin ranch did what they did out of concern for other people's safety but they ended up sacrificing their own they used to feel the police rout there to protect them tit help them and now on any given day the worried that their not here is wanna i promise you every day i leave this house when i drive to work i pray to god that i do not get pull over because ism scared ism legal i have a license i have insurance and ism scared e make rob drive me to work lot and it is hard on him because he has to wake up to come get me at five in the morning and then take my daughter to school and do this and do that and but i my anti to get bat i do not want day cause ism scared him to get pulled over and and anything can happen it might be somebody who knew him w right or one of his friends those worries an fears they tell me they are not just when they leave the house they have seeped in the last thing it'll play for you is from wanna this was from five months after the city ad terminated andiron when most of the people in meskigan had stopped thinking about all this i i probably get two three hours sleep here and there once we started get in the threats and i but i i had a lot of bad dreams i could not sleep i would have to i used to put a chair right by that window wand just set out and look out the window in the dark just i could see i is to keep an iron what was going o yeoutnd that we have a monitor with our security cameras and i would lay it and my bed with me and i would just hold it and watch it for ours cause it shows all of our cameras is all six it'd watch all the little scans and for hours i could not sleep and that is what i would do and how long did that last i still do it sometimes i do not sit there no more but i will sit here ere or i will lay in my bat an it'll hold the monitor right in my hand in his lastnouben he was sometimes the or i set on the stairs right there at the forth stair i can see right out that night when mi worse light is on slip sent there i tested rob the other day he told me they still get that sometimes and they still watch the monitors regularly that is the normal he wrote always on guard i gan long i think o on them for the last six months as bancovon is been working on this story he and i have talked about and the thing that i have wondered about myself about this whole thing this whole time was oke if you are a police officer with the history officer andirons all these interactions with civilians a goo badly over twenty one years why did it take this free even people spotting a a c replication on a wall for anybody look to is record the way the cheated it is something about hem could not they have flagged him sooner across the country re we setose incidents were police are mistreating people it seems if there were some system to catch problem officers it can make a difference does any police department try in a real way an an effective way to do that flag them deal with them other ben i i was not a one in this question you also were cone of obsess with us yet i put this question this exact question to several policing experts a and eventually one of them told me about these things called early warning systems ah and basically what these are are computer programs that track problematic incident in an officers career a and they flag an officer if there is too many of them and one of these experts told me that if meskigan have one of these systems then all of this would have been different a a yet right but then i check and meskigan does have one of these systems in place oh it does it does but id did not lead to any action against officer undersea oka then what is he problem well i mean it turns out that a lot of these systems are just really bad a and there is a few reasons for it one of them is that some of the systems this includes miskigans they rely really heavily on police officers re porting each other on which does it happen very often it realizes on citizen complaints a which we just know that people do not complain about police officers very often because they worry that nothings can be done which is true often right yet totally true ah another reason they're bad is that a when these systems get installed a they have to be negotiated with police unions and police unions kind of defend them a and the last reason it turns out they might be measuring just the wrong things ah a few years ago a a group at the university of chico got together and they wanted to change the way this works basically they wanted to money ball the whole situation thy were to break down all the things police do on the job into numbers and statistics and then they wanted to find the stats that best predict bad behavior so man example of of what these moneyboflstats would be oke one example a they say the old systems would measure just the sheer number of times a police officer would use force if they wrestle somebody to the ground or if they taste somebody a and what they want instead they say it tells you just way more if you measure something they call proportionality of force and what that is is how much force is a police officer using given the situation that there in ah are they using force in a situation that would not usually call for it o we can think of officer andiron going into the back yard and ending up pepper spraying a bunch of unarmed people over a noise complaint overdose complaint or or shoving that old woman of the ground that is using a lot of forest were forces necessarily needed right exactly i talk to a policing expert name born super men he is a former chico police officer and he is one of the people trying to get people to use these new money ball type stats he told me the university of chico group french the numbers for a lot of officers and they were looking at whether they were using force and situations that would not usually call for it you learn two things you learn that most police are great at the escalation and you learn that some police are always trying to use is much force as they lawfully can or the policy maples from tort or the top end of that factorage those officers are much more likely to have a major avers that occur right something terrible the nature o whit you can turn on and see on the be here and there right to ma another one what of to the track another thing the these folks are looking at is something called discretionary arrest that is essentially an officer goes into a situation the desk necessarily requiring arrest and makes one yes they pulling over the mafficks for going thirty five and a twenty five that results in a an arrest or bag as just the traffics up as a speeding tic can nest result and arrest yet exactly ye same with duke stalling right it the noise complaint and he and up arresting duke and his uncle a case all that goes until i anogarathem or whatever yet exactly and one the most interesting things that these people are finding is that patterns of problematic behavior with police officers typically go together if an officer has one kind of bad behavior than the probably can have others the officer who pushes down an old lady is more likely to be an officer who involved in say three shootings u and there also more likely to be the officer who is now at a traffic stop telling a couple to shut up we do not generally fine that oh an officer is just shroud or an officer just uses a little too much force and if we use the story that you shared this officer was not just run right that is the general accurate story we do not really just find well this officer is otherwise great but is just across disrespect right but the data would generally show that officers going to be struggling in other parts of their job they are using more force than one would expect they are using a higher proportionality of force i just want to add another thing that their tracking is who police officers are doing problematic things to if an officer uses more force with people of collar say take that is can a show up does this one about system work better what we know do they actually catch more problem officers and get the to change or n a get rid few i mean what run humoral says s they have only been doing this for few years it is still pretty early to tell how it is working but he says some departments get better results than others and the key variable is how they follow through when an officer gets flag a lot of departments exon using new radio versions of the shots no not that many on huborman's company which is based on all this university of chico research is called bench mark analytic and that one is working without a hundred and fifty policing agencies which i know sounds kind of float from but ye there is eighteen thous and policing agencies deliver the country most of america is mistaken right that that is the average or the normal police farming in america which is there might be something in place but fundamentally it is not it does not have both the data in the citification to identify diplomatic patterns you just i asked on humor what of the big obstacles for getting these systems up in running and he said some of him our superstraightforward you knows a money in tack an getting at in place a but the big problem he said is is politics a police unions they just typically fight anything that involves scrutinizing and disciplining officers you an't to get these systems in that is where the

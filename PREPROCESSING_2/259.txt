on a chines name a while i playing an avian for laughs keep in mind this is the sixties he said he made up the name of doctor clocks research institute and his title too he said the chines fore wasn't the point of it except for that they were at a chines restaurant heating and drinking a little too much the night they made the bet and how were one that bet yes it was in an article it was a letter but it was printed in the journal good enough for them here is michael landing the reporter who interviewed toward but once you saw it it's the letter was published he is sort is mildly horrified i yous were if id for he was it happy that do in the bed at hardtop tell you it see in he a go back and forth between i be proud of the fact that he as able so the this a be published in this journal

often recounting their own experiences and simp does the new york times notice his ten letters from doctors publish is an article remember no scientific studies at this point just letters some of them jokes the headline was chines restaurant endow puzzles doctors the new spread from there under headlines quack squeeze and chines chow nuts sum here is juniper the professor retraced the history i mean the titles were very very offensive ah ah el see less i can find the on from the chico tribe in broken english the headline is chines food make you crazy and a she is number one suspect who chines food make you crazy i cannot believe that was a headline yes well is who a they were all reacting to something that was not even real n it was all projection to this day lots of chines restaurants post no oniscee signs and their windows and printed on their man's a a a tax m a city a a in u a i i to big id a we a the chalk i e say t to how it l locks of people the story over the years he told groups of other doctors he told gender who believed him she cleared the elemi magazine who reported those interviews they pitched the story to us and we were ninths six year old man confesses to waiting a prank letter that drove the nations o decades long scare about a tocsin does not actually toxic he is dead but you have reportings ore in but as we and michael the reporter started looking into this more carefully there were few things i ere puzzling for one the name of the research institute toward said he invented the national big medical re search foundation michael discovered it was a real place and the real doctor quack had worked there kind of a coincidence if toward made up the name he said he did it also seemed heard if the journal published a fake letter with doctor quack's name and institution on it and it was quoted in over a hundred newspapers naming him and the letter it seemed heard that the real doctor quake never said the record strait never polished a letter complaining in the new inland journal of medicine or in any of those newspapers also toward did he tried to get the journal to retract it that he called an y editor would not take his calls we reached out to the new inland journal of medicine did blind comment but it seems strange just on the face of it toward became a highly a claim season he invented important medical proceuturs it seems for sure he couldhave gone the attention of some one at the journal it is hard to verify what really happened because everyone involved in this is did toward is dead the friend he made the bet with his dead the real doctor qua is dead but doctor quack his kits we called them a doctor's family we also spoke to one of his colleagues of the research foundation and the son of his bus there they all said yes doctor robot horseman quack did write the letter his daughter said e was proud of it that he was a concerned doctor in a curious scientist would often pose questions this was not joke at all the thought that toward was going around telling this story for years he creepy rout a little and when you read the original letter there are details that seems more likely to come from her father than from toward when he says he moved to the guess which the real doctor quack did and how he's very specific that the condom happens with northern chines food in the sixties how many while eyes and philadelphia would have made that distinction also common quack is an actual cantons name what are the odds that towards steel threw together random chines sounding syllables to arrive at that i called up gender the professor that toward steel had left the voice mail for am i finally reached the quack family o e and they told me something am they say that their father did write the letter what add they say that he wrote it and there certain well o he what o you think of that i out i we have no idea i just cannot believe that doctor steel made this up writ now i i the who were they two letter i d the bat a have id like they happen to writ o that i at he can time i won got e did it like one e that you end it only we know i mean i can rely i i mean have me i mean i we i we are he o let i my how any rein only a there were two options neither of them good i some one has been telling a story that is not true for fifty years one of these two men both of whom were by all accounts brilliant upstanding pillars of their communities either toward was fessing up to something he totally did not do claiming responsibility for the whole ms g ms when actually he had nothing to do with it or toward was telling the truth and doctor robot holden quack we loved pediatrician and researcher hat seemed this letter to the editor in the journal with his name on it that he did not write was delighted with his good fortune and rolled with it for fifty years i had one person tough to call toward steals slaughter anna she grew up hearing the story i told her everything i just told you cay at that is the show but actually not that bites shock an took her about two seconds to make sense of all this she believe the looks not her father no i i do not think anybody who new ham and lav an would would be would be surprised it it on one more thing in the life of my gad this she said this is exactly the kind of thing he love to you he liked to prank people and he told lots of big stories about himself many true and some not ye could never totally believe him and never quite not believe him in fact she says it help explain this other thing that even though her father supposedly on the bet his body never paid him the fact that that would never that that i it it that that that that maybe it with a wink wink between them both well now knowing all this do you feel convinced that he did not write the letter it then the point in that direction does not it i mean if i thought we were dealing with too trait way drat are no non and revisions i might be arguing a stronger petition but knowing me to clown the ism ism not sure i can non there is not much i can my it seems toward did not write the fake prank letter that cause decades of chaos his prank was that he said he had written the letter he was claiming credit for chaos he did not create it was complicated o even think about o my gad h a eh a you finny i well here we are a first the world believed i must she was bad for you and it was not and now we nearly believed the second piece of fake news that ad all started with toward here was where anna came down loving her father and his best friend but also what the hell i wish i could give them both a piece of my mind ism not angry but i could want a ay you ow everybody huge apology what is wrong with you and you would just art laughing ism sure and ye would have big mischievev grand and he would fake them thing i do not know anybody in apology you all should have had your head brewed on wait figure out i is a you many people near the end of their lives are trying to make things right he was trying to make trouble a lasts a last acts a lifelong legacy prank and of that the law laugh i in a to i i tot any bi the won bee me ay wit i beer an happy ti to thing a further not you believe i did tor if the be i don't any one re war to wit e chip shut my mow but e try with i e she pretty e not e toward died just a few months after he caught his way through those interviews he was ninety seven lily mulligan is one t piss sore so that to b baby's got bank obey i know unlikely this sounds but we now have another old guy basically cranking the world right before he dies bet mescal that gets hundreds of thousands of people involved an excited in talking about this guise plan that he set emotion for years and years stephany who explains an nineteen twenty six in torn canada is seventy two year old lawyer named charges dance miller was at lunch at the queen's hotel with two lawyer friends the gone to an argument over some legal matter miller told them they were both wrong and he prove it if they followed him up to his offish he eagerly ran up three flights of stairs grabbed a playbook plopped it on his desk and then died just what his had down on the desk and was gone a couple days later rumors started swirling charges dance miller had done well for himself gone rich he would avoided scandal his whole life was an upstanding citizen though h had no family never married he would hinted that he would leave his fortune to the university of torn but when his fellow lawyers brought out his will that is not what they found as soon as miller's people started executing his will they realized that his will was an elaborate prank as if he would thrown a bunch of money out of a window to watch what would happen he left stock in a brewery to prohibitionist o pastors he gave his rasing stock to people who did not believe in bedding he said he wanted to leave his vacation home in jamaica to three other lawyers an ice think for them to share except for the fact that the three lawyers all heated each other but by far the claws that unlace the most madam was the last one it is about all the rest of his money it'll just great it to you at the expiration of ten years for my death give it and it is accumulations to the mother who has since my death given birth and torn to the greatest number of children as shown by the registrations under the vital statistic's act and e in other words the woman who had the most babies in the ten years after his death would be awarded a whole lot of money nine million canada dollars into day's money ere almost seven million you west dollars there were immediately a number of theories as to why miller did this but none of them wore charitable if he really wanted to support a young woman with a bundle of kids he could have just willed all the money to her at the time of his death but setting this up over the next ten years created a twisted contest some said he was an avid supporter of birth control maybe setting off a baby making storm could be a win ked way to force a conversation about it some said he was trying to test the legal systems ability to hold up a crazy will but that he would really expected it would be thrown out that the money would automatically just be donated to the university of torn his all matter people said that miller had ben obsessed with the idea of what people would do for money he to talk about how everybody had their price maybe he was testing the women of torn to we what theirs was i do not think anybody he know fully knows why he did thus this is elizabeth wilt she wrote a two hundred page dissertation on the contest i just think he saw it as a big joke i feel the modern day word for at would be that he was basically a troll that would be a good word for it yet he pretty much cops to it in his will he says this will is necessarily uncommon and capricious because i have no dependents or near relations and no duty rests upon me to leave any property at my death and what i do leave is proof of my folly in gathering and retaining more than i required an my lifetime apparently miller really to drop dollar bills on the side walk and hide and watch people pick them up when i think about the can of person who plant a wallet in the street put it on you tube to day as a commentary on human nature ye i feel i know who that gay is a favor the first few years after miller died nothing happened a few news paper articles were written nobody took a very seriously some relatives went to court arguing that the money should go to them and then six years after his death the a treaty general introduced a bill trying to nullify the will and have the money donated to the university of torn this was a mistake totally back fired before this not many people knew about the will but now that the government was trying invalidate the press picked it up and there was a huge public outcry but not in the way you might think the public was baby making race hell yah we want a baby making race c women grew supported the contest because they felt women should have a fair shot at the money which what can i say was a differentiae others disagreed with the government intervening in people's wills and affairs altogether it caused an uproar the government back tracked said o we fun you people have fun ad with that the race was on usually when the story has been told it is ha ha a man created the zany will that set off a wild baby making storm in canada the conjure breed bunch images of big families happily stopping their way to fame and fortune see deep in cabbage patch children but the wait unfolded was actually much darker be cause of course the story is about an old man encouraging women to go through the excruciating pain in danger of childbirth as often as possible and a ten year period e ten year period that was already half over this contest did not really get started until six years in that made its chewed from the stark it meant suddenly the only contenders were women who had about six babies in the last six years women who didn't even know there was hen contest to be part of they found out about it quick when reporters started pounding on their doors it was madness really it was media feeding frenzy this is carat noon she worked with elizabeth to develop a screen play for a move base on the contest that aired on canada tell a vision in two thousand to as soon as the will was verified reporters went through the birth registry found women who had already given birth to about six children since charger's death and dashed to their homes to try and get the exclusive you not they point the phrase the stork derby comparing it too a horse race there was a my dash to track down the women get their exclusive stories and to follow them in hound them oh on the very intimate and personal details of their life it must have been a jarring experience to be an automatic front runner and this bazar contest but most of the mothers went along with it because of the nine million dollars many of the contestants were desperately poor during those first six years the great depression at taken hold nearly a quarter of toronofs families were in well fare families were living in shacks or camps some even a groundhacks to keep from starving canted as birth rate had actually plummeted at the time and most of the families that suddenly found themselves on the running to receive the stork derby money agreed to media scrutiny because they wanted the chance at the prize and because and the short term the newspapers offered the money exclusive contracts were reporters could come and photograph and interview the families whenever they wanted to sometimes the families even got advertising deals for things in many ways this was sort of an of reality show all be it a really perverse one the front runners of the stork dirty even became household names john an helpless ate were maybe more octagon after all it was build on the news reals as free canada race papers all over the world from the new york daily news to the marshfield wisconsin news herald picked up the story the pressfollowed a bunch of contenders but ism only gin a run through three of the long term favorites to win one of the first competitors that the newspapers dug up was missus grace binate at i want to give away who one or how many kids missus binate actually had during the race but over her lifetime missus bignatto was pregnant twenty four times though only twelve of those children lived she was a working mother she was a was with languages picked up polish german skittish and worked as a sort interpreter an italic all the while she raised her twelve children and would get up at four thirty in the morning to make two dozen butter parts macaroni meat balls sausage and her famous red sauce for her family but the public did not exactly see her as a hero here is care again the cultural make up of trona with the time a was a very waste waste society and we have this italic family here who is reproducing children at rate at out pase the the white protestant angle savants missus bignatta's husband was an italic immigrant and some papers were not kind about that these were the years leading up to world were too of course it did not help that one of the other italic contestants named one of their derby babies little beside muslin but because of their nationality italic families in the race received one calls calling their families rashest and threatening to kidnap their children contestant number too was missus x she was the scandalous one she was a social outcast because for children were father by different man which was to to and she was shame for that she was considered to be a troop a you dotty having children with more than one man it is a saucy word start using that missus ex had five children from her husband but then her marriage ballpark he moved out and she entered into a new relationship with a man and had another five kits with him she wanted to marry him but did not of enough money to go through with their divorce all in all missus ex had ten children by the time she was twenty for she tried to hide her identity because of the circumstances of her situation but her name was eventually re sealed cauline may clerk contestant number three was missus kennel she is my favorite character in the whole wholstower why she er favorite i think her eccentricity for one thing a her passion and her undeniable belief that she was the chosen one if you will missus kennel was in it to win it she was under five feet tall but over the course of her lifetime she wound up carrying nineteen pregnancies to term she was french kanadian married to an iris man and she believed that money was hers she said she had the gift of second sight and a divine connection with miller who told her she was going to win soon course it had to be true missus knew was a talent at woodcarver and often told her carvings in the street and she carved a large number of statues of miller even named one of her children after him at one point a bunch of the leading derby mothers got together and said screw this whole race let to share the winnings areas ton of money they we all poor it would still result in plenty for every one but missus kennel was the soul hold out the only one who insisted no ism the winner she shouted once and i will not split with any money why should i it is my money and if the judge does not give it all to me it'll walk right up to the bench and punch in the eye e out missus kennel was tough as nails but she probably was the poorest of the three her family lived in a slum and their home was infested with rats one night rats attacked three of her children tiny three month old part a the worked of it here is care yes it had bidden the baby on the in the face and neck area and you now as we all know throughout history rats married diseases am but they could not afford the hospital it could not test is this is difficult to even tie let's unbelievable that its still chokes me up missus penny and her neighbors tried desperately to have the public health nurse visit her home but to know avail the baby died and then it was all over the front pages of the newspaper but always written in terms of what this man for the chances of missus penny or whatever other woman was that the coverage was centered on every lot or tragedy or triumph was always put in terms of the chances in the in the race you know am not in terms of what kind of a system do we have were some one's baby can die of rat bites in the first place it is hard to say how many woman had baby specifically for this race when they dock o reporters every one always ad the same thing i would have had this child any way attend to believe missus bignatto and many of the other catholic families on the race it do not think missus bignatta was ever playing the game she would been cranking out a baby a year long before she heard a word about the derby the whole contest was just ratted boss to her but then there was missus penny who was obviously playing to win and set outright that she was trying to make babies and then you have missus clerk missus clerk's situation was the most unsettling it came out that missus clerk's lover had drawn up a contract with her where he could get half her winnings if he impregnated her enough missus clerk's lover was also abusive he given her a black i broke her door down chased her out into the street after a fight maybe she did not want to be pregnant as many times as she was maybe she was forced to here is elizabeth be set a wonder was she basically abused was she taken advantage of because if you think about also the kind of power dynamic that miller set up between men and women and at that ism if your partner or if your husband or your lover that that if he got you pregnant over and over that you might win millions o dollars and she was a very young woman and m you were sort of insinuating that maybe these these women might have been coerced or i mean i do not know i mean i think it does not take a lot for some one to put together with this young woman and many babies and with this huge prize in nineteen thirty three it looked missus bignatta was on away then in nineteen thirty four had line's read that missus penny had taken the lea in nineteen thirty five another woman missus timbal sped to the front in nineteen thirty six madam x was listed as a late entry died for second all the while the physical tool for these mothers was norms missus bignatto suffered a hemorrhage near the end of her final pregnancy hand many of the storeturby mothers were in another hospital for operations and transfusions and all three mothers suffered the emotional to of having still born babies during the race most of the women could not afford to have their children in hospitals and the infant mortality rate of the derby babies was six times that of the national average thirty four per cent of these babies died but aside from an attic her to again the pass only saw these deaths in the contacts of the race the headline in a nineteen thirty six mistrial paper was still born infant may assure prize underneath a stillborn child may assure missus matter kennel the prize and the stork derby under the will of late charges vans miller her nears competitor is believed to be missus josh binate the race ended on hollowed nineteen thirty six but at first it was not clear who on here is how our three competitors stood on that date missus penny claimed to have had eleven children miss clerk said she had eleven as well missus bignatto at nine but missus penny and missus clerk did not walk away with the prize that easily with missus clerk the scandalous one who had died for the largest number of children the lawyers and charge of the estate had some questions about her case and raised the question of whether it children born at a wedlock should count this is where it was clear that there had been a huge oversight nobody had actually set rules for this contest at its beginning remember miller explained this whole contest in two sentences in is well as the court saw it there were new once that needed to be figured out rules to be set but of course only after the fact of everything after the babies had been born and the blood transfusions administered a massive mufti way court battle broke out all of the contestants had to go to court to prove that they had the most children each woman had to lawyer up and go up against the lawyers for the executors of the estate the fight went on for two years and of course now the rules would be determined in front of an audience to figure out of her illegitimate children would count missus clerk and her lovers abusive sexual history was scrutinized on the stand he recounted his physical violence with her admitted to giving her a black eye and busting down the door to her house and to the contract he drew up when he mentioned the contract the courtroom burst out into rocks mocking laughter and in fact the lawyers regularly threw in crude jokes during the trial soliciting giggles from the audience and the end it was decided that illegitimate children could not be counted within the derby and missus clerk's number got not down to five she was out of the running then came missus kennel the one who believed she was the winner and had carved statues of miller she would also tied for eleven but apparently two of her children had not been properly registered probably because missus kennel was two poor to deliver children n hospitals she would had them at home instep that brought her count down to nine children but no big deal she was still in the running then the lawyers pointed out three of her children had been still born quickwarning ism about to talk about a lot of dramatic births until this point everyone had assumed that billboard children would count for the derby again this had not ben in the rules and after all these women had carried these children to term but now at missus kennel's trial lawyers for the executors of the estate started questioning that and missus kennel had to sit lie a pack of lawyers argued around her about how legitimate her dead children were they brought up doctors and had them give graphic descriptions of the stillness if each baby breathed if its whatever beat she had to relive the moments all over again missus penny cried throughout this and eventually ran from the courtroom it was just all too much for her and at one point she left the court room just screaming that she was being treated a dog and there never was a sensitive portrait of this woman it was all sort of caricatures also i think the coverage just continued in that way the news paper report said she was shrieking insinuated that she was drunk and said quote during the scuffle missus penny dealt at least half a dozen hard blows on the arms en bodies of the officers who showed great restraint in their tactics in the end it did not helper case the childborn dead is not in truth the child the judge rote it was that which might have been a child her count was nocked down to sex missus penny was out of the running lastly there was missus binate who again had nine children but one was still born and another was unregistered missus mignatto suggested that there was some conspiracy with this she said she would registered the child herself at the parliament building she's quoted to saying if they cannot find the record it will be just too bad for them up there i will tear the parliament buildings a part before i give up ism suppose to be in the hospital now with another baby coming but it'll stay only feet until i drop were this is cleared up but her protestations did not sway the judge and she eventually did give up after all she did have a job and almost a dozen mouths to feed it the end of two years none of the three favorites bound up at the finish line four other women with nine babies each one each of these women walked away with what to day would be about two million canada dollars wore one and half million new less dollars most were late comers who really only became candidates when the heavy hitters were eliminated and these four women had something else in common here is elizabeth i mean the families at one were whit protestant families who were essentially middle pass and who had at homes that when the reporters when in to them an describe the homes it was always the clean and tidy home and the well kep the in the cashed the for runners through the whole race were working class people and unemployed people and they had very at the back grounds maybe it was not a coincidence that these women did not win maybe they did not win because they did not have the means to navigate the system as elegantly we maybe the judge who decided the contest had his finger on the scale in its last four years the public's view of the contest that turned his people saw how it played out it had encourage the poorest women to have the most children that sat alarm bells off for a big group of people in what was a growing an popular movement at the time eugenics kitty roosevelt was into eugenics oleander granbell w e b do boys even heller killer a refresher ougenisas believe that in order to improve the human species some people should not be allowed to repro duce and yes that is just as creepy as it sounds an the end of the contest they came forth and droves to say that the money should not be given to any women here is elizabeth the social commentary was a round who are these people and should they be we producing there not canada born there poor there not the right people a minister reverend care silicon submitted written testimony against the par ticipants as duo unspeakable women and argue that these poor children what eventually reduced wages and lower the standard of living and editor for a canada newspaper said that the contest attracted quote those whose progeny would be of little use to the state elizabeth and careen believe that this environment influence the judge hat he eliminated on technicalities all the contestants who had not made the right kinds of babies here is care ye i do believe that it was intentional i mean because they wen of such lakes to discredit those that were the others the french canada catholic the woman with the illigentimat children the italic you knowthe catholic with a am a good husband it became a platform for them to send the message of otto use a a modern pray staying hourly t immigrants know their place they were definitely thing to send a message after the law suit took place missus clerk and missus kennel both filed appeals and both received settlements for the equivalent of two hundred thousand canada dollars each missus baccate the emigrant translate walked away with nothing yer went o o or under last remember i shuffled around a table piled high with forchudo and profalon manta came into the banquet hall and little kids ran past me to get their guest from him i was that the eighty nine annual by dato holiday party which as you can imagine is bigger than most holiday family gatherings missus magnate remember had twelve children and they had

about complex priest and looking pro published coming up something said in the middle of a race between one racer and another the gets it both of them for years after bit is a minute for chicagobubgridio when our programmed continues to s mar in li f my glass today programmed the l infuse we never you was suffices an show to totally worth it i mi todasho the long us is about people a n things that end of having consequences for years after we arrived at act three of our show act three meet ball in chain this history is about three little words altered at twenty five miles an hour during a sporting event and years and years of feelings sat those words unreached jerid marcel tells what happened en billy was twenty one when his whole thing happened he was competing in a big bike race a national chapingship it was in gansvill e is from button and when they got there he saw that the roles were pretty flat just home plus it was humid not too bed just home he was hey have a good she at this thing when the race starts everyone comes out blazing everybody was racing really aggressively in that race an there was just a lot of a tacks there really group of five riders and then it would become ten and then fifteen and twenty and and then a group would come out of that of five riders and if was cold a this a me a that cap can a breaking up and coming back together en was not considered one of the favorites but on this day in this race he was better than most he kept the tacking take silly stay near the front of the whole time and then at one point he realizes o man first now you would think being in first place is a good thing but for the majority of a bike race competitors play hop potato with the top spot chances are if we stand for as early on for too on e probably god to loose no you are definitely good to lose because the person in first takes on all the wind in sibling this is a big thing the front runner basically works the hardest and that makes the person that is peddling behind then have to work a lot less hard i mean scientifically it is thirty to fifty per cent less hard that is whine bike races you see bike was lined up behind to lead god i remember bending my head over kind of as i was peddling as hard as i could and looking behind me and i and ye just saw ism this kind of white and black checked jerry coming across to me and that was that was mike mike freed wen e knew who the favorite at this race word and this mike freed me was not one of them and sawing to siren it as hard as i could he would claws way back to and i just could not believe it he seemed done but he e just he just really tenacious he just card coming back en was worried now if he kept the lead blacking all the wind for mike he was going to get tired mike mike burst ahead and win can was let him get i font forbid i started coasting and then we were conn just is coasting and he would look back and the group would be getting closer to catching us and om and he said a you can wen you can wind three words i knew instantly what it meant he means if i stop attacking him and and let him stay with me ism and let him set in my draft then when we get to the finish line he will not spent me he will let me when the bikegrace now wen cycling this type of gentleman's agreement happens all the tie competitors will temporarily tree too trips they can conserve energy and stay ahead of the pack is a strategy sometimes this happens at the end was could end up deciding who winds hey this two of us here at the top i will not sprenon you if you tie on the wind resists for me we can beat everyone else en word for it i just put my head down and wen hart as i could i mean i felt i was just going fast and we had i we had a a a motorcycle a motorcycle refer that would i fall ow the race and they they come up and give you time splits on a they will either just tell you were sometimes they'll have a whiteboard that is all right they gap between you and the chasers and if they kept coming up and it would be you have twenty seconds and then it was thirty seconds and then forty seconds and they gap just kept going out an out you a may i remember with one lap to go and just feeling happy it'd already one the race and then we go round and then were coming towards the finish line and were you were getting ready to take a cold of the final left hand turn to the finish am and i turned to him and i was i you you remember a deal right and then mike just started spinning and a just remember watching him come by on my last and mi started cramping as we wen up that hill and i was just i manfully this is happening it felt this dream just all of a sudden cant o turned into a nightmare and i did not when the wikerace mike did mike one just belief quickly turn ta told rage i was upset remember riding up next to him and hitting him on the back and yelling something what the a first place takes home a jersey with stars and stripes captain a merino i watched them but mike's metal on and then i they gave him a jerry a been traditionally every body am raises their arms on the podium am after the national anthem place and i was standing right next to mike and i did not i would not hold his hand i did not raise my arm and that that was the photo of the race been was not having it he immediately told the report of what happened he was mike cheated he cheated his side of the story was that i there was no deal that i was just confused it when he said you can win this race he was none mono what i was saying is if we work together if you stop attacking me you can win stop attacking me stopped trying to get rid of me you can win if you just keep pulling i and and do not let this croup behind catch us as if to say came in you do in well keep it up might even when this thing i said you could win not that i to ousel hen races professionally forgot get s injured and becomes ha journalist of course he comer cycling mike he comes an a living the whole time the sort of circling each others orbits but of hitting crossing bats and annoyingly every one in the racing world really mike he had this nickname as meat ball and he had a blog and i there was a lot of sort of love for meat ball and i was a little bit resentful about that i was always thought they do not know the real mike he is a cheater he go he goes back on his word i would tell people i people would ask me about what happened in that race and i fee well mikes a a cheater and they just be but does not seem something he would do and if you no you do not know people would sort of look at me sideways when i was i i hate mike the laic nobody hates my freedmen what do you talking bout is li saying you hate mister rogers or i ye as time passes this race days a thorn an he inside i realize saying that sounds a high soulful pul player talking about competing in the state title a gave whatever else and then i boldly get ow kind of ridiculous and small that sounds as as in a dump tat it is it is weird it is just heard how how you cling to those things then one day about fifteen years later he is covering a race in colorado they were might lived he is almost sore bus o hanging out and then one of the guides on the bus was om going give my cable and see if he will he will come to the startling and and hang out with us on the is before we start and i might came on to the bus he it bet anyone look at each other and then he laughed and then when he came back i was ism standing outside the bus and he had a tray of coffees and he handed me one and i and think you was just i i want i just one o talk to you about that day i think about that race all the time and and i was man me too i remember seeing his lower lip shaking just shaking and that is my freed me that damn the bus mi did not fully fits up in apologize for my gits complicated here is ow he remembers those final moments of the race i was not me thinking ixioust man we made this left can turn in t o finished line is right you now within sight you knew two or fifty meters and before i knew a man i was sprinting event going up to the wine i knew what i was doing i was was wrong but i could i could not stop do why you did what you did or have a better understanding of why you did it who think there i was seventeen years old a time i i i just i i do not know it just his kind of one of those things that i do not have an answer i i try my best but i do not always do my best kind of than to was not pretty planed it was not done in a way to be nefarious it was not coming to tell the come to do this in the sprint it was not done in that way t was not done that way at all that is it i mean that is it that is the only time have ever cheated ever at a bicycle race ever he immediately regretted it did it change how you saw yourself as a aglet has a competitor it did change how saw myself i just i do not have anything else that that i can definitively say affected me the way that this had the ways the one thing that i knew that i had done wrong it ate at him he did not race for two years mi did not even tell any one for really long time testing up that he cheated would me that he was just that but cheater not a kid who lost himself for a minute in a race i dot i did not admit that this happened until you n ways with some one that i wanted to marry and then there was one other person that i told why was drunk and he is my best friend and never men as mush to any one else as it did to him but he could not let it go he thought about it for years after a cycling square was done his life sort of tent his marriage ended hid bottom he was living in a camper in his friend's land when he realize he wanted to reach out to en hat he missed his oppertony in the bus a our back here is been he was moving back i took to colorado he was driving back and he called me and that is when e said i ye i mean you're you are right it was a deal and and ism sorry i that i crossed the finishing first that i did and hold up my my under the bargain mike also once to give e in the jersey the captain america one he would stuff the deep in a drawer all these years they agree to meet up he drives this really reed up i think it is a up er pick up cuckoo something and you could her it rumbling down the street a the ye herm pull up and i mean i was cannon nervous and he came up and he was holding the jersey and i he gave it to me right away he looked me in the eyes and he said sorry i said thank you he had talked about he i think he had even called the governing body and asked them if there is anyway that the actual results could be changed and am ye h he was just every afford to make it riot i was just win when does that ever happened and some one's i i mean it on even know when have ever done that just made something that i did wrong right decades later this event set off by a few words had just ballooned and ballooned in their heads for bout fifteen years even though in the grand scheme of things this race did not matter this not it was the reason might me wit the thing indict means career e fixing it took something that is simple three words you were rang mattered myself his reporting could be heard on the podcast cot from to b and my see he and dilly the racer who got cheated out of his victory who wrote about this in bicycle magazine that is how we

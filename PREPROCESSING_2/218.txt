hopes and goals we have stories of deception and star cross haters babe easy chico the sis medical live i for glass her with us at one green level that titles can make more senses this story goes on to trust me on that in nineteen it six a man a woman ran into a years embassy in sienna said they needed asylum though from south care they told empty officials this incredible story of kidnapping and intrigue and being torn apart and thrown back together and years of dreaming about escape from the kidnapper well at the same time convincing the kidnapper that what they really want to do was stay with him nancy dyke has the story the woman who was kidnap was a famous south care an actress named chazan he i read a book about it by writer and film produced her name pal fisher he spent years were searching this story she was compared at the time to elizabeth tailor elizabeth tailor imagined it elizabeth tailor passed her prime but still famous from all her kinos had just disappeared ort i cha was that beautiful that much of an ikon to south care and she was gone she found out pretty quickly who had arranged this when the was kidnapped an it in seven et she was put on a boat and a boat went to campo harbor and north care and she actually has a photo which is in the book of her very first meeting with kimjongel he was there waiting for her off the boat wite a photographer and the had apstographer take a photo and and tun sender to her as till one a remember this exactly remember that time and he seen time had your kidnapdon brought to me and s the terrible picture and his beaming and smile and she as got her face covers for years her family and her country did not know where she was this happened in nineteen seventy eight cha was in her fifties and her first sickening guess as to why she had been taken was at him jonyell had brought her to north care to be a mistress for his father the great leader kill sung who was ruling the country at the time but no it seemed that kimjonell himself was just a very big fan of chaise movies he put her up in a fancy villa surrounded by walls and bard wire and arm guards she called it in her memoir less vagus meets vlatabostac him jowl brought her out to display at parties that was has life for five years in till one particular night and one special party the had been there for a while and she was standing in a somewhere in a enter of the room and she was used to these parties by this point exactly they we routine a shed started feeling repulsed by then but people got drunk and groped women and than they went on forever and somebody had already told her that you notice is going to be such a great evening for you and she nodded along because she was used to sort of my purely about everything the had no idea that him jill that night was planning to show off for the first time another person he had acquired the man who had directed or produced almost all of chaise movies her ex husband chinwag of chin and cha each did not know that the other was also in the country chin had been brought there the same way chat was but he tried to escape twice he was thrown in a prison camp for a couple of years the best way to thescrime chin seven speelbergs a sort of good comparison a sense as while he made films that were very good very commercial very popular and also produced o the people's films had his own studio and he was the most powerful popular tell anger and south care arguably in all of south stasis from most of t o sixteen into the seventeen and chin tends price that as tefillin prison camp carries for it ten days and villa they fatten them up treacherous storm to house he arrives at the part to you when it is already you now in full flow and he walks inside and as soon as he enters there is applause an whet an same thing an as thaysago you are in a prison camphor walk and a your the life of the party he runs applauding exacting in the pictures you no his face to look a mediated you can tell he is on through something terrible to see does fit now cha does not see shin come in she just hears people start applauding and chat is sort of even on faced by this anytime cam does anything people get up an applaud to she do not know why people are piloting shall cannot till somebody tuna says why do not you look happy looks here and she turns around and it seen five years chins got the marks of having been torture a prison camp she does not recognize him right away and and from that point on cam hung ill yo now was pulling them together an and e sot of shell shocked hugged one another and and whit than moved around blocking in an a movisin make him jungle and what night stand here sit here and here you stand next to me smile to cameras they were sort om the the guests of honor famous people do not get depict their fans him john ill was the superman who was also unfortunately the son of the all powerful leader of a totalitarian state shin and chat had made their best movies together him loved their movies and he wanted them to be a couple just they were in their hay day he arranged it parent trap style he told them at the party the guess what he had a newly remodeled villa for them that they would be living in from now on together making a joke i think he said something a the newly way gan wont to be alone now an why we're and had them takin to a car and by all accounts seemed extremely pleased and expected them to be equally and and it is it is the the moment right after that when try went back to the villa close about them door turn the falsetto on to toke an order to li dirt privately they turn the fosses on to they can whisper and stay of a private con exact and they just asked one another what had happened wan ad the way she described to dis or the lovely moment t which she asks him you know wat happened to you and he said a lot it'll tell you some other time and and he ask how at happened to you and she says a lot it'll tell you some other time and you a shin count how gingerly can asked her you looked very smile and happy and i just have you been brainwashed and and she made a joke about how the direct her can you recognize acting any more any sort of both of them were finally able to be canine with some one and and they spent the next several hours going through everything chin and chat made a long turn plan in a short turn plan long turn they were going to escape but they would wait till they could do it right they would not be caught their short turn plan involved a small taperquarter which they were able to get because one of the weird privileges of their captivity was that they were allowed to shop at a department store that sold things that were out of reach for most people on the country taperquarters him johngill had long and short turn plans of his own for them he told them that soon he would summon them to talk about his vision for their future then seven months went by and during those months chin and cha spent hours nearly every week and kids huge film arrive he wanted chin and chat to see it and be impressed and they were him did not just love their movies he loved all movies it was against the law for ordinary north careens to watch foreign films but him had set up a mass if boot legging operation running in countries all over the world he could build up his private collection with every movie ever made or as close as he could get the arrive was three stories high and heavily guarded at least two screening rooms all for him only and now for chin and chat him was bowled over by every detail the to way the building itself was set up to run and and you know admiration over how him had set up his own arrival and how well everything was kept seeking out over the air conditioning set things and how he was preserving the seteloide and how everything was catalogue than the staff and n how large it was how as it categorized was it by year or by gonna or by director and went by country first and then i think hit went by year as they got the man and and there is that lovely touch where the south great films in a kind of normal air conditioning room and and the north great films an amuse lavish store an screening room no bill din the films were dubbed into careen after being pains taking i transcribe sometimes by america he was an america defector he was one of several actually who would been there since nineteen sixty five and one of his jobs was transcribing america films but just bay listening because he was not allowed to watch them yet and he would not know that they were films because they gave him any other america effectors the audio for some reason they chopped up the filmshantracts into different bits in the long orders ta they would not no i get they en doing exactly enjoy them but he had this experience of of in a transcribing i an sunny realizing wat this is my point china cha spent dozens and dozens of hours watching one move after another in the screening rooms that the film arrive and in their villa which was also outfitted to show movies they did that for months until finally they got word him is ready to meet with you they went and they brought the catercorner and the second they walked in and chat had the tapequarter and her a perse an try flirted on and i think unexpectedly kimdrungell just talked at them mostly for two hours n a him final spoke very very fast and his mind soul have went all over the place and he had a very intimidate thing way their slash body guard who kept walking and the to refill drank and empty ash trace chin and chat wanted to record him for two reasons first they knew they might not be able to escape maybe they would be killed and their children and friends would just never know what hid happened to them or according if they could smuggle it out would at least be proof of where they would been the second reason to record him was that they knew that him would insist they say publicly that they had come to north care on their own voluntarily chin and chat were hoping that in their private conversation him might admit to having had them kidnapped and brought to him and he almost almost did by making a joke in the first couple of minutes of their conversation him talked about how he brought chat over first in order to entice chin to north care i say joke because him laughs as he says it and then all three of them lack it is tyrant management one o one he laughed you laugh the rest of what him said in that conversation well he said a lot of things but the main thing was north care an movies are bad and i am sick of it they would making g the same film over and over again and that they were too long and to boring and history lessons and and to mole dramatic and than says there is too much crying at in tell anybody but in much crying kimjhnyel told chin and cha that he knew he was the only person in the country who could get away with saying what he was saying and he told them not to repeat any it he said when it comes to movies we are in kindergarten and other countries south care are in college he said if we do not catch up in the next ten years our movies are going to be the worst of the worst movies in the world the problem he said just between us is the people in north care had it too easy they had things handed to them he have to hostile shin and chased there is a point an t this wet he tells them that i no an i think in says i parvis the bay says he not there no and entire and socialism to bunyubat ay hi as might might screenwriters i at they will wright something they'll get their passion o heather is make a film not at their passion they ha paid no matter what they that ages turn out that the work exactly an fallow orders i any seem very conscious that in i needs some one he he pushes himself more than that who is use to having to do more than that the earnest keep him john yet never mentioned another possible reason why north career's movies were wooden and unambitious fear he him john will had written the book the only book in north care about the right way to make movies and think about movies it is called on the art of the cinema its still in print everyone involved in north creeps film industry in the nineteen eighties had to have been aware of the potential consequences of doing something as unpatriotic or insulting as trying to realize their own independent artistic vision without kid's explicit blessing and his fathers it was better to be crappy than sorry the conversation continued chin and cha murmured that north area's citizens were fortunate to have a comrade leader who understood film well him johnyel agreed with his permission he three of them got into croaking specific films a north are in one called the starve care and while they were at it a soli at film called mother that had a dying scene they all agreed had been atrocious they were three move lovers talking about what they loved and him john yells big plan for chin and cha was that he wanted them to make north careen movies good that they could compete with films coming out of the west and when awards and be shown in theatre all over the world he wanted cha to act to me movies and chin to direct them chin could have his own film company just he used to have chin wanted to call the company shin film a very bold request in the circumstances he can nothing in northwest had been called anything other than e not the work is paradise that at a part this it a supremely a this porno kimalson university am was a big feel but is also no very telling of shin that even in this several situation his first instinct is a kicaoca it can w give the company my name in inn in film nor some one is always using somewhat and often people are using each other and we do not find out til the end who gets away with what chin and cha knew that their only chance of escape would be to convince him john ale to let them film and work in the west him get ill knew that if he wanted good movies he had to give shin an cha enough freedom to create them all three of them wanted to make great movies but same bed different dreams cam danger on of the films for his own purposes and need of the films to get away from him and its almost his ambition of making film with the world of respect completely overtook any sense of logic the first fission and chat am shaw had sequences that they shot and east in rope standing in for the vague and i now the showed him dung i the film am he said this is fantastic it is a european film it is the best thing weever made ballad him start showing it and i never cross his mind that they had done exactly what he forbidden his own film makers to do for ever for reason they been forbidden to show the world outside north care they showed people things that they had not been able to see i n almost in a lifetime for some people in north care about nineteen eighty three nine into for and a seconds that film sir playing in minimal in north care you know the north green audiences did not take in necessarily the hirproduction valleys am all they could talk about was that first ten fifteen minutes shot on the streets of page where you know key wait the buildings look amazing people walking into business as they dress differently withal cars wet that is what we had an impact because up until then they had been told you are the luckiest people in the world you know the workers paradise is the only place in the world with people have peace and freedom am and and sly they saw that that was not true how do that thus for people thought i was lucky enough to an meets and speak to people who would escape from north care who were in a variegates at the time hat they were able thee washes films am and has another at german receptor and in japan cold the hands crasher who ton quite the love of talk to the fact as about the same thing and at one of the things that is fascinating is that shin and chase films had a huge impact straight away you the given people a navigates thirties who would never seen anything of the outside world they had not been filters but the was not just the people soundly were able to see footage of the outside world that i a chin and cha made am a filmdom love love my love which was literally the first love story and north care an culture post nankin forty five there was note about love of the leader a love of the party was liters the firs some people able to go both senior and see something those about two people falling in love and it was the first time in teen ages had pictures on their wall of of a mathneid of anybody other than the leaders shin directed seven films for kimjanyel and then in march nineteen eighty six he and cha went to a hotel in sienna for some film business manage to grab a separate taxi from their north green minders sped to the a embassy and ran in they were briefed by the s a a and later by south care and intelligence and they were interviewed by the fashion post and other media outlets and stories about north care are always hard to fact check for parts of shin and chase story there recollections there interpretations are all there is but the movies exist the costing of him exists him genial had told shin and cha in the recording that when people asked them why they were in north care they should say freedom for true artistic freedom for chin there were some bitter truth to that because south care at the time shin an cha were kidnaped had been a military dictatorship with very heavy handed censors shin studio had been shut down by d the south careen government in nineteen seventy five his career was in ruins in north care shin got to make films again he wrote unabashedly in his autobiography how much he had loved making movies there shin always spoke of north care as the place where he can of a that the place he associated film freedom with and creative freedom worth because he can ask for anything and data he asked and one upside he he pe asked for and a model train to blow up for a scene and he was given a real train packed with explosives on rails to blow up if he wanted to and if he asked for a win machine he want helicopters and if he ant end fakes know i had betters flown to a mountain you knows no expense tare you not him doing ell felts the larger than life film producer they hereabout and he did not have the downsides that from producer usually has because if om produce yes testy no every now and we don't hae enough money we all have enough time shin in cha had remarried in or care it kimjenials suggestion and it edit of being a real marriage they were together till shin died in two demand six these seem to have been each others big love in life besides movies although shin love movies more than cha did maybe a lotmore and the shared memoir of their time and in north career it goes from his voice to her voice back and forth and count of the second they star making films her voice kind of disappears entirely and it is all his from then on and ye know it is about escaping but in equal measure at about making the films almost o this it he's writhing a memoir of his time and holly rod or something has eighty eight years old living in south care when pal was were searching his book he interviewed her for it and he asked her about shin and the movies they made in north care and and you know wat i modern spoke there you could sense the impatience that she had had been able to get out of there three years earlier and no mate any of the films she had been very happy to do and him not som to send him not much even great love cannot protect to you from the other person wanting what they want any hat ink is one of producers of our shell pol fisher's book about all this is

extract on a cat well i a yo she had been there of i is tat yo and nobody knew anything about her or they get i mean and i just of just left and then i photograph the ora jessamine goes home to new mexico but she just cannot let this go she still dealing with the fall out fighting with hurts and a few other places over bills and she decides to do a bunch of things that most of us would not do first busman sends a letter to arrant a dress saying basically i know it you did and here is what it is done to me she includes an envois for twelve hundred dollars the total cost of her round trip flight to californium combined with an hourly hate for her time and then months later jessamine finds herself back in san francisco for work and she picks up array's trail again she has a list of old address's arranabof debt may be twenty of them she got from a private investigator and she starts going from place to place visiting bran's old apartments a one point jessamine pulls up to this gorgeous building overlooking the abridge at the time postman was seven months pregnant and she thinks well maybe i can use this to my advantage i went to the front desk the we cured officer and was hey om as you can see him pregnant i really have to go the bath room ism looking for my cousin are in heart but om i need he us a restfram first you mind and she was errand heart ah yah i know for she used to live here the woman actually knew her boy friend at the time sh to guide now i do not know for sure and it is just bye know gossip bat am i had heard that a she had had several thousand dollars of his possessions arewhatever that she took off way that never came back and i was oh wow o key she is now in she sick well you ran or whatever an else oh had totally bran's old boyfriend did not live there any more sugjestaman took a few pictures inside the building and then moved on to the other addresses all of them were deadens no mean there any part of you that kind of feeling a creep i knew it was crate i knew thug it was not healthy i did know that but i could not let it go as just something the at some one did to me that i had no control over postman hates feeling she is lost control and whenever it happens ever since she was a tea anger she is dealt with the same sort of way when she was around eleven her dad abandon the family her malm and her three longer siblings then they lost their house and for a while they all lived in a van with her cat and dog her dad he did some pretty extreme things my a tried have me kidnap but he tried to kid nephew or sent some one he tried to have some one coming i him not at my school and then again later in apart and d my family we ended up going for o some time up to canada that he could not find us later jessamman's malm got really sick and suddenly she found herself taking care of her entire family at some point as a way to deal with a the choose she started taking pictures things an ambulance driving her faraway screwing matches between her sisters trash strewn all over their trailer home she methodically document when she was going through and it gave her a sense of control she continued to use her camera that way is in a dull at one point eight years ago we had a brief scare that reminded her of her dad a random incident r she wondered if he was following her again from that night on i had not i my had i wanted to find him but i did not want to find him and talk to him what is something that you wanted just i wanted to see him i wanted to first just find him i just want to know i could find him i did i did bunch of searching and back on chacksin gouglestuff and he was about the and half hours north of where i lived desman was living in garland at the time and her dad was just north of her living in a condo on the medicine o coast she started making covert trips up there and she never knew how explain this to her friends she kept at simple and told them oh ism going to spend the woken with my dad which technically was true just that she did a wearing a blondwig and from a distance why do tellphotolanders really far away i was out in the woods i could get a mile or if i needed to om what did you see he was on the deck he was out for walk he would go to the him taking out the trash he never saw you no no when you are stocking her dad of your following your dad observing him observing him what did that feel felt really good to see him and him not now i was there because wham because i had some knowledge about who he was and what he was doing it was a one way mirror om i could see in and he could not see me and it felt i had some kind of power oi do not know much about the identity that business but ism guessing that the ideal taken does not own camera that can photograph you from a mile away two years after dustman got that phone call from the police she was still trying to track errand down and in february two thousand thirteen her private investigator let her know that he found errand she was back in jail and about to be released jester went with him to a jail and down town san francisco she bought a telephoto lens an the video camera the two of them sat around in is ass you be for hours waiting her meet i had a contact told them arrow might come out the back fully one by one people were coming out and the entire time ism just photographing i is lens pointed at the door and terrified that she is not an come out she's not to come out we are not con finder and we see her eaarranhart walked right past her car she end a couple bagging off her shoulder and she was dressed jussive thought but she was going to a night club tight lucks her shiny pants and wedge boots immediately i thought only gosh we we do kind of look similar she was a similar build to me which is sort of tall is fie sevenfivy but no fuller figure wider hips and i could see that she had a roundish face i do and she has this bright orange hair and i just thought of my days and my teenage ears dying my hair that exact orange the superbright orange and i just felt this uncanny connection to her i really did and then from there on for the next several hours with just a ran oo o o tan two other pi's working with them and a spare car they all trail thread whose first stop was a convenient sore or she went in toy cigarettes an the lighter she hung outside for a few minute smoking then on a public bus array got off right in front of a good millstone walked in right away pe says jump out and going there go after and was oh she talk to er i a i thin thinking oh of he is a note o do not talk to her just just go in get your photographs get a good look at her just go gococotand jumping out freaking out all my body just leaving me here with her what like and then i see one angel in there the other pas yea i ope ism looking at them for kind of use and they are not remotely giving me any kind of use and then i just go for it and i go up to her and i do not say anything to her i just stand across right across the rack of clothes and the good will from her as she is going through pulling clothes all looked changing her mind very expressive oh now i would never wear that like a kind of cure in my mind what she might be thinking from her expression and ism at an angle where i feel she cannot really tell what ism doing made ism just checking my e nail or something ism just looking at my phone and i take some photos of her but how nervous are you mind you are literally now you are face to face ism shaking ism very nervous definitely and i think there is a part of me that is still thinking i could just talk to her rate now errand he errant i could just say that i i could here myself sang a in heart i i know you pow we do not recognizing i knowing do not know me i but i am lair a dustmen level a and you use my idea to do a number of things but i just the power for me was in seeing her without her knowing that i was seeing her then she disappears into the into the dressing room and eats when the other pane comes her to me and says she steeling clothes it was in what to i just needed to get out of there i was overwhelmed i was feeling really om is feel really sad for her and i did not want to feel sad for her o i wanted to feel angry at her it was hard to maintained the anger because she was looking at grand and remembering things she would done when she was young and her family was broke i had shop lifted nice cheese or i a literally stole the angola things that i thought and associated with class middle tan upper middle class and i think that is what really was giving me this sympathy for ran heart was i could identify in a way with the desire to be some one else i could see how a path in my life could e led to my bet in that moment i i really could but it was i guess a little disappointing i could guess it was a little oh i kind of wanted it to be she was a criminal and did something bad to me and it just was not that non of that satisfaction of i got er it was just sorn of this weird its transition and anger was starting to be sort of replaced with empathy what jessamine did tax does not sound empathetic at all when he first hereabout it but for just then it was the logical end of her search she wenthrough the hundreds of images she taken and she put together a gallery exhibit i had survellant shots of grand the court summons place reports bills and pictures of places where her idea had been used she done this once before with the surveillance motive she took of her dad in fact her whilelett was stolen while she was setting up that exhibit which is what sent her down the rabbit hole of trying to find grand in the first place she called the new show dear ran heart and one of the ideas on display was a sealed letter and a plumy glass box she asked the people at the gallery to give it to ran if she ever showed up there it was not a dramatic letter just a way of telling grand that she would been looking for want to talk jessamine did not see putting grand's name an photos out in public as revenge but not every one sought that way you are victim a vicinity that wit you consider trying down the take and turning the table this is from the to day show in an fact some have described is voted level followed and photograph the woman who told wallet and then her identity i reached out to ran heart through her probation officer to talk about all this i sent a couple eels listening everything dustmen says about her but around never got back to me i could not verify whether she was responsible for bill's dustmen got from hurts and wholefoods er any of the unpaid parking tickets and told or whether she shop at did from goodwill or stole from her boy front

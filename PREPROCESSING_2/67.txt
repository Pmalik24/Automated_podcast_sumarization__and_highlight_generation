that existential crisis the existential crisis is that a lot the people agree with been lawn now if you find yourself in large to skills agreement with same ben laden one of most evil people to ever live you might want a preexamine your on bialies but instead people are starting to think that maybe been laden was good a shall been laden had some point is sing a lot of this on tiptoe in fact much of this is happening on ticktock tat the guardian you a guardian which had the entire text of the letter posted had to take it down from their website because they say that they did not want their top trending piece to be same ben when's two thousand to letter talking bout the evils o the west here is a more these tiptoe reactions best friend ages read a letter to america have you read that a if

some on olterbe here if were on to call same been lotion derris is the america government and that is the point that is the point we have taught entire generation of young people that atom ben laden has a point is bend lot of talk in the aftermath missed october seventh attack about why is it the young people in the west america members of of the european community why are many young people siding with commons and the answer of course is because we as a civilization have taught them beside with common we have taught them at the west is in gerent evil or the very least morally equivalent with derris on the other side of the equation another havebeen bribed from that well hey been taught that for years an yours an yours when they read o sub and man's letter yo that they are look people wore wondering if note eleven happen today how would young people reaction the answer is a lot of people would be pro dumb and laden they are now here is som more of this to d there's anna when i got the news since o those eleven we goyim celebrating two thousand twenty two thousand twenty three reading his letter to america knowing he was right knowing who's r lav been loden was right guides can these tick that us are everywhere an me take full on trending topic on tie to again here is some more no one in america ever really was giving me in formation of wit to the topic why do not eleven hope n also why do the ninny three all the world says are hopping the america people were never actually given logical reason it was just those people has because of our freedom and that was the propagate the cat it is western freedom if the western ideals of freedom whatever that means and it is freedom for white people g again oppressed here's is oppressor and the more unsuccessful you are in this matrix more evil you are in this matrix the more you are not out the more your oppressed because we have to see your side of the argument and again you being an press person you have the ability to stand up and then destroy your oppressor of course these people are procomas today they are proven latten yesterday here is some more of this how can lemme get this strait wet me get the start i not san in than i just what to make are that a my facts are in order not say anything was is won to make share correct and it certain alter tibial america was taken down after lately being on the guardian let tavern twenty years an which as o a ben loden the that as was killing of civilians y san hay you america you takes such gradin yearsistemen democrats you pay a tact is youalacer leaders that is why i also who yo account all and that is why killed america billions rat we defend tot a derris here in camera a but when a same argument we a sin a argument is us that its aha that we level gaze we alow is real to level gas be was they elected most whin you twenty ears gone fifty pop fifty present of their population is miners and the elected a leader who didn't to everything they said they origan calling does not represent everything they said they re present won how can we as america possibly empathized with that but acts ability argument her israel leveling at right they elected an most they nobody nobody including these really government is that won quote leveling goa by targeting village but this the whole case again the whole case here is a bunch of people w the the west that is what this about now let us go through some of the ben loden letter exerts here is what they say and get you can see the metrics that benlateon was trying to create in two thousand one two thousand to and in the nineties and you can see it now materialized on the streets of parts of onion of washington d c in new york here is what benlottan said this again back into thousand to why are we fighting an opposing you the answer is very simple because you attacked us and continue to attack us right their victims a benlaton was victim you attacked us in palestine the creation the israel is a crime which must be a raced he brings us both laughter and tears to see that you have not yet tired of repeating your fabricated lies that the news have a historical right to palestine as was promised to them in the tora anyone who disputes with them on this alleged fact is cause ofvantisemitism it is the museums why the inheritors of moves it is to notice here that he shifts ben latten does into thousand to from the argument that palestine must be establish to israel must be disestablished and there is no jewfish right anywhere they are right he is in favor of the destruction of the state of israel an the murder of all the news and all these people inthestreets to day they agree this is why they are chanting from the river to the to the see palestine must be free benlatdoen continues under your supervision consent and orders the governments of our countries with which acts as your agents attack us on a daily basis these governments prevent our people from establishing the atomic chorea using violence an lies to do is again westerners particularly western lefts they read that mist ell whale there are a lot of tyrannies over in the midst that but benlatdon is calling for the establishment of his comic chorea these calling for the establishment of an cranial style theocracy does the western left care about that of course not because again what the western left holds in common with ben loden is a hatred for the west that is the thing the matters benlatton continues it we commanded by our religion and intellect that the oppressed have ta right to return the aggression here is that matrices oppress oppressor metrics that all this is dependent on do not await anything from us but we hod resistance in revenge the america people have the ability and choice to refuse the policies of their government and even to change it if they want the america people cannot be innocent of all the crimes committed by the america and the news against us which is his excuse for killing massive numbers of civilians in the world trade enters and the pentagon i that is that is the reason why been gotten did that he says it is saddening to tell you that you are the worst civilization witness by the history of mankind the news have taken control of your economy you eve destroyed nature with your industrial waste and gasses more than any other in history despite this you refused to sign the koto agreement that of course at the time was been loden attempt to cudgel the photo grutatunburgs of the world into line your law is the law of the rich and wealthy people who hold sway in their political parties and fun their election campaigns with their gifts behind them stand the news who control your policies median economy your hear echoes of that when both the entire radical left the to sea wing of the am critic party and in the isolation is right benlatens has you have used your force to destroy mankind more than any other nation and history the freedom and democracy that you call to is for yourselves and for the white race only that is the appeal to black lives matter photo black lives matrices this is twenty years before that what happens in glantonimo is a historical embarrassment to america and it is values and it screams into your face you hypocrite what is the value of your signature on any agreement or treaty what is the a peal of all this the answer is really obvious ben lowdown is expressing the ideology of the current barbaric collision dedicated to destroying the west which is why the current barbaric poison dedicated to destroying the west on stumbling online lowdown's writings is finding a new hurt why would not young people love his words they have all been taught his precept at their universities all of them except tho part about chorea law and killing all the gave people and not being able have sect it never you want they can put all that a side because anti western solidarity is the important thing the oppressed class must come together to destroy the oppressors that is what is behind the ticktock than china of course is pushing it because china hates the west in china is of course running ticktock and young people are pushing it because we have trained in the west an entire generation of young people to despise their own civilization that is on us as a culture should we then be

radical left to try to push the more moderate left into mirroring their room ass position and the way they are going to do that is by again playing the oppress remember in the leftist matrix the more angry you are the more evil you are the more criminal things you do the more this is evidence that you're oppressed now in reality it is the opposite the reality is that actions of evil criminal actions for example violent actions they tend to make you poorer they tend to make your life worse but because the left does not believe in personal responsibility at quart level they believe that basely life is a thing that happens to you because of that when they see somebody who is poor and angry it is that the poverty is causing the anger not that the anger is causing poverty and when you have protestors in the streets are getting violins the lefts almost immediate response very often is to say well those people must be angry for reason and the reason is because we need to make concessions to the that is the purpose of having these violent protest last night according to the associate press police and protestors clashed outside the once head quarters during a demonstration for a sense fire in the barbitone israel and come ass the latest reflection of boiling tensions over the bloody conflict by he way the only boiling tensions are coming from one side and literally the day before there was a giant three hundred thousand person rally on the washington mall pro is rally peaceful loving america flags zero islands zero that was not a boiling crowd the boiling crowds are the ones in onion or assaulting police officers the boiling crowds writhe ones last night or assaulting police officers ism old enough remember when the was considered a bad thing on jaguar sex now it is considered you do not just count of deregor scores of democratic representatives in candidates including house minority leader hokum jeffreys were inside the building for a campaign reception when twas interrupted by chancing outside protestors said they wanted to block entrances and exits to force politicians to en counter they are could light vigil however the situations swiftly revolved capital police set about a hundred and fifty people wrelegally and violently protesting in the capitalwhol neighborhood of washington protestors then beats blame police for the violent here is ut what it looked as these craze leftists and o the radical muslin allies decided that they were going to attack the the front of the dance building possess can insurrectionary does not it rah here no nothing does not mater totally fine just can a point out at this point that done this is not covered pretty much at all in he mainstremedia it's buried the mainstremedia now f you imagine pro israel protesters outside the icy calling for more support for israel attacking police officers do mouthing out my make the from pages literally everywhere the answer course is yes when see a violent protest outside the d n c and is by left wingers it is considered normal these yen that o presser o press matrix is strong the have no systemic community to it at all the capital offices ended a having to go into lock down and again this is just the latest example for over over in berley for example left wingers we are throwing money at city council members the implication of course being that it is u money that is responsible for the lack of the cease fire which of course is insane here re these anti jewfish protestors in berley throwing cashed city council members instead again there there they are delight delightful human beings meanwhile forty groups to colombia university have not proposed to a push divestment from the state of israel they call themselves the colombia university o partied at divest ay coalition of student organizations that see palestine as the vanguard for the collect give liberation that is right compass is the vanguard is the palcinian authority a terror script sos palisnian s lomicehod quit we are continuation of the venom antiwar movement and the movements dives from a parties and south africa we support freedom an justice for the palestinian people we know the true collective safety will arise when everyone has access to clean air clean water foodhousing education health care freedom of movement and dignity now never mind the commossis deprived it is people of literally all of those things for last twenty years while building terratunnels and shooting rockets at the news does not matter the students at colombia have decided to to face down the quod pianist project according to reports from the w echo a palisinian chad is killed every ten minutes these attacks are explicitly connected to israel attempts to anal and ethnically lens more palestinian land again historically ignorant ridiculous israel literally pulled out of the gosstriptit vans of hives did not want anything to do with this area it does not matter the entire agendicere is an anti western agent is not chest in anti israel agent how do we know because they say quote we believe in liberation all systems of oppression are interlink the fates of the people of palestine curtistands suntan conquer mini ireland porterikacorea guava hey how cashier cuba turn island and other colonized bodies are inter connected there some things on this lessthat are they are rather interesting apparently i they want how to be turned over and core to whom i seem they mean south core i turn it over to the works what what would exactly they talk about there we are committed to creating a molt generational interjectional accessible space dedicated to fighting for abolition trains national feminism anti capitalism an colonization and also the combating anti blackness queer cobia is lamaphobia and antisemitism now again rational people look at that listen they go wat the they look at that list of get hands from this colombia anti partite coalition the go i noticed the you have a few things here that conflict with one another when you say queer phobia and his lamaphobia back to back it is weird because let us be real about this radical muscles hate gave people and tried to kill them s that is strange but that is not the point the point is it is coalitional it is all coalitional strategy we keep each other safe we do not believe that prisons police profit over people clitoris more colonialism or imperialism will keep us safe we reject the you us emigrations and customs enforcement agencies caponizing of the united states is a systemogration laws to prevent our international comrades and peers from speaking up they believe in open borders we believe in the right of self determination land back the right of return from palestine to turtle island a noticed by thewy none of these people giving up their land to native america we believe in solidarity and the power of relationship building we believe and collectivity an that is the that is the that is the stick ere it's a coalitional strategy and age that coalitional strategy sounds an awful lot likes been lot in this is i from ben satin was doing the koto protocol routine payback wen it is why he was doing the anti colonialism routine way back wen now by the way there has never been a more colonizing religion in world history than is mum ever it is lot is a colonizing religion by nature if you think that erotic peoples we are native to spain you are out over mind if the reality is that virtually all religions have at times been colonizing but the arabia peninsula was completely dominated bit is lam since the seventh century and pretending the there is no colonialism in herrenton is louis just historically ignorant of course there was it is why they still consider in radicalislomic circles the world to be divided between day all isle and day all hard great the idea of the world governed by is lam and the world not governed by is lam and the ideas that eventually everything is can come under the dominion of is lam when you have this group pushing against colonization obviously there is a lot of a double thing right there happening but that is on the point it does not have to be internally consistent it has to be externally consistent meaning its enemy has to be consistent and that is the idea and that is why you see this coalition building happening and just one second will talk about how far this is gone in democratic circles to the point where obviously they not only are quite supportive of som comose forces they are perfectly million cover for congress people lie re sheeted to leave who's pretty obviously in league with commons supporters get's that one second first as a daily wirelessener your notches and formed your also engaged you value freedom and personal responsibility which is why you need to check out medicare mediocre is a community base approach to health care that lines up with the principles you believe in your value's matter with

leafstalk while respected member of the democratic canvas despite being censured by congress the she was asked yesterday five straight times if those antistatic she ignored the reporter obviously esmintepecra to the try tong the egrets the we ti i derris to call for the tenniside of the this pole tepreceis tight we how the that try ton eatetematic carinate thematic ingression alone callrinton why intetematic congress omen thong of interpretentinshis on the pone are you strange taco come you knowing tole are you ante thematic congress o man into the elevator that is not a surprises acticoleas been given the fact that according to the ceric post tole is a member of the casebook group palistinian america congress who founder maker medal radar has referred to his rallies as not real news and question whether the holcosst really happened that casebook group which to leave join six years ago has posted several images of comes fighters following the terrors brutal assault that left at least twelve hundred at across southern israel a member of the calcine america congress posted on our tower twelve quit we do not want to throw you in the sea we want you to ride it back from where you came sharing a picture of an elderly is rely woman identified as a holicossorviver held hostage by comas another post on that same casebook group showed a commas tear alongside a list of achievements reached by the resistance in northern occupied palestine poleax of course fully in league with all of this not not a great shock is nosy the comas canvas rides fully within the democratic party at this point yesterday she treated out the new money step again apace has said that they are going to dedicate a lot of money to getting rid of congress people who a out a lined with comas and she thinks that that is a truly just a reflection of new a bad u money what criticism of these rely governments virtually upon existent in yours parties but apparently that is not enough that aspen a hundred million dollars to in seat the few who believe in palistinian human rights and a sense fire that most america already support the acceptable level of decent is zero well that's heard because i see that pack is actually not launching primary challenges against the vast majority of democrats virtually all democrats there only targeting the people who actually our members the comosqua but again the idea is it is it is that corrupt jaw money that lose is really upset about speaking of which twenty four members of the commas canvas have now signed a letters to present an by an an secretary of state blinking expressing deep concern about the intensifying war in goo and calling for areas fire they am they then commit the moral sin of equivalent between c moss and the is really defense forces that of course of signed by all the usual suspects all the people who you would see ye again no shock there the brutish labor party experiencing similar convulsions cure starter is suffering a major labor rebellion in triton over a gonna sense fire not fifty six of his appears voted for in immediate sense fire ten of the party's front ventures those are people who our sort of spokes people for labor have left their jobs over the vote including eight shadow ministers and though the left is turning self apart over all of this because again the left has no systemic immunity at all two the sooner ban loden interjectional crusade they have know i punitive that because they too believe hat the left is in recently food that must pay a deep and abiding price and that battle is just going to get more and more pitched it is it is stunning to watch to play out in real time but again this is the wages of wast that is a apologetic about it s own existence for decades on end now meanwhile the media are targeting where they think the anti semitone this and they the media have been very very generous tor comose in attacalites the media have been granting every counts of credibility they can to the going minister of help they've been granting every piece of credibility they can to every lie coming out from comose they have been stamp that they've been stamping for a sense fire and claiming that israel committing war crimes indiefines of all facts on the ground the media love that sort stuff they are doing colossus work i mean really crosses proving and work but they think they know where the true anti schematism lies the truant schematism apparently lies with wait fort wait for wayferit donate trump now the other day dona trump made a rather intemperate comment during one of his speeches now that that is nothing new we should not be shock by this everybody clutching at their pearls its tiresome as have said many times before dona trump's epitaph may and up reading dona trump forty fifth president of the united states he set a lot of stuff but in any case cure is what he actually said that set the intrnette blaze sure hiristonal trump the other day the great shilangaris rid like every or and under action the forgotten man and woman will be forgotten on o be forgot with your help you love an you o we will put a ma a first and to day is betray in one of our are stern on bettering that we play to you that we will rude out the communes moons ratios and the radical we the at in german within the con in of a cutin the li and stay clean elections and will do anything possible they will do anything withe leglyelyly to destroy a ma and to destroy the main to now he is reading from is hell a prompter the mean that that that is actually part of the speech tan's not the best use of language the use of language german it is do redolent of bad things it is ugly but the media were not just content to say that that is ugly language that is reviled of of a demagog see of the past the immediately went alltheway they went directly to hitter and then just go to hitter hm with hitter fifty one times is their favoritething i gated trump because he said lord german is just hitter they here he go here is your beloved media of course its trump is a not time again let till hitter act i do not think a typobolic to say that my that is mostly any hitter languor trump e pinny for hitter with away covered under an umbrella he heredity we er words listen a o hitter loudly elected a echoing the hateful record o idol hitter the echoes hitter at a the kind of language hitter and in come the german an a hitter n muscle et the horrifying e tat the as egis going polo hitter om hitter's germany i see to ay r the record that the term vermin with really effectively you data hitter anchor dictate hitter with language evoking authoritarian figures fatal hitter an at hitter tonal trumparadan the autocratic languid a all hitter men t goes on long is over and over and over and over vital in this is the stake hitter hitter hit now let it be said at this point tonal trump is not enough hitter not only is not tonal trump enough hitter he is the most pot israel and projewish president in america history baron but here in lies the true insanity many of the same members of the media tone policing trump as hitter have been simultaneously proposing the actual movies of to day come ass in their supporters the gout my lesson and the rest of the host at a mass an be see who seem to have made it their likes mission to down play colossus evil in order to establish moral equivalents with the jewfish state and they are the first on the band wagon to sniff out filarian references except for the people rashly love hitter of course the people of she love hitter well that they just have me legitimate grievances some the same dynamic has been striking you on musk f the course last twenty four hours to most made a rather large twitter booboo last night somebody twitter posted the following message quote jewfish communities have ben pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites that they claim to want people to stop using against them ism deeply disinterested in giving the tiniest leap now about western jewfish populations coming to the disturbing realization that those words of minorities that support flooding their country do not exactly them too much you want truth said your face there it is s that was the tweet musk than treated you have said the actual truth and this set everything blaze it is true obviously that certain jewfish organizations have brought into and promoted things diversity equity and inclusion which are grow distortions of theamerican dree nobody hates d my more than i do there are certain jewfish groups that a liberal an plantation who have supported that sort of stuff many of those groups have also push for open borders it is also true that some of those organizations are now realizing post october seventh that actually open tomagration for people hate news on an interjectional basis with pretty stupid the or open with the original tweet is that it label's jewfish communities on mass my community for example pretty jewfish has always opposed d e i and open boarders in fact most orthodox communities do presumably then musk was reading t at the term jewfish communities and instead seeing the letters any ell and indeed that is exactly a musk then clarified he said quote the adieu unjustly attacks the majority of the west despite the majority of the we supporting the jewfish people in israel this s because they cannot by this own tenets criticize the minority groups ware their primary threat it is not right and it needs to stop and then musk continued you are right that this does not extend to all jewfish communities it is not just limited to the dell says a much more specific point and it is certainly true there are a lot of liberal jewfish organizations that supported a lot of the same policies that have now imported a lot of people who really hate tunes and westerners into the west and a lot o the very same people who are pushing d i interjectional politics are now realizing the wages of that that is true the original tweet was wildly overload but a huge number of people in the media decided now was the time to link musk in the alright and the called jewfish question and support the notion the musk is some sort of script not now it is not a coincidence again that a lot of the people sewing just that are happily calling for israel to sense fire in swarth moss see very often antisemitism becomes a political football when ye can hang the label on donate trump or melon musk and ore on the left you doit however when your fort denounce process protesters shouting from the river to the sea palatine must be free suddenly get a little shy thus the same media leaping on both trump and musk has been down playing the open new hatred and massive promos protests around the globe instead propagating liked bout israel supposed human rights violations instead their focusing in on their political enemies trump and musk and seeming them the acolytes of idler meanwhile the actual hitter alkalizes or out their waving mine comthilic those people i mean they are oppressed and brown it might have more bight to hit trump and musk for supposing antisemitism if these people actually spent some actual time talking about the people who actually hitter on planet earth wore right now holding some two hundred forty news and others hostage in goa and killed twelve hundred people and have subjected the gozstrip to complete hellish tyranny for last twenty years but a lot of the same people are totally silent it one

breading bring back our girls remember this hashing bring back our girls many out that that hashhanging can do bleep and did not work by e why a hundred plus of those girls are till missing but that is not the point the point is the celebrity class was up in arms over the kidnap girls as they should a been right hash tag up bring back our girls that was the thing all the big slabs all of them universally question have we setae look at this have we seen any any of these same celebrities holding up bring back our baby signs for america being held the hostage and fossa actual america and for all the talk of people about america firsinsthe i just to point out there are currently dozens of america being held hostage bahamas right now the we have seen members of the media gal king lecture a jewfish father whose eight year old daughter is currently being held bacamases whit the media do media are not holding up those sins for this guys kid but they are at tempting to cudgel this guy there there tempting it this guy whose daughter is being he by compass to say that israel should stop trying to kill members of compass but now this seems to me all about politics what to you say about that you have ani see children and holist pakistan an tear dying and the sent is real y children who are sin and no one seems to be able to say enough stop tat ism tho interests in the poetic veto my hunky concern is we ting unreal back in this is naan the media are literally trying to push a man whose daughter is being held hostage by a terrorist group into saying that israel is doing the wrong thing by going after the terrace roup not sing that time from gel can right there that bring back our our babies sign not seeing it here the thing the is tons of new hatred on plan earth plenty to go run any one who spending their days going after dona trumpet melon mas antisemitism while leaving comas untouched is pretty obviously concern about something very different from new hatred pretty clearly an came meanwhile with regard to the latest in this war jobidon is playing outsides a that that is tholingwy to read this cordon just greenlet ten billion dollars being handed over to iron lade on tuesday the secretary of state sense congress a recommendation for one hundred and twenty day waver allowing the rocky government to transfer ten billion dollars and frozen fun to the idols in iron the capital is rock to payments for eonian electricity but is being held in in escrow accounts the administration says the waver was necessary to preserve rocks electricity supplies but ta that means that there is cannas all that money for terrorism because tat is what they are doing the united states has been under attack from terrain militia groups throughout the stalest mostly control baron on fifty six occasions yours positions an rock and serial are now under attack from the agrarians fifty nine you service personal had been injured in those strikes and a jobidon is signing wavers to transfer billions of dollars to the cranial government even as the baronial government is weak the dona government has been tremendously weaken there is a port yesterday out of iron international english that actually the iron supreme leader ill the company one of the tolls he delivered a clear message to comas leader small honey he said we will not warned about your attack and do we love you and your best friends but high five as you drown which makes perfect tens and as have suggested since the beginning of the war the the most plausible explanation for what actually happen is that on greenlet an attack from comas in attempt to scuttle the south piece plan that was being put on the tablesteen israel and sad arabia broker by the by administration they want to kill that do they said to comas do an attack killabuncho news hope that israel goes in strong and tat will scuttle the deal but what that did not count on is comose being successful enough to kill twelve hundred people and take two hundred forty hostages necessitating the complete obliteration of come they just figured compass would lived fight another day there would be another sense fire come would continue to maintain its power in the gocestrip instead of iron gaining the death of the south piece plan they got that but they also lost one of their biggest pawns on the board in commas and then the question became to they wish to lose other pieces on the chessboard because the unspoken reality of this current midday conflict is that the actual serious three to israel is actually not comas in the gosistripright now is casually on israel northern boarder which has two hundred thousand rockets pointed at israel including fifty thousand highly sophisticated rock it is capable of get targeting which means can hit towers in tellofeve not the due rocket they are being fired bahamas smart rockets they are being fired from southern lebanon into israel as we seem deterrents does not really tend to detour terrors groups when push comes to shave and israel at some point is can have to go after cabbalas the question is weather they are going to it right now iron does not want them to do it right now es for if israel wore to swivel and hit kisbell all right now and take them off the table that is a real prom fer on the found operating base against israel for on was commas in the south and casballat in the north come as has ben taken off the table if israel take cabbalas off the table iron that has no projective capability in terms of actually being able to destroy israel they can certainly make trouble on the northern border they can certainly create problems injurdand marry the called less bank they can certainly do all those things but they do not have an accistential thread on israel border if israel takes out cabbalas or on basically its interesting containing this thing because they do not wan kisbalat to go down alongside come as salon is in a weaken position it is very weird the by administration continues to fund iron an what exactly is the they there that the'regoin to be nice if you give the money that has not work well in the past meanwhile israel has ben taking over the all she a hospital again it is truly incredible truly incredible that the united states the rest of the world continue pe pressure on israel wit the rite human rights when israel is literally sending in arabia speakers and medical workers into a hospital run by commas in being used as they base of attack again soldiers for the idea and then the question is whether israel being humane enough there is never been in army that is been forced to do anything remotely this the united state when it came to sell bomb hospitals we did and what we ware not wrong to do when they were being used as basis by isle and yet it is the same exact people hare now li gal man i hope that israel is is bringing in sufficient fuel to these hospitals the camasses turning down whole the shoot the soldiers in any case jonathan concrete gets who is the up who as the spokes person for the idea and he walk people in side partspital shive a hospital showed its to military base because it is a military base a aecethy in email to i dunno when this was use the last time i e the lain a bite ai my follow me be ivy you a a cup o you mini legal in end the terms that is a grammar rate go o e home to ran if you full in an we get the li over in what woful careful fee or if mina that equipment there is a a an comfort e even hear carpet a am a thenar remain here of course uni to and all of that with was hither very conveniently secret behind temerity well man obviously it is a medical facility an what why would is all possibly be going into a medical facility obviously not a medical facility but do that is the entire idea here is the media which are focus again on creating moral equivalents between a group that it is literally using its own blood re sources soldiers lives in order protects civilians on the other side of the conflict many of whom were involved in the actual october see of attacks the trngrin moral clinging those people on repeople who hide eighty forty sevens in m are rooms that is the media ben dedicated full time yo doing and meanwhile the barging colezerbeam the anti temps is m even of any one they proceed as a supposed right winger t this is their stick

whose trying convey to china yesterday he just walked away from the question by walk inside an ism sure that those negotiations went amazing according to the walszrejournal we made real progress said bid in is went the modulator told reporters were some of most constructive and productive conversations we have had what exactly did they do well they agreed to resume communications between the militaries said they are an a firing on one another to operant on choking off dentinal production yet ism sure that is on to happen am sure china's going a stob the giant cash revenue stream that is dentinal production and begin a dialogue on the risks of a i yes that is what we need we need the chines involved in the direction of artificial intelligence probably that will not go wrong given what they have done with tiptoe by caponizing it against the west remember teething bout tiptoe ticktock in the west is not the samesticktok in china ticktock an china teaches is to no mouth ticktock in west teachers kids to cut off their own penises it is it is a little different ya china involved in the ai discussion not superior on that the outcome is likely to face pressure in coming month with disagreements over an election in titan and the chines navies harassment of ships from the philippines o less ally the us non china have different sharply over the israel commons war bison also faces politicalrisk at home from republican politicians who argue he is going easy on bashing here is the thing therereshes a pity wide by partisan consents as the china the faggot wat a democrat agree with this repress on might galliard runs an entirely new committee congress dedicated to chines relations and it is well attended a mean democrats are are largely on the same page in terms of believing and being correct the chase infamous force in the world rare area by partisan agreement what exactly is biding but what deal is bid going to cut this time the agreements reached wednesday give washington and fishing more time to steady time than down on downward pitch for years well sore sure they do excepted when the united states shows weakness china tends to pick up the atoning go i ism old enough remember when honghong was not a chines occupied territory ism all nigh remember when honghongstoll had a level of independence announces completely run by china the lest just completely surrendered the thing the shine account which is the official chines media quoted she is saying quit china has no plans to surpassed replace the united states and the united states should not have any plans to suppress and contain china a that is a li china does hat plans to surpass or replace the united states obviously and it's particularly true one comes to international relations the senior ad ministration official said the leaders had a substantial exchange aboutstiwan and that bison a responded by saying the longstanding of position is a determination to maintain piece and stability bid an urged bashing respect the a total process inti wan we appear to push back at the white houses view that relations with china are to find by competition saying that he rejects the idea of a major country competition but towns momma some pretty words i but houses can materialize i i have mite outs i jobidon again speaking a lot of es pretty were retrace on we have to work together we have to work together with the chines an good luck with that gross responser people the wore word t wore o beer we redo of we will see what that working together looks last time job an work together with china on at least the big i got to money said there there is that as well a a meanwhile the the republican party continues to be a party in disarray the politico has a piece to day all about the house hope and how make johns the new speaker the use avoided a shut down the avoid to shut down by putting into law a a continuing resolution the basically is a continuation of what earthy would have done and many members of the house copier lice we do not even know what the hell is going on and that is correct no one knows of the all is going on because you have no sense of city or intense if structure as we discussed it yesterday on the program according to political republicans cannot agree on basic policy priorities or even fun the government without a majority of democratic votes individual law makers are going rogue on the house floor with theatrical efforts the century coles an impeach members of the bide ministration growing number of all makers are choosing to retire because they feel impossible to get anything done well yes that is correct rat represent call armstrong of not to cot aid it is the same clown car with different driver we do not have the majority essentially i mean that is right chippy is saying the same thing from the conservative side of the ow hes as iron under uni what we do for a living id yo your blot here is represent a boy we would nobly down without frothing shut summer job into the cable because republican control the chamber only they than the republicans for the life of me i do not understand how you can go to the trouble o campaigning rasing money going to a tank calking to people coming to this down a the member of a party to lately than for something a lovely that for producing pending a lovely than foreliminating that securing the border strong military landing the witness that is killing at corrupt in our schools a did an then do nothing about it one thing i we my republican college the give me one thing one the in go campaign on it this we did one anybody thing in the couple you aught to come down o the for come explain to me one ma curial meaning full significant thing the republican majority is done beside well i guess it is not is tat of the democrat i mean he is right about that obviously but that is the nature the gamewright now the republican party has a lot of independagions and the independations are not working together to actually craft anything they remotely resembles solutions and they are losing and they dis here to lose that is not a leadership problem jersey again replacing the earth with johns isn't change the mat it is an incentive problems have ben saying for a very long time people getting on t v people the purism tests in congress because it makes them look better than their colleagues it means they get to yelling scream lot the realities whole get something done you are acting in a half to at some points get together as a caucus democrats got

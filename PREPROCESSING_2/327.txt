welcome to the superman bacon was ascus science science pase tool for i m indrupubermen and on a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of venison my guest today is doctor family crawford doctor badly crawford is a medical doctor specializing and obstetrics and gynecology reproductive and chronology and in fertility she also holds a degree in nutrition science doctor crawford runs a clinical practice seen patients daily as well as being actively involved public education both through social media and through her popular podcast entitled as a woman to day doctor crawford teaches us about all aspects of female hormones and hormone health and fertility beginning as far back as in uteri when we were still in our mother's womb and extending as far forward as menopause we discuss topic such as the timing of puberty and what the timing of puberty in girls means for their fertility and we discuss birth control both hormonal and nonhormonal forms of birth control and how birth control mayor may not relate to long term fertility and different aspects of female health we so talk extensively about measuring fertility that is a count we also talk about egretreval ah a freezing one's eggs as well as inventor fertilization and we also take a deep dive into the popular and important topics of nutrition and supplementation as they relate to fertility as they relate to pregnancy but also how they relate to female hormone health generally indeed doctor crawford provides us with a master class on female hormones and fertility one that i know that all women ought to benefit from and that men would benefit from listening to as well before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is me new venison maven y venison is the most neutrino dense and delicious red meet available have spoken before on this podcast in sallow episodes end with guess about the need to get approximately one gram of high quality protein per pound of body weight each day for optimal nutrition they're many different ways that one can do that but a key thing is to make sure that you are not doing that by investing excessive calories make new venison has the highest density of quality protein per gallery and it achieves that in delicious things ground means venison stakes jerky and bonebrot i particularly the ground venison i make those into venison burgers probably five times a week or more i also the jerky for its convenience specially when ism travelling or a especially busy with work and know that ism getting an extremely urine dense high quality source of proline if you would to try make new venison you can go to maxi new venison doc am slash superman and get twenty per cent off your first order again that is make new venison dock cam slashhuberman to get twenty per cent off to day's episode is also brought to us by relic sleep relic sleep makes mattresses pillows that are tailored to your unique sleep needs now sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well end enough mental health physical health and performance all stand to be at their best one of the key things to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress is tailor to your unique sleep needs relic sleep has a brief two minute quiz that if you go to their web sight you take that quiz an answer questions such as do you tend to sleep on your back your side your stomach you tend to run hot or cold in the middle the night may you do not know the answers to those questions and that is fine at the end of that two minute quiz they will match you to a mattress that is ideal for your sleep needs i sleep on the dusk to you s k mattress and when i started sleeping on a dusk mattress about two years ago my sleep immediately improve f you are interested in upgrading your mattress go to heck sleep dock cam slash superman take there two minute sleep quiz and they will match you to customize mattress for you and you will get up to here hundred fifty dollars off any mattress order and to free pillows again if interested go to relic sleep dock calm slash superman from to three hundred fifty dollars off and two free pillows ism please to announce that we will be hosting four live events in australia each of which is entitled the brain body contract during which i will share science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance there will also be a live question in answer session we have limited tickets still available for the event in melbourne on february tenth as well as the event in bribe on february twenty fourth our event in kidney at the kidney opera house sold out very quickly as a consequence we have now scheduled a second event in kidney at the aware supertheadr on february eighteenth to access tickets to any of these events you can go to superman paddock calm slash events and use the code superman at checkout i hope to see you there and as always thank you for your interest in science and now for my discussion with doctor neatly crawford doctor crofford welcome thank you much for having me m honor to be here while have been thing attention to your content for a long time and i find it to be incredibly clear informative and for many people actionable to day i to talk about both fertility and of course hormones but as we both know fertility is not limited to a discussion about hormones naturally late the things behaviors sex behaviors and other behaviors nutrition supplementation an will get into all of it but if we could just back up developmentally and talk a little bit about female puberty because i think pretty much everything will talk about today is related to what happens puberty forward mostly in females but we will also discuss male fertility in hormones a bit and the question i have is is there anything about a woman's timing or let us just say patterns of puberty write how frequently menstruate early on with the timing of menstruation is o interns of their age et camera the provides hints or maybe even facts were directives about her future futility or how long her fertility might last this is a great question and i think defining some terminology before we begin as helpful if we go all the way back to win you are pious inside german when there is a female feeds in sierra you have the most eggs your ever going to have at about twenty weeks gestation if about six to seven million eggs by the time you are born you have already lost more than half of those and you continually lose eggs all the time the analogy that i always use and you do too is imagining that there is a vault inside the very where all your eggs are kept and every single month since the moment you have an very you lose a group of these eggs and when there is more inside you are losing more your losing all of these eggs throughout early fetal development and then up until the time period even of puberty when you reach puberty you have a lessening of the number of eggs and your very to the point where it can start to respond to the signals from the brain we think about puberty arms that in females first we have released thearchy which is the development of breasts that happens about two years on average before you have monarchy which is your periods starting what happens is the brain as we know from the hypothlymas since hat we an our age and the we have of each coming you which really starts to stimulate those folicals was a tropholical stimulating hormone well named hormone fer the female of course men have it too and it is less well named for them but it starts to get those folio's which house the eggs to grow and make estrogen women have about two years of estrogen exposure alone unopposed estrogen with no progesterone because they are not yet ovulating and that is when you start to see breast budding and you start to see the development of some of those secondary sex characteristics before you actually have a period what a some of the other secondary sex characteristic that precede anarchy as he said a breastfed development in the breast development a on average about two years abhor years and are you have sexual hair developments are actually adernarchy is one of the first usually comes right before at the same time with brassard two to three years before you will see your period and then general hair under arm hair exactly it don't hair usually fairest and the i a m hair am and a weld getting right down to the weeds here which is good am atoll of this podcast to normalize all aspects of health including sexual health and and a reproductive health am is that commence also with am the development of body odor noise as a young boy who eventually itpebertin became a young man in now i suppose ism an middle age a forty eight am i can tell you that the the locker room smelled a lot different a the before and after middle school right y light the in other words a boys start to smell stinky a right do yes and that is usually round that same time of sexual hair development as when you sard to have those glands around the hair making some of those odors that are to produce stink do they reflect hormones themselves not this the smell the actual smell does not actually reflect levels of cornpones or anything that it is just that you are body your on outs whether it is testes are ovaries are now starting to respond to those brain signals the brain is turned on their standing to respond in your body starting to mature and away to get to the point where it can support reproduction the reason i ask that question is not to heat people thinking about a stinky smells but and by the way some people love the musty smell o on their own about a a arms eats a there e referring to adults am by the way am but the reason i ask is that there a wealth of data in animal models including non human primates suggesting that exposure to the odors of others can either stimulate or accelerate puberty u is any evidence for that incumbents there is mild evidence and it is mercy because we also know that anything that could be an intercrendisruptor which a lot of sente or fragrances are also can excelera the onset of puberty by destructing part of this system and we know that toxins and n of sense and a lot of the world that we are exposed to is part of the reason why we are seeing puberty tapping at such a younger age now in females specifically but in both but in females than we have before we have young girls seeing their onset of monarchy at their period at a much younger a how much younger have seen the various grass for different countries but can we say that ten years ago on average girl sin the united states in northern rope were tin menarkyet about what twelve to thirteen years of and we know startles see monarchy for the purpose of this having your period ten to twenty years ago you will see most data would say oh thirteen to fifteen would have been kind of the average age and now we really seen at shift to be starting at ten to eleven and completing by thirteen fourteen most girls are definitely going through the puberty change earlier and the other thing to note is that most girls get their final heightgrowth right before they start their period to not only are we seen a change and this getting starting earlier whet we are also seen as probably some reduction at height from having gone through puberty at an earlier process because once you start actually menstruating once the ovaries have really started to learn how to respond to that effessage and grow the physical and it gets to the point where you can start ovulating about two years later then that oblatory period those high levels of best even are going to go and they are going to close those growth plates youvereally started to limit your final adult height as well when you go through puberty earlier and not suftnliny something that is a huge concern for precocious puberty a very young puberty right and we can use blockers when there are children who start to exhibit signs of puberty and one of the main reasons people do that is to try to get them to a greater adult height if there really starting to go through puberty at a very young age is tat also true for mails that is happening early i reallyior puberty means that your growth spurt a a terms of height is going to be a truncated not the same and you pull most men will say oh but i had my growhsper kind of after i started having some of the puberty change that happened but because it is this extra generated process and women that we see that prosper really your final height as within that year of when your period starts interesting boat this a discussion is certainly not about me but i was one of these but i thought was cave an add duck a hit puberty bout thirteen fourteen is her say i knew i did but i did not shave until i was after college my grow spurt between freshmen and sophomore you i grew away i is you grow full foot but i was the same weight soli real taller skinny a recall that real skinny and then it seems some people my life would argue that puberty still occurring for me it as again very long in prochracton which leads me to a i a a very specific question a if puberty arrives less again defend is monarchy am forsake of our discussion right know if puberty arrives really in a girl does that mean that her fertility will shut down earlier as raneston it does not the age of which you start the onset of your period does not impact how long you are going to have a reproductive life span and notes because you have the eggs inside that fault you are losing them every month no matter we you lost them all those years before your period started no matter if your period came at ten or at fifteen it is just about winded they start allowing your body to ovulate determined by being able to carry a baby o your body no thing you can be pregnant i think this is important to highlight because it puts together what you said earlier about the loss of eggs even in as a feeds a i think most people sort of assume that the reduction in egg count is due to ovulation and the fact that you one egg ovulates typically but that other eggs are deployed in that copulatory cycle one than those those basely are taken out of the vault and out of the opportunity for fertilization but what you are saying is that the eggs are constantly be called from the vault starting from early o embryonic development and that ovulation is a a distinct step in some sense unrelated to the moss of estates the loss of eggs i think this is going to be very important for our discussion later about potential egg harvest yet because i think some people have it in mind the readmits conception that your losing eggs from your fault and that is not the case you are just accessing the ones outside i shall you are not a we can just answer this now perhaps it seems if i understand correctly that if one were to harvest eggs for if or for embryogenesis an addition a settee aside later or frees them for later if they wont to use them eggs or or for liked embryos that one is not reducing the total number of eggs any more than they would had they just let their their cycles proceed natural exactly all that such an important point i think the i think a lot of people believe the opposite they probably the number one thing that patients fear when they costal to me about beg freezing or going to if is i do not want to harm my future fertility i do not want to cause myself to vino eggs earlier going to menaces earlier and it is explaining this process to them the your ovaries are on a pathway that you cannot change those eggs are coming out of the vault regardless of if your on birth control pills your pregnant we do ivy tough what we are modifying is one's not gone to ovulate and have the rest of them die we are going to try to give you medication to get them all to grow we can take all of the wines that have been released from the vault that month and give them a chance for later and the next month you will have another group come out i f is not about stimulating viper release or excessive release of eggs it is about stimulating the growth of the ones that have been release that they can be frozen e stage either elater fertilization or fertile in addition than frozen is embryos right exactly and we just use the hormonesthat your body normally makes in a different way the medications we use are a manage a tell age to get the egg to grow people will say to won to take all these weird hormones or strange medications but we are just manipulating that normal process that happens and the natural menstrual cycle in order to say hay this month let us get all these eggs to grow let us try to improve the efficiency a finding which eggs are going to be normal or not and help you along this process i think a good number of people are now going to and to the i f clinic i think again i really want a high this i think most people that have spoken to assume that the process of harvesting eggs for freezing for fertilization then or later is going to diminish their fertility because they're easily pulling more out of the savings account to speak right of wee making they withdraw no matter what git well on such an important point for re people to known and propagate a getting back to puberty a will bit later on i wanted to get into indican disruptor and things that sort but since you brought it up am you have heard things such as okay things evening primrose oil if mam is putting evening primrose oil honors has it in her shampoo that have heard of young males getting a precocious breastfed development keep in mind folks that some transient breastfed development is a characteristic of some normal puberty es and males it sometimes shows up and goes new some kits that in the neighborhood they got teasilob and then they stop getting teas holy nowadays they do not teas i but when i was growing up those kits got teas not by me but by other people but it was normal when it passed for for some right it occurred abnormally then passed but have heard that things exposure to evening primrose oil may be even just through contact with mam can a increase the the frequency or degree of that man breast development is it also true that young girls can undergo precocious puberty or let show say accelerated exasperated puberty am through contact with things evening primrose oil which is a i think has some pseudo estrogen property it is important to differentiate that the secondary sex characteristic we see dressed development are from estrogen but it is not really puberty being initiated when it is from an interbrain disrupting chemical taking you have been exposed to evening primrose or lavender or theatre ale in a male is not going to cause him to start to go into puberty but it is going to expose him to estrogen when his body is not and therefore stimulate some brestbud development same thing can happen in young girls meaning they could show some of those secondary sex signs earlier than they normally wed and this is why if that is happening at a really young age can shag to a pediatric andtechronologists who are gin to check things bone age and see if you really started the puberty process or not or is it an outside exposure which is causing it interestingly about the young child exposure and development the other thing to say that is really interesting and relevant in my field is the hen we think about how many eggs are in the vault and everybody's born with this different number and ism sure we will talk about ovarian reserve what we now know is of the vault your ovaries are most susceptible to whatever your mother does when she is pregnant with you and hat that epigenesis that pro ramming which is happening is predisposing young women to probably having some of them low being reserve some of them having disease as we associate with in fertility pee times are in demetriosas and we have not yet characterize what all they are but if we look at the incidents of some of these disease that wee see now what we do know is that the time period of which these people were pregnant the ladies and nineties was not the healthiest time when it comes to intercintreceptors ane plastic exposures in chemicals and all of this process stuff what is to say that people have been exposed to though were really seeing that those that a caring susceptibility to egg quality and quantity happens in that needle development period interesting a because there some a parallels to mail female development the the fact that of these early organizing effects of hormones the hadrisastostrone which essentially stimulate the growth of the penis but also then establish a a propensity for rostering puberty to activate growth of the sex organs but also activate the brain arias a responsible for a host of different things i only mention that because a what i to can of illustrate in the background heres that a basically a reproductive health begins really private privy to conception really its at dependent on mam ended but a certainly to a great degree on on mam a but then female developments going to be important sort of a as a being able to pick our parents ah i i do have a couple questions about lavender trio and evening primrose all i was aware that evening primo oil oilscuse me can a somehow bind esteem receptors it mimic as some of the estradiol or something similar to it i was not aware of the tree oil or lavender a here are we talking about oils what a out aromas and how concern do people have to be about this stuff because having you know you will go into a restaurant bathroom they will be popery ah some people wear perfume an ut we do not want to set of parinoiso no o but to but i think people should know about the stuff retrials in a lot of those in natural shampoo a lot of the ones titrant the one that tingle your saw as a thou one people love them though constant exposure is very different then one time hand washing in the bathroom and i think that is the big difference for everything when we talk about chemicals or toxins or exposures in the world you cannot live in a toxin free world but choosing what you put in and on your body on a regular basis does sat the tone for certain physiologic change and using unscented products especially with children as a really an important thing because we want to make sure that their lifetime exposure to some of these things especially doing critical times is much less and you will see people recommend things your laundry to charge at what censor in your laundry to charge in the sham poo and conditioner are a big one and the soaps that you use on a dato day basis in your house or the oils you put on your body lavenders huge because there is this whole community of people they want rob lavender oil on their babies fee and help them see but really we can see and somebody goes and shadows of pediatric anterchnolegist for a day they will see some kits come in and this will be the reason why what about cloth divers verses non cloth divers heard he that you have your very strong cloth driver proponents right in the because they seem to am feel or believe that a loincloth divers somehow contain things that can get into baby skin and and maybe there is a bigger question here is baby skin more permeable then oh i do not do not know that baby skin is more peri don lira it to me it seems i think is up be hard to imagine it is but but babies do seen to have is incredible skin right their skin is smearing not you must squeeze their cheeks in lo all this kin a stuff but am yet the idea they will be more permeable i think it is more that their development is this time is very important and setting the stage for a lot of what happens later verses in adulthood those stepwise developmental processes of curdy happened i think that swat we pays so much attention to what happens in the childhood period of time because where now learning about those later consequences of what you are exposed to it is not that regular divers verses cloth whatever we want to say it ones necessarily better than the other it is more honestly of personal preference babies are exposed to them a lot and there is been a lot of attention to that but similar least somebody could use cloth and wash et with a detergent that then haw certain chemicals in it there has not been a study shown that this one thing is an exposure for a baby that somebody needs to be worried about there is definitely companies now which are promoting and talking about no traditional divers that they are making sure have less talk sense an them and i always think any time you can decrease talks in exposure to a child is going to be very important ceremony evidence for a bresmil verses formula in terms of i impact on future reproductive development of reproductive states of of a child that is a complicated question because breastmilk exposure at least for the first six months of a child's life certainly helps with the simian system development and we know that poor immune development can lead to high risk of otuummun disease later what people call leaky got and some of those diseases certainly are correlate with fertility i would not say we have gone far to say that if you do not breast feed your child they are going to have fertility issues but we do know that there is an between correlation with things that breaks feeding as protective against and how those s diseases themselves may relates o fragility and the female later on o case safer thinking about a young girl slash woman was retire out puberty write at do not what exact moment cloture is there what my experiences all a offend and somebody no matter what em but a girl who undergoes puberty writs a young woman who maybe thirteen or shes early teens am undergoes purity and therefore is continuing to ls eggs from the vault but now is undergoing a presumably roughly every twenty eight days manarkeepble let us talk about this twenty eight days thing because ay a people think that am queen quote normal menstruation is always twenty eight days and and we know that is not true sand what is the the range of a normal a durations between menstruation a cycles or duration of the menstruation cycle and let us also define when the menstruation cycle starts probably for the males mostly in the onwerwere let us think through the cycle will do a quick one over and then answer the questions what we think of a cycle day one or when you are going to say this starts as can be the day these art bleeding that is actually shedding the endometrial lining from what true the last time any spotting even would be considered ay one it is we can get back to the problem attic if you a lot of spotting before that full flow starts a day or can be really normal just as the bodies adjusting to the dropping projestarown but less is start the beginning daytime you have a period a menses this as when your actually bleeding at this time period we think about all of those new eggs being out of the vault being susceptible to that effesage which of course is that well name common because it stimulates the physical to grow and each egg as anapholical that egg starts to grow and makes estranged that estergan stimulates the proliferation of the lining of the uterus and preparation for potentially that pregnancy that make me and also that estrogen makes youfeel really great a that the vehicular phase names because that police is growing and its an eatage dominant phase where you have a lot of estrogen and we will feel great when they have a lot of estrogen yelbecoomen feel good with broken because of the relationship between estrogen and other demodulators the opening sunstone and and n is that happening in parallel or they somehow related is estrogen controlling the release of stone and somehow and vice first a where they just cold of confidently happening in parallel we doubtfully think that there more of a correlation causation than just coincidence because we know there is time perse to people are more depressed within your cycle correlating with those lo estrogen levels and we know that when you going to menopause ore you run out a eggs and you are now in a low estrogen phase we see a lot more of a depressed mood and anaconda lack of response to things which were normally give you pleasure happens more frequently the female brain loves estrogen and its protective against things dementia this is a time period where women are going to be more energetic there on how more energy more hocus this is the estrogen dominant phase of the cycle and when you have seen that estrogen at its high levels which its only made from a mature physical and its very specific two hundred decagrams percolator for fifty hours that is the brains clue one we must have a mature a and it can send out that surge of elate are utilizing hoarmom and now you ovulate and when you ovulate the physical opens up release closes back and then its the corpus medium and we have enter the audial phase and the corpus medium is the name suggest the corpus is a body the easily the it is ad was it is basically the corpse of of what the its this attach yes i oh the egg before a and it what would i find amazing a biology beautiful and it instead of just taking that tissue in spoke lists discard this or a that becomes the to group for the next pus it is essential for life it the corpus medium which makes progesterone opens encloses the implantation window it is what allow somebody to get pregnant and for our species to continuo it is it is extremely fascinating and that corpus medium gets stimulated to produce projesteran impulses throughout the entire audial phase because it still controlled by the brain unless you get pregnant and then in that audial phase protester own is fascinating it is trying to protect you from things which coipotentially harm your baby suddenly now you have less energy you an a let ore you want o eat more you may be do not want a half sex as much because your body is suddenly saying let us just protect o this potential implantation that you are going to have if that pregnancy does not come the corpus medium can only live twelve to fourteen days it has a very distinct life span and then it dies your estrogen and poster own both drop you belied starting over the next cycle and a new group of folicals comes out to be released and the reason why walking through that very distinctly but is important when you are asking how long is the normal cycle because the audial phase is pretty set at twelve to fourteen days the follicular phase can very in person to person and what we know though is for one individual if you are menstrual cycle your secretive hormones are working right it should be relatively constant for you and if your periods are every twenty four days but they have always been every twenty four to twenty five days then that is not concerning and if your periods are every thirty three days but they have always been every thirty three days then that is not concerning but we do get concerned when there is a change in your period or we get concerned when people have what i to say is i regularly regular periods because what you will see text books tell you is that your periods could be as sure is twenty one days as l on is thirty five days and that can all be normal but people will hop between them the willhave one cycle that is twenty four days in length from day one to the last day before the next day one than the next cycles thirty to and then it is twenty six and then it is thirty four and that is not normal that is too irregular and that can be a sign that something is not communicating correctly within your reproductive hormones what i tell patience is in general your period should be less than thirty five days apart and you should be able to look at a calendar and with your finger put a finger on the date and within a couple days of accuracy be able to predict when your periods coming and if you cannot there could likely be something that is interfering with the hormonal signals between the brain and the very and one of the biggest really one of the only things we see as women start to have fewer eggs in the vault is a shortening of their cycles you have a regular period and suddenly now you have less ex in the vault less are coming out each month and when the brain sends out that f s age signal now there is fewer egg it is not getting as delete and you have one starting to respond sooner suddenly your ovulating shorter faster in your cycle you are ovulating on cycle at nine instead of fourteen your audial phases still set but the person who comes to see me and says my periods have always been twenty eight to thirty days but now there every twenty four i just figure is big deal i am give red flags going off everywhere because ism now really concerned that potentially their ovarian reserve has dropped to a point where we are starting to see clinical changes now of course things library and placed in an other hormones can also cause such changes but that is why you will hear most reproductive intercronologist say your periods of vital sing and what we really mean is the regularity at which it comes and the predict ability of it is stallion ass if your harmony are it'll communication an normal faction or if something conpontentially be off as we all know quality nutrition influences of course our physical health but also our mental health and ore connive functioning our memory our ability to learn new things and to focus and we know that one of the most important features of high quality nutrition is making sure that we get enough sidemen and minerals from high quality unprocessed or minimal process sources as well as enough politics and robotics and fiber to support basically all the cellar functions in our body including the up microfilm now i most everybody try to get optimal nutrition from whole foods ideally mostly from minimal processed or nonprocess foods however one of the challenges that i and many other people face is getting enough servings of high quality fruits and vegetables per day as well as fiber and robotics that often accompany those fruits and vegetables that is why way back in two thousand in twelve long before i ever had podcast i started drinking a g one and ism delighted the a g one is sponsoring the hubermanlab podcast the reason i started taking a g one and the reason i still drink a g one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it provides insurance that i get the proper amounts of those siemens minerals robotics and fiber to insure optimal mental health physical health and performance if you would to try a g one you can go to drink a g one doctor slash supermen to claim a special offer there giving away i free travel pay plus a year supply of sidemen d three k two again that is drink a g one dock slash supermen to claim that special offer miss i have this correct we have got this thing that we call the menstrual cyclethe ovulatory cycle the there is two phases a vehicular phase an a audio phase flicker precedes the audio phase the ludiophades tends to be fibered critically an fairly fixed about fourteen days the vehicular phase can vary in duration en maybe ten to fourteen days maybe even ten to eighteen days depending on the person i something about their brain to over communication for those that are not familiar with this the always learned that estrogen primes progestrown this and the the really basic top contour description of the ovulatory cycle that unesterogen is gin a slowly clime toward the the point of ovulation and then there is there is rock and then a drop and then progesterone is going to dominate in the audial face the second half you said that estrogen is associated with with a psychological level in a physiological level were energy feelings of vitality and some of that estrogen increase is actual coming from the one egg the got stimulated the most the wen the on selected is picked for the team potentially for the team but got picked o potentially for fertilization and that beg sheds its corpus medium o which is the piece of the of the egg that then triggers the progesterone the dominates the audial face to have that right a mostly motel yet please correct en were y uncle an which the egggrows right when you ovulate it ruptures the sister opholicals assist assist as a fluidfelt structure physicals of fluifelstructure that holds an ago when you ovulating you get that ullage sarge the sit bursts at opens up and the egg comes out of it and then it wheels and becomes the corpus ludo not just a little bit different antigen and you write with estrogen primes progesterone but really we think about at the layer of the interests because estrogen stimulates the growth of that lining and then progesterone stabilizes it and allows and plantation to a car but the sequence of events of when you are estrogen dominant and progestorown deficient which is the follicular phase and people will come in having labs er on randomly and there all concerned that they do not have protestor own and when you talk to them but where they are in their pcycwel you say you not suppose had prodesterown that is your funicular phase this is perfectly normal great thinks for that clarification i get a lot of questions about birth control but on my social media handles a e to be clear am this it is a vast topic for exploration but along lines o what we are talking about now have heard and i suspect it may not be true but tell me is there any evidence that taking birth control can disrupt the process that you just describe in when we talk about birth control we should jolly the find what we are talking about there are a hormone basebirth controls a gave the pill there also hormone base birth controls that are not in piliform am there are dudes that copper judges her other dudes lilies talk about hormone base contraception in females again a if which many of them as i understand a estrogen may maxi estrogen themselves that suppress ovulation do they diminish were increase the number of eggs that are taken from the vault fantasia question let us talk about what people say as the tell the specifically talk about combined or a contraception and the tell which has final sterile and some type of protestor no contraception does not change the release of eggs out of the vault they are cursing at the same process an the same pathway you are not ovulating because that estrogen does prevent acetates from coming from the brain you have the group of eggs still come out of the vault there is no effect age they just all die the next croup comes out when you are saying are you going to run out a eggs faster is a gun o harm your facility does birth control and pair the process the answers no but there is a couple pinpoint caveats one is that the birth control tells especially if you take them continually or for a prolonged period of time the the body smart and that lies are to say we are not really doing anything and one of those markers of a very reserve we have is a my and that is antiquarian horror and a this made from the granuloma cells or the cells that surround every logical in the shortest way possible more legs an the all more come out every mount higher amah you are legs an to all you are come out lower man your amah is being suppressed because of the birth control pill because it is decreasing the activity of those gran else cells you might get a low a man value when you have been on the birth control pill for a long time that is completely reversible but it can be significant if somebody is wanting to get in a man level let say somebody comes to my cleaned they are not trying to get pregnant and there on the tell and there considering freezing their eggs we are going to check their ovarian reserve if we draw it i always say this amah may be up to dirty per cent lower in somebody who is on the birth control tell we can still draw it and if it comes back in the normal range we shall get but if it does come back low we are on have to make a decision are we going to stop the birth control tell for a period of some months you've all curative contraception if you do notion to be pregnant and then repeat this test to see if this is a true low because we do see that young women do you have low vein reserve sometimes or was this just suppressed because you were on the birth control tell we see it impact some of the hormone testing that we can do and thing that is an important distinction and we can see that the longer you take it that potentially it might actually improve your fertility if you had underlying in demetrioses or some medical conditions that we see associated with infertility prolonged polluters can potentially improve their fertility verses people who are trying to get pregnant that same age who were not on the all those studies are complicated right b has a selection by us because if you have been on the pill for ten years you are a little bit older is it that they were preventing pregnancy in the other group potentially had some exposure they were inherently more infertile than the group that was on the pill but we do know that the oil does not cause in fertility and i use it all the time all the time and ivy of cycles we but people on the birth control pill because we can actually synchronized that group of eggs that comes out of the vault to grow together because your body does not want to have twenty babies at one time wright and we were trying to do with idiot get twenty eggs to grow if that is what's out of the vault really goes against the check unbalance of the human body to not have twenty babies at once why is it that male who take to stastrne since to stastrone it shuts down their own testastron production inspire production but females wo take estrogen in the form of decontrol pills adoesinshucdown estragon production by the overs i love this question the answer i at extra because in a our asking mspermata genesis is a constant and on going process right in women you are born with all the eggs a ever going to have and what we are talking about as if we stop afasati at that moment we are just impacting the ability to ovulate at that time but we are not changing this constant lost throughout the vault fermata geneses right the sperm is made every single nay you are making brandy's firm seventy two days for the sperm to be created in the testes and eighteen days to find their way out the ejaculatory system and exposures that you have that stop the production of afasaon all age inhibit the development the creation of new sperm somebody who is been on testa strong we will tell the brain the brain does not know is from your taking it it says hey we have plenty of sperm were good we do not need any more the brain than get suppressed and does not make that affixation l age therefore not stimulating both further testosterone production cause you do not need that but tesauceron production an sperm production go hand in hand therefore you are no longer making new sperm and in fact the longer you are on testansterown the harder it may be to get sperm production to come back and in twenty five percent of people they may not get it back if they have been on prolonged to saucer an exposure it is really because of what women will sometimes say is unfair which is the fact that you are born with all these legs an you run out of em they accumulate the were and tear of your life right we see quality being a huge issue and female reproduction yet men get to have new sperm every ninety days they get to wash away whatever bad needs they did and can change their life tell in their exposures and have very different sperm but because of that same promises things that shut off the production of effasage ell age really impact sperm quite significantly mention bad deeds am forspent ah not bisepern i said horsier ah in in a week we know that heat is is i you pretramatic insult to the em to the dramatic genius o cycle a son's an hottubs and wat not a i did receive the question as to whether or not am heat exposure son's hottubs camera are they a detrimental to ovulation or a production in any way i mean obviously things or more internal in females the overs are internal but there any evidence for that i mean the body does heat up the others n it does not harm the oblatory period of the ovaries and just we know the reason why the trusties are susceptible is because there suppose to be at a cooler temperature that is why they rein the scrotum outside the body that is why the testis are susceptible to heat changes but the ovaries being inside the body they are not in the same way now when somebody is pregnant important distinction right we know that the development especially organ development of an embryo can be more sensitive to certain things and that heat exposure at that time whether it is hot tubes are extreme fevers even a an make a difference in development of a files but moment's coming to the copulatory cycle or hormone production an heat in the female does not make any difference i onto be clear before asks the next question that i do not want to be responsible for any in wanted pregnancies but when i was in high school they told us that women can get pregnant even while they have their period is that true seems a live based on everything you are saying but i do not want any one to run out and a test that hypothesis without having the facts first in general if somebody has extremely regular cycles then that is a complete lit you cannot get pregnant on your period the reason why they tell us thus is one especially when your younger your period cycles tend to be irregular there not your body has not fully mature to have that regularity and that we know that sperm do live and the reproductive tract for much longer than the ages a sperm can live there for up to five days if somebody did have a shorter period window let say their normal periods are going to be twenty four days they are ovulating on cycle day ten if they have a regular period that is five or six days they could potentially have intercourse that in part of that period the sperm could live for five days and be right there when you have the a in route it is not the most fertile time for shower and in most people that is considered a time when you are not going to get pregnant but especially when your younger and you have more irregularity or in people who have a short cycle window that might not be the case by extension can we conclude then at the most fertile time is going to be when sperm meet aglet us the save timing of intercourse for yep for the time being but as there's can be a delay there a when per meets a em on obviously day of ovulation or day a day after they we day of the egg is for twenty four hours the egg can only be fertilized for twenty four hours while it is in the philopian to once the egg has entered the uterus it cannot be fertilized any more it has this very short window of time where it will allow sperm to enter it now sperm can life for five days we will say the fertile window is this five day period ending on the day of population you will hear lot of us a lot of doctors say the day after population because really know exactly what time you populated on and if the egg has twenty four hours then that extra day could potentially be helpful but really it is five days ending on the day of population and people with very regular cycles or who contract them and they know when that population is happening the day before and the day of population those the two top heading days of your kind of not in the mood to have lots of secs those are going to be the days you target to have the highest chance of conceiving and what is the relationship between estrin libido and ovulation and females the higher your estrogen is the increase limit that you are going to have and of course you see those peak estergan levels which are going to trigger that elate serge the body is made to get pregnant you are going to have that peak ester in that per libido right before and right at that copulatory time periods that hopefully you also want to have intercourse and get pregnant have heard before less to say that some people tore careful here oh a consents the literally the deployment of of the egg yet the population they they report that they can feel y that this less you say that departure of the of the egg is that an imaginary thing o on that may we i always i always that image that people a know when that happen it is realthat i m no y on men generally know when when there when there sperm are leaving their body let us hope they do but why would not that there be internal sense for for women also of what is going on may we have interception there is a ton of nerve innervation of that area does not communicate to the brain excellent as far as tracking to where that sensation is but you are right irade said ovulation is the rupture of a sit right it is rupturing and the gas being released and those follicular fluid is also exiting and going into the paritinial cavity and there is a group of women who can feel that especially people who are vermin tune with their body and has a name its called middleshmirts the pain is almost feel a crappy pain that happens in the middle of the cycle and that is your ovulatory pain how interesting what is it called middleshmirts cat will put then the show not you captions and whoever does is can have to an the spelling right an shirts amazing amazing amazing and foreign to me but for obvious reason to but amazing a am always astonished in a how incredibly well orchestrated this whole processes it is issussussiston incredible feat of biology is i men the number of things that have to be timed correctly in the use in unless he reused but the the purposing of tissues for different things a it what it what an incredible dance it's just amaziful i mean am nutty because i just love how everything have to communicate just perfectly it makes you an awe of a the pregnancies that just happen just all the time because really things have to sinckranize really at the wonderful time period and even the sis ho were talking about i heard you say that o i when i say this people always ask every single day well how much sex should you have when should you have sex as there too much sex and what we know is that you definitely should not decrease your sexual intercourse intervale if you are in a relationship and you are sex everyday people half sex every day you will a hundred per cent hit intercourse throughout your entire mortal window on the day that you ovulate you are depositing the same sperm there because you are not generating new sperm is whether the load went half and half and half and half or if it went an one big group but if you are constantly putting more sperm out there you have a higher chance and studies go back and always say daily inerequires as to say wit the highest chance a fecundability especially during the fertile window however for couples who are not sex everyday people that idea can cause a lot of stress stress of course impacts the system in a lot of different ways it can also cause sexual burnout where they no longer feel being an to men are having sects on the day they are actually ovulating because they have been doing at this whole time leading up and tot's where the time period saying half sex every other day throughout the fertile window starting five or six days before you think you are going to ovulate and in try to target having intercourse on the day before and the day of population and the reason why people said every other day or a few days prior can have get some sperm exposure there in case you populated early but really to try to prevent some of that increased stress that can happen when you are trying to conceive especially if you have programmed or timed intercourse that needs to happen on an everyday interval but the odds of getting pregnant by saving up sperm for two or three days that is not higher prison why if a to ay apathetically some one is do not eating or freezing sperm are doing ref why they instruct the mail to ism not ejaculate for forty eight to seventy two hours prior to let you say depositing sperm is such a funny word is but they works two points one if we are doing a seam an analysis now we are trying to evaluate this sperm and in its hest has certain normal parameters and these are all based on a forty eight to seventy two hour abstinence period yes if you a acuate more frequently you are going to have less sperm and that to be very normal but if we are looking at a tests wit set normal parameters that are based on two to three days of not having intercourse that is what we want you to do it for that if we are doing let us say i i or intributern insemination also known as artificial insemination or where we take the sperm and put it in a case that are and put it in the uterus we are trying to get more players forget on the field and in that case i know when you ovulate because ism timing it perfectly and i am trying to get as many possible in this process because we are not just having them deposited an the vagina we are trying to get him further we want more because that is part of that treatment process and similarly with eff i wont to have as many sperm as possible to sort through and pick out the best looking the most motel the most normally shaped ones we are trying to get just a better sample and by having these normal guidelines were able to judge this is low for what it should be which can also be a clue to other problems it if we will not talk about chemistry both them interpersonal chemistry and literally a ejaculate and vaginal chemistry but before we do that ism curious whether not we can just touch on a few of the things that a lot of people wonder about in terms of egg quality and if they touch on sperm quality maybe we can also just mention that but for instance does cannabis either by edible or by smoking cannabis impact a quality neither direction alcohol would be the next and then ism going to assume and i have to do this it strictly because of what i understand about drugs of a beasts cocaine and emphedeming methempedeming that none of those can be good for systems of the body because they provides they create much stress for the body u but this is a alcohol in cannabis i readistatistic when researching episode on c anabas that shocked me which is that fifteen per cent one five per cent not one point five fifteen per cent of america women at least in this one study survey reported having consumed or smote cannabis during known pregnancy which is we or wild unless of course ism just naive and tics not harmful o feed us but i have a hard time believing that what gives i mean her to and there i ash just throw needle the basement is cannabis is i'lli'll call bad for a quality there different things index the same thing in one let answer them each individually we will go with the one that everybody knows and has accepted now that they would not have accepted forty years gat right smoking cigarettes that is obviously bad decreases the number of eggs you have in the vault smoking cigarettes actually guessnto your vault decreases the number that you have soave a higher chance of going into menaces early a and it increases the risk of having abnormal cremasoms which is what we really think about we think about beg quality right and patine those my attic spindles inside the eggs which hold the cromazones and their perfect position they are associated they get wearing tar from things that cause inflammation or a toxic says cigarette smoke we know decreases at quality a quantity increases miscarriage and the of chorus has needle and packs could i just as you ad i win we tell about am there is nicotine which itself is not carbon pelican then there is the smoking process which brings in a bunch of other things the the question i know is burning in everybody's mine is raping yet let mi because raping is ism ism very bullish on this mates very clear that the chemicals associate with aping are just oh bad for everybody's health but it is distinctly different from saying that nicotine is bad at for one's health and it can be but without doing too much of a deep dive is are there any data that show that raping is bad for e equal city of course there is not as much data because it just has not been around as long but yes raping defiling as chemicals that looks its associated with poor successorates and ivy of cycles and that is really crone of one of the most finite measures of at quality we can see because we are really testing the a at a level and a lab verses just are you getting pregnant naturally and s art introject again but any time of conversation this comes off especially between two people in the health science space therefore these shouts because i hear them it literally were people say well listen i tape o every day and have had three healthy babies and i think a my response is always sane there is can be a distribution of responses and then of course how much healthier could your babies have a been had you not tape during pregnancy were raped prior topredencs you i and i think these are that the key issues that you cannot you cant rewind the clock as far as i know right in the absence of the time machine you cannot rewind the clock it m easily everything you are saying is that smoking cigarettes were raping nicotine just cannot be good for a don't to at we know that it is not good for getting pregnant we know that is not good for sperm and therefore we also in was going to impact pregnancy rads you things anabas right decreases firm production decreases firm motility changes form morphology the shape a it changes the dona it increases the fragmentation of the dona if your partner uses anabas and you get pregnant you have a higher chance of miscarriage because of these firm association with the anabas now arable cannabis i o no as you cause you cannot study something that is illegal a lot of this data is just morn new and a lot of its going to be observational and in states colorado in californium were cammisis essentially legal yet a am assuming that there more data but o case smoking and or raping nicotine cannabis other table or smoked very likely detrimental to e quality and sperm quality which is not to say that one can conceive it times tat the quality of your baby the your child will not be as high as the quality of that baby if you did not do that and is alright yes anear not emu y to humanize any one that did did do this during pregnancy old people don't know but if this is this s really about people try to make choices in anticipation of future pregnancy ye and when you're trying to set yourself up for success because we know and festivities becoming more common we do not always know who is going to have it and when you find yourself in that position specifically one t optimize everything you can if there is something that is going to make these firm quality worse and the equality worse and your success with treatment lower and your miscarriagerat higher we are going to recommend that you not do it if your trying to get pregnant naturally all these things correlate over but of course there is always going to be outliers in exceptions ism going to sit here and tell you that the odsogetting pregnant at age forty three are less than three per cent per month and every single persons can be but my aunt barber or i know this person who did because three percents not you and your short natural a brenassiaer bind by a have an internal fashion way k right but yes people will get pregnant people will have healthy children who do have exposures to negative to cannabis even to alcohol even though we know that alcohol can cause feudal alcohol central zero percent of alcohol should be the acceptable level and pregnancy and then does alcohol in pact fertility such a complicated question and this is probably due to the amount you consume in the frequency of what you consume it alcohol is a toxin that your lever must filter out and we know it causes inflammation anybody who is had a finite with alcohol nose they can wake up the next day and they feel different their body is processing that alcohol and that inflammation especially f it is chronic chronic exposure we know chronic inflammation is one of the things that we see impacting at quality in sparmpolity soy certainly if you enjoy outhaul is should be something that is done in moderation one or two drinks a week at the moist and you should not do it at all whence you find out your pageant i to take a quick break and think our sons a inside tracker inside trackers a personalized nutrition platform the analyzes data from your blood engine to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals have long bed of believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long turn health can only be assessed with a quality blood tests the problem with a lot of blood indicates out there however is that they will give you information about certain lipid markers or hormone markers but no information bout what to do with all of that data inside tracker makes it very easy to look at your levels of hormones metabolic factors lipids et camera and then to assess what sorts of behavioral nutritional supplementation or perhaps other interventions you might want to use in order to bring those numbers into the ranges that are optima for your health inside tracers ultimate plan now includes three new hormone markers that are critical to measure during a woman's reproductive and menapozl years these are extra dial progesterone and thyroid stimulating hormone if you to try inside tracker you can go to inside tracker dot cam slash supermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that inside tracker dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off when we are talking about bit control i fortunately moved us forward and and forgot to ask about a u d soy ow a minor change to the copper up works by creating a sort of em not actually electric but a kind of a electric e fence that kills spurn from do not let no ya on that lint copper copper likes to killspurn em there is some interesting a history have been reading along the history of medicine of em people who you know for whatever reason were forced into or chose to be in the separate the prostitutes using a inserting copper coins into their vaginal tract to trying a kill term but to varying degrees of success obviously there is a whole a such economic landscape around that am think it is obvious wit an referring to but am very interesting but that is just one form of audio rite the their some other the indies and then there is course the ring we did not talk about that s may we just touch on a few of those within the context of whether not it alters a quality end or future fertility when one takes the ring out takes the guy out this is a great question because a lot people do not know this and an all roll through a few of the toppers control fatheads and just thinking through copper any as you a decide no hormonal involvement its causes inflammation and a toxic environment inside the uterus isolated does cause sometimes heavier periods but they should still be regular if they are irregular that is a sign of a hormonal issue because you still modulate with the copper tidy is it literally a copper wire woven in years i a it the liudyas is a little tea and the arms a have copper wires wrapped around them and in those are they grow into the uterine linin they grow into the stern lining gaudy just sits in there and just the presence of that copper causes that inflammatory reaction in that toxic environment and is it toxic to the environment in ways that are detrimental to the woman or just a sperm both i mean implantation as not going to occur likely writing no nothing as a hundred per cent successful but it is much harder for n embryos implant within that highly inflammatory environment to me amazing that people figure this out before its asanynone laboratories ray let this put some copper in the uteruses and see what happen it it really speaks to the the urgency that must have existed to preventing pregnancy and they just how costly biologically and the pregnancy is on easy pregnancy pregnancy's not health an neutral it is something tot somebodies needs to be in a f right other it can be a deadly circumstance when we get back to other dudes dudes that more people are more familiar with are the projstoron base dudes this is going to be our more ceiling biretta they have a bunch of different names base on the amount of projestoron and how long they last for these work mostly by thinning out the outer an lining as we already said project or own compact the outer an lining to prepare it for implantation an normal cycle but if you have constant exposure to project or own what is going to happen it its going to prevent the outer in lining from growing and it gets it very very fen not all dudes in fact most of them do not prevent population only in about fifty percent of people do they actually prevent ovulation their main mechanism of action is this indemetrio a fact when you remove the dude especially if you already ovulating no problem the problem we duty in some people with protestor an dudes that maybe is not talked about as much is that this prolonged protestor an exposure because people are putting dudes for five to seven years and not having a period for that length of time because the endometrium has become a trophic or nonexistent that you are no longer bleeding despite the fact that you may be ovulating it can take a while for that lining to grow back and it is not uncommon to have an idea place and if you have no period your going to say this is great i do not have a period wonderful you get it removed and now your period has not come back and that leads people to sometimes concerned that the dudes causing them not to modulator they have this in fertility caused by the dude but really what it is is that the linings become then that it can take many months of that unopposed estoredan exposure in the follicular phase to get it thick enough to finely bleed when you are ovulating i do tell people f they have a progesterone i to get it removed three to six months before they want to get pregnant you some other form of contraception but give their body time to make sure they have that regular period pattern back important distinction if your still ovulating and having a period on an mud then this is going to be less of a concern because if you are growing in enough of a lining to then she it we are less worried about it but if you are aim in a relic or have absence your periods with an mud we need o think about removing it for a period of time before you get pregnant that your body can grow that lining again when it comes to some of the other things that you mentioned one at you denounce that i want to mention is the demo prefer shot the devil revere shot is a hide of produstoron high enough to actually prevent population in that circumstances you are not ovulating and therefore if you do not populate yore not going to get pregnant devil reveres proven to prevent ovulation for three months when you take it you need to get it every three months to have a proven contraceptive benefit however it can lasting your system for eighteen months and prevent ovulation for up to eighteen months i will see people who liked that option for contraception and now they have not had a period a long time but their last demo shot was six months ago and there all frustrate it by the fact when i tell them will you still may not have another period for a year plus because this high level of progesterone that you have army injected into your system can last a substantial amount of time that is a contraceptive option that i tell people to discontinue a year and a half to two years before they want to get pregnant which sometimes people do not know that yet and that something that can be a contraceptive option for if you are very remote for wanting to have a child but in people who are in their child bearing years contemplating family building soon that is not my favorite option you have not mentioned because i have best asked am any negative consequences of birth control of any kind and ism not encouraging you to if you do not believe in them i know that this library controversial a topic but am one of the more popular studies discussed on social medias one that have spent some time with the paper m and a few of the papers that stepped from it am not a huge study but describing that how women rate the faces of men as either more essentially what happens that there seems to be at least in this study a there was a a statistically significant a bias a for women to select particular male faces as attractive in those male faces tended to be of the more square jaw aka masculine features right in air quotes right thirds what the study a found am but that when women were on oral contraception presume estrogen progestin type or contraception that that effect a was smeared they had a not a statistically significant tendency to a choose the quote quotmore masculine face have to be very careful of my language here because it is easy to get description of a study this wrong and that is a led a lot of people to think that birth control seen to throw off their partner choice a now of course it is a small study am studies it are not always well controlled am but is there any evidence that birth control or or esteem project in bases birth control just keep its specific can increase rates of cancers can decrease rates of cancers can lead to am any sorts of disruptions in a bodily a function or health that is really a rock solid result that is been seen by multiple studies clinical trials am ere we still just in the dark about a lot of the stuff o case in nothing is without rest getting fragments not without risk taking the birth control pill is not without risk do see hat the is been a lot of not informed consent in people who are taking the birth control tell meaning maybe they warn educated about what all of their options were the positives and the negatives about each one of them if organ a reference the convey to the tell estrogen prodestran tell important understand that neither the estrogen nor the progesterone are the same estrogen progesterone that our ovaries make it it is eternal estradiol with your brain interprets as an estrogen but other parts of your body may not and in its various types of progestins some of which have even androgen or male hormone properties and some of which do not there is a ton of variation even the amount of eternal steroidal that each all has with your low low in your low pills having last and even with the modern day average pill having a lot less estrogen than it used to when your on the birth control tell your ovaries are not making estradiol and that estradiol is important in growing the outer an lining but also for the general structures and we think about vaginal health and dollar health we certainly see that especially with continuous use if we distinguish you take the tell for twenty one days and you have a seven day break where you might bleed or you take sugar pills and then you take them again a lot of people now are taking continuously where you have exposure to these compounds every single day has i the the the weal the l l pouch with the feel of different colored pills they have seen these on then nonstop in previous relationships to the ah and then there is the ones that sometime you were just ought not to take as those of the not i de but the the sugar pills that there is no need to take estrogen during that these and then an then they repeat is the tacitly i cad but somebody were taking estrogen can anomaly rverycommonry now people and they are not wrong they say well why have a period in these little brakes it is not really a reflection of my hormone status which is accurate and there taking them continuously you also less tell failure pregnancies if your using the oil for contraception that can be a great strategy but the longer you take them we do see some imaginable lar changes rite in a trophic agent is people who notice increase sensitivity decrease elasticity increase discomfort with intercourse increase in with east infections that can sometimes be we because that environment is different now that just one thing that can come from the pill we also see the pill be life saving for other people they have terrible know pajamas or premenstrual dispose antrum where their mental health when they change from hide a lo enteron ways the change in estrogen that interferes can cause some people to really have mental health issues that are severe that having that stable hormone level is helpful and the oilcan be extremely beneficial for some people when it comes to mental health it can be beneficial for people who have issues with very heavy periods an a denials that getting blood transfusions yo taking the birth control pill might prevent the lining of the users from growing much that they bleed much same thing with fibroid people with picks pieces is polycysical variance antrum if we went o pit very simply you eve a lot o eggs in yourvault you release a lot of eggs every month and what this does is the presage signal gets deleted and your not responding to the normal signal and you do not ovulate and because the very is a hormone making factory gets really bored when it cannot make estrogen cause at eggs not growing it starts to make tesosterom you start to see this androgen dominant environment associated with lack of ovulation and having a lot of folicals inside the very that are not early responding entries it souse me interageization of other tissues body her dancing a voids air it typically the level of tesacteran made in vicious is not truly deepening vain it can if there is and a vermin tumor making tosaucerone or certain other conditions but typically with vicious you see increase in body hair increase in any and you can see some even male patter an balding some temporal balding of women some hair loss whats again it a a might again you had the widow being and then finding out in these two areas and then we see an increase and body composition towards a male level f we think about a male body holding your fat in your abdominal reach en and if we think about the traditional female body holding more fat in the hips and thighs area we see that when this hormone shifts and vicious you tend to get more adman old fat distribution which then leads to further insane resistance and matabolexan gem but in pesto es because you are not ovulating and those ovaries each little physical makes a tiny amount of estrogen will say each little physical when it is not responding will make one to two diagrams of estrogen but if you have fifty of them each month your having some constant estrogen exposure that lining of the uterus is being constantly stimulated to grow and your never getting the progesterone to stabilize or the progestrom withdraw to bleed in demetrial cancers much higher in people to vicious who don ovulate and the birth control pill can prevent that any unopposed estrogen situation because the body is made to have both estrogen and progesteram we see an immense decrease an indemetrio cancer an immense drop an ovarian cancer a caring cancer comes from the remodelling of the very every time you have a magical grow and it ruptures and it makes the corpus medium and than it heals up those are opportunities for those cancer cells t you go away in that remodelling process and lead to wearing cancer and because you are not ovulating on the pill your incidence of bearing cancer drops dramatically ten years of tell use has dropped the chance you get o caring cancer by more than ninety per cent and of course of barking cancer is superhero to diagnose because the enervation to the paritsnial system is poor and you do not have any outward signs often till late stage disease that being said could you potentially have an increased in blast cancer in some people by taking the pill by taking the tell that that is a concern especially in people who might be predisposed to this for some other reason might have recomputation thatsllina and then is there a situation where the pill certainly masks what is going on with your menstrual cycle and i really think this is where woman's health had has a huge history and paternalism meaning doctors what just tell people this is what you are going to do your periods are irregular here is the birth control tell and they are not explaining why or the prose and cons to it and what open as people are not being taught how their bodies were can now they are because of your podcast amongst others and now there able to know that my periods of vital sign and i do not know what it is because the pill is producing a different environment the pills also been associated with potentially development of things leaky gut or ideas and there is a definite change in your environment when you are on the birth control tell increase risk of blood clots betas of how its process in the liver increasing your cladding factors can just a car a were the a a fair freely high percent of people have a mutations in fact or five lighting a clotting factor a fewer people are as we say homes i guess have two deficient copies a mute copies i should say a but there many people out there the have one matin copy of factor five lion and my understanding is that or contraception in females can really exacerbate the factor five lidimutation do you suggest that people get get their factor five lion genetic analyst it is pretty inexpensive to do right i think on a standard bloodless you can disease for the factor five analysis in it is not a a really inept thing you would ought to fly to as ta blood was ye not ye lis you do not to flight o another country you do for many things it is importance hey does not the norm rightly that is not the recommendation when you are togging about putting somebody on the birth control tell you want o mature they do not have high blood pressure cause it can increase their blood pressure you wane to make sure they do not smoke cigarettes because the combination of the pill and cigarettes smoking can increase the risk of a stroke but the recommendations not to screen them to see if they have any inherited clotting disorders that is sad if you ever have a blood clot on the birth control tell cause you are travelling on a plain or you are just on the pillar living your life you are now gin to get this extensive work up to find out if you do have that it is by no means wrong and specifically you should if anybody in your family has ever had a deep tea a deep vain thrombi says blood cot in their la or a pulmonary embolism or a p anybody in your family as had one of those you should a hundred per cent get worked up for clotting disorders and if you have something it you carry factor five you should no longer take the birth control tell and specifically the pill because it is an oral pill and how it is metabolizes in the lever is actually what is causing the change in those clotting factors because that is where they are made as well it does not mean you cannot take any form of contraception but we do when i make sure that we counsel you appropriately i never think it is wrong to be an advocate for your own health or to ask questions it is important to know that screening i may all get on my soap box cause with like about screening for covering reserve and it is a hundred per cent not recommended even though i think it should be you the my next quit you be about testing a ma level ta and and will return to that for those that hear that and it sounds critic as well as getting an altrason to seen basely how many any eggs or are likely to be in in the vault on on both sides we is remember that screening recommendations come from at what point in the population does it make sense to spend the money to tests for a diseased base on the likelihood of finding it if we think about right that is what your papsmare guide lines and your colonoscape and your mammograms everything is abase on when are you going to find enough cases at some age to make it worth while testing which is a crazy principle especially in the us because the governments not pain for our health cares why should these guide lines be based on when is it cost effective to do testing why i all put in at this is gin around a lie but conspiratorial but it is not i and i think that given that for people who have insurance private paid insurance through their work om that there is a cost to doing these tests of any kind colon's come a mates et camera and they must have figured out the optimal point on the graft with which they can reduce their pay out to people who for instance get coin cancer if they did not get the colonoscobe at forty five as suppose to fifty is opposed to sixty has suppose to twenty five i mean this is amid the reality we know is that the more information you have the better choices you can make i man the only copy to to that would be that for some not all but for some people serve of the hyprocondriatic type sometimes more information leas to more anxiety which leads so more problems but that is a rare instant is i always think that in general data is always got i agree having the information at hand about your body and being able to make educated choices verses being in a position where you say i had no idea that i had factor five light and and i had this terrible blood cost because polmaramblisms can kill people we all know that right we talk ago t this rare thing but it can happen for this is really were it can be tough it can be tough to find even a doctor who made was that factor five as a blood's and relatively an expensvesife that one is not hard but physicians live in a weird world where you they have recommendations base on screening base on the likelihood of finding disease that they follow and when they go off of those they start introducing themselves to why are you not following medical guide lines but for an individual this is really tough to advocate for yourself and the one thing that it'll say to this is why paying attention to your body it is important right understanding your stool habits in what is normal on what is not that you can catch early signs of things and present for that colonoscop earlier the current screening guy line for should you get your covering reserve checked is that you should not cog the america college of obeduianne has an entire practise mulligan situation saying there is no utility and screwing for damage a in i totally disagree bed you have glad a disagreement to me it just seems not a or overs rather i mean the the apaches a blood draw a ma us the blood t has a blood draw i it one could ought to do the ultra sound is well which is course more invasive but but women who are seeing their you an are prowl familiar with with with colic example ye i mean san that in alter sound but it is not painful not painful but different then a blood draw just i just for in fullest closer and have heard of women in their early thirties going in getting the gamma slip will checked in their ultrasound an going all my dimness they are down to i i do not through out numbers was this fashion yet tricky they will see oh you have whatever forfolicles and then some one in their early forties will have twenty flicks and then people starlit you sit show becomes a score keeping thing and and of course nautical quality there much other thing yet of and that you can tell us more about those but let us say some one did not have insurance or or insurance permission to to get this pay for what is the proximate cost of getting one's a m h levels in list seventy nine dollars seventy nine dollars to find out essentially where your overlying reserveice and let us talk about this i desk s my back cock says you should not screen it because a m h does not print your for kind of ability right your body's ability to get pregnant in that month is independent of your a m h and for the most part that is true right because let us say you have a person and they are both thirty of two people one has lo o veering reserves they a e five eggs coming out of the vault and this one has normal covering reserve and if twenty eggs coming out of the roll a we should pro clarified that the number cause you said this earlier but the number of eggs coming out the vault is an indirect measure of how many eggs in the vault when that number is going down it means the number of eggs in the vault is likely going i also down ho your body sees to take smaller with drawls as you stare to run out yes the t all once to be at equilibrium ray it really wants to be in this middle ground when you too many it shoots out more every month it is to crowded it does not want that and then when is starts to get lo it gets scared about being empty and sends out fewer per month what you see outside the vault and that is called an antropholical counter an a f c it is an ultrasound base measurement of how many eggs you have outside the vault at one point in time and on the alter sound if one looks o this vagina she is it look little hollow spaces not gray stuff but but ya y bodies i say chocolate chips in the chocolates of cookie if we can imagine that oh your a air looks a chocolates of cooky the chocolate chips small little dark fruit philfolicls each one of those houses an egg some bigger than others because they are more mature than other a one when you check in the cycles o if you're looking in that early follicular face when somebody is on their period they all should be small because nothing's been simulated if ism looking paryopulatory it'll see that dominant police that is about to populate and then everything else will be small and is there a graft that people can a look at er that we could link to that says oke the the average with the distribution of you do not standard our on either side for let say a twenty eight year old woman or a thirty seven year old woman or forty five year old woman of the number of folicals on the right and left side and as i understand a symmetries are common yet tends to be a sone goes in in the got six folicals on the left side and twelve on the other side are they how how to people gauge what what van ether into on because their doctor should tell them ut that does not always happen but yes we would we add these counts together to get your antropholical count because there is often a cemetery but what we should expect to let us say in somebody who is thirty is you should have in the sixteen to twenty range of total folicals per month right and left side compline open cab when you are thirty five that number is closer till lake fourteen to sixteen starting to drop but pretty good when you are forty it is eight ten when your forty four two four rase start to have this immense drop that exponentially starts to increase really around age thirty seven things starts a kind of get into this severe zone really after age thirty seven we really talk about ages eighteen to twenty five but there are people who get pregnant in that derange racket are is the logical count very very high as there serenade is a non when your drop off or the other logical cunt would be higher and ism not occasionally have patients who are very young but have in fertility a one or frees their as i also i patients and not a drain to are in premature vain failure right because there can be things that go wrong even early but we should pity highlight again something that you said earlier but gash this what contradicts much of what is out there which is that even if you have lowfolic account if you collect eggs you are not changing what is in the vault you are not coming from the blot you cannot rite that those eggs are spent you now have the opportunity to turn them into potential pregnant correct i mean sild know right we have even dozen to ivy f but that is the next wave of technology is what we call ivy m and vetrmaturation people are trying to figure out how can you get eggs from the vault and get them to crow and the lab because that would open up possibilities for people who have few are eggs to have our higher efficiency of this process because one of the limiting factors when you are doing fertility you are doing beg freezing our ivies is how many eggs can you get vermouth and not spy some people f to do psyched after cycle because they can only get five eggs or five eggs but if we circle back to what we were saying when we got off on this beautiful tangent is that no matter of you have five or you have twenty eggs outside the all you are ovulating one you are trying to get pregnant naturally that is what the culpability is probability of getting pregnant permit naturally you have the same chance if yo are the same age regardless of if you have five eggs are you have twenty eggs and that is why cog came in and said well a m h does not impact to culpability it does not predict your ability to get pregnant or whose going to have in fertility and who not going t haven fertility there is no utility and screening for it in people now for want some speechless i mean that that argument make sense through the lends of just probabilities of pregnancy through natural conception but completely traces the very very very real situation where people are making choices about for instance whether not to stay with a given partner whether not to leave a given partner whether not to celery the processes building a family my egg a have a baby nail that they're mi as price s america college if whoever whoever is completely o go i sire lovely is but they are crazy and that what i say they they argue and their statement that finding that you have i mig not ism reading in anything at i thing in analogy that does not fail but it is if you can it is as saying of you can walk now great there is no reason to test for this inevitable paralysis that is going to happen at different rates in different people and the things you can do to offset in other words you could take a little bit of some tissue that will allow you to was ray in the future but when i can do that because if you can walk now you can wait ut now that is absurd that is really what it is and they say well finding out that you have low over reserve at a young age is going to cause undue stress that is unwarranted because most people do not have in fragility and they are purely putting it through the lends of your likelihood to get pregnant but into actionable stress exactly i give in distress ha guess what and i know people who have family members with huntington simulations and some onto not no whether not they themselves have have the huntingtonsimutation and and it is a very personal choice right ere but here that whereas unfortunately there still listens a a cure for huntington's hotel some day there will be not come would but in the meantime there is essentially a cure for the situation which is the harvest and potential for like at least an opportunity and this is what i say and of course you and i feel so fly education and out i being the one to make the twas is an extremely important distinction verses having it happened to you if you are young and you find out you have low over reserve is i going to make a difference and it very well might you might now freeze your eggs when you would not have otherwise you might now start to try to get pregnant if your partner when you otherwise were just waiting ut win my conversation with your partner ray right because a lot of you'll think they can just wait i do not you b as of a tour or thorny i car totally way but if you have a low covering reserve then that you may lose the opportunity for parent hood and for lot of people this is a lifegol and this is with wild to me when on earth besides reproduction do we have life goals that we take the approach it'll just wait and see if it is a problem later never right if you want to become a doctor you want to become an the you are constantly working towards that goal or understanding what it is going to take to get there but why does the goal of parenthood that the attitude is completely ism not going to think about it and till later and then it'll deal with it if it becomes a problem because you can make chain choices you could freeze your eggs you could try to get pregnant sooner you could if valueait for reasons of low over reserve you have a genetic mutation or an autumn disease why is it low it is not just always a big in known there can be some actual things that potentially might be impackful for your health long term i think it is while that this is the current conversation and i will say i know personally a lota you be due i ends who one hundred person we will draw an damage blood task if your a your annual and you ask and i recommend all of my by friends cause i see people at a different state drape when they see me they are struggling to get pregnant or they want to frees their eggs but we talk about this i say hay just you say are you trying to get pregnant now and if somebody says no and your follow up question is will do you want be on birth control the same question should be will do you want to be pregnant at some point and if should you consider freezing your eggs or getting this blood last checked and very often people will make a different decision with that information ism gladly your telling this because my understanding is at least in the state a californium o o at other states for we very by state that the opportunity to harvest eggs an frees them there say hard cut off that age i think it is forty two portage forty two o they will do it om after forty two they will do it if and only if you are willing to do in vetrforlization act for lion than they frees embryos but their for more reluctant to collect eggs after a forty two yet yes and no when you think about egg free in an via are really the same process right when you are going through the exact same thing you are taking the eggs out of the body and then you are either just framing them as an egg or your fertilizing them an the lap and that is via and making an embryo right away eggfreezing has changed dynamic over the past ten years whereas ten years ago survival rate of eggs in the lap was forty per cent really terrible and we really did not offer it to many people it was not something that was talked about and now it feels trendy almost but it israel just the neck has gotten much better and cheaper ye ninety per cent of legs now survived the free can ninety percent is not a low number by any means embryos are much stronger rate and egg is a single cell it is a single all and embryo when we frees an embryo that stay five or six is three hundred pluscells it is much stronger and those embryos survived the frees thought ninety nine per cent of the time yes there is a nine per cent different that being said making embryos a lot morexpensive eggs is cheaper you could do two rounds of eggs and have just as many eggs or m have more eggs than if you would made them in to embryos right away i never recommend that somebody commits to a sperm source that they do not want a have a child west unless that is the sperm source they want to have a child and this has changed because when embryo survival was much greater than egg survival especially if you had few eggs or you are older making embryos was the only option what we do know is that egg quality decreases immensely as we get older and we have touched on this we have not really mentioned it not only do you haw fou are eggs as you get older the crumisomes and side starts you lose their positioning and we think about equality we think about genetic normal sea and we know that the rates of annuploity or abnormal chromosomes increase is proportionally to your age which for people at arenawere re going to predispose not always em to miscarriages if there implanted or potentially even at the formation of it of the feats that carries for instance trust to mes cry crimson repeats or am lack of lack of certain groans these count be deadly or they could be a capable carrying to term and then build have undetectable oil to severe developmental am abnormalities correct correct and this is this is why you have a lower probability of pregnancy vermouth as you get older we look at your natural forcandability it is not because you have few are as because we already said your count vermouth at does not impact your probability getting pregnant it is because the normal sea of those chromosomes has changed dramatically that the odds that your bodies randomly choosing the good one to modulate becomes let and notes why those natural fertility rates are low because most genetically abnormal as do not fertilize our implant but if they do they have a significantly higher chance if is carriage is forty per cent at age forty rate you have a much lower chance of seeing the position pregnancy test but then your chance of losing that pregnancy is significantly higher as well when we are counseling somebody about phrasing what we know is that not every ago is going to fertilize with sperm going to make an embryo going to be genetically normal or even implant when it is genetically normal there is huge loss in human reproduction meaning the more eggs you have at a younger age the better the aïoli on this process is on to be it does not mean you do not do it when people get older but every clinic does have a cut off and every clinics on be a little but deferent lot of different reasons why we actually probably oven older cut off we will lets them to go through via or frees their eggs of take forty five and it is a lot about inform consent and having the approach that you are smart enough that if i give you the odds and i walk you through showman eggs you are and the likelihood of them making into embryos you can say ya but four eggs are ten eggs is way more than zero base on my circumstance and that is worth it to me because it gives me the opportunity to potentially have a child when otherwise my opportunity is going to the zero a lot of this is rooted in paternalism that people cannot as a patient understand these odds and they have unrealistic expectations the there is a huge shift and reproductive medicine to really counseling patient and giving them autonomy and some of these decisions but there does become a point where there is to likelihood of finding a normal egg is low that the money or the expense of the crosses does not make sense and people should utilize donation a other opportunities for conception this drop in both in number of eggs and the equality they really stare to become profound at age thirty seven and on that is when we really stare to see both these things are overlapping at the same time if you are waiting till age thirty five thirty six for your first kid but you want two or three we have got a really look forward about is that it is strategy make sense well what is your m age one or you going run out of eggs before then to how what other issues could be going on is the sperm fine of the tubes open because we are seeing that when people start families later when people have more chronic illness and autoimmune disease and o cecity that it is much harder to get pregnant and the birth rates ray for the first time in a long time across the board are dropping and in fertility is rising because of all of these factors compared basted on everything you just said and yes me one to say at a fifth time because the misconception about this is one of the primary reasons why people avoid harvesting eggs s not the only reason but when you harvest eggs freeze them now sounds the viability of those eggs is quite quite strong compared a few years ago so that is great ninety per cent a recovery o when they far them am is not going to diminish the number of eggs in the vault such a critical point am and post the age thirty seven there is a soundslike anon linear drop off in egg quality for most in these are averages quite right everyone n be up other people they a got origin with healthy kids in their late thirties in forties yes we hear you congratulations were happy am but this speaks to the and of the the logic anyway we are not putting any emotion or circumstances on this but the logic of somebody in their let us a late twenty es early thirty's getting their ay in ah levels throughusts roughly eighty dollar blood draw am and then perhaps based on their life goals and circumstances doing either one or several rounds of egg collection and freezing especially since it sounds you do not need to fertilize those eggs if one does not have a partner is concerned about what they arguing to do whose whose going to be a who is given provide the sperm at ism course some people choose to rase kids on their own am but parent tings the whole other issue but a they could do that later that raises the questions of what are the health risks if any pain levels if any and and that include psychological pain of egg harvests i mean to going back to what you said earlier this is going to be injecting am synthetic mimics of effasation ell ah am fallal stimulating hormone and uniting hormone may be some growth form n i hear now days there is also the practice of injecting i these are essentially a level rich plasma or p a pletelih rich plasmescuse me a or p in perhaps even into the ovarian vault we can get back to that there is a much o stuff that is being done to some one there is low swim where people are getting low doses of these drugs are high swim wards a full blast maybe can walk us through that procedure in just sort of general contact as i old require a lot of time to go through it all in detail but is this a horrible thing to go through to it mild to go through is it a walk in the park let let us walk through it all i love thus in this bet and bettering this is what i do every day studies tell us that if you are not ready to have a family by age thirty two to thirty three that is the optimal time for the average person to intervene and freeze their eggs it is not up for debate it is when you have both the inter section a still a good equality and good quantity on average and that is the younger than a lot of people are thinking about having families and the reason why is we really think about what happens to the egg afterward that is what is really critically important som one to answer the question about what you go through but just thinking we are to said you free your eggs ninety percent of them are gin survive the frees about seventy five percent will be fertilized by sperm and about fifty per cent of those will even make it to an implantation stage embryo or a blast more suing healthy sperm a square the firm no in a a successively an a rally a head my on the head one of the biggest issues with egg freezing is i do not know the future i do not know if this sperm is going to be great or not i do not gan e for a pot smoker just getting nonsmokers not getting a nonsmokers why not but we do not know rights that behave this future yet undetermined sperm source i am going to assume you are on o fall average on these at o points that were on to walk through but the reality is you buffer the risk by having more eggs frozen and that is why people are going through multiple rounds or cycles because we do not k no we do not know how that fertilization will be if you have twenty as and eighteen survive the freeze though and fourteen fertilize and seven make it to the blasters a stage if your age thirty we would anticipate around sixty to seventy per cent of am are going to be genetically normal you are young it's already kind of a big head at that age let us say of the seven four of them genetically normal when i go to transfer them i have at best a sixty five per cent chance of life birth perembryo which is really good when you put in the lends of a culpability and pique success fence to be closer to twenty per cent oudninpoint one embryo to a hundred per cent rand in plant one angry at a time now anyone as cut people ask for two doctors will do to it is it lowers live birthrate if we are looking at giving each embryo the healthiest opportunity at becoming a baby number one embryos with via have a slightly higher chance of monks i got it twenty rites o tweeting for turn tweeting comes if you ovulate two as they both get fertilize each baby is completely different genetically own beg own sperm monks exotic is from an embryo split because of the via process likely putting the embryo in the after maybe having that outer surface touched predisposes it to spending after you put it into the body wore identical swim yell o daughter two to three per cent chance of monks i got at twins with via and the natural chances point o three per cent significantly higher even though ultimately not a probable outcome ism an no have a couple patients a year who are going to have monks i got a twins and if i put two embryos and have now one taken this from a potential twin pragnenty to a triplets even a quad if they both split tens presumably the onto om cases on thinks without when they just literally put eight embryos inside but that is the whole them n that's medical malpractice it but really most the e time when we are tugging about embryos were tugging about people with infertility or people who spend a significant amount of money a huge portion of fertility as embryo quality writ the competency of the embryo the genetics of the embryo it is expensive to go through egfhreezing and ivy off yet the outer environment is another component it does not make sense to waste multiple embryos in the same uterine environment statistically does not make sent hit also does not make sense to make your embryos compete against each other will people put one obryointo a us say dean mom mi and one into surgetmom and mantra and get to sibling an simultaneously have defulally done not and have patient do that it is not common because seragase using gestational carrier is expensive and there such limited supply it is very hard to find somebody who wants to go through the act of carrying a child for somebody else but that definitely is a strategy that some people utilize especially if their older or there concerned that they might have a lower chance of implantation but they wan to give themselves a try but if we look at one embryo sixty five per cent chance of success cumulative probability after the second is eighty eight per cent car almost everybody's pregnant after two and these are you played genetically normal embryos aura and then if you go to the third cumulatively after three you played mayo transfers each one being a single mayo ninety five per cent of people have a baby in their arms meaning the incidents of er current implantation failure is actually pretty lo five per cent but how many normal embryos do you need for what family size if you are freezing your eggs because you got twenty eggs at age thirty and the example i gave and you just made four normal embryos i that is really unlikely to make three or four heads it would it has a really good chance of making one gives you the opportunity for a second but that is also presuming that everything happened perfectly that the sperm is not posmokings warm but you knowing not that quality sperm there is not other environmental issues when it comes too your own health when your trying to get pregnant or other diseases you may have we really need a higher number of eggs specifically when we do not know what the equation will truly look for one individual person when they go through the process and one of the only added benefits of embryos especially if you are partner if you are wissomebody who you do were i have children with you just don't one to have them yet is that i know the down stream i know the number i know how many embryos i have and if it is not enough to give you a high chance of what you want your family to be you can intervene now right because by definition with beg phrasing we are not wanting to be pregnant for years if you are doing this with a partner and you are making embryos and now i say we only got one genetically normal embryo you have the opportunity to choose to either go through more cycles and store more embryos for later to may be tried to get pregnant sooner because there some underlying issue with your fertility you can make a choice because you are falling off the curved there could ask o cushion to this a you mention each about thirty to thirty three in an ideal circumstance with the finances there et camera one would harvest a mexemless the already starting a family natural means a what about for sperm we we have all heard the study tat a with the increased age of the sperm that there is a higher although still statistically pretty small incense of things a spectral conditions am do you recommend to young get male em amen in their a late twenty early thirties to free sperm i means never go to be wrong to save your teammates because we do not have crystal balls for the few chair writes your ammines a your eggs and your s firm that increase and well just say negative outcome from advance paternal age really starts to be seen at age fifty most men are not looking at primarily starting their family after that age however what i reminds you all the time is maybe your working on the second family or may be life has gone down a different pathway and now you are with a partner who potentially is younger and ants to conceive and you now have older sperm having sperm in the bank it is cheap and easy to free sperm eggs i have anyone answers your primary question then the process of collecting sperm yew well not entirely without its issues is is for it is in there is on at was iadvut it is much sill it's r employ the is generally does not require hormone injections you know maybe for rare incenses where people ore hipliganatal or something but if your gin a freeze your sperm your ray you typically you are going to get some blood work done because most places that store sperm per after a guys lines have to make shore that if you carried an infectious disease at store in a special tanks she ought to get blood work done then you thought to abstain for your two to three days collect into a cup you're done which by the way is you can do at home and bring it in sperm or stay l you ever done this just bring it in its free many and the little man a lit a bit of i i think not in a thing that the my friend did this and told me but it is it is can outrageously easy in the sense that you just bring it in and they'll what take it out in the away an you is that your name and like very different in the egg collection ganger here is hears what it'll say about sperm and what i wish more men new sleshworman dead if you are going to get of a see to me because you are choosing that you do not want to half kids and we see many men who do this real they say they do not want a kids they want to go good of a see to me yet later on in life you do not have a crystal ball about life is dynamic and things can change if you are going o get of a sect to me go free sperm first where many men getting to sentiment i do not have the answer to that i can't heard this y a lot of men are getting to sector mes you en i that just take control over not having child out there when they do not want to use explains the drop berthrets a is ages that is e mihtevector is many people even if you are in your familylissy if two kids and all decided you are going to get the vessecto me that you do not have any more children things happen terrible things happen and life changes there might be a circumstance where you potentially would have another kid if something really bad happened or you just changed your mind freezing firm is easy and much easier than if you do not not all the setting y reversal's work especially the longer that it is been reverse the lower the likelihood that it is actually going to work and very often if it does you do not get firm and sufficient levels for a time intercourse and you are seeing me and the offs and in freezing storm is cheap an it is relatively treateslyk four hundred dollars right it is it is much much cheaper all in than the entire egg freezing process to answer the original question when you go through eggfreezing most people do fantastic and we will just use egg freezing an ivy eff interchangeably here because what you as a person is going through to harvest your eggs or to take them out of your body is exactly the same right the distinction between beg freezing an via is all about what happens on the lab end of it after they have come out of your body if we have this group of eggs that comes out of the vault your body does not want to allow them all to grow even if it is a low number right that is the check and balance to not have many kids we need to override that process and what we tend to do with this is you use a combination of frontal medications and very often i describe it to patients as suppressing your body and then stimulating it if i can temporarily stop the production of is h and you have a group of eggs come out of the vault and we can imagine that effasages their food and there is no food because you are taking the birth control tell for three weeks these eggs are going to synchronize be very small be very hungry for lack of a better word there face receptors are going to open all up it is a nest of baby birds that are all now starving instead of the hungry bird gets the worm now we go with this suppression period for a few week we can come in and give gonna a trends which is is h and h was h is now synthetically made in a lab it is very was s a synthetic compound that means the structure of the brain was h we actually can't synthetically make l h very interesting we do not a away o make it yet and we use the purified ruin of menapozzle women because when you are in menopause your was can l h levels are naturally high because they are trying to get that egg to make some strum a fearsome the we have covered man home on health before am and this been a discussion of h c g human corionigan at a tropic and which is dessensioly mimic l h in that in the receptor it does yet is a signal a a human coryonigan at a tropic is it purified from postmen puzzle woman's our we non sin it is synthetic a g is synthetic and what why can at what o mot it is called maniple men if you man appear is a combination of was h and h the reason why we give h c g to men to try to stimulate this formatagenesis process which of course if we could just give oh would give oh just the same reason why we give h c g for a trigger if we are going to go through fertility treatments and we are trying to mean that oh serge which naturally would cause ovulation we actually are giving h c g because it does mama oh when it comes to the receptor action of i but when it comes to really especially in wedding vehicular development and the relationship between h and is h meaning oh is really providing some of the hormone substrate that we need to be able to make storm and you really need some algae in a lot of people defining on your protocol or if your older on your naturally making less the example all the off shot would be the picks patient who has some naturally high late sometimes they do not actually need all and their protocol but they tan or these postmen upon o when ten er supplying the our no ray boy yes we lagan ow on an i when you sandier ye cut y entry go to the menopause in pay d ruin it it is called measure its purified menapostle neural ray dial i do not you on know that they no now now they no ten tho we use affixation ablates will just say and lack of better terms those of the two primary compounds that were gean over the course of on average a twelve day buried to get the polices to grow and the eggs to mature you can measure beg maturity by blood levels of extradite and by transnational ultrasounds when your going through egg freezing a ivyough your taking these person shots of affixation late they are getting those policies to starch o grow the eggs are starting to mature we are monitoring them along the way trying to determine the tying period where we think most of the eggs will be in the mature range these eggs have gotten to maturity you then are going to take a trigger shot which allows that final stage of miosis those crumasoms can separate my we think about the egg we remember that normal female genetics forty six exam and i always think about in the egg that these crimisomes are lined up your eggs are frozen inside your body when you are born your eggs are in metaphase of miosis that is when or metaphase crimsons meat in the middle and they are held apart by these magic spindles and this is why eggs are stink and fragile because they are held this and those mystic spindles just absorb the wear and tear of your life but when you use that trigger shot that l such naturally ore that c g an a cycle that is when you are going to that final separation into half the eggs you half those cremaszomsinto the egg for belle listening as to think about am a zipper we i i pulling a part of of a zipper that then you now have the the cromazolms just one one you now have have the cromazomes because why because in successful realization the other cromazoms ere can to come from spun whisper man that is way this process has more air the older you are and the longer your premises have been sitting there because those spindles are going to break down and we arguing have that increase an anuplody likely already said purely because of the impact can ask a cushion about that spider the thing now would be the right time to ask land hat my understanding is that a lot of the dynamics of pulling a part of this opera thing these cromazomes and then am is related to mite cordial done a because the lot of mechanics were literally talking about an egg splitting itself a in half i guess it is power halt yen the the mitacondre and mite cordial health is a big topic these days a and will be sure to touch on nutrition supplementation and prescription drugs that impact mite cordial health but have heard of a new procedure am called three parent am i the f where they are taking based the dona from the intended mom the done from intended dad am and then putting it into a a surrogate a done egg that is where the dona has been sucked out and than you know because it has health healthy your younger a might cordial done your mentally a say you have got a couple in there we s a late thirties early forties and they are not getting successful embryos our implantation or whatever things are not working they will take the dona from macadam in the and the they merge it with a third parent am incapsillation that there are clinics that do this i know that a a lot of this was i should be none anysterin rope until until recently am mexico offer either places mexico that do this in inland it is been use to a solve a might a conceal dis function but in the oasis still not legal is at right yes the purpose of what your toking about essentially we think about utilizing am a done might a conveyor donor a the point of that technology existed to help cure might acondryald diseases which are a hundred per cent fatal and you would have this subset of people who would because if your the mom you always pass on your might a contra to all of the offspring if there is disease inherent in your might acondrya everybody's going to get it n these are very severe diseases the idea of this was first to say how can we overcome the might a country a disease and give up people the opportunity which it has done that right now to it works when done properly when done properly especially for that purpose now that purpose is distinct because those people are not infertile right there is something else going on within there might a condryold disease utilizing that technology to overcome age orated changes in the as has not been successful yet are we hopeful that it can will people charge you money for it in certain places yes but you are you are hitting on a really important topic is that the political environment of embryo research in the united states makes it extremely hard for us to be the pioneers of new technology in this space and that is because a lot of us about an embryo or wind's life began that happens here in the was that results in limiting the availability and the possibility of doing research in a meaningful way on human embryos lie use it would require the destruction of a lot of of and it would also in you knight looked into the split as it from an academic perspective to be clear it would also require that the abortions be performed different my because section f torsions destroy embryos in ways that extraction of torsions do not t at is a very controversial topic and it is it is only it may be returned to i an episode about themselves in the future dominating because especially if you look at via whole separate as u is that there is millions of embryos that people are no longer using because they have had success they at extra embryos the bank they got divorce a variety of reasons and a lot of people would to donate their embryos to science feel hay i do not want to have this embryo an planted i don't wan to carry this child but potentially could something good or could help advance the field but that is not really a tangible option when people do that what is actually happening is their embryos are being utilized to train embryologists which is valid right to teach themhow to the in freeze and biopsy and do different thing still useful but it is not in a meaningful way we to really love to be able to utilize to advance the science especially for these embryos that have been created yet people no longer need them for family growth to what happenstall the embryos that people do not you fantastic question right now they sit in storeedge this ever well this is a new problem och via is only forty is years old embryo freezing alone write the first via we having gone to the process wot the first via baby there is no fash la to stimuli more of the eggs outside the vault to grow they followed the single police and they did not have the procedure which we do now which is amenably in five procedure to extract legs we go vaginally with a needle attached to the ultrasound and we enter into each police and we drain it the very first via you followed one police and you wen an abominably with a surgery to get put that needle into the physical and drain it out and give that just one aged chance and then of course there was no embryo freezing originally the field is still rather young to understand some of this and as technology rapidly improves we see things better successorates with freezing and thawing embryos better process of getting more embryos to grow but now we have a lot of embryos in storage that may or may not be use i personally tell people you should keep your embryos you should pay the storage my until no matter what the worst thing on planet earth happens to you you are done having children because sadly i live in a spectrum with my field where i fee lot of sadness and people who may be left lost a child something else has happened and they have may be a sibling who they feel they really want to give the sibling child the chance to be a sibling again and often you are much older when your experiencing thus and if you ad hat embryos frozen that you could a use but you have got rid of them you an be really upset if you find yourself in that circumstance i say you should save them until that you are not going to need them and then what do you do with them most people just discard them some people will do not ate them to labs which is called for research but mostly it is fer embryologist training you are better date which is also important am but mbryodonations a new thing being able to just we have people who do not ate sperm and do not ate beg embryo donation is the next evolution of an opportunity to allow more people to become parents little bit of the wild west people finding people and face not groups and connecting as this whole other dynamic when it comes to you will we call third party reproduction or what d you do with no owners an things that but it is a very interesting concept this problem is emerging as the technologies getting better ism realizing now remembering rather that when i was in college in graduate school you would see these adds in the student paper e freezer for downers and spirted owners spider generate throughout the life spend it is a kind of less controversial issue but this is now not allowed most places to advertise for fregdowners on college canvasses that is my understanding these goners were often paid whatever whatever they were paid i i guess say was reasonable mounts or doctcause i don't do not recall what they were paid everyone circumstances are different but the argument that most people use against this is oh these these people are giving up legs that they could otherwise use but we now know that is not true you've any knowledgist is was the the rational for for limiting the recruitment of downers and we ism not arguing for against i just i it is no longer supported base on what you said by the u by the argument that they losing eggs they would otherwise i will not be able to some others about proper inform consent especially at an age were the financial in entire can be very persuasive without under standing maxed not that it harms your fertility later but that you're going to hive genetic children out there and you might potentially and we are seen this now we do not know if you individually will have infertility for a variety of reasons cause you are not trying to have a family until much later but the same t concern does not seem to exist for men who are donating sperm we mean issue there is the whole done conceive community where people a really talking about putting new restrictions on will you sperm donation for example there are sperm downers who have hundreds of children hundreds right they're these sibling pods because it is been unlimited and sperm banks are a business that work to make money and they make money by selling more sperm but that is not healthy one for population you need genetic diversity but also it is not healthy necessarily for one person have all the half siblings and to just not know when you are going to run into somebody who could potentially be were sibling is that this guy at the bar that you do you have to worry about that if your done conceived we are starting to see sperm banks finely set to real back and put limitations on how many families total children halfway because one family might have a child and you want them to be able to have sibling children but at least for how many families that that done can contribute to and we are seen sperm downers deal with the fact that now there is no anonymous donation we can act anonymous donation exists meaning it is not identified at the time that somebody is beautilizing this sperm but with direct to consumer testing for genetics twenty three and me and ancestors people are being connected with their sperm donors with their eggdoners with their sibling pods and we have to believe that technologies only going to improve of time what people do for money especially when they are young i think without understanding the potential ramifications and i do not want to act sperm donation a donation are bad they give people the opportunity to become parents that otherwise might not be able to and that is a lovely and a beautiful gift but you need to understand what that might mean and how that might impact your own potential children later to to know that the have genetic half siblings out there donation people do get compensated much better than sperm donation there certain characteristics that are hard to find that compensated even more and certainly know ethnicity's doctor degrees and things that were somebody can rely pay for their education by do notating their eggs it is a it is a dilemma because what you would love to say it is freedom eggs for you too if you are going to do that you are at the perfect age to freeze your own eggs and there is been strategies to tray to mitigate this and i do not i get off too much on a tangent but it is a really fine line that you walk with what people understand there is a company and i will not name them but they are promoting that young women do not ate their eggs and they will freeze half of them for you and half of them will go and become donor eggs interesting business model that would can see the credential efficalconcer i think ethically this sounds good cause you get to free some eggs but i think more people will do not at eggs than otherwise would have for some of the reasons we previously stated and i also think you would get more money by simply do not eating your eggs and in turning around an paying for us round of freezing your own eggs you would get paid more and you would have more eggs because one of the issues is do do you now falsely believe that you have enough eggs in the bank because you did this split but you do not really halve enough because we already walk through the math at twenty eggs does not really result in such a high probability of having a mouth child family there is a lot of ethical debate in jamming and emryodonation it deny is the wild west and there is a uncharted territory even an embryodonation there is places who are very unethical about it who will only allow people to have embryos if they are header sexual been married for three years make a certain income submit to a home study yet they let the people have no say over the embryos that are transferred be it how many what stage what quality and they are taking evils money and putting terrible embryos inside of them and really wasting their resources which could have been used in another way at the dangers of prophetization of biology right and tax mean tact entering spaces is amazing but also technology starts to advance before studies rat tagisgon a become has more finance backing than we see scientific studiesgep i feel one of the major questions out there is whether or not i f babies call them there how the hire incidents of things spectrum conditions or other developmental trajectories let us call them and ism not trying to be politically corrective but punishing nowt is the word a disorder it has to be really carefully examined when considering any a neurologic a an psychiatric am situation am be we had discussions about this on this podcast before but but a lot of people are wondering just to be to be direct a lot of people are wondering do more i f babies have autism am then not if babies is this the good question and it is changed over time an couple different ways anything this is important to understand if we just think about the hormonal environment with natural conception and you have a pick estragon let they have two hundred something you have projustron being made the placenta is implanting and what is the main if friends with ivy f babies and a lot of it has been tied back to the you decent environment especially in what we call fresh embryo transfers which is really not a common practice any more in a fresh embryo transfer i noting the eggs it of your body fertilize them in the lab and grab out embryos and then ism going to put the best embryo back in your body five days later at the natural time of t n plantation and if we rewind the clock that is how ivies was done right when you could not frees and brits very well when they did not survive and you would a lots of embryos inside because they would not survive and thus the early days of via when you saw a lot of multiples a lot high order multiples and of course multiples have their indistinct issues that put them at higher risk for developmental disorders and issues with development and arrest in general a there there combo be far there commonly refer to is as disorders i just think a around autism in particular that there is t there is a camp a growing cam about there that what want it referred you differently we we would covered this a anytime this comes up i bring up both just a high the fact that yes we are aware and sensitive to that emerging issue right now unfortunately for sake of conversation there is no new nomen later we and easily get bill in on down and in the in the attempt to trying am smooth over everything with everybody and and t as a consequence confuse everybody i think we will go for clarity forward with the underscoring that the woman cloture s changing cane say it'll calling any more i because it is it'll call use disorder and i do not have a problem with that but lot people wonder those are two different things and this confuse again we went outhemplify send river people lucky feel free em to when we first for doing via we are putting embryos back in extremely unnatural environment if you have twenty legs growling and each up makes two hundred decagrams of estrogen suddenly now you have these extremely high superphysiologic esters and levels higher progesterone levels because here's more corpus mediums and this environment is not the normal for how the plecanti would invade in to that maternal blood circulate and a lot of these issues that are commonly associated became because of plecantalisues a lot of things growth destruction small fortesational age preternberth which further put you at risk for other developmental disorders were associated with these fresh tramp seers the feel this change we do lot of frozen and brio transfers on a lot of it for this reason we see huge improvement in genital outcomes when you bleed off that high hormonal outran environment and then re grow the lining of the uterus and a hormonal level that is more natural and then transfer the embryo and we see completely different beetle outcomes that is fantastic as far as looking at the change over the field but of course if you take all via babies over all time it is a little mercy because you have modern practice and old practice we also know that infertility people if you get diagnose with in fertility you are under age thirty five and you tried at pregnant with regular periods for one year and have not had success or you are thirty five and older and you have tried for six months and you have not had success you meet the medical definition for in fertility when that happens you now statistically regardless if you get pregnant naturally in the next month or you do veg you have one percent higher chance of berth effects and you have a slightly higher chance of developmental disorders is it more population pase verses proceed your base and there is probably something to that to underlying a lot of potentially what goes in or what can cause and fertility when it comes to quality of ex or sperm or you do not environment or things that were still learning about when it comes to autism specifically then number one strong at association we have is advance paternal age when you look at the people and the male sperm comes from an ejaculation after age fifty that one does have the highest significance associated with opium and also with some other very interesting to same dominant disorders we do not want to take advance paternal age likely although it does get much less attention than what we call advance maternal age or being over age s thirty five and a woman and not as purely because of the difference as and the sperm and the a environment and how their qualities an backfill thank you for that answer i think really important for people to hear that a because you a that the lower out there is that i we a hire incense of abolish n i v f babies but something a good percentage of those call be because of age related factors as well as technology related factors that u and that the technology is getting better all the time if i understood correctly a we did not complete the discussion of a i v f and i want to do that talk we in a few other things i know that that stuffing your wheel house before we do that can we inject a subconversation around miss because a i neglected to bring the supper earlier and i know there is a lot i curiosity about this and them will and then will a finish off i the f can we do that you for of applause in the ivies the trout the frozen spires out frozen or maybe they can put am livesperm on a unfroze excuse me a sperm directly on to those unfrozen eggs will pause their intermission for those a potential embryos a and talk about something that you have been very open about which is and a lot of people are not frankly in your profession s i really appreciate this which is nutrition and supplementation to optimize the the health of a equality and not just for people want to get pregnant but for but for people who believe that fertility is proxy for over all health i mean r other things that people should eat and not eat things that people should supplement and not supplement in order to optimize their fertility i mean this the devil an interest of in made all my fellows spores ere cycles around a kind ability and natural fertility and i think we really do a de serves by how manikin really is categorized by organs the stems because we back things in one place do not impact the other you ray butiyou have a body and your body and especially your hormones change and fluctuate in their meant to they are meant to be a dynamic system but the world and the environment of which you are subjecting your body to has proven changes on both oriental function and also when it comes to egg and sperm quality and if you are somebody who just once to live your healthiest life and have your most regular periods and have your hormones as well balanced as they can be for a lack of a better word will just say that that means that their function normally then inattention to the things that you do are really important and i know this is a big one for you sleep is probably the number one thing that people do not do that does not pack their reproductive hormone system and there for can impact againsfirm quality because sleep as when you have cellular repair and when you can drop your inflammation levels we know that inflammation is just toxic to ex inspire it is the inflammatory environment is not ideal for conception and then for a female you have to deal with the fact that you have your equality but you also have how inflammation or what your exposed to impacts your turn environment you have a a twofold situation here none of this should be shocking news when it comes to nutrition but it is not talked about enough your right decreasing inflammation by the foods that we put in our body is consistently shown with an improvement in faccundability an improvement an modulation in improvement in success with via and a decrease in miscarriage rite huge studies have looked at these now the vicariate is that new arson studies are superhero because people who consume flax for example tend to have other good health behaviors that sometimes make it hard to identify what thwacks did verses their general health verses somebody who eats fast food every day so nutrition studies him to be observational and fertilitdies studies are really hard too because what in point a you using is it getting pregnant is at live birth are you looking at idea f are you looking at natural fertility and we have a lot of different overlap that makes both of these a little bit difficult and they're all cohort base or population by studies where you analyze how people perform when it comes to fertility treatments or getting pregnant naturally based on their exposures to certain things diets high and fruits and vegetables are good for you right fiber any occidents fruit is not bad fruit got this really bad reputation o y love fruit too but people think that it has sugar and that its bad for you isfruos good is know is not that type of sugar is not bad for you if we can just agree on the fact that fruit has a lot of nutritional benefit especially when it comes to vidamends and any occidents that can be extremely beneficial an decreasing inflammation grain whole grains especially that your body in a provide a lot of great fiber course if you avsiliacer your gluten an tolerant your different category but there was much focus on to and people eliminating grains is a food group over all and even though that might be utilized an a dietary strategy to lose weight and losing weight can improve fertility likely because of inflammation being the primary driver because we know that even in studies where i take done eggs and i transfer that embryo into somebody who is overweigh they have lower gods of success than if they were a normal beam we cannot act that causation is just on beg quality from be city right there is also some inflammations and inflammatory changes that impact the bodies ability or desire to allow an embryo to implant suits wedgies whole grains are all good interestingly dairy marry tends to be coquet and most studies but what we do see is that if you are gunshot dairy have whole of the real thing the process day the skim milk that actually decreases your fertility and likely because the processing to make it still look milk when you take out the fat is adding an things that are unnatural potentially impacting your fertility i do not drink milk ameer but penis a teaatrink half an half on that recommending an can that merousees dainty mage your o you are tying a book and all now i just could afford to i was not try at that age o i was not trying to at all but am it was jut delicious but chooses how a full fat milk you gay a for now but do not do not choose the skim one choose tho actual one that comes with some of the milk fat fat is not bad for you there is also this rate we are holy were getting away from it it there is been such a low fat craze are this real attention that fat is bad but fat comes in many important forms avocados an oil is a nuts marry meat fat and collateral are the backbone for all harmony fruit you need at in order for your body to make the sturgeon and protest around that it needs to allow this whole process to happen and there is this idea that those are bad for you there just really not healthy fats whole grains fruits wedgies and what about ratings o meats because i think within those categories not i wot be thin of sustainably rased meats stiff possible it some people chose not get me but fish eggs love it all octet let us just go through the meats and the myth and the fact will do foot there is aspic assume that i too has soy and that too much soy can be bad because s we can be a lido estragon too does not negatively impact fertility even in men in fact it can improve it because it does have some any occident properties lots of iron when it comes to fish fish are fantastic sources of healthy facts and a mega the aliases which are very crucial in the reproductive process we do worry about if you are pregnant having too much fish and over exposure to mercury and how that can impact feel brain development the general recommendation is three servings per week that does my gest a serving is forth six an ay is a great a real human no all really e than is that eats you know sit eight lances are and i think it is important to say even though people will tell you that when you are trying to get pregnant with the idea we do not know when you are going to be pregnant if you are going through things up freezing are iveough and when you are going to be pregnant i would not feel tit you have to restrict yourself on the consumption of sea food during those time periods when you are not pregnant at because really the concern is about that mercury and what it could potentially do to a feudal brain an rosy food correct no sushi o sushi well when you are pregnant correct and notes mostly because of the risk of infection disease that can cause severe brain development and other issue is eduintupe i do not know i do not live there they pray laugh at this they probably do la ride e ai t at wen a whose hos am a in pregnant in jupon every child tell e were conceived in open tell us do not tell us the story the conception to but tells tells a d yet sushi over all meat is a really broad category and studies study it differently as at all meat are you distinguishing now red meat and chazan are you putting it all together me obviously i think we can all come to the agreement that process meats are not good for a variety of different reasons an addition to being person at fennec those talkers do negatively impact foretelling now belly meat no one ye but in specifically those things the began and the p the things that are really highly prosy hot dogs sorry the forth of delyhotdog picnic but those things really do not provide nutritional advantages and only harm especially then en we have red meat for the most part red meat when isolated individually and most circumstances in moderation tends to be fine i usually tell my patient i went the meat a plant forward diet that does not mean no meat but i say look at your meat servings i do not want it red meat every single day because there was a study looking at niveous and looking at embryos and the more servings a lot of nutritional studies base things on cortices who eats the lowest than the second most and the third most n the topmost and people who ate in that top tortile of red meat had lower progression of embryos through the culture less embryos that developed less normal embryos and lower successorates and what do e nothing about t how that meat was a rye which i any we don li hogan sin which s to graspedstake great is toadies are not wonderful but that does not mean that they do not hold merit and helping us guide counseling but now that one who as how many servings of red meat do you eat in a week it we do not really know does the really ethically sores the grassphad you this environment which we feel is much less talksick than potentially less they a cattle factory where the cows are injected with all sorts of things is there a difference and how those impact your reproduction probably right if this cows getting injected with a lot of hormones why are we thinking that it is not in acting the meat that you are then insulting into your body i think or dance certainly em subscribe to that i dead my thing most of them hell i the notion that the polutenence you breathe in the air somehow or not the the air that you breathing her long's is just completely and the the i yell feel that a and they hold strongly to this idea that it it cannot be this thing that i love that is causing this problem right the denial of the association between what we put in and on our body and how it impacts are body's function is really strong and some people and i think it is really just lack of education and a awareness because the medical community for long did not address these factors right your doctor never talks to to you about nutrition and it just be came this idea that it must not matter otherwise your doctor would talk to you about it i think sugar's the lasting eject at mention but added sugar and artificial sugars are bad for you artificial sugars artificial sugars too o cutin studios repaint was or a lowcalory sreeserevia it self has not been studied as much as the other ones things sweeten lo acnoleges but what we do know is that they interfere that cause inflammation inside the body and then they also cause can causistrust reaction and they can cause hie beats a miscarriage when you an take more sugar and artificial sugar that is a lot to wrap your head around and i see the same thing to every nation one cake one this one hot dog in those things individually are not can o make a difference right it is the choices that you make every single day that are going to set you up to be your healthy self or not and you should make times in long with how you want to treat yourself you want to be in your best health you want your hormone functioning the best and if that admit helps you get pregnant when you want to helps you have a better chance of success with idea o my gush what a fantastic benefit but the does not mean you cannot enjoy some of these bad things here and there as long as you have set yourself up on the day to day where you are giving your body lots of nutritious food that it needs to make commons similarly being you know very under weight in color restricting we all know is really terrible for your reproductive system and can cause the brain to totally shut down ovulation because it senses that you cant have a pregnancy is evil miscarry excuses me for am by virtue of being under weight does the body the i i learned am some years ago think this is still true that one of the signals for the onset of purity on females is that leapt in an a hormone is secreted from body fat am that then signals to the brain to that withalmiss locate it is others enough reserves to create environment it is a signal by environmental am the others enough extra fact to to have bat others presently enough food around a to sustain that man not right or miscarriages and lack of body fat correlated on both ends of the spectrum yes right lack of body fat and being over weight we see decrease and getting pregnant german and we see increase and losing pregnancies certainly there is a healthy medium where your body has what it needs and it make sense because if you have i likes even a hypothermic dysfunction maybe your brains not totally shut off where it is sending not no hormones in your not ovulating do not getting pregnant in that circumstance but certainly ovulation disorders are on a spectrum where you go from a perfectly sencranize cycle to one that prolongs it get shorter together than prolongs then you have nothing there's the spectrum of dysfunction which is representing your hormones not being you necessarily perfect and that can have impacts on the placenta trying to grow into that uterus and the ploce is fascinating right an entire talk just on the placenta but it has does this incredible job where your body has to not reject it yet allow it to eat away at the sight of your uterus and grow into your blood vessels but that requires a very specific hormonal environment for it to be done in to be done right i think in the same breath of all this would draw asking is yo case of that eating healthy none of that really new news for most people about of those things i just said i think but i be one o tank youcause i think an rarely if ever do we hear some be a physician be really direct about talisman some read me yes not excessive amount or any ideal from a as sustainable sources whole fat milk products grans fruits vegetables name those kind of am straight what bit do you seem straight for directors are i actually pretty rare in in the landscape of of public health discussion because a more often than not people talk about nutrition in these kind of elimination i tithing i eliminate all the grains or eliminate all the meats or am eliminate all the milk milk fats when in reality i think people forget that most people out their omnivore an they can make better voices about not belly meat less bacon if any bacon rat one edges with your hunt tray you can make better voices on the day to day i think thatthat is a great paint i think there is a place for supplements i think the big disclaimer that everybody can say with supplements is that they are not regulated the way medications are right and i will say supplements and herbs are different things right a supplement but many companies are adding herbs to their supplements and that can get into really mercy territory especially when it comes to how some of these herbs do you have estrogen and profusion properties and can impact reproduction and torments and perhaps even energetic yet yet yet we cannot act everything's created equal i was to be if i recommend you take a supplement or your doctor does your due diligent is to look at what is also included and make sure it does not have these extra added things that there unaware of because sometimes they can have negative impact at one stage of your life or another decision on where you are certainly criminal ointment which has follow acid we all know that follow fasciate is really important to prevent nail tube to facts but it is also important and subdivision and how the very is growing locals and growing legs should people women but also men be taking a vehement with folicacid even when they are not trying to conceive there is no harm in having it but very often pragmencies occur when you are not trying to conceive and that is a store that needs to be built up three months a head at time we really need you to be taking that ahead of getting fragment not just let us get dragnet right now ism going to start this predator vitamin i recommend anybody who is end their reproductive years take a prenatal vitamin we also know that many many people are invite him ended to lenient and within indeed does in pact reproduction and i usually say a thousand internationalingnes video index is not going to be harmful in anybody it is going to be helpful for most people some people definitely need higher levels we screen everybody with divide him indeed to see who needs to have extra but a blanket statement that extra invited indeed is going to be helpful the mere three fadiacis also extremely important in one being antiinflamatory but to train development of a fetus most grenades now actually do have those who mega three fadiacids in them but if they do not i recommend a patient take those just a breagoi haven a question suchioncerthon their the em there is a laboratory up the university calforno santabarber that is poison really interesting dit assuring that you o the sorry brain weight which is just but one in direct measure of bring health but brainweight in at birth seems to be correlated at least in some positive way with the amount of essential padiacids that mom consume during pregnancy does that sound is a ye let thus hold and there is there my studies about the nicer smarter when they have d its with a mgathry fadiasis when they're in you tore you wrist the exposure on the time period is very important no mega three's have a lot of help and effects when it comes to their any occident properties especially in an endometriosis diseases that are very highly inflammatory they can be very beneficial we are dialing to talk about your work about after baby is arrived and impact of e mental fatiasis but what would you say is the dosage cut off on this part cast before have to thrown out numbers one one to two grahams per day of the e pa form of essential fatiacid and we could one hold the scission about my gat three o me a six ratios but do you you think there is a upper limit is is it truly that you what is a up to for grams prepay of e p a o is without the advantageous is better than one graham i sell people gram a grant that is analonement with pretty much what we talk about before that is what i recommending non when i give my hand out to my patients and hair trying to get pregnant is can have a preneadle a thousand i use of item and gram of a mega threes and thin cotton cotton which essentially in general is trying to help the mite control thus the whole idea here that it is helping provide support across the body in a lot of different ways right cocusenasy is in a lot of different are is the body but en wen comes to reproduction when it comes to miosis an sell division and population and quality and even firm quality there is a place for cock ten showing benefit without harm rite and not there's the are here nothings without any harm or any rest harm but very very little i usually recommend if you are trying to get pregnant an you take cocuten a dose of two hundred pilgrims three times a day si this conn of higher dose than sometimes people are on and often preneedles now have just two hundred total in it an use the expensive ingredients are usually that the a the lower concentrations in an anyone just enough they can r exit on the label right includes to cocuten a does the form of cocuten matter cause you will find them in jail capsids who fond also find them in powdered capsids i always say i mean there might be for the individual person i mean absorption of medication is really depends lot on got health and other factors but the number one issues supplementation is at people do not stick to it i always say whichever one you are going to consistently take is going to be the better farmers a a push about i carnations yet researching a but for this epic another ay ye well carnations has been associated with some improvements in ford morbilli and sir may be ad quality a but we know that a very small percentage of the oral carnations that one invest is actually a utilize o some people shall purchasing use indictable ell canine which is count of painful causing in it it'll call they suspension not not comfortable scout to be done trmuscuarly but my read of the data kind of impressive i count say superimpressive are you ever injecting a patience or having them inject themselves with el carnations this would be both male a female or male a patient ore both a or using or of canine or do the date is not impress you enough to demotivate that we use a gram of a carnations with a gamma vitamin see for our male patient to have any animal sperm parameter and that is kind what we consider the spermanhampsman protocol and sous that sort that it pwentyvitemen goths to with the multividedmen and cousins o that kind of the male protocol of course there is different specifics for one individual person i do not tend to recommend it for most females that being said those who have indemetrios as fallen to a unique category where inflammation is high that usually it is a different inviremet where we recommend a carnations and axial sitting vitemencian e they downfall en to a different category has even known in lavatory disease but if we just tuning out the person at whole who may be once to take some supplements for their r e protective health that have very little side of facts and for the most part can potentially be helpful is can be no octan a carnations item in we can be helpful especially for the male for the female partner ore going to be looking at that extradite de in addition to the predator with phobic acid and what abut a women with vicious i get soon an apache i nocitalso and there are we talking myaocital or the what is it the de cairn i don it have that right you do have the right myonocitale is the main driver of a social and how it can be helpful if you most blender can have a combination of both of them but a much higher ratio of myoanocital to de cairn and moon hostiles probably the one that really is doing the work and pilots what is it doing it is evilly helping the body when it comes to insolent and sugar helping the body be more sensitive too insolent or less resistant to it essentially helping you respond to what you eat in a better way and also looks it does potentially decrease some of that inflammation pathway in vicious in pilots this insolent resistance correlates with this tastaceron production from the very meaning even that foreman alone can decrease tastaceron levels based on some of the change that it has in the very take noblemen many is taking that foreman or barbering thinking o this is great on the lower my blood sugar mimic fasting and live longer and and then these are also the same people who are writing me go how can one i take that former night either have headaches was i you know essentially his bi a i see no but also their testator levels are a are getting crush not in every case but it happens then i think this we thinks people just do not think about they read that a supplement might be beneficial for this one thing that does not apply to them and they start taking it o also the evidence of that form an extending life we had peter t on near ticked by the the evidence for that is is o poor is just not really that convincing it may change but and now all the excitements about rap of my sin and a extending your life while plummeting your testosterone i mean that that is a i sew that strains been tried in t e on levity come there is a there was a whole castration i do not o i can write that oh yetis was the heavens gate cult where they castrated themselves they do longer well they end up committing mass suicides e a they end of the experiment early a manly am yes in any event am going back to o supplements or i couldn't help myself am supplements that am women can percentile take just i increase their fertility even if they do not want to get pregnant as just cone to creating a miles of health you talk about the nutrition you talk about cokuten maybe all carnations within an c a the essential padiosits getting at least one gram of e p a that might require taking two grahams of of fiscal o are not an yet that e the e p a a mown ositsall how much or you talking about ih'veseen some pretty high dosages thrown out there mi o not can what is he don't moms oke taken before sleep or it does it matt what does it matter that it the matter thank you for covering the topic of supplements and supplementation am this is probe good point to return back to those harvested eggs a eggs are out am and there is a collection of them frozen am maybe just maybe a live they areaways alive sorry a i mean rapper at i la thlrashwere the fresh sperm they are not always some portion of the ejaculate is going to be am dead spermright some live some form motile some non am for motile the twitches i read is the name i the a and cay they get a wash the the sperm why because the almost of what people see as ejaculate or know excuse me as a ejaculate is am is not i they the sperm i ma giant but sperm wash there in one compartment am yet the eggs a ut you you or your embryologist at your clinic is then going to tat some point decide to combine them as it can is it a sperm race or you maybe could explain icy and why would one want why would one of for i and are there any risks with my because they're you really at some level this is the only place where i cant sit back in o we somebody ye say neral development night some level your saying he that sperm looks good whereas when you run a sperm race nature saying he the sperm really did beat all the other sperm let sike way first because think this as nice because a question i get of all the time we tug about nutrition and supplements and all of that is you now your doing ivy at for your freezing your eggs and what if what behaviors are good are bad of course all of the same ones are but about how long done to do them and this is why if you live healthy most of the days it does not only matter that is high your living but we already know the sperm cycle i about ninety days and the eggs i to say another in the vault they become they start lining up getting ready to egg at the vault and become more susceptible to the things you are doing in that ninety day window and we know that to be true as well they start to be price selected for whose coming out the next month they start to line up and making these changes as you start thinking about getting pregnant doing fertility treatments is still extremely beneficial people will often say well i have not been doing to why start now s nothing to make it deference but truly it can or all drink up until the week into a day reel us of us i know o r i got old have my two glasses of wine which ritually equates about six glasses of wine when you measure out by how much is i a right right up until the week before getting pranging or something can i know people always ask what should i be doing is these healthy behaviors and you should be doing em this hold time when we do i an i ma gets all the things you just ask but earlier you said of how tolerable is it the truth is you are give taking shots these are subutanea shots during the growth process next to the million next to the bellybutton how dingbat it gives ensign a very small need i mean nobody loves shots but they are not a big and crepuscular shot it is not a flue shot or something that this have been out in the text mosquitoes the away her layaway wars than one of these needles exactly to you are going to use those medications for about twelve to fourteen days you are going to hat your folicals grow your going to feel that you have pelvic pressure as your estrogen rises you are also going to third space your fluid which means your fluid your water component of your blood is going to start to dis e out a little bit and you are getting it more bloated you can have more water way going to feel puffy air and that is very common just because of getting the eggs to grow you are going to mentally be fine cause the female brain lives high yesterday you are doing fine as not one of the main concerns is how emotional will i be and during this face of the process people great when we take the eggs out of the body its about a twenty minute presager it is usually done under ivy sedation chopfallen retinal and we are watching while we drain those folicals and get tusttuves full of the eggs you some people option tot use any a they i say i i hear hard went in all ism sure all li away dentinal crates and i you obviously medals at a drug that has its uses a talidusis in that a medical community am the any one just can of for just i you we finanasesiologist who is really talking the patience i mean propefalls the base of it certainly there some patience you may when it avoid narcotic usage and they use different strategies men here is this huge great the retrieval's pod cast came out form the new york times doing a deep dive into a fertility cognac male were a nurse with siphoning off dentinal for herself for herself and replacing at with sailing and giving patient sailing these this clinic did not do anesthesia base proposal they reimposed to just get retinal and have kind of e less pain environment not a know pain and ironed and not not just a few hundreds of women reported extreme pain extreme pain through the procedure really speaks largely to pain not being taken seriously when they went and found this out what happened to again would us what happened this a technician well i mean ye they the the turn a one fin all behind marsh yet i mean and but it is you just has too man i cannot imagine i cannot imagine doing i do this pretty her all the time right have done thousands and thousands in my career and i cannot imagine having people be in pain during it it is but it is important to now that some clinics do not use have ease edition or they do not use proposal thy do not put you to sleep understanding what your clinic is using is really really important to set the expectation or to know an mi going to be awake or my going to be asleep toothy should ask you to what specific drugs or gin to give me to your up and i mean some clinics only do one i am not going to do a retrieval undergo sedation now some clinics would allow that some clinics that is all that they do but you that is a huge piece of puzzle that you need to know if your patient are you going to be feeling pain not feeling pain what is at going to be it'll see most clinics use proposal and put patience to sleep and you take a nice little nap for fifteen to twenty minutes the eggs are retrieved from the follicles under direct visualization they are ictus tubes you wake up and you are going to feel crappy and you will get a period finish days later but you this is when you will feel your worst use just just the one thing one to say about tolerability of it can you get prion into met ye weather is a a case report of an goner who is do not eating her eggs and she had secs with her boy friend and because not every egg is always retrieve fro the folicals or some small ones could ovulate to and she got pregnant with quint owlets o o cat you've to really tell people not to have inner course one from an infection standpoint was we really are poking a pretty large gage needle through the vague yo cost into the partial cavity we don't wan a introduce infection but also for pregnancy an that time period and if you got pregnant your risk of what we call o german hyper stimulation sundramar a h us us is very profound what is normally happening is after the retrieval your estrogen and progesterone are on o drop you are going to feel a severe p mas for lack of a better word you will be more emotional you are still pretty bloated until this all heels if you get away oh us us which is very uncommon in modern practice but when you did fresh an brio transfers or people who do not utilize some of the modern protocols this means that h c g continues to encourage all those folicals to make estrogen and product around and if you are pregnant yore's can have a constant yet exponential increase an h c g and this is going to get worse and worse we really do not want people to get pregnant in that time period u we when during that temper at the word sex sons it in the few days befog lie action typically i usually say it is from a five of your stimulation pay usually the earliest retrievals are run of around cycle day nine or ton if somebody goes fast unto your next period comes it is usually but a three week time period where we want you to abstain from intercourse for the most part though the more eggs you have the more you arguing to feel both this hormonal and physical shift than the few ere eggs that you have if you have a low account and youyou need a do via for frees your eggs and you might do multiple cycles are rounds you arguing to tolerated actually pretty fine because you are nocking to have these fun she's physically you are gong if you'll fine and that is always a big concern when you mentioned earlier about different stimulation types people have this idea that things that are more natural are better i just this human thought that natural is good an synthetic is bad naturally you ovulate one adamant when we are trying to get eggs out of your body the success is determined by how many eggs i can get and how young you are it does not make sense in most circumstances to do a mental stimulation protocol meaning purposefully under stimulating somebody by saving the money in medication cost in order to purposely get few are eggs because their odds of getting the ultimate success of what they want is going to be much lower is there i do not want you be in the position i do want o put you rather in the position of and having to i demonize your your colleagues in your profession but i could see others a pretty significant financial in pensive for people really desperate to have children or or just simply might one have children down the road to the here lost is better were talking multiple lost cycles they might be even a fraction of the cost of the fullstops cycle within there many many more you got i most in cycles you got it you make a lot more money by doing things that are not in the best interest of the patient and i mean that is not uncommon in my field which is very sad but it does mean that because reproduction in via are foreign and unknown many people walk in blind not known if what there being told really make sense for their situation there are couple situations where mental stimulation make sense if you are only going to make three eggs ore only to make three eggs i do not need all the drugs in the world to tell your body to make three eggs cause heres only three and that is a senora where mntamal stimulation does make sense and then there is the scenario where there something called invocell has your research expose you to this invocell is a way to try to take ivyouf in to making it more financially accessible for certain patient populations mainly people who do not modulate your very refractory patinas patient who does not respond to medication or wo have table factor and fertility right your chelonian tubes are blocked because of clematis or an demetriosas and we just have a problem here that egansberm cannot get together because you are not ovulating or your tubes are blocked an invocell it is a device that is plastic and you can fit have to ten eggs in it and there is a little middle chamber where the sperm can go and you go through this via process with the gold to only get a to ten eggs coast what fits in the device and ten you put the sperm in the middle of it and then you put it inside your vagina and you hold it in place with a diaphragm and the vagina is the right temperature to incubate and you incubate your embryos in this little in vowels container inside your vagina and then five days later you come in and we take it out and we take the bastembryo and we transfer it and you can do a fresh transfer because you did not make many eggs your morons wasn't high you people this pressure the something a sum ylikstenin proximity to the springing beg your take taken at home i case on o love this procedure and sir some circumstances and i see it applied often in the wrong case and that that can be frustradyoug mikes it still not cheap even if it is cheaper then ivyouf it is still not inexpensive an any means and patient selection most things and this field are important lit o say if you have had no at give per if the sperms the problem then it is probably not smart to just presume that the sperm an egg will be fine and there right that might be a case where you really do need help with assisted fertilization or if you have unexplained in fertility if we do not know why you have not been able to get pregnant because everything looks good on paper what if fertilization is the issue and these are circumstances where you pull out an enbocell and there is no embryos and you do not really know where went wrong was it the fertilization stop was it the growthstup of the embryos in culture you do have less data notably i data you cannot do genetic testing and this is not really a strategy that allows you to freeze embryos for future family growth that being said the young patient who is got great beg quality who might have really bad vicious or table disease it can certainly allow them the opportunity for a child at a lower price point when they still have many reproductive years finalize their family yet also is a lovely option four people who need do not sperm to conceive because the successoraces with this are much higher than an i my which is what a lot of people use an intributan in semination a putting this firm in the uterus now were able to improve this outcome our same sex couples or a single parents by choice if it is a single woman whose trying to become apparent then they need a by done or sperm and go thou the process anyway this often can improve that efficacy through the process pending their age and other factors there was a study that it is fully need there is a lesbian couple and one of them the eggs came out of and the other one incubated the embryos and then the other one had the embrace transfer o but it gave both partners a way to feel a little more involved in the process which i just ink is always a really cool way when you have these different options with reproduction seems also em that it is a more of a three to regional environment i always imagine that the putridity is no a approach am is that two to mention compared to the body and allies things having done self culture before and in a cultured our on on things that sure lice e these these concerns wet the concentration of s to tononanthing or you don got forbid if there is a a fluctuation in you you have back up generators and things much in the electrical float of the incubators that is distracted rest the natural environment of the body even the fluctuates in temperature it is on this is evolved over you tens of thousands if not e hundreds of thousands of years to be the process by which embroils are created there seem here is were i sort of default in my mind anyway o to the and all it seems more natural you are incubating in the more cortinguat more naturally and but of the same breath what why are you having in fertility if you are an infertility patient right if you need do not or sperm you maybe do not have in fertility or if you have table disease you have a very defined reason why we do not think that there is this huge in lavatory issue in your body or something unknown again it'll see it apply to people who really are bad candidates for it based on their age or based on their diagnosis and it is not always better but for the right nation hear have have patients have babies that way who otherwise may not be able to is just taken i can really open up the door that is the most animal of the minimal stimulation right then we have minimal stimulation because you do not have many eggs we do normally need that but for the vast majority people who go through beg freezing our idea we are really trying to get as many eggs as you potentially have everybody has a different number but whatever you have whatever that antropholical kind is for you is what we are trying to get and that is what these combination of medications is trying to do when the eggs come into the lab if you have egg freezing very important to know as before we get into the sexy discussion the eggs are stripped of their outer cells what is called he cumulus that is what the sperm has to attached to in order to fertilize in order to freeze the eggs this cumuli sells are stripped off the eggs are frozen you have to do sexy if we are gin a leading to this icy conversation if you are freezing your eggs you are having next when you fertile see i do not want somebody soever not know that if that is what they are choosing nix is you can tell us yes i see sands for its i see aside or interaside o plasma sperm injection it is taking a sperm that under the microscope looks newarmal in shape and moves well and your pulling it up into a little needle and your mentally using a little lair on the side of the ago ore the zone a pellucid of the ago and your injecting tat one sperm in to that excide plasm and you are picking that sperm on the basis of shape motility you are piking what you think is is the best sperm in the batch obviously you you are picking i mean there is eon me one sperm peag there is multiple sperm that are chosen but you are picking sperm that look they have the highest potential my understanding is that there is a range from very low to potentially high but hopefully not high of din a fragmentation and pretty much every sell the bite the cells all to repairing its done when visually selecting a sperm a for e for icy it is it is pascal morphology shape in motility right you cannot see the doing damage inside the head of the sperm on the deonaat self i we soon have a technology where you can actually a get a dye that could label din a fragmentation and select em because i feel when we talk what en bryology not to get too far down in the weeds but a the the methods of selecting eggs and selecting sperm i mean these are the same methods that been using in geology for since the nineteen thirties all this one looks good that one looks good and the skilled biologist can can really develop a a real talent at overtime knowing what corrade with healthy pragmency and an an offspring but i do technology youould think that by now twenty twenty three that some one would have some die that you could drop on the spirminggol will that one has lot of of din a fragmentation in that one okay there should be better ways to choose which sperm there is family people are trying things nothing as proven to be helpful far there is early some in rest and this because we are tarting to get more insight as we have become better at embryo culture getting embrace to grow doing centric testing on embryos to understand that that mel genome kicks in at day three and there is a subset of people who have beautiful fertilization and embryo growth desert to three and that is all on the egg and then as soon as that male genome kicks an you have this huge drop off in your embryo number and even some of this is in the context of normal sperm parameters write things are normally normal though er there is something underlying it dead that every embryo failiuron day three post realization not on but not but it definitely means that none of the ones before that can be blamed on the sperm and once after that there is finally still maternal and sperm contribution and we don't great any o et a couple a disputes around this om but it can be an an insight when you are trying to look through somebody is i be off cycle about potentially modifiable factors right can you improve sperm quality by some of these lifestyle measures i mean the debatable thing about a dona sperm fragmentation what is that it is not a normal seaman analysis but it is that as far as as they sperm sample that is then sent off to be evaluated how much fragmentation or abnormal dona is in the heads of those sperm the studies have shown that people who have abnormal deny sperm pigmentation should do icy for that is the point of the study now i sees become very commonplace sexy choosing the sperm to put into the egg originally did not exist tries o what is the alternative conventional fertilization this is having your petty dish your eggs are on it you sort your sperm yet cover it up yet put t in the intubate orshedin man you squirt your sqranshe sense went the ten the embryoembryalitis squares the sperm on matter just the and then pulls it out and the next say sees by which eggs and firm fertilized well it is really devastating to pull out the dish and have no fertilization and it definitely is a cause of infertility and it can be very hard to know that because fertilization is not challenged on a cella level until you challenge it see used to be an out on cost it used to be a separate thing because it was harder to find embryologist who could do it it is standard that a lot of clinics do it the majority of the time purely because you often do not know all the variables that are impacting fertilization and you are trying to give somebody as many opportunities as possible see have in a lot of those original idea studies got some of the bad reputation of being the problem with why you might see that one per cent rise a birth effects and ice took the brunt from a lot of that we really do not see that when we are growing out and we are doing freezing the embryos doing frozen transfers and was i mean why do you exceed almost every patient among a saying every one be hire probability of success probity success and when you get to this point and few people have in turns coverage they are spending the money there getting second mortgages are taking out ones if there is one decision that you say will i do not know you could have zero eggs fertilize or i could have the embryologist pick the best firm and put them inside the egg and we expect to seventy five per cent chance of fertilization that make sense for the majority of people that that the mix sense to me i om because ism obsessed with data and you the blood work fairly regularly none not obsessively but the twice a year or and now i did not always you that i actually did when these m the inafragmentation last at their pretty expensive the other in the warm more than a seaman else otherwhere the no lo the other show twelve hundred dollars fifteen hundred dollars or at least the one that i did it was vreayinformative of relieve to see not abnormal levels of den a fragmentation but i will say that haste on everything you just said it seems it might be the lower cost option because the alternates to go through repeated cycles of his the effing its failing and that is certainly much more expensive ifs and i mean i will say that there is some current thought by my neurology colleagues right i not a neurologist but definitely when i have a male who you needs a firm extraction and may be had a prior posactime maybe his got very oosperm counts and we are going in were doing a sperm extraction procedure that potentially if you have a patient you has an abnormal den a sperm fragmentation and even with icy has this drop off an embryo growth after day three because the sperm are still be made the same way leader they still fragmented that potentially the ejaculatory process could come some of that fragmentation and certain men and the by going in undoing a sperm extraction and not subjecting those sperm to the rigors of ejaculation for lack of a better word could potentially lessen the fragmentation and improve outcomes and i have some patience to we have gone down that road and that has helped them clear to say there is non a study that is not the point of dean sperm frag its to try to distinguish if potentially sexy could be a helpful technology but a lot of doctors are offering or doing eye because we want you to fertilize your as when they grow it in culture as we took wat i be exchanging the metabolic needs of the embryo change throughout the process and and trial culture has become much more successful but even in those best case than areas were looking at fifty per cent progressions your gone a have loss throughout that culture process no matter what and you said fifty per cent progressions half of the fertilized embryos that make it pass lately the sadly seven than there screen for come on mom abnormalities that ocean you have got unless two or three of those may before company how many gean cursed and your age and then an manage yest think y you and then and then you said of those that are implanted in to let us a woman i you forty five or younger you are looking it about anywhere from thirty to sixty five per cent ism successful in plantation an pranks you a healthy baby it is usually v sixty five per cent chants of life birth if it is a genetically testa embryo that that that astrict is the f and that is why you are gin to see such varying i v f success rates because if you do not do genetic testing of embryos let us use the forty year old who makes four embryos and i send them off for genetic testing i anticipate she is one normal embryo if i do genetic testing which takes it is called pig t preamplatation genetic testing i am testing for anna polity is the traditional testing me does it have the right number from is comes you can also importantly less for single gene disorders cystic fibrous or honeingtons but if we are job doing pay t for anniploity i expect an a related proportion of your eggs to be normal or abnormal at age forty i expect twenty to twenty five percent normal i can choose that one and put it in you and have a sixty five per cent chance that you have a baby i could not do it i sell the same four that one is in there but if i go in transfer them each independently ism now going t have closer to a twenty to thirty per cent chance of success it it is not that ism changing the embryo by testing but ism allowing myself to have higher utility of success higher efficient ceil putting somebody through less file transfers which is extremely important and less miscarriages because those also take time and one of the most important things is the you have the opportunity to understand how many potential normal embryos you have an batch cycles you could go into another cycle because ism forty i just not my person i really one to have two kids because my airline is really important in my life yet naturally by the age i would be for that second child it is going to be very hard to conceive i can go through i deaf an b och some embryo i could save two or three for that second baby that ism not going to transfer for a few years and it is called embryo banking and that is changing the ways that people can potentially grow their family to later ages but you do not know that unless what is normal are not and it also gives you the chance to goad an intervene right now because right now especially of year older ism have a higher chance of six sens than if i am four transfers down the road and maybe there was one miss carriage and there two we are suddenly now eight months down the road before i can go do another cycle and get more legs verse s if i found out that none of those were genetically normal the average forty year old might have the road to one if they have average overran reserve per cycle they are going to need multiple cycles is not that it is impossible but its just studying that road of expectation for them but if i do not get any normal embryos i can turn right around and go get more i am using what is left in that a varying vault each month to try to get to that opportunity of a pregnancy for you and a much more efficient way by utilizing genetic testing of these embryos this is where we can put in lips in in airlike shot dot dot healthy baby and am maybe in the future a if we are lucky you will come back and talk to us about healthy pregnancy also and ah healthy baby onward am they'll be a fun an important set of discussions i would to touch on the call the issue but the topic of menopause which i room is to find as the cessation of fences am but there ism guessing and ism messing it is the constellation of things that happen u and i have a very street for a question which is is there an acceleration of the onset of metapaus are we seeing that nowadays are the good data on that should people try to delay menopause what are some of the things sat you talk to patience about rems of their considerations of ways yes that transition may been off at that transition with a armor replacement there be r other the reproaches these are great questions and i do you think this is going to be a huge interest in upcoming years as we have learned more about the man apostle transition and the health risks really associated with being hypo estrogenic or having low estrogen men pause if we define it as ovarian failure your ovaries now have no eggs or few legs that they are refractory to the brain sending out eyes age your brain is sending out all the effect acknowledge that it cane your very is done and not making any estrodyle or product or own any more in this tying period what we know is one are we seeing a population be increase in earlier menaces there is not been a study to say that observationally inclenecally i would say yes because i see many younger women having low covering reserve or having premature ovarian failure or premature ovarian insufficiency which is the more politically correct way of saying it but when we think about what this is is there are modifiable factors right if running out of eggs is a variable and we are any said certain things smoking cigarettes and exposure to tocsins and likely chronic inflammation and untreated disease we know that having diabetes those things increase your risk of going into menaces earlier paying attention to the life style that you have when you are not concerned about your fertility right when you are in your younger years and maybe you are not worried about getting pregnant yet you are not worried about menial but those choices that your making in those time periods at least for women your eggs are uphold on to them they have an influence later similarly trying to live a lower and lavatory life and getting sleep and avoiding toxins of which you a one its some of the best that you can do to try to naturally prolong when you will go through menopause with the huge aviate that everybody is truly born with a different number and you do not control that you do not and you might have been born with a lower number and you cannot change that trajectory and you might have cancer and be exposed to keep with rape which also will deeply your ovarian reserve but do things indemitriosis especially if it is not being treated in any fashion that is where we think the birth control pill or progestin exposure or surgery ways to go in decrease the inflammation it is that inflammation as so saved with in demitriosas that is really causing these women to have low ovarian reserve and go into menopause early not only is that in acting fertility and how many eggs you get in how long you have to grow your family but when you going to menopause earlier you have lower life expectancy than people who go in to menopause later and that is why you've see of earlier festivities this variable kind of reflecting long gravity and health over all what we do know about menopause is that having that low estrogen whether that happens at the average age of menopause at fifty one fifty two or at an earlier time period it is not good for the brain you knohierists of dementia increase risks of asiaparoses increase risk of heart disease and stroke an essentially higher risks of death and that is not even to talk about the impact on your life what it can be to have hot flashes heat and cold in sensitivity to have profound volar and vaginal atrophy to the point that you no longer want to have intercourse and the changes that it can even have on your gut and durian system we as a community of doctors especially obejuiend really recommend person replacement there in women who are going through minors and the key here is to initiate it right at the beginning that big woman's health initiative study which came out for ever ago and showed all this harm with hormone replacement theorize the big issue there was that these people were hypo estergenec for temples years and one group and then started back on the hormones and in that circumstance they already been put into this hirers category and their body had adjusted to not having the hormones and when re expose they had more adverse events but if you are starting on estrogen replacement and it it can be various but honestly the estrogen that we try to replace and this time period much more mimics estradiol we have esteradyle pills if you can have vagal inserts you a patches it depends on what is on to work for your life but it is not the birth control pill most often in some people it might be that is what they choose but we really are trying to pick and enteron that is extra deal where medics that natural structure and you cannot have unopposed

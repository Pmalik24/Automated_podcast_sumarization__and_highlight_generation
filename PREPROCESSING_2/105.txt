boson university investigates the bum extend anti races center a turning general mericarlandheads to the hill where the grope grills and a on president goes to the kente chide america i ventuoner o this is t venchbaro show the shows ponder backxpress be pianist time to stand up against big tact protect our data express vepianticon flesh men already for you remember beam x kendo this my is a genius how do i know that he is a genius he is such a genius the he actually on am a author genius grand in two thousand and twenty one this a six hundred and twenty five thousand no strings attached fellowship honoring his exceptional creativity scholarly achievements give for communicating his anti races work and ideas with diverse audiences and promise for further benefiting society and is boson university that dome that gave him this anti races to grant t that that is super inspiring stuff now for those who have not followed the prodigious career of ibermax kendo the founder of the b center frantic basis research he is the author of a bunch of really not very good books and he speaks nonsense for living the nonsense that he speaks all about ho america is deeply and irrevocably basis he wrote most famously a book led stamp from e beginning the defining of history of racist ideas in america abut how america was literally races in all of its iterations from the varibianning that is up to and including all of the constitutional protections of the bill of rites he also wrote a book led how to be in antifascist and he now has a podcast called b in anti basis what exactly does this genius say about racism well he cannot really define the term he just knows that rases him exist wherever there is a disparity the direct quote from him as an anti races when i see racial disparities icy racism which is unbelievably stupid and you might think that its genius it is really really stupid let me given example how stupid that is the vast majority of the end is black that is a massive racial disparity only thirteen per cent of the america population is black the vast majority of the end players are black does this mean that there has been some sort of deep and abiding racism in the n b a to make all of that happen conversely in hokey virtually all the players are white does that mean there is a deep and abiding races in that exist at the root of khaki and that is why there snothemany black hockey players playing at the an ache level of course not it is incredibly silly if you see for example that ninety nine percent of men in of people imprison for violent crime men less then two per cent are women is that because of some deeply sexist root in society their we are a consent society fifty percent of people going to prison for a violent crime would be women presumably the truth is disparities exists across virtually every industry across virtually every metric in society for all of time the are tie to everything from geography two environment the idea that if two groups by rase do not stack up identically in any particular area this is because of systemic and abiding racism is nonsense it is absolute nonsense in fact is unfalsifiable nonsense because began literally ever y a rent of life is going to include group disparities age disparities height disparities weight disparities these disparities exist literally everywhere but iteramask key's entire proposal which was built up on the back of the bell movement in twenty twenty is that he does not need to prove that racism is actually at the rot of anything all he has to show is o disparity which again is incredibly stupid it makes his jobreally easy because i too can point to disparities in every arena of life but unless i actually prove that that the reason behind the disparity is some sort of evil have not proved anything but bendy because in two thousand twenty we decided as society hat you no longer had to prove that racism was at the route of for example crimestatistics instead you could just simply claim that it was and than everyone who said that it wasn't was deemed to be races this is the magic of enemy can he waved his magic one and suddenly everybody who is not races before was races he says that color blindness is races if you think that race should not matter that is because your races race does matter an thewy we no race matters is because o disparities and those disparities are evidence of racism and if you say will last i ration matter that is because your races do not you see well famously itrmax bendy mac farther genius grant award winner famously german bendy was it asked just couple of years ago about how to define racism here was this geniuses definition race through them are we resident u es e collection o oh race is pelicans re to racial method that is the thin you a rather wait the way that he justified racism is race that races policies that lead to racial inequity you cannot define a term by using the term that is not a possibility you cannot do that am mayor con try but it does not work again just to read you the quotes you understand codon thesis quote i would define it as a collection of races polities that lead to racial inequity that are substantiated by racist ideas the audience by the way watching actually laughed out loud and then he reiterated his definition and he adequate and anti races been pretty simply using the same terms anti racism is a collection of anti races policies leading to racial equity that are substantiated by anti racist ideas now again as i say just texpooc logic you cannot define an term by using the term if soon asks you to defend an elephant and the quickly explain that an elephant is an animal one is an elephant how we not add any no information to the discourse if you said an elephant is an animal that looks exactly an elephant an acts exactly an elephant per will laugh at you because it is ridiculous that is exactly what army bendy is sayings that he does mutually have to to fined the term now remember he was richly rewarded for all of this crap in the middle of the bealeniscam that was happening in two thousand twenty again it was a scam the li that america society rests in unidentifiable but ever present racism is a lie the social that disparities and crimes to six are caused by races to policing it's a lie but that ideal is very prominent was perfectly prom among liberal white folks who felt that they sign imam bendy a check the same way tat they would have back in the nineteeneghtyes to a sharpen then they could give easily alsharpedon with a patina of intellectual legitimacy some sort he would give a dispensation to them you sign thermal bendy a check and now you are an antiracis is magicontiracis works how do you show your an anti races you become an anti races it is not enough to not be races is what bendy says if you say ism not a races i do not think the people should be judged on the base of their race he says that is not enough you mean to be actively anti races and the only to be antiracis is to fight races policies namely any policies that end in some sort of disparity in somehow argalis verity and the best way to fight those policies is to give two ibrmax bendy how magical which presumably is why jackdorsy into those and twenty give kindles new censer for anti races research at boson university ten million dollars the vertices foundation of perfect farmatuticals gave the sent one point five million dollars over three years thank of america brought in bendy to deliver his message and the boson globe teed with bendy censer to greet a new media platform the sender frantiracis research has generated precisely zero a research at this point far as any one it is where why discussing bra bendy today because hilariously after be you set up in entire center in owed to this idiot the after be you set up with the boson globe media enterprise with imam bendy after all of this happen it turns out that boson university is now announcing an inquiry in the ibermax key's anti races center turns out the whole thing is a scam oh no you do not say all that is a shock you mean a person cannot find the word racism those being paid note to find the word racism and then the way that you actually become not races is sad you mean that was a scam you mean just any other cult if the call leader cannot find the terms but the terms involve you having see with the call leader it is call yet that is this that is this thou get to more of this in just once if ibelotic needful about this is because idiocy that is clearly obvious to the human eye ignored and metastasized we will eventually take root and then come back to kill the host and that is precisely what has happen with regard to ibermax key's version of the anti racism ever could see this a scam that was idiocy there's emperor's new closes garbage everyone new this at the time anti rasishom is a collection of entiracis policies the target races disparities back by races ideas but everyone could tell this is gobbled t gook nonsense but well toe pretend not because black lives matter now how protect tor black was beyond anybody no prove it does but in fact precisely the opposite it turns out the best way to alleviate disparities is to actually folks in on human behavior and focusing the behavior the leads to those disparities but

and here is what he posted recently on his social media quote busting university needs to explain how one of it is from for centers ended up in this situation and how mass lay offs a antiracis this act of employment violence and aroma it is not just about individual leaders it is about the culture and systems that allow to occur i love pa man it is anoroberus t to snake eating its own tail here you see index bendy preaches the grift and then when he actually uses the grift to fires on people creating a disparity an outcome this means he is now violating his own anti races recept it turned that firebunch black people at the boson university center for amen key's grift another you fire bunch black people and you now of created i asperity then who is the anti basis and who is the racist beam ex bendy anti racism is not a branding exercise pare campaign or pat to self promotion it is a life doth matter says ship plan too much of higher education responded to the called racial reckoning with theater theropean marketing masturbating his institutional commitment whoever this a cursed it needs to be exposed for exposed for the obscenity it is there is too much at stake those this who believe in real anti rases need to demand more from our colleges and universities are students are watching to those who laboring an institutions to commitment to anti racism its cosmetic and hypocritical i see you i her i am with you sis chili plan he says he has a story to tell during my time at the center i proposed on developed a new fellowship program led designing antiracis t curriculum this was a collaboration wit the center for teaching an learning in the office of diversity and inclusion all professional useless people we successfully launched this new program i decidethad i could no longer work at the center due to the is management i witness i subsequently told i could no longer be part of the leadership of the fellowship by created the excuse for this was that i was leaving the center and would be replace by some one else this was in spite o the fact t i said i was willing to continue serving without a course by out or compensation the excuse made no cense there is already a fact that to member serving on t e leadershiptim we no filiation with the center taking a program from shoeblack faculty member that created it it is apparently what be u considers anti ran seems they fire t a black eye this means that they are the try races to now be has launched a full skill inquiry ins the iberamacts bendy center for anti races research and grift the sentiment comes the week after bendy to laid off more than half of the center staff not twenty per cent fifty per cent ism sorry the complains a but spokes person said focus on the centers culture and grant management practices the inquiry announced whensthey represent a broadening of a previous examination of the center's grant management practice according to the spokes person rather papal covalgerio bendy takes strong exceptions the allegations made in recent complaints and media reports she said since it is announced launch in tune of twenty twenty just days after the murder of forge floidto maneapolists the center has raised tens of millions of dollars from tecontripnors bostonarya corporations and thousands of small donors according to the bossing globe which is one of the institution that sponsor kind the money who went to finance range of ambitious projects a day debates to track racial disparities nation wide a gradual to gree program media enterprising research teams studying the effects of totemic racesmon health and society some of those projects have come to friction including the emancipator a digital publication launched with the busting glob's opinion staff in twenty when once another words the busting globe to its part but nothing else happened with the money there is no racial data tractor that was supposed lea the centerpiece of their research there is in fact no research what exactly is the list of the cents achievements funding for numerous research projects collaboration in a project launch by journalist at the aplanatic magazine they paid the aplanatic to do what the aplanatic does an organizing two policy convening who policy can beings where is the money om it is just kind of gone apparently bendy has complete a umber of personal projects since twenty twenty button recent months he is been on leave from the center the returned last week and in a series of u meetings told the proximately twenty of the centers staffers they would be laid off according to spencer pissing a b professor and leader in the center's policy conference the lanose were initiated by doctor bendy and there is represented a strategic pivot according to b u the censer will now pursue fellowship model rather than its research of based approach there was no research hard have a research based approach win got no research again y all got jammed y all got scammed and that is the message if you cant articulate why it is that somebody should give you money to do a thing all you can do is threaten them the you will call them a racist were a bigot if they do not do the thing this means the you're a colt leader in a scamartist and that is what happened right here with the center for anti races bigotry and this is indeed the greatest scam in modern america the d i scam the woke scam it is a scam woman's by thewy has an actual definition hogans springs from the writings of critical legal theory it springs from the writings of cambrel crenshaw the basic idea is penny's idea than america is rife with institutional racism that that institutional races serves the purposes of whites premise and that any disparity is evidence of that racism that is kind and an nosh and it is a scam because the only way the you can escape this bind the day home created this unfalsifiable e theory racism the your a part of is to give them money and then they waste the money they spend it on themselves there is it any one how many scams have to be uncovered before people realize it to scam how many b ale leaders have to buy themselves houses price colors with the cash before you realize that it is a scam truly it is an amazing amazing thing say every other day one of these scams is exposed for the scam that it is and then people just keep on parting the scam d i is a scam in his been a scam for as long as it has been a major part of america life and i continues to be a scam to day okay in a second open get to the latest on mussels bran and there is really no new informationthat is emerged about resell brand and the allegations against him was that is not stopping people from attempting to remove any livelihood he right have ill gets that momentarily first everybody knows i love my helix matters andhave you checked out their most high and collection the hulks elects hell's has honest years of extensive mattresexsport he's to bring

why would you miss out they are offering twenty per cent off all mattress orders and two free pillows from aliens how over to helix sleep out comslashmen yes cot relics partner twenty it is the best offer yet si can last long with hell's better sleep starts right now can meanwhile on the mussels bran an front i got a say that you we will see what happens of the allegations against resell bran the metropolitan police are soliciting i counts in evidence of the allegations tat are made against rusellbran for the possibility of prosecution of him if the turns out that these can be substantiated i run to find out but that is not stopping people in the brutish government from immediately going after any out revenue that bran could be receiving from any outlets we talk yesterday about the fact that you to has now demonetize t all of mussels bran's videos on you to allegations are tan amount to conviction in the world of view to which is were could hardly be literally has admitted to drugging and robbing men but i see that her videos are earning tons and tons of cash a lager staffer pointed out went out by the way it is a good point and it happens to be in obvious trouble scared well now the brutish government is literally sending letters to rumbles to rumble is a is a video sit that hosts mussels show and the you cape parliament they a committee that sent a letter to the s to of rumble that letter from dame caroling did not in name the chair of the culture media and sport committee wrote it this letter to rumbles and quote i am writing concerning the serious allegations regarding mussels bran and the context of his being contempt to bide r crumble with more than one point for million followers the culture media and sport committee is raising quest on with the broadcasters in production companies who previously employed brand to examine both the culture of the industry the past and weather that culture still prevails today however we are also looking t his use of social media including on rumble where he issued his are emotive response to accusations made against him by the sundae times and channel for at dispatches hell we recognize that rumble is not the creator of the contents we are concerned he may be able to profit from the contents on the platform we ill be grateful if you could confirm weather brand is able to monetizes content including his videos related to serious accusations against him if weave like to know whether rumble intends to join you to bin suspending bransability to earn money on the platform we are also to know what rumble is doing to insure creators are not able to use the platform to undermine the welfare of victims of interpropriate and potentially illegal behavior to got the brutish government basically tacitly threatening rumble with some sort of unspecified consequences for not demonetizing russelbranof government working to push social media platforms to demonetized people on the base of allegations and the brush government has far not yet prosecuted that is a making while cries pavlovsky who the c o of rumble issued response quotoday we receives an extremely disturbing letter from a committee chair in the escape parliament were rumble obviously to lore sexual assault rape in all serious crimes and believe that both legs victims an the accuse ore entitle to a full and serious investigation its venule to not recent allegations against brand have nothing to do with content on rumble's platform we are hard is deeply in appropriate and dangerous that the you can parliament would attempt to control who is allowed to speak on our platform or to earn a living from doing singling out an individual demanding his ban is men more disturbing given the absence of any connection between the allegations and his contents on rumble we are agreed the behavior of many of rumble's creators we refused to penalize them for actions they've nothing to do with our platform i mean that should be patiently obvious to anybody but the fact that the you can parliament is now on legion committees to try to pressure social media companies to remove monetary compensation from mussels brands videos is totally crazy mean that it that is in fact a violation of every freespeech principal if the government i understand was happening here the government has not charged mussels brand with a crime and yet they are now pressuring social media to remove monetary compensation from all of his videos the waiting open letters two places rumble about all this that is wild that is wild stuff m yuan talk about by true tyrannical kind of frets that is ate that is a tyrannical thrift let us assume that you got accused of something not in sort not by the police you are accuse publicly of a thing and the government then went to your employer and tried to get you fired on the base of an allegation that has not yet been substantiated by the police that is scary stuff n that into obviously ending around you process but ow this is the world in which we live and that is ate that is a scary scaryworl ta can one second orang to get to merit garlands being of lawlessness mericarland the attorney general of the united states appeared on the hill yesterday first as you might know we are fans of our friends over at genuses my family'sbeen using genuses for pal debated this plowing ganusall first

younger tomorrow say good bye darken liver spots bags and puffiness under the eyes crowfeet a genu seldom calm slash o chipuro that is genu sell cam slashfprog and you s yellow cam slash chipiro don't git me well republicans had mere garland to the hill at the judiciary committee and did not go amazing for mark garland according to the pastry journal he stress the independence of the d one's criminal case against hunches bison as republicans accused him during a combat of congressional hearing of song leniency toward the son of the president who appointed him who's a six our hearing republicans are camping up their impeachment inquiry into president baton but it is not just targeting hunter and and job that inquiry obviously targets garland as well because garland was presiding over a done that attempted to cut an obvious sweetheartdeo with jobidons son while jobidon's president of the united states an amerigarland is denying having anything do it this he is all it was in me i ism completely independent from job and then avid wise the prosecuterin this case was completely independent from me but here is the magic of being a member of the doge it is very much win henry the third will no one rid me of this troublesome priest with regard to homes jacket you do not have to say anything the president of the united states can basically say ism very say that my son is being dare and mere garland a all you no you have to tell me what to do i know what to do of quash that case and you night on you have to act in order quash that case it'll have to do is not give avid wise special council abilities is will not give it to him now he claims will avid wiseneverasser i wise as have to ask for it your suppose to give it obviously its up to you to give him that you all mere garland had to do in order to effectuate this the sweethartdeo which had to have sign off at the done for shore is nothing that is all he had to do just do nothing do not intervene do not give m special council status to saved wise do not do anything and then magically a sweetheart deal would be cut that is the probe americonsliy i did naturally yet we know we know you naturally have to do any that is the beauty of being the head of the justice to apartment he got grilles yesterday on the hill by a bunch of republicans here our bunch of house republicans peppering garland with questions about under bison mister wise has been belt prosecutor on the under by case this twenty eighteen i here is the question he will leave a prosecutors since here was a appointed by president from ora why o me asking why has the justice doorman drag this investigation out for long as it really ta years to determine if under bison who on a federal form related o perching affirm too wise long time queer prosecutor president trump appointed him as your not answer in the question is that standard preceedur should it take that long to make such a simple determination ism answering the question et me an opportunity do he was charged with that investigation under the previous administration he is continued he knows how to conduct investigations and i have not intruded or attempted to a value a that because t was the promise i made to the senate he is been truly independent is will of fer bit again here is the point he isn't have to do anything it'll as to dues coming office and not give avid wins additional special council abilities now you say divide wises appointed by trunk that is true it is also true that if you are looking for independencefrom me just as partan run by the suspect father then may be when you come in you say o a well yet i understand that the other party was in charge of t justice parminell now ism in charge of the justice apartment and that is on awkward since my boys is the dad of the guy that were looking to prosecute to maybe i should give some semblance of independence to the special prosecutor that's bee the way to go about this representing jump drown one after mericarland as well here he was yesterday duo mister lyses has full authority to bring cases an other jurisdictions if he feels it s necessary that was your response a turn general to senator grassley's question on march first twenty twenty three just reference when mister bishop was questing you only problem is he would purity been turned down by the yous aunty the district of colombia mister graves he did to pull authority did he i had an extended conversation with as to grossly at the time we briefly much time the section five if thing question and how that process went i mix an over mill a gas a quitstral simple mister garland u sit at complete authority but y rarity bid turned down cannot ring inaction in the district of colombia and the yous turn their sad no you cannot and then you got the united sate send it under oath that he has complete authority i to say again that that no one had the authority to turn him down they could refuse i to partner with him that you not ears whenever u you language refused to partner is turning down mean that clearly is true if you refuse to ut in prosecuting a gave that obviously is saying no to them clearly yet again when merigarlan is saying is i interview i no have say was habit if the message goes out that all these other district attorneys all over the country they are better off not partnering with avid wit's in prosecuting these cases than what do you think is going to happen precisely represented tombs mass of kentucky he saying it the same thing when i said how many agents er assets of the government were present on jaguar if tan canary six and agitating in the crowd to go into the capital on how many went into the capital can you answer that now i do not know the answer f that question o last time you do not know how manyithere were or there were none i know the answer to either of those questions if there were an y i do not know how many you don't know whether there are any i think you may have just perjured yourself that you don't know that there were any you want to say that again dit you do not know that there were any o personal knowledge of this matter i think what i said the last time you have had two years to hid out and at day by way that was in reference to rays and yesterday you indited him ya don't again that is about canary six thewhole point is the mericarland as always the the accuser is often the person who is doing the thing and that is particular torn comes to the geojank for years all we heard is that bill bar was somehow a a tool of donate trump doing all the biting of don trouble is weary bees bulbar was a direct do donate trump over for example canary six an all the election stuff that trump was doing between the election and canary sect to the point that trumpasering to fire him bar threaten to walk and all the rest of the sort of stuff meanwhile road ericholder who is the attorney general under baroccamama openly saying his baroccumon his hangman you had the rede lynch on the tarmac with with the cantons and and meanwhile you have now merigarland doing the exact bidding of jobidon i war supposed to believe that its completely a political garland did testify that he i he wouldn't even say if he had discussed the hunter brain probe with avid wise here he was this very learn answer is represent make johns losing grilling him can you tell us about any brief inter discussions that you personally have had with mister rock wise regarding any an all federal investigations of hnterbud i men say again i promise the senate that i would not interfere with mister wiser you have not o iodous undercoat to that your testimony is you have not had any discussions with mister wise about this matter under oath my testimony to day is that i promise t then the senate i would not i intruded in hims investigation i do not intend to discuss the liber internal justice department a liberation whether or not i had them oh of case for you your testimonytoday is you aren't on to tell us whether you had discussions with mister wise i testimony to day is i told the committee that i would not interfere i made clerk that mister was would have theory to bring cases that he thought were appropriate limit o get but you will not asked in sir any specific question is about the exact content of conversations with avid wise which is which is weird and the garland was was asked well did did you talk to anybody that t hunter probes a got ton member i i do not think this the true do you think that is true that he don't remember if he had any conversations with anybody about the hunterbrob have you had personal contact with any one tat pa headquarters about the under by investigation ah not real i do not i do not recollect the answer o that question but the f b i works for the justice department if som sorry amber an you do not recollect you do not recollect whether you talked with anybody at pig headquarters about an investigation of the president's son i i do not believe that i did o was are sure again mericarlan one of the most obvious my corrupt buricrats in washington d c and ha thanksmistmicanal for not putting that my on the supreme court of the united states also mericarland was rigged t over the coals about the do was bizarre decisions over the course of his tenor including multiple alibi field offices coordinating to prepare in anti catholic ammo that happened you call back in august when house judiciary committed chairman him jordan an some committee on the construction limited government chant a chairman mi johns sent a letter tabbed rest or cries ray reviewing of the a yanrichman field offs coordinate with multiblaffby offices across the country to produce a memo turning traditional catholic as potential terrace well mericarlan as asked about this and he denied that there is any religious discrimination at the d o ja which om sure through the chair i ask you do you agree that traditional catholic or vile extremists it have no idea what your what the traditional a means here i we leno to tan oi urge may i answer quit gaiohea that some one with my family backdrop wit de criminate against to any religion is outrageous is absurd tour turning general in i i er f we i that did this it was your f be i that was sending and we have the memos we have the meals we sending under cover agents into catholic churches may now what mericarlands referring to there is the far that is of jewfish backgrounds the idea that that you would never ever engaged in religiouscrimination is crazy well that really is not the question is his religious background tit is question of perception if you believe his why he he is why he hesitated when he said wonder traditional catholicswhere we talking about here because the reality is that it is very easy to believe that you are the good guy and that you are not engaged in a form of discrimination even if your afbiifield offices are engaging indiscrimination against for example traditional catholic es just say be they are not actually traditional catholic are they really traditional how re dividing traditionallere indwell the democrats came out in full skill defense of at medical garland of course jerry nobler n particular one after him jordan suggesting that ta everything that him jordan is saying that mericarland has already ben refuted which his feared cause little blowers accusations that the independence that a sought by divide wise was not granted by mericarland that has not ben refused in any serious way at the absently make to comments one just bet ever asserting you made in your on statement has been completely refuted by witness is to testified before this commit two far from being favored many commentators a noted that people accused the simple gun position while under the influence of it jug that we on was not used in the commission of a crime a rarely if ever prosecuted the hunter bison is being cross a hundrebidon is being persecuted you see according to democrats and mericarland yet there bunch of administration officials who really should be on the table for impeachment probably before jobidon e is the idea of impeaching jobidon is based on some sort of connection of dot that supposedly has yet to take place it is not too hard to connect the dots with regard to merit garland malfeasance we have whistle blowers testifying to it or with regard to for example ohondro matrices not doing anything remotely his job at department of home land security can one second we are going

and police custody in iron for not wearing hear correctly he was then ejected was the israel ambassadors the rule is that you are allowed to be a terrorsdictator but if you hold up a picture of a

herd that the media coverage of the number of protestors wo are protesting the cranial dictator being in being in the united states and an jstspeaking nonsense and and garbage that was dwarf the media coverage of that by the coverage of a few hoiden protestors in the united states o our very artist benjraminiton now who is also visiting the united states and is having a sitar with jobidon at this point just again the can continues to be not only a useless but a counter productive organization o a meanwhile speaking of useless and counter rector organizations youwould imagine the the in this international organs actions these would be the places where negotiations would happen over for example nugorno carjack this is a very little notice and little watch region of the world except by people or sort of in the no it is a hot spot there certain hotspot in the world cashmere hot spot say the gossip strip is a hot spot a e is of jane same or hotspot angora carjack is i is a hot spot the reason is a hotspot is because it is largely ethnically armenia b ah it is controlled by aver bacon and for years and years and years there has been in armenia separatist attempt to take begorra carjack from the rule of aver bacon where now aozerbshani forces have assaulted the area the apparently reports suggest that there re lot of civilian deaths the ozbrchani forces suggesting their telling people to get out in advance of their advance but apparently according to the waltz journal armenia separate is inigornal carbon agreed on weekday to disarm and discuss re integration with afar began following a swipe but dedlyassault by ozerbacni forces at capitulation signaling the end of decades of ethnic armenia rule in the conclave and the rapid decline of russia influence in the former soviet union territories it is very complicated situation because both on and russia are supporters of the separates in begorra kurbash meanwhile turkey an israel are supporters of the ozerbajhany forces the terms of the sense fire lay groundwork that could bring to a closed the autonomous rule by the population of begorra kurbash which was one o from bake in a bloody years long war after the fall of the soviet empire fighting appeared to continual pass of the only ours after the signing of the sense fire the speed of which the armenia separates agree to abandoned the arm struggle underscore mascots waning power over events in the region as its forces are stretched anuran has been a frozen conflict and of the drumlin has used this as e lever to maintain over both armenia and over bacon according tote water journal over the years mascot sent both weapons and peacekeepers to the region while using diplomacy's retain its position is the ultimate arbiter over go politics there is obviously is another piece of evidence that that russia is weakening internationally which is generally a good thing rushes bit of very powerful and aggressive for in the world obviously particularly along its old soviet borders according to homes totally expert on i gonna carbon and tenor fella carney rope rascals coverage as much weakened by whats happening in crane we see the armenia moving away from russia afar bacon having relationship it russia that is more on its own terms agora karma set t whist twenty four civilians and soldiers in the day on conflict that began on tuesday with artillery assaults on what over bacon sad armenia military targets in the breakaway region locals posing on social media reported strikes on residential neighborhoods in the territories maincity of stepanikart russia defense ministries had peacekeepers had come under fire and died during the violent that in specify how many were killed ozerbachans has a plans to take back the conclave it is inside the borzvozer brusshon its populated almost entirely by ethnic armenia who have ruled since the nineteen nieces under the terms of a special poker by russia skirmishes a rusted into conflict in tweeting twenty when ozerbacan re claim areas around the territory that battle ended guaranteeing armenia separates control over that particular area apiece has remain shake armenia leaders complained russia was not able to enforce the do s again a complicated conflict in which the men has been entirely absent the russia and u allseed they had made last efforts to to swayed ozerbchani president ham an alias from attacking the territory anyone karma hasrelight almost solely on armenia for links to the outside world sectaricstad anime blinking called the leaders of ozerbachan armenia to express is concern over the escalation again what one the things that is amazing about these s orts of conflicts that nobody notices them until they break into violence in after that five minutes later nobody notices otherwise this why when comes to america form policy the ountifocus that actually is placed on america form policy around the world is actually fairly low by america account of burst into the national consciousness for a hot second and then it is just gone and meanwhile the feds continued to debate the interest rates because our economy continues to stagnate according it to the waster journal federal officials are set to hold interstate steady at their meeting on wednesday while debating what we take for them to lift o borrowing close again this year there anticipated decision men mark the second time in six policy meetings this year the get has not raised rates the r the fed signal that will hold rate saidingan make no substantive changes to its postmeeting policy statement that does not mean that inflation has actually been solved i because again inflation in the united states remains almost double what we are supposed to be looking for right now get projections suggest that manufedofficial see rising neutral rate which keeps in elation and unemployment stable in the long run it just means that as hardy baked into the cake according to the waste journal federal reserve official surprise marks by signalling that interstates will not fall as much as previously plan that week might be more important than it looks in their projections an common tries some officials hint that rakes might be higher not just for for longer but for ever it is a for a very long time in the united state you get a mortgage three four per cent that is not going to be the case for a long time to come and that is because of the inflation t has ben baked into the cake by the loose monitorial physical policy of the united states over the course of years one of the provenshere and one things that creates in elation is lack of labor at productivity one things that brings down prices additional labor ate productivity as grew uprights for the waster journal for the united auto workers makes perfect sens n man mare pay and better work balance from detritus three automakers after all workers throughout this historically tight labor market are getting exactly that but what make sens the striking factory workers makes no sens for manufacturing as a whole pays ultimately tie o productivity the quantity and quality of products a company's work force turns out and here america manufacturing companies in workers are in trouble the she is not with labor an tensive products clothing in furniture which off short a long time ago it is in the most advance products electric cars and batteries powrgeneration equipment commercial air craft semen conductors america companies still lead the world in design in novation but the resulting products and creasinagly are made abroad especially in aria hoiden lihetonal from plonks reverse that through tar of subtitles norther government interventions but the problem is is really not about that it is that avion manufacturers have basically decrease cost increase quality and america counter parts have slipped whenyou look at manufacturing productivity growth from two thousand nineteen two doesn't twenty to ti wan is had a productivity growth annual average four per cent the cate one point seven per and germany one point for per cent the us zero point two per cent in motor vesical manufacturing t the pictures e special bad from twenty twelve through last year productivity plummeted thirty two per cent that not the fault of america workers as greggot points out productivity to pends on bunch of factors including management decisions supply can public in for structure regulation for damp america manufactures use far fou up robots then their competitors but it does not matter if you are not bringing up the productivity that means that you are not going to be competitive on the world markets and the you a double you is striking for temporary gains in the face of what are going to be significant future losses right now the attempt to transition to electric vehicles by the big three that is a very risky move considering that ford is set to apparently lose pourpoint five billion dollars on electric vehicles this year the is not a good number boring boring ill for the future of this you a u strike hell get to more on all that in just one can first in a time where different opinions are pretty much everywhere it is vital to be able to find facts that you can rely upon this where you s a facts steps in it is a not for profit non partisans to the condition give committed

and factual discussions make your voice heard and back by truth with you us a facts dot or that you s a facts dot or to day well despite the fact that the america car industries about facing very hard times to do specifically to all these regulations an restrictions put on them by the by administration their push of for electric vehicles for example the you a be u continues ford with its strike and democrats are signaling their support we begun again the most corrupt bargain an america politics is union support for democrats the way the this works not by the way not all unions are bad they're unions that do good an go back to the coal miners unis there plenty of unions that do good the point is the are notes to see cap workers as long as a union is just a voluntary association of men negotiating for pay men women obviously negotiating for pay no problem it is when yous our see caring people or relying on the federal government to crammed down solutions the you're now engaged in corporatism which is a a form of financial fascism economic fascism o the democratic party knows this it is no wonder whenever people hung by money an politics theyalleas neglect union money politics because that might implicate democrats what is amazing is how the unions are now holding the democrats to the wall back in september early september jobidon said he thought that you a be strike was unlikely now of course were in the middle of the end of week one of this thing when at by fan an bat the i whether in away a i good happen an et what then killing time when the contract on been ate otto work each fire thin in that e do not think thou is the me not word about a strike until it happens i do not thing it is going to happen it's always going is incredible at this of course unions are holding hin to the wall why not they know that they they own him meanwhile the governor of pennsylvania joshipero he is saying also that he stands with the you a able you because why not if you are democrat what cost does it have to you to stand with the union even if it ens bankrupting the karndistry couple yours in the future us blame capitalism after you regulate those car companies in to the ground then can down crappy union deals on them when the companies go under well that is when you blame capitalism obviously here is joshipero arena thunders though that is the now i the bosses are going to benefit from this better technoligat tho worker she cur they should haven't war time with their families war time at home what do you think we i stand with the striking u a w workers a ten deserve the share in these record profits that the executive sir taking home i think what we have seen is just a a a greater gap between what the executives are making in companies and what the workers who are putting the the product in the services a on the field are earning we ain't a shrink that gap then i stand with the u a w striking workers of course the democrats are all in hock meanwhile they are hoping to cram down all the regulations that a to make these car companies go bankrupt it is it is one of the things that irritating by watching politics is very often it is government interventionism that skews the incentive structure for all these major companies crams down bad contract on them then when the companies go bankrupt they blame capitalism for the failure and then they bail out the companies blaming capitalism all the balancing but what really need here is more government regulation this the story the two seven that the two thousand seventy thousand eight economic crash the government created in sense structures in which it was very obvious to everybody that all o these companies wringing gat bailed out ans they took all sorts of crazy risks the risks went south the government bed them out them blame capitalism for that it's not capitalism that is corporatism pretty obviously but again the same time that they are now pressuring the car companies to capitulate to the u a la carbon is closure rules or coming for u s a companies according to the waste vernal many ambiguous companies shebeen fighting in washington to block rules requiring them to disclose a greenhouse gacimissions they picked the wrong fight with californium and the u our boys to approve rules that require companies that do business to disclose their missions the rules would apply to private as well as public companies and require business to calculate and disclose emissions from their suppliers an their customers which goes beyond what was expected out of washington this means that pretty much every major company in america is now going to be expected to disclose their carbon missions which is going the some predictable down strike economic a fact things are going incredibly incredibly wall cat time for some things i and then some things that i hate things at that i today pennsylvania students have decided that they are not going to go along with new transbathrom policies suggesting that boys can simply go into girls bathers and they stage walk out the other day to protest these bathers policies heres what a look according to the her cost hundreds of students from pennsylvanians prosimians valleys school district walked out a class on fridge after the local schoolyard failed to enact police e requiring transgender students to use the restroom corresponding with their biological see above the description there i mean you mean that that they they did not pass a police protecting girls kids were up sat girls who wanted to protect him they were used that want men in the bathroom said john out who organized the walk out his mother stefphany accused the district of only protecting trains a students not looking at the whole picture proposed poly seven twenty came after local father t on dagger postsenohn social media tat his daughter was left to two upset and emotionally disturbed to walk in the school bathrooms after a legally having encounter with a trains a students in one of the facilities the gutless report however said neither the father northerdaughter r one hundred per sent sure that the student dagger saunter encountered in the restaurum was a biological mail why mean here is the thing if you have rules than he can insure that that does not happen that is not really a problem but it is som it is incredible me that this is even a controversy good for the students fort walking out a time fry quitting that i hate a john fedderman hates pans on why ism confused why he hates pans but apparently he really really hates pan much that the senate of the united states in order to apparently concede to this brain damaged person and i say that with again that is on the insult is to reality this person had a massive stroke this apparently means that dome john fedderman must be allowed to preside over the senate my seven year old son going to going to camp or something i dow that is of the senate of the united states its all the staffer till hae to pursuits john fedderman however he literally presided over the senate wearing him shorts and a short sleeve button down shirt looking as though he just emerged from a homeless shelter according to the daily wire the senator from pennsylvania took his turn sitting as the presiding officer while some of his jig pe colleges including sent of john thorn and ran pollen john corn's liver remarks on the senate floor he said the worlds in seen off s ax as he know just it it i think we will still go on this is what we deserve what we deserve is a is a country of of absolute fools wearing garbage clothing on to the floor of he united state senate mean honestly why not i at is one why not our standers for politicians are unbelievably low that we will elect the brain damage to high office why should not they be able to dress as though they we tending a free school as supposed to the senate of the united states strucsumer send it statement to action senators are able to choose what they were on the sentefloor i will continued to wear a suit i am declaring that all republicans and honer of john federal should car lawman shirt day at the a senate a sounds were a the ugliest in shirt the could possibly fine along with cargo shorts as well as sox with sandals that is what everyone should wear in the why not howsrom flip flops that your flip flops son glass is sudan columns by the way is threatening to wear taken that is his joke by her by the way smash is not going to do that but why not i mean after all if john federal can wear whatever he wants because we have to make sure that we concede to the to the not qualified senator from from pennsylvania why why not at this point i suppose that it make some sense the goodness i guess that the mask is off if the united states senate is going to be a joke i suppose the we can get rid of all the rules pretending that it is not a joke carditises the rest of the shoe continues right now you are

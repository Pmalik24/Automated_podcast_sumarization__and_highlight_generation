welcome to the superman ladponcas ts a science science pace to i major superman and of a professor of neurobiology and the myology at stamford school of medicine to day is an ask me anything or a m a episode which is part of our premium subscriber content our premium channel was launched in order to raise support for the standard superman labpodcast channel which still comes out once a week every money and of course is zero cost o consumer the premium channel is also design to support exciting research being done at major universities stamford and elsewhere research that done on humans that should lead to protocols for mental health physical health and performance in the near future if you would to check out the premium channel subscription model you can go to superman labor calm slash premium and there you can subscribe for ten dollars a month or a hundred dollars year we also have a lifetime subscriber option for those of you that are already superman labpodcast premium subscribers and your watching and or hearing this please go to superman labor calm slash premium and download the premium podcast feed and for those of you that are not already superman lab premium podcast subscribers you will be able to hear the first fifteen minutes or of this episode and hopefully that will allow due to discern whether not you would to become a premium subscriber without further ado let us get to answering your questions and as always i will strive to be as accurate as possible as thorough as possible and yet as concise as possible our first question is about motivation in particular how to maintain motivation over long periods of time this was a question asked by martin to cop he wrote i alternate between periods of two different states that vary from a few weeks to a couple of months i have extremely high motivation in one state where i can do multiple things side projects making music as well as my main things or really low motivational states where i can barely do anything and i only look for short term entertainment am guessing short term entertainment comes in the form of video game social media at is and of doing generally unproductive things as we all do from time to time he goes on to wrist what would be the best set of protocols to normalize those extremes into a more stable and consistent state when first off this is an excellent question i say that because it is a question that i hear a lot and i think that many people ore interested in knowing how motivated they ought to feel and i think a lot of people also feel lot less motivated than they would ow here the question was specifically about how to not go from these extremes of days or weeks of high motivation to days or weeks of low motivation but before we do that we need to take a step back in acknowledge that just as with anxiety or happiness or sadness we is human beings do not have an objective window into how other people experience motivation in fact most the time we do not even realize how we experience motivation we just know whether not we feel a high barrier or a low barrier to leaning into work in getting things done in fact have a good friend who did many years in the special operations community and then went on to the finance community and then now works in health and wellness community is a great an a mental image for all of us to adopt is certainly one that have adopted which is for anything in our life we can either be back on our heels flatfooted or forward center of mass back in our heels meaning really struggling flatfoot an meaning then we are doing one or forward center of mass being that we we feel as if were really tackling things and that we are in control of our environment or at least to some degree in so i place that imagery in your mind because all return to it limit later in the question when we get into some of the underlying circuitry in tools in the meantime want to remind everybody what the basis of motivation is there are many narrow chemicals in curl circuits involved in what we call motivation but decennial theme of the nauru science of motivation is that the neuromodulateor dopamine is involved a dopamine does other things besides control motivation of acting controls light adaptation in the retina a that is your eye it controls a number of different things in terms of movement it controls all sorts of things but it is strongly related to the motivation pathways how do we know that well there experiments on animals in humans which show that even in the absence of dopamine or in the presence a very low dopamine i should say people and animals can still experience pleasure however when dopamine levels are too low peoples a ability to pursue pleasure or their willingness to pursue pleasure in particular their willingness to undergo effort to pursue pleasure or any goal of any kind not just pleasure any goal of any kind is strongly regulated by the levels of dopamine dopamine levels are too low people simply will not put in the effort to obtain or reach a goal if dopamine levels are adequately high they will put in that effort and if dopamine levels go too high you actually see something that is pathologic which is that people consider every goal a reasonable goal this is often seen in the manic phase of a manic by polar person for instance somebody with manic by polar whose in the manic episode dopamine levels are very very high and they will think every ideas a great idea and they'll have tons of energy to do that much that they are not sleeping obviously that is not what we want what we want in what the question asker martin is asking about is how to keep dopamine levels in a range that allow us to lean into effort but that we do not expend our ability to stay motivated and we can really trace that back to a big chemical slash curl circuit statement which is we really want to control our output of dopamine and the base line levels of dopamine from which that output is taken in other words we want to think about dopamine as a reservoir or residing in a reservoir that reservoir can be depleted it is exhaustible it is delectable but it is renewable soul and one of the best analogies that have ever heard was by a previous guessed on the human labpodcast doctor file select this a medical doctor obesity specialists expert in hormones we did a episode on optimizing hormones and male with doctor calgelett you can find that at superman lapdog come or anywhere you can find podcast doctor delete offered an analogy of the baseline levels of dopamine as a wavepool and i really this you think about this pool full of dopamine and here we are just talking about the dopamine that resides in the circuits of the brain that control motivation but that pool of dopamine you can imagine is just sitting there not doing much of anything while you are a sleep in fact while you are sleeping your replenishing those dopamine levels it'll ell you another tool in a moment to replenish those dopamine levels but if you were to purse of goal really really go forward center of mass for many many hours are many many days in some cases and pursue goal are multiple goals andyou really driven to do a ton what your effectively doing is generating waves in that wavepool and if those waves are too big well then the waves cannot keep repeating themselves think of thou the wave is the motivation and the depth of the pool is the reservoir of dopamine and if those waves are too big too much excitement too much motivation too much center of mass for a given period of time then the water in this wave will sloshes out of the wave pool lowering in the reservoir and then there really three was that you can replenish that reservoir and you want o maintain or replenish that reservoir if it is been depleted how do you do that well first of all quality sleep when i say quality i mean where you are getting enough slowly sleep in rap and i movement sleep for some people six hours for some people eight hours on people might even need a lo bit more obit less we have episodes the protect your sleep episode the master sleep episode we have a too kip for sleep all available as your cost to turn labor come links et camera to check those out for getting your see right but sleep is really when you replenish that reservoir of dopamine you can not ignore sleep it'll come back to this in a moment the second science supported tool that is really been shown to replenish dopamine in particular dopamine within the pathways that regulate motivation is a practice have talked about before on the podcast called non sleep deep rest sometimes called yeoganedra although yeoganedra is a little bit different there too studies out of denmark that have explored yeogenedra in the context of dopamine the first one simply involved having people do a yeogenedropactice again this does not involve any movement but involves people potentially you doing anywhere from thirty to sixty minutes although there are now data showing that is short as ten minutes of a non sleep deep least a c yeogenedroprotocall leads to dramatic really dramatic increases in stryetald dopamine reserves it essentially is replenishing the dopamine reservepool this is why it's such a fan of using enestyar a k yoganedra at least one to day and a s es under times when you're engaging in a lot of high output and when i think especially at times when your engaging a lot of high output this is a mistake many people make they pushups pushups push there in pursuit of a goal then they hit that point where they are exhausted then they star doing all the dopamine reserve pool replenishing tools such as yoganedrar n star the real key is to always tap off that or refill that reservoir once a day before it is completely depleted now this gets into some of the bile chemistry of dopamine and the relevant circuits but it takes a lot longer to restore the dopamine reservoir think of it still as a wavepool but that reservoir from a place of complete depletion then it does of partial depletion there is ana cemetery in the way this is done it is not as if you drink a glass water you fill the glass water a certain rate and it fills up to a certain level and the rats constant think about it as once the level of dopamine in your reserve is pleaded past a certain point it takes a lot more effort much more sleep much more star things of that sort to replenish that reservoir now oftentimes what people will do when they start feeling less motivation is they will start relying on things thrall riddling some cases illegal substances that a can increased dopamine you know what those a please do not a ever lean to those they are extremely a dangerous they really a because of there ability to potently released dopamine and guess what to plate that reservoir even further we have talked about some supplements on the podcast that can replenish dopamine all pyridine and particular a mcunopurins is acting ninety nine percent a dopa the precursor to dopamine i do not necessarily recommend a mcunopurians it tends to make people a very doorman unit dridridridrivd motivated and then crash again depending that pool i elltirsinselobit milder but i really encourage people to lean first on the behavioral tools such as an ester by the way there's a nectar script totallesro costs that you can find by a putting my name and nesting into you to a that one a works quite well if you are looking for a short an star a there is some other enestiars you can simply look on the internet a or you turban just put n star animal fine n star or if you prefer to do the more classic yeoganedor type approach they're a lot of different yoganedr options to choose from on you to many people think nesting or yoganedr are simply meditation with a body scan that is not true meditation is a focus exercise an most meditations are focus exercise nesting restores energy through the dopamine system and newer date our string to show that can actually recover lost sleeps if you are not sleeping enough but to return to n star a k yeoganeger as a practice yes it is been shown in laboratory studies inhuman by the way to restore dopamine levels there is another study less er known from t that same group that was publishing two thousand eleven which is entitled dopamine uric stimulation enhances confidence and accuracy in seeing rapidly presented words this was a connive task they explored yoganedra a k and testy are in the contexts of increasing trial dooming they already knew that it did that that is great they confirm that result but what they also found is that doing and star could restore confidence in cognitive ability and performance in these cognate tasks et this is a really powerful zero cost tool for re upping or replenishing that dopamine reserve ye this is something to do every day especially when you are not feeling to pleaded the question again was about how to make sure that you do not go through these cycles of extreme motivation and then lesser motivation well get your sleepright i would say eighty per cent or more of the nights of your life hopefully the nights that it's not good for good reasons that you are enjoying yourself but a life happens you know under per cent of the time is just not reasonable to expect of yourself do an sty are once a day for either ten minutes if you have the time to do twenty thirty minutes or an hour you will see even more positive effects it has been shown in these research studies to replenish dopamine levels of confidence cognivability et camera and sense of motivation and i said there were three tools and the third tool that really can allow you to keep the dopamine a k motivation circuitry toned up properly is to really start paying attention to piss in dopamine and be very careful about layering in too many things that can stimulate the dopamine system i talked about this quite a bit in the episode tat we did on eighty hey and building and maintaining focus there are many things out there nowadays that we will deplete the dopamine system for instance and by the way none of what ism about to list is necessarily bad i actually use some of these things for instance affine will increase dopamine receptors that will low whatever dopamine is available to be more potent o faso caffeine's great for some people less good for people with anxiety do not do git to lateen the day all interfere with your sleep and on and forth but many people will combine affine with music that they particular music scrape music can stimulate dopamine release we know this it can unhandsome motivation especially of its kind of music that really puts you in the group for the particular type of work you are going to do for me i to listen to either loudest music or glengould classical piano one or the other i know what is right for me for a given time you will know what is right for you for given time in your preferences but what will happen as people will start consuming affine at higher and higher levels again affine is not nearly bad but they will tart doing that and they will start layered in or stacking very potent music potent for them plus things all tyrosine again none of these things are terrible on their own fact they can be very beneficial sometimes they will start taking macho purine sometimes they'll start relying on things after all riddling and pretty soon what is happening is there getting these big waves in that dopamine wave will big peaks and within a few days or maybe even within a few hours they are tepleeated and there at that lo and then as doctor onolempki who as a guest on the podcast talked about in terms of a diction but also in her wonderful but dopamine nation what a happens is after those big peaks in dopamine the reservoir the base line in dopamine drops below it is initial level it is as if the reservoir got deeper and it is emptier and it takes much much longer to fill so to be quite specific what ism recommending is get your sleep right i really every night to your life but for as many nights of your life as possible that is clearly replenishing dopamine and sense of motivation do all the things associate with that morning sunlight lack of artificial light at certain hours of the night et camera all of that is in the twill get for sleep another episodes i mention before have a practice that is research supported to replenish dopamine and incorporate that practice any time of day again and as tear can be done morning afternoon or evening or middle the night if you wake up an you need to get back to sleep it can be very beneficial for that but do it as a consistent practice that dopamine reservoir remains tapped off and as a third point please be weary of or at least aware of these peaks and dopamine an the fact that laying in a lot of things that stimulate dopamine while that can be wonderful for your wedding a birth of a new child going to a sports event with a bunch of friend celebrating a big anniversary yes please do celebrate and enjoy the wonderful events of life but please also understand and expect there will be a lull a sort of postpartum lo may be not full blown depression that follows that unless you incorporate some tools and practices to replenish that dopamine does that mean you should never combine final tyrosine music and a work out in time with friends no absolutely not but do not expect to do that and then go down intense bout of work and then get up the next morning and do it all over again for more than a few days before you find yourself pretty to pleaded o was rather than give you a specific schedule of you do not do seven days of this and for days of this what i encourage you to do is for at least five days a week maybe give yourself some time off on the weekend may be not but it for at least five days a week get into a consistent routine that is i should say nurobiologically consistent as well with how the dopamine each a circuits the control motivation work and i assure you that you will find yourself in a more regular groove of focus and attention and alertness and motivation when you need to and provided you're doing all the things i described and hopefully pain attention other things nutrition and social connection too of course you will find a much more even pattern of motivation over time one last thing before i conclude the answer to this question when i was in graduate school i got some wonderful advice from in excellent neurologists is me as robot night he is to be at universe calfornia barely i think he is retired now but am is still active in the scientific community and i asked him ah what he was doing that we can i do not know why this came up and s ism going fishing i kind of young mindless recreation unto it is great young fishing's fond not particularly a in to fishing myself but have done a few times an i enjoy it and he said the most important thing for a science or medicine career or any demanding career i said what i hos all years a superior know superlunary to to get in the moon you have do re search in published papers and he said figure out how many hours a day you can do real work consistently that means five days a week for some people six or seven but five days a week i think for most people is gin to be of it healthier over all for your social life and family et camera and he said figure that out and know that that number is what you should apply over and over and over again but up date that number about every for or five years and i said o use does that mean that over time ism working more and more or less and less and he said ah here is the deal as you get better at your profession you will find that you can do more potent work more directed work in a shorter amount of time but that does not mean that you can continue to expand the amount of time that you are going focus work in fact the opposite this follows a sort of general principle that is also present in resistance training the wait lifting right ism the analogy there is that people always imagine that as you get better and better at resistance train the you should do more and more volume just keep acting volume and other some evidence to support that more volume for hypertrophy as pose less et camera we have done episodes on this however there is a different school of thought that works exceedingly well and it runs in the exact opposite direction which is as you get better at controlling muscular contractions or let say for an an endurance sport as you get better at regulating your stride and breathing an all those things you actually can do more quote and quote adaptation stimulating damage during a given training session you want a train less not more over time because beginners do not actually have the ability to get much done in a lot of time or a short period of time we are as experts can come in there and really nail it i think it'd advice that robot night was really key and it something that's followedthroughout my career it one period of my life i will not mention the hours that i worked in graduate school they were pretty insane to be honest it'd family members get a loll concern actually lived in the laboratory even as a junior professor i do not suggest people do that by the way but i enjoyed it at the time and the key thing is that you figure out what you can do consistently and still maintain mental health and physical health that is key as well and do that and then every couple of years are update that typically by reducing the total amount of time that you are doing that high potent see work i think that combined with the other tools that i describe before for generating on going topemanurgic circuits keeping that reservoir full ought to give you consistent motivation again it is in art and a practice and a science do not expect to get at perfect the first time around but i wish you all luck and ism certain that these tools work thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode n and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the superman labpodcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to superman ladotcom slash premium just to remind you why we launch the superman labpodcast premium channel truly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard superman labpodcast channel which of course will still be continued to be released every money in full length we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard superman labpodcast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which thing we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is time toward developing further protocols for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all channels humeral labpodcast and other medium channels the idea here is to give you information o your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that whose kinds of answers in the first place now in especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that they're going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the humeral lab premium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the a m as you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well there will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the a m as and various transcripts and protocols of superman labpodcast episodes newfound elsewhere and again you will be supporting research for mental health physical health an performance you can sign up for the premium channel by going to superman labor come slash premium again that superman labdotcom slash premium and as always thank you for your interest in son

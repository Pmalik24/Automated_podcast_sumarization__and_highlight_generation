welcome to the superman falconer discus science science space to i mandruhuberman and on a professor of neurobiology and althomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing alcohol one of the most commonly consume substances on the planet earth should mention that both humans and non human animals consume alcohol either for recreational purposes because they the feeling that it gives them or for traditional purposes or for other purposes that will discuss we are of course going to discuss the effects of alcohol on our biology ranging from its effects on individual cells on organs and organ systems in our brain and body we are also going to discuss the effects of the effects of alcohol that is what being inebriated really does to our thinking in our behavior in how it does it and we are going to address what seems to be one of the more common questions out there which is whether or not low to moderate amounts of drinking are better for our health than zero alcohol consumption at all and of course we will talk about severe alcohol in take binge drinking we will all stock not hang over and what science says of ut ways to reduce the effects of hang over either by doing things that are inoculator meaning before you drink or while you drink as well as things to you if you happen to have a hang over we will discuss some of the genetic differences for alcohol and alcoholism and we will discuss alcohol consumption in young people and how that can be especially detrimental for reasons that i think are gong to be quite surprising to most of you my got is that by the end of to day's episode you will have a thorough understanding of what alcohol does to your brain anybody and that you will be able to make inform decisions as to whether or not you should be consuming zero absolutely no alcohol small to moderate amounts of all again will define exactly what that means small to moderate amounts and if you or somebody else that is consuming excessive of ants of alcohol that are clearly detrimental to you health some of the better routes and resources that you can use in order to remove that dependence and or consumption i to preface all of that by saying that to day's discussion is really geared toward giving you information it is not about judging alcohol intake or also alcoholic take i just want you to be able to make the most inform decision about alcohol possible before we get into day's content in detail i just want to answer a commonly ask question of at alcohol consumption and the brain and the question that often comes up is whether or not low to moderate amounts of alcohol may be one drink a day or one or two drinks to day kind of thing whether or not that is bad for your brain in particular whether not it causes degeneration of neurons or nerve cells now the reason that question comes up often is because for many years it is been known that high levels of alcohol consumption twelve to twenty for drinks per week or more is certainly causing her or degeneration in particular of the call no quarters the outer layers of the brain that hows associative memories that hows our ability to think in plan that hows our ability to regulate our more primitive drives according to contact et camera to make very clear drinking a lot having three or four drinks per night every night of the week is clearly bad for the brain a recent study however finally address the question of whether not low to moderate amounts of aldol consumption can cause brain degeneration the title of the study is as locations between alcohol consumption and gray and white miter volumes in the up biobank the unite kingdom soak torso a gray matter are the neurons is the called sell bodies that wit hows the german the cells at camera and white matter is the connections the fibers the called axons of neurons and it it is called white matter because that a that tissue is surrounded by a fatty tissue call man which allows nerve sells to communicate with each other very quickly what this study did is it looked at the brains both the gray matter and the white matter of more than thirty thousand any more than thirty five thousand generally healthy middle aged and older adults in the unite kingdom who were drinking serious amounts of alcohol what they found was that even for people that were drinking low to moderate amounts of alcohol one or two drinks per day there was evidence of thinning of the no quarter loss of neurons and neoquartecs and other brain regions and i do not say this in order to cause alarm i tell you this because they are important data because they reveal and indeed answer the question that has been burning for long aweather or not chronic alcohol in take can disrupt the brain even if the chronic in take is very low now we should talk about what the word chronic means because many people when they hear the word chronic think high levels of whatever in take kid they think five drinks o night or ten drinks to night or people drinking every night now in the study they looked at people who on average were drinking one or two drinks per night that could be fourteen drinks on the weekend it could be one drink per night it could be seven drinks on fridge in other words on average one or two drinks per night and i think many people out there are drinking somewhere between one an two drinks per night or day of the we on average to that would be seven to fourteen drinks per week this is an important study because it says that if you are consuming you even just seven glasses of wine across the week it is likely that there is going to be some degeneration of your brain in response to that alcohol in take although as mention earlier we will talk about some of the things that can inoculate against some of that neuronal loss for those of you their interested in reading the study in more detail we put a link to it in the sh ow note captions before we begin it'd to emphasis s that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls it stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and sins related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive end physical performance element contains a science back to electrolyte ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one graham of sodium two hundred milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc come slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element el event do come slash supermen let us talk about alcohol unless us acknowledge that human beings of been consuming alcohol for thousands of years if you look at the archeological evidence for mesepotamia you will find that five thousand years ago people had wine vessels a few want to know when people first started distilling alcohol much of people surprise that did not for take place in relent and that is not a joke about the iris that you will geologic claims on line that the iris were the first to distill alcohol but in fact they were not it was the chines that were the first to distill alcohol that took place in china in the first century alcohol has been used for nutritional purposes there are cultures that believing indeed still believe that the calories in alcohol are useful of the later will talk about how alcholcalories are indeed empty calories and what an empty carry really is why it is called empty aldol has been used for medicinal purposes because indeed it does kill bacteria and as you will soon find out the fact that it kills bacteria because that is absolutely true it also kills the good bacteria your gut and the destruction of that good bacteria your gut can lead to things leaky gut syndrome and has all sorts of issues and their ways to deal with those issues and will talk about those to alcohol has been used for medicinal purposes it is been used to clean surfaces it is used in my laboratory in order to make up called reagents to do our experiments but most humans have been consuming alcohol in order to change their internal state in order to feel differently than they would otherwise that feeling of being drunk or inebriated or tipsy or light headed is something that many not all but many human seem to enjoy and pursue even though typically it leads to a feeling of being less happy less s motivated more stressed et camera when the alcohol wears off that is pretty incredible victim in we are talking about a substance that people are been highly motivated to pursue that are still highly motivated to pursue to create and to consume that they will spend money on and that is despite the fact that it makes them feel good and then it makes them feel lousy now some of you might be saying well i drink but i do not drink to excess and therefore i do not feel lousy i feel good when i drank and then it wears oft and at lows me get through my evening and then the next morning ism ready to go o k om that very well may be true i believe those people and as i mention the beginning the episode of night here to demonize alcohol in any way but i do want to point out what alcohol is and how it creates the effects that it does and then i want to talc about what those effects are when you engage in consuming alcohol even is often is one or two nights per week or let say you are just somebody you as a drink or two on fridge may be a few more on sturdy or maybe or somebody who consumes all your alcohol one night per week or one night per month we will talk about how that is effecting your biology let us address what alcohol is and how it affects the cells and tissues and organs of your body then well take a look at some the epidemiology that is how many people are consuming alcohol and how much they are drinking and then you will be able i think to get a good sense of how the alcohol that you are drinking if you are drinking any i at all is impacting your brain and body and the choices you might want to make about how and when to e drink alcohol or even if you want to eliminate alcohol altogether o faso some basic chemistry and biology of alcohol and again it'll make this very clear or even if you do not have a chemistry an biology background because of the structure of alcohol it is what is called both water soluble and fat soluble translated into what is meaning full for you what that means is when you drink alcohol it can pass into all the cells and tissues of your body it has no trouble just passing right into those cells unlike a lot of substances and drugs that actually attached to the surface of cells to receptors as they are called lo parking spots and then trigger a bunch of downstream domino cascades of effects aldol actually has its own direct effects on cells because it can really just pass into those cells it is water in fat soluble and the fact that it can pass into many organs and cells easily is really what explains its damaging effects i shall mention that therefore three maintop's of alcohol there is isopropyl methyl and ether alcohol and only the last one ether alcohol or than all is fit for human consumption however it is still toxic o k it produces substantial stress and damage to cells it'd love to be able to tell you otherwise but that is just effect than all produces substantial damage to cells and it does that because when you nest than a it has to be converted into something else because it is toxic to the body and there is a molecule insult of all of us lied an a d and you mayhap her of an i d because it is quite popular there is a lot of discussion about ana d in the longevity literature right now an a dis present in all outsells from berth until death the levels of an d ten to go down across the life's band their ideas that increasing levels of ana d may extend life's band a lot of that is till controversial or at least we should say is on going in terms of the research but none the less when you jest than a an a d and related bad chemical pathways are involved in converting that than a into something called a steal altahie it is broken down into a setalaltohde and if you thought ethanol was bad a steal alcaide is particularly bad a steal alcaide is poison it will kill cells it damages and kill cell and is indiscriminate as to which cells it damages and kills now that is a problem obviously and the body deals with that problem by using another component of the an d bad chemical pathway to convert a seal altohide into something called acetate acetate is actually something that your body can use as fuel and that process of going from ethanol to a steal alcaide to acetate does involve the production of a toxic molecule and again a steal astride is really toxic and an a d and if we want to get technical its the an d to an a d h ratio and that chemical step is the rate limiting step to ethanol's metabolism what does that mean for you what that means is that if your body cannot do this conversion of ethanol to setalaldaide to acetate fast enough well a steal aldtahide will build up in your body and cause more damage it is important that your body be able to do this conversion very quickly and the place where it does that is within the liver and sells within the liver are very good at this conversion process but they are cells and they are exposed to the setalaltohide in the conversion process and sells within the liver really take a being in the alcohol metabolism events the key thing to understand here is that when you invest call it you are yes in jesting of poison and that poison is converted into an even worse poison in your body and some percentage of that worse poison is converted into a form of calories that you can use to generate energy generate t p and the reason why call is considered empty calories is because that entire process is very metabolically costly but there is no real nutritive value of the calories that it creates you can use it for immediate energy but it cannot be stored in any kind of meaning full or beneficial way it does not provide any vitamins it does not provide any men acids it does not provide any fatyacids it is truly empty calories i know some ye will talk about sugar is empty calories but sugar actually as a far better fuel source than alcohol or acetate but none the less when you invest call some percentage is being shuttled into a worse poison and some is being shuttled into a fuel source now the importuning to understand is that it is the poison the sendal altohide itself that leads to the effect of being inebriated or drunk think most people do not realize that that being drunk is actually a poison induced disruption in the way that your our circuits work and we should ask ourselves at which neral circuits what brain areas what body carries involved in feeling drunk inebriated now in thinking about this state of being tipsy or happier really drunk or a little but drunk when a mention something i think most people are notoware of and that is the fact that for people that are regular drinkers or that have our genetic predisposition to alcoholism when they drink they tend to feel very energized and very good for longer periods of time again people have a genetic predisposition to aldol or people who are chronic drinkers or even just if you recall chronic does not have to mean a ton of aldol but their drinking one or two period or their every other night type drinkers or thursday through sundae drinkers those people typically experience and increase in alertness and mood when they drink where as occasional drinkers will have a briefer meaning less long lasting period of feeling good when they drink and then more quickly transition into a state in which their tired or they start losing motor skills they start luring their speech also on emphasize this dis distinct from tolerance will talk about tolerance later in exactly what tolerance means but i really won a highline the fact that when people invest this poison cause indeed it is poison the range of effects is very different and you can reliably predict who are the people with a predisposition to alcoholism and who are the people who are more regular drinkers by the contour the timing of the different of facts and again people who tend to feel more alert and excited every time they drink they tend to get a real lift they becoming on life of the party and that lasts a long while those people are the ones that really have to be careful about predisposition for alcoholism and those people also need to be careful about the are drinking in the amount of drinking that there doing even if they are not forlorn alcoholics of course people who are insulting alcohol who are not accustomed to drink alcohol have to be concern about drink aldol for other reasons because it can impair motor function and judgment et camera but in thinking about the big chemical effects of also what it is doing to the body what it is doing in all cases is it is consumed into the got rank goes into the stomach deliver immediately starts this conversion that we talked about before of athenalto septal altohide to acetate and some amount of a sendal altohide and acetate are making into the brain it crosses the blood brainberrier again the brain has this fence surrounded that we call the blood brainberrier or the b b b many things musings thankfully cannot pass across the blood brainberrier but aldol because its watering fat soluble just cruises right across this fence and into the milk the environments of the brain n which is made up of a couple different major retypes neuron's nerve cells and call gleam cells which are in between the nerve cells ill talk about the effects on each of those soon what happens when call gets into the brain that makes us feel tipsy or drunk and in some people makes people they will really especially energized and happy well calls indiscriminate in terms of which brain areas it goes to again it does not bind he particular receptors but it does seem to have a propensity or an affinity for particular brain areas that are involved in certain kinds of thinking and behavior one of the first things it happens is that there is a slight at least after the first drink or second drink there is a slight suppression in the activity of neurons in the prefrontal quarter this is an area of your real quarter that is involved in thinking and planning and perhaps above all in suppression of impulsive behavior if you go to a party and they're serving alcohol and people are consuming drinks what you'll notice is that a few minutes into that party the volume of people's voices will increase and that is because people are simply not paying attention to their voice modulation as other people starts speaking more loudly other people are speaking more loudly we have all have this experience right of going to a party an the you step outside for mom i can s or shouting or come o next day you got a sore throat might be that you picked up some sort of bug some virus or something but oftentimes it is just the fact you been shouting all night just to behead because as the prefrontal quarts shuts down people stop modulating their their level of speech quite as much also knows the people start gesticulating more people's start standing up and sitting down more the tart walking around more if there is music on people might spontaneously start dancing all of this is because these areas of the prefrontal quarters normally are providing what is call top down inhibition they are releasing an our transmit are called gala on to various parts of the brain their involved in impulsive motor behavior and thought patterns and as you shut down the prefrontal quarter that gala unit suppression of impulses starts to be relays people is vaguthings that they want to say without much forethought about what they are saying who they might do things that they want to do without really thinking it through quite as much who they might not even remember thinking it through it all or experience i should say thinking it through it all we haven't talked about blacking out yet in the effects of alcohol on memory but s all's were there it'll just tell you that alcohol has a very strong effect in suppressing the neural networks that are involved in memory formation and storage is is why oftentimes we forget the events of a night out if we have been drinking one of the more important things to know about the effects of also the brain is this destruction in top down in ambition but also that areas of the brain that are involved in flexible behavior f considering different options i could do a i could do be i could see this to that market say that i could say t in that way or i could say it in this way this might be a little more tactful those brain arias basically shut down entirely and people just tend to say what they want to say t e seething to understand is that when people drink the prefrontal of quarter and top down inhibition is diminished that is habitual behavior and impulsive behavior starts to increase that what is interesting is this is true in the short term after people have one or two may be three or for drinks but it is also true that the more often that people drink there are changes in the very circuits that underlie habitual and impulsive behavior this is really important highlight much that i want to drill into it a a bit more deeply for the person that drink say every thursday night or every fridge night goes out only on saturdays but every sturdy there is evidence that there are changes in the curl circuits of the brain that control habitual behavior and impulsive behavior and they are modified and strengthen in ways that make those people more habitual and more impulsive outside the times in which they are drinking and when they drink impulsive in habitual behavior tends to increase even further this is something that is not often talked about when discussing the effects of alcohol and we all know the effects of being drunk can be bad right can be bad interns of judgment motor coordination certainly driving drunk is a terrible thing get you or and other people killed and on but rarely do we hereabout the changes in curl circuits from just one or two nights of regular drinking again chronic drinking does not necessarily mean every day and every night it can be the person that simply drinks every thursday or every fridge or just once a week has three or four drinks or may be even a few more that person is going to experience a decrease in this top down in ambition an increase in impulsivity and habitual behavior because the break on those behaviors has been removed while their drinking but also changes in the very curl circuits that allow habitual impulsive behavior to occur more readily even when they are not drinking and you want to know the actual subtract for that the cellar substrate i can briefly describe it its really interesting again you do not my know an y baggie t understand this what it does is it increases the number of synapses the actual points of connection in the curl circuits that control habitual behavior there is literally a growth of the curls circuits in your brain that lead to existing habit execution right the performance of things you already know how to do and a reduction in the curl circuits where i should say a reduction in the number of synapses of the contacts within the curl circuits that are controlling behavior this again is not often discussed aspect of alcohol an take fortunately it is reversible in animals are humans that undertake a period of abstinence of anywhere from two to six months these curl circuits were return to normal excepting cases where people have been ironically drinking large volumes of alcohol for many many years and in those cases while there is some recovery of brain circuitry after a people get sober meaning completely sober a stop drinking entirely there is evidence of long lasting impact of heavy alcohol usage through alcolife span but of course this does not mean that any one that suffering from alcoholism or that used to should not continued to focus on their health you absolutely should all is not lost but for people have been drinking for lot years may be you went to college and you drank a lot in those years and your neral circuits change if there is a period in which you do not drink alcohol again from two to six months and ideally longer those nerd circuits can then be remodify back to their original state let us consider some of the other negro chemical effects of alcohol on the brain and body and again for right now were confining the conversation to people that are drinking on average one or two drinks per night now some people mig thing that two drinks per night is a lot and a lot of that will depend on body weights for instance people who weigh a hundred and ten pounds for them to invest to alcoholic drinks is going to be substantially different in terms of the alchemical effects then somebody who weights two hundred an twenty pounds of course tolerance will also factor into this genetic background will also factor into this and indeed whether not people have eaten will factor into this that a lot of factors and will talk about that for the time being if you are curious about how food in pacts the effects of alcohol and your feelings of being drunk you may have heard for instance that if somebody is inebriated an they want a sober up they should eat something turns out that does not work here is how it does work however if you eat something prior to drinking alcohol or while investing alcohol it will slow the absorption of alcohol into the blood stream in other words you will not feel as drunk as fast from any of you this probably comes is no surprise in particular if that meal includes carbohydrates fats and prolines i the inclusion of all three major macro nutrient seems to slow the absorption of alcohol into the good stream far more than any then having any one of those or two of those machrnutrians present now if you are already inebriated or you have had a glass of window or a bearing you eat something chances are that alcohol is already made it into your blood stream because it moves into the blood stream quickly again it is fat soluble and water soluble within minutes if your on if you have an empty stomach within five to ten minutes that alcohol its going to be within your bloodstream in distributed throughout your body may be even faster depending on the type of all and your metabolism but if you are already drunk and you eat something it is talk in a sober you ut more quickly but it certainly will blunt the effects of any additional alcohol that you might consume and if your somebody who is concerned about getting too drunk too quick even from a small amount of aldol having some food in your got can certainly be beneficial now that is food and alcohol in the absorption of alcohol but let us go back to talking about the by chemical and negro chemical effects of alcohol on the brain we talked about lowdown in ambition and we talked about habitual and impulsive behavior circuitry there are all to dramatic changes in the activity of neurons that control the release of called ceratonan ceratonan is a neuromodulator it changes the activity of neural circuits and many neural circuits in particular those involved in mood and feelings of well being recently there is been a lot of interest in ceratonan because of a study that was released that showed pretty conclusively that ceratonan levels cannot really explain depression and depression symptoms i want to make it very clear that although that study did show that craton levels are not necessarily associate with depression the study was interpreted by many to mean that essessorise selective ceratonan retake inhibitors which have the net effect of increasing ceratodus these are things prosaic et camera that those drugs are somehow not helpful because they increase ceratonan and caratonan is not involved in depression that logic does not really hold together stomachs as as an opportunity to just clarify what really occurred there and then will talk about how ceratonan relates to aldol consumption in things feeling good and in depression the anything is this assess arise can help alleviate depression that is right essessorise can help alleviate depression they are often not always associate with sideifacts dosages very important et camera but they probably support relief from depression by changing neural circuits not necessarily by increasing ceratoid itself that is increasing rational with these drugs likely change the neural circuits involved in mood allowing people to feel better through called neural plastic which is the brains ability to change itself and response to experience there is a bit a confusion and again amusing this episode on on alcohol to highlight some of the confusion because i think its timely because the study just came out an there alto chatter about this out there that when people are depressed its not necessarily because ceratonan levels are low however if ceratoid levels are increased with things prosaic oft and other essessorise oftentimes there is yes a relief from depression but that is probably not because of restoring caratonan levels person it is probably because craton facilitates the changes in neural circuits that need to occur in order to for people to feel elevated mood one again that is a bit of a tangent in aside but i do thing its a vital one for people to know about again your thing about taking escessorise your currently taking them and hove hurry this news defile talked your doctor again there is great utility for some of these essessorise and also and conditions of d they have been shown to be very beneficial we really do not want to throessessorise out as a potentially valuable treatment getting back to the effects of alcohol on ceratonan it is very clear beyond any doubt that many of the circuits in the brain that are involved in mood and feelings of well being and also self image in how we see our selves employ the neuromodulator ceratonan an alcohol when we invest it and it is converted into a metal all the hide it goes and the a septal altohide acts as a toxin at the very synapses the connections between the start and urgent neurons and lots of other anurans in other words when we invest alcohol the toxic effects of alcohol disrupt those mood circuitry's at first making them hyperactive that is right making them hyperacid if this why people become really talkative people tart to feel really good after a few sips of aldol these most people do and then as they contest more alcohol or as that alcohol wears off creatine and levels and the activity those circuits really starts to drop and that is why people feel less good and typically what they do they go and get another drink and they attempt to restore that feeling of well being in mood now typically what happens is that as people in jest the third and fourth may been the fifth drink there is an absolute zero chance of them recovering that energized mood right most people as they drink more and more will now start to feel more and more suppressed the forebrain is now shutting down quite a lot a lot of the motor cortical areas that control coordinated movement and deliberate movements are to shut down people starts of further speech people start to shuffle their feet people forget their posture peoples are to lean on things people start passing out on couches there is a great depression not depression of the psychiatric depression sort but a depression of alertness and arousal and eventually people will pass out now i said most people because there is a subset of people that have gene variance or who are chronic drinkers or who are chronic drinkers and have gene variance that as they invest the third and fourth and fifth drink what happens they become more alert they stare talking more they feel great they have all sorts of ideas about the fun they could have that night and there the ones that if you've ever fallen a sleep at a party for whatever reason or you getting tired in our yawning an looking round the room and these people are still drinking and parting and their having what seems to be this amazing time often not always those are the future alcoholics in the room or those are the people that have a genetic predisposition for alcoholism or those of the chronic drinkers the people who have built up enough for he tolerance or who have the chemical genetic make up such that increasing amounts of alcohol make them feel better and better and better and of course they too have a threshold beyond which their nervous system will start to get diminished and they will pass out landfall over et camera but that threshold is waylay higher than it is for most people this is important understand and it is important understand because i think everyone should know and recognize their own predisposition and kind of risk in terms of developing alcoholism it is also important understand because it relates to the phenomenon of black out you many people think that blacking out as passing out but black out drunk is when people drink and their talking and doing things sometimes sadly the all or tragically they will often drive home or walk home or they hop on bicycle and ride home or though go swimming in the ocean all of course very dangerous activities to do when people are really drunk or even a little bit drunken some cases these people all do these sorts of things and they do them because they have the energy to do them and they feel good while doing them but they are doing them hell the activity of neurons in the hippocampus which is involved in memory formation are completely shut off and this is why the next day you tell them at may wish to talk about what happen last night we will have an last night sit woo do you remember going the part yen as great we do this we do this and then what and it is very clear all a sudden that they have no recollection of all the things they were doing despite being awake now i wish i could tell you that the some sort of blood last or other bulwark or even a finger print test that would allow you to determine whether or not you have a propensity to be one of these drinkers that as a predisposition for alcoholism and if you have ever been black out drunk and certainly toque been black out drunk more than a few times you should be quite concern and as we talk more about the for chronic effects and long lasting effects of alcohol consumption lie bit later in the episode think it will become clear as to why you should be concerned but in any case there is something that can tell you whether or not you might be in that category verses likely not in that category and i alluded to this a couple of times already but i want to be really clear that when people drink no matter who you are initially there is that shutting down of those prefrontal cortical circuits there is a gradual shutting down o the circuits the control memory but then people divide into these two bins and these two bins are the people who after more than a couple of drink start to feel sedated and the people who after more than a few drinks do not start to feel sedated now of course there's going to be differences created by how quickly people are drinking whether not their combining different types of alcohol the types of aldol et camera but in general that can predict whether not your somebody who has a predisposition for alcoholism or not one also very interesting finding is that alcohol changes the relationship between what is called the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland and the adrenals now the hypothalamus is a small collection of neurons about the size of a large humble sits above the rotor your mouth and houses neurons their responsible for some incredible aspects of our behavior and are mind set things rage things see drive things temperature regulation very primitive functions clouding appetite thirst et camera alcohol because it can go anywhere in the brain remembrance water and fat soluble has effects on the hypothalamus the hypothalamus normally provides very specific signals to whats called the pituitary gland this is a won gland that actually sticks out of the brain but it receives instructions from the hypothalamus and then the pituitary releases for among into the bloodstream that go and talk to your a adrenals your dream of lands it right above your kidneys in your lower back and the dreams release as the name suggests a adrenalin also called a an errant and also a moleculecal cortical which is involved in the longer term stress response as some healthy effects to on the mean system o case o the hypothalamic pituitary a dermal axis i know it is a mouthful you do not need to remember the names but the hypothermic pituitary dermal axis maintains your physiological balance of what you perceive as stressful an what you do not perceive i stressful people who drink regularly this again could be just one or two drinks per night or could be somebody that drinks just on fridges ore just on saturdays or may be just on the weak and two to four drinks will those people experience changes in their hypothermic pituitary a dremalaxis that result in more cortical more of this called stress hormone being released at baseline when they are not drinking this is really important people who drink a bit and when i say a bit i do not mean one or two sees or even a glass of wine every once in a while i mean again people that a may be having one drink a night with dinner and maybe on the weaken a few more can i offer a bunch or different patterns to explain how it could also be two or three drinks on fridge or six drinks only on sturdy will all of those groups experience increases in coatis all release from their dermal glands when they are not drinking and as a consequence they feel more stressed in more anxiety when they are not drinking this is a seldom talked about effect of alcohol because often we hear about the immediate effects of alcohol and were been talking about some of those effects effects reducing the amount of stress i mean how many times if we heard somebody tit i need or drink and the they have a drink and calm down now they can shake off the thoughts about the days were they can start to think about things in a may more grounded or rational way or at least they believe that or they can somehow just relax themselves well while that very well may be true that it can relax them when they are not drinking that level of cortisol that is released at baseline has increase substantially again this relates to a define neral circuit between brain and body and it has to do with the ratio of cortical to some of the other hormones involved in the stress response will provide a reference to the study that describes how old this works for those who that really want to delving to it but let us go back to this issue of those who are prone to alcoholism verses those who are not remember there are people who have genetic variance that meaning genes that they inherited from their parents that make it more likely that they will become alcoholic but there are also people who drink often who start to experience this increase in alertness the longer they drink across the night part of that effect we think is because of changes in this hypothalamic pituitary a drealaxis s you aldol is kind of a double hit in this sense it is causing changes in our brain circuitry in narrow chemistry that at the time in which were inebriated are detrimental and it is causing changes in neural circuitry that persist long past the time in which we are experiencing the feeling of being tipsy or drunk now again i do not want to demonize alcohol ism not saying oh if you have a glass wine now and again or you drink a bear now and again or even have om a mixturink now and again were a shot that that is necessarily terrible for you i certainly do not want that to be the message what ism saying is that if people are ingesting call chronically even if it is not every night there are well recognized changes in neural circuits there well recognized changes in negro chemistry within the brain and there well recognize changes in the brain to body stress system that generally point in three directions increased stress when people are not drinking diminished mood and feelings of well being when people are not drinking and as you will soon learn changes in the neural circuitry that cause people to want touring even more in order to get just back to base line we the place that they were in terms of their stress modulation and in terms their feelings of mood before they ever started drinking the first place again i do not want tod to demonize alcohol but i do want to emphasize that there are long term plastic changes meaning changes in neural circuitry in hormone circuitry that across a period of several months and certainly across a period of years of the sorts of drinking patterns i described which i think for most people are going to sound pretty typical ride i m nothing that i describe far was about drinking a case invite or or about binging on alcohol in the ways that we often here about it in the news is are pretty common patterns of of aldol consumption mean all you have to do is bore to trains an lactic flight or a she go to an airport on a sundae afternoon in a sunny area of the sand en on people are having three four or five six bears et camera than personal choice is personal choice a not telling y what to do but s very clear that those sorts of drinking patterns are changing neural circuitry and their changing hormone circuitry and it'd love to be able tell you that they're changing them for better but they simply are not their rashly changing them for the worse and worse is defend is making people less resilient distress higher levels of baseline stress and lower mood over all it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a item in mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the probiatics that i need for got health our got is very important its populated by got microbyoda that commune crate with the brain the amen system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probiatics an athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegens vitamins and minerals that make sure that all f my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastegright if you to truth lentic greens you can go to athletic green sdoccom slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plane et camera and they'll give you a year supply of vitamin d three k too again that athletic green doctor slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply of vitamin the k to now have been talking a titbit about genetic predisposition but there are couple of important points i to make about that first of all what sorts of genes are involved in setting some one down the path of alcoholism or not well it should come is no surprise that the genes that chronic alcohol usage modifies they tend to fall primarily in the pathways related to genetic control over ceratonan receptors gala receptors remember that top down inhibition and involvement agama and no surprise the h p the hypothalamic pituitary axis all of those of course combine with environment that combine with patterns of abuse right we know that if you are in a social setting were lot of people are drinking the likelihood that you are going to drink is much higher social pressures aroma right some people will use aldol to selah medicate to try and turn off their thinking or to deal with amtrama et camera they combine with the environment but the genes that are in the ceretonan synthesis and receptor synthesis pathway gala and each pe ax as combine with environmental pressures to give rise to alcohol use disorders there is a fairly coherent picture that we have here right this is not a case where for instance people that have a lot of the enzyme from atavolizing all which will talk about in a minute aldol de hydrazines it is not they are necessarily the people that become alcoholics whereas certainly in certain cultures certain alien cultures in particular there are gene differences that lead them to have low levels of aldol de hydrazines there act people have little aldol d hydrogen's that when they ingest alcohol they get very red and they just feel sick if your somebody has a sip of also you just feel horrible at makes you feel nation chances are you have gene variance that greatest situation we are not making very much alcohol d hydrazines you just simply cannot metabolize aldol you just get a rapid build up of the toxic effects of alcohol the septal alcaide you are not converting it into those empty calories but in cultures where you have a lot of genetic variance and genes expressed in people where they have a lot of all d hydragunaes sure they can drink more and they're converting more of that aldol from its toxic form to a nontoxic form and yes of course you will observe more alcoholism in those communes because they are drinking more but i do one emphasize that the environmental factors are playing a strong roll there too because if you can drink more you are likely to drink more you are somebody feel sick immediately from drinking it is likely that your not on engage in alcohol consumption especially if these things are genetically related and of course genes and culture and location in the world tend to run together do you have the gene for alcoholism when there is not one single gene chances are if you have an immediate relative whose a chronic abuser of alcohol or several relatives tor chronic abusers of aldol well that is going to predispose you to be an alcoholic but since you do not know which genes you express unless you do genetic testing in those things are available but most people are not doing that this assay if you will man's not an assay as we say an assay is a test that you run in the lamb om to determine something and it is not one that i recommend that you go drink in order to do but if you notice that you or somebody also of somebody who can drink a lot throughout the night and have increased energy can just drink and drink a drink and especially if there is blackout episodes not remembering things the next day despite being alert throughout the entire night on well then i would be very concern that you might actually have a genetic variant predisposing you to alcoholism the other thing that predisposes people to abuse of alcohol is age people who start drinking at younger ages are greatly predisposed to developing alcohol dependence regardless of your family history of alcoholism handsome on repeat that people who start drinking younger are at great risk for developing alcoholism even if they do not have alkalis in their family now of course you do not have to be an epidemiologist understand that if you grow up in a family of drinkers in alcohol is everywhere and especialyif there is pure pressure or lack of overbite then there is going to be a higher tendency or a higher probability i should say that you will start drinking at a younger age however even people that grow up nowhere near their relatives if they start drinking at a young age for instance at thirteen or younger or fourteen or fifteen there is a much higher probability that they are going to develop a long lasting dependence on alcohol people who take their first sip of alcohol later fifteen sixteen or one would hope even later i can say one would hope cause in now of that age in generation where you you know you think about all the things that a young people do and skosh if they only would wait or if they only would of staying since what happens out know there some marry circuit for that that i cannot explain yet but people who for instance drink only once they reach legal age of drinking which in the you ask i believe in every stage is twenty one years old if they take their first drink at twenty one the probability that they will go on to develop full blown alcohol dependence or alcohol use disorder as it is called a up is very low now upset of them will because they have such a strong genetic predisposition or may be life circumstances create a pattern in which they become a chronic drinker but i found this very interesting gene's matter but also the age in which somebody starts drinking really matters now whether or not that is because their changes in neral circuitry as a consequence of that drinking than make people want to seek out more and more alcohol or whether or not there is some other effect maybe it is a change in hormones et camera that predisposes those young drinkers to become chronic drinkers are even full blown alcoholic certainly developing alcohol used disorder there is definition for that we can talk about it it involves the amount of drinking over a cercertain period of time et camera it is very clear that drinking early in life creates a propensity for the development of alcohol used disorder later in life and while there is a genetic component to developing alcohol used disorder i find it very interesting that if people who have those gene variance delay thereon set of drinking well then the probability that they will develop full blown aldol used disorder drops as well again its gene's end environments not in other or and there is no single gene for alcoholism well i promise you i will also talk about some of the documented positive effects of alcohol although they are very few and far between they do exist but before i do that i would be remiss if i did not emphasize some more of the terrible things that alcohol does in the way that it does it and for those of you that enjoy alcohol i again i i really to say a feel guilty about telling you this because i know how much some people enjoy a good drink every once nihil and i say good drink because some people do the taste of aldol i suppose i lucked out and that i do not really the taste of aldol me just puts me to sleep but i know that people do enjoy it and i do want to point out that there is zero evidence that you do not provided somebody is of drinking age certainly not in the stage of brain development that having one drink or two drinks every now and again meaning every three or four weeks or once a month that is not going to cause major health concerns or major health issues for most people i suppose of you have zero or very little alcalde hydrogen's it might make you feel sick but then your not probably not the kind of person that is going to be drinking at all again if you enjoy aldol drinks ism not trying to m take them away from you to by any means but you should know what drinking does if you're consuming it in this kind of typical chronic pattern as we can now refer to it which is that one or two and night or a few stacked up on fridge and may be three or four on sturdy this kind of pattern of drinking which is quite common and one of the more serious effects that we should think about is the impact on the call gut brain arise for ache of to day's discussion the gut liver brain acts i do not think the gut liver brain acts has ever been discussed on this podcast maybe any podcast although the moment i say that imp no the the gut liver brain axis people are on to come after me with i supposed gut live r brain and brains in any event you have a brain you have a gut that got runs from your throat down to the end of your intestine you are got and your brain communicate by way of nerve cells morons and nerve connections the vaguest nerve in particular and by way of chemical signaling you are got also communicates by way of chemical signalling and believe or not by way of nerd signalling to to your liver and as we talked about earlier the liver is the first sit in which alcohol is broken down or metabolized into its component parts the liver is also communicating with the brain through chemical signaling and neral signalling we have the got liver brain axis and what you find is that people who invest alcohol at any amount a inducing a deserruption in the clue got microfilm the trillions of little mycobacteria that take resident in your gut in that live inside you all the time and the help support your mine system and that literally signal by way of electrical signals and chemical signals to your brain to increase the release of things ceratonan and dopamine than regulate your mood generally in positive ways what alcohol really disrupts those bacteria this should come is no surprise and earlier we talked about this and it is well known if you wanted you sterilize something yo i kill the bacteria you pour alcohol on it and i can remember scraping my myself for cutting myself i was always endure myself when i was a kid and the moment they take out the peroxide on the cow boy here it comes but it is no peroxide around and you have got a wound the i mean to clean it out yet they they will use alcohol which i do not recommend by the we that is one of the harshest ways to clean a wound but for centuries thousands of years really calls has been used in order to clean things and kill bacteria alcohol kills bacteria and it is indiscriminate with respect to which bacteria it kills when we invest aldol and goes into our gut it kills ha lot of the healthy gut microbioda at the same time the metabolism of alcohol in the liver which you now understand that pathway involving an idea seed a seel alcaide and fascinate that pathway is pro inflammatory it is increasing the release of inflammatory site of kinds things ill six et camera to necrosis factor alpha if you would to learn more about the immune system we didn't episode all about the immune system you can find that you havereen labor come teach you all the basics of what our side a kinds what our mast sells et camera in any event all these pro inflammatory molecules those are being released you have now got disruption of the gut microbioda as a consequence the lining of the gut is desterrupted and you develop at least transiently leaky gut that is bacteria that exist in the gut which are bad bacteria can now pass out of the gut into the bloodstreams you have got a to hit conomodel re in billy we talk about two hipmodels that it is kind of a one plus one equals for and it is generally when you hear too hit it is not a good thing you have got bad bacteria from partially broken down food moving out of the got the good bacterin the gut have been killed you might say wisely alcohol kill the bad bacteria in the gut well the bad bacteria that are from partially digested food oftentimes escape the gut before the alcohol can disrupt them and now you have got leaks in the gut will you have got the release of this bad bacteria you have got inflammatory side of kinds and other things being released from the liver and they are able to get into the brain through her what is called a neuroma signalling and what is really bazaar in terms of the way that this manifests in the brain i mean it is not the way i would have done it but then again as i always say i was not consulted at the design phase and anyone says they did you should be very skeptical of them the neteffect of this is actually to disrupt the neural circuits that control regulation of alcoholic take and the net effect of that is increased alcohol consumption this is just terrible right into your take in something that disrupts to systems the gut microbiota and it destructs in two ways it is killing the good gut microbiota and it is allowing the bad bacteria to move from the got into the bloodstream you have also got proinflammatory side of kinds coming from the liver and those converge or arrive in the brain and crate a system in which the neural circuits cause more drinking that is a bad situation and this is why people who drink regularly even if it is not a ton of alcohol again of the sorts of patterns of drink out talked about before and certainly for those that are chronic heavy drinkers what you end up with as a situation in which you have inflammation in multiple places in the brain and body and the desire to drink even more and to further exacerbate that inflammation and the gut leaky ness this is basically a terrible scenario for the gut liver brain axis and it is especially prevalent an called alcohol used disorder again people there investing somewhere between twelve and twenty four drinks per week for those ore you that are interested in learning more about the gut liver brain axis and in particular alcohol usediceorder all provide a link in the show note captions another is wonderful review on this the details that but on the positive side it points to the possibility that at least some again at least some of the negative effects of aldol consumption whether not you are somebody use currently investing alcohol or who used to invest alcohol is trying to tho called repair these systems of the brain and body whether not replenishing the gut microbiota is going t be beneficial and we know that there are waits to do that and we know that there is at least some promise for the ability for the system to repair itself how does one do that weave talked before about this on the podcast but study's gone by calliopes of mine at staffer just in sonoberg who is been on this podcast as a guest in amazing episode all about the gut microfilm and is calla greater crisgarner also at stamford school of medicine have explored not alcoholism but what are ways to improve the got microbyota and particular to reduce the production of inflammatory site of kines and to a just what is called the inflammatory you heard of the genome and the prodrome et camera while the inflammatory is the total array or at least the near total array of genes and prolines that control inflammation how can you reduce inflammation and make that imflammatome healthier well they have shown that two to four servings of fermented foods per day and here ism not referring to fermented aldol and ism at low sugar fermented foods of things kimchi sour craft am dato for the for those of you that japan's food om there are others i know on things keeper things a yogurts have a lot of act of bacteria again low sugar varieties of all these things those are terrific at reducing inflammatory markers and at improving the got microfilm one could imagine that either inoculating oneself from some of the effects of alcohol although it'd prefer that people just not drink alcolchronically frankly or if somebody is trying to repair they are got microbyom because they invested a lot of alcohol a because they had a lot of these inflammatory did o kinds for many years are even a short period o time regular ingestion of two to four servings of these fermented foods can be quite beneficial one make it clear that has not been examined specifically in the contact of alcohol used disorder but because a huge component of the negative effects of aldol use disorder are based in this got liver brain access and destruction the gotmicrobiom in the inflammatory side a kinds it stands to reason that things that are well established to improve inflammation status anotherwords reduce inflammation such as investing two to for servings of though sugar fermented foods per day make sense in terms of trying to repair or replenish the system one cold also imagine taking probiatics or prebiatics certainly that would work as well although have sort of favored the discussion round fermented foods and replenishment of the got microfilm mostly because there are more studies that have examined that inhuman an because of the direct relationship that is been established between doing that and reducing negative markers within the inflamatom and i should mention along the lines of repair and recovery i put out a question on twitter the other day i said what you want know about alcohol more than a thousand questions and take some more of those questions like later in the episode but one of things i notice is that many of the questions hundreds in fact related to the question of well if i drank a lot previously am i doomed can i reverse the negative of facts or i man ism trying to drink lass and ism trying to improve my health as i as i do that what should i do will certainly am focussing a bit on the to microsome ought to be useful the other thing i should mention is as people wean themselves off aldol even if they are not full blown a frolics a have call house disorder should understand that that increase in coatis all that we talked about earlier that leads to lower stress threshold and greater feelings of anxiety in stress that is going to be present in its con it take some time to dissipate for some people hit might even just be helpful to realize that as you try and wean yourself off collar may be even go call turkey that increased anxiety and feelings of stress should be expected and in that case i would point you to an episode that we did on master stress you find that again at superman look commits got ton of behavioral nutritional supplementation base exercise base i suppose exercises behavior but a lot of tools you can navigate to those easily because we have timestampsying go right to the topic of interests those tools are gong to be very useful in trying to clamp or control your stress and the point here is just that some increase in stress should be expected and it should be expected because of that increase in cortical that course with even low level consumption yet chronic alcohol consumption now i to talk about a fairly common phenomenon which is post alcohol consumption malar also referred to as hang over hang over is a constellation of a facts ranging from headache to nausea to what sometimes call the anxiety which is anxiety that follows a day of drinking anxiety i think we can understand physiologically if we think about that process of alcohol in take increasing the amount of cortical and the raise of cortical to some other stress hormones that well explains why some people wake up the day after or even the day the day after a night drinking and feel anxious and not well and stress for reasons they do not understand if you're somebody who experiences anxiety then again i refer you to the master stress episode that we put out o sometime ago when you can find that huvermn labor calm tools to deal with anxiety tools to deal with stress ranging again from behavioral to nutritional supplement base et camera that of course is not justification for going out and drinking much that you get anxiety induced hang over but for those of you that are experiencing post alcohol consumption anxiety as it were that could be a useful resource because i certainly do not want any one experiencing a uncomfortable mounts of anxiety and there are great tools in resources for that now the other aspects of hang over such as the stomach ache or headache or feelings of malaria or fogginess those can be related to a number of different things and probably are related to a number of different things first of all the sleep that one gets after even just one yes even just one glass of wine or a beer is not the same sleep that you get when you do not have alcohol circulating in your system and not trying to be a downer here but this was discussed in the human labpodcast episode we re i had doctor matter walker from you see burly on and course doctor walker is a world expert in sleep runs one of the are eminent laboratories studying sleep in its effects wrote the incredible book why we sleep and on doctor walker told me and certainly is supported by lots and lots of quality previewed studies in animals and in humans that when call is present and the brain and bloodstream that the architecture of sleep is destructed slow wave sleep deep sleep and rapid movement sleep all of which are essential for getting restored night sleep a all disrupted for those view that are drinking a glass or to of wine or having a a hard liquor drink or a beer in order to fall a sleep the sleep your getting is simply not high qualities sleep or certainly not as high qualities the sleep you be getting if you did not have call on your system course when we are talking bout hang over were talking generally about the consumption of more than just one or two drinks course for some people one or two drinks as probably sufficient to induce hang over but for most people it is going to be having three or four exceeding that there typical limit as it is called again not the legal limit that is a whole other business but when one invests too much alcohol for them one of the reasons they feel terrible the next day is because their sleep is in really good sleep in fact it is not even sleep its often considered pseudo sleep ear least that is what it is called in the sleep science field because people are in kind of a low level hypnotic kind of trance is not real sleep their multiple bouts of waking up they may not even realize their waking up multiple times o gas there is the sleep in duce effects then there are the disrupted got microfilm effects some of which we talked about earlier now you understand the mechanism of call destroying good healthy got microbiota which then leads the leaky gotten things of that sort but one could imagine again could imagine and there some evident starting to support this that again in jesting sugar fermented foods ore may be in abiotic or probed to support the gutmicrobium might assist in some of the gut related always associated with hang over other words get those got microbiota healthy again as quickly as possible or maybeven before you drink have those got microbe to healthy i would hope that you do that think everybody should be doing something to support their gotmicrobyum whether not the ingestion of sugar tormented foods daily or at least on a regular basis or ingestion of robotic or periotic the gotmicrobium is important for many different things in terms of hang over and head ache we know that that is caused by veto constriction the constriction of blood vessels that tends to occur as a rebound after night of drinking call can act as of azo dilator can dilate the blood vessels part of that is associated with the increase in called parts sympathetic tone we have an autonomic nervous system it is got a sympathetic component these are neurons that make us more hurt and if there very active they make us very stress threes also the part sympathetic aspect of the but gnomic nervous system this is all just fancy geeks speak for the parts of your brain and body the nerve cells that make you very relaxed when your very relaxed theretends to be azo dilation it allows for more movement to blood and other things through the blood stream and call tens induce some azo dilation at least in some of the capillary beds and then when the alcohol wares off there is a vast constriction and people get brutal headaches that is why some people will take aspirin or tile an all or advice or things that this or of non steroid anti flammatories i should mention there is a lot of literature coming out that some of these non steroid anti inflammatory drugs are not good for us for a number of different reasons and way they impact deliver the way they impact the immune system and no surprise the way they impact the up mycrobyom him not one to tell you what medications to take or not take but you certainly would want to do a a quick web search of effects of nonsterroid a anytime flammatories om an astern before you start taking those or stop taking those for that matter generally they will alleviate headache but they can often have other issues including liver issues and keeping mind the night after drinking your liver is already takin a beating because of the need of the liver to convert alcohol from a see alow the hide imtacitate which is now pathway that you well understand am not certain and in fact i believe it is not the grayest idea to burden your liver further through the use of things om that are going to cause it to have to work harder and metabolize things if the goal is simply to alleviate a headache there is a lot of kind of lore a old school lore about how to relieve a hang over we already talked about how eating food will not do that but eating food will prevent the rapid absorption of even more alcohol into the blood stream there is the lore that one should simply invest more alcohol what terrible advice that is that is just in a delay and even worse hang over however it'd be remiss if i did not say that the reason that that with came to be or that i should say that truth came to be because indeed investing more alcohol will alleviate a hang over but then a worse hang over will show up the reason that came to be is because injection more aldol will cause those constricted vessels they are giving t a headache to dilate again but of course investing more aldol to relieve a hang over simply a bad idea just do not do it i think the is called the hair of the dog approach may be some one can put in the shown out captions on you to why it is called the hair of the dog i can come up with a few ideas but o they are not they gong to be very good ones and ism some of them d probably en be outright ridiculous do not invest more alcohol simply to try and recover from i hang over i know many people have tried that one before but that is a terrible idea now one thing that you will also here out there is that deliberate cold exposure for instils taking a cold shower might relieve hang over i find this one particularly interesting because we have done episodes on the benefits of deliberate cold exposure we have an entire episode o bout that you find it again human labia come there direct lings to some of the tools relates t o deliberate cold exposure and we have an an en tire newsletter on deliberate could exposure protocols you can find on humeral labdacongod or curl network news letter o these those of you the interesting ice was in cold showers and weighs to leverage those you can find that there what you will not find there is a description of how to use deliberate called exposure for sake of treating hang over but here i went into the lichrand i found something kind of interesting there is some evidence that increasing levels of epinephrin in the blood stream can actually help with alcohol clearance that was very surprising to me and i want to point out this is not a large and robust literature but there is some evidence pointing the fact that when levels of repiner and a adrenaline are raised in the brain and blood stream that some of the components of aldol metabolism can be accelerated and some of the inebriating effects of alcohol can be reduced maybe this old school lore of taking a cold shower actually has something to it in thinking about the use of deliberate cold exposure in order to reduce the effects of hang over or to more rapidly clear alcohol from the brain and bloodstream i want to be very clear and i want to emphasize your safety the way to do that is to understand that alcohol lowers for body temperature i can make people slightly hypo thermic its can a dropcorbody temperature if you were inebriated and you went and got into a body of water rite a pool or a lake or something first of all that is extremely dangerous to do while your inebriated people drown all the time people drown they die as a consequence o dong that please do not to that but also i it is very cold water your corody temperatures going o drop even further now if you have heard the episodes that have done on deliberate cold exposure previously have talked about how normally when people are not in busting aldol they get into an ice bathroom shower and their body temperature initially dips but then it rebounds and increases that is a process that is going to occur when people do not have alcohol in their system when you have aldol in your system one of the reasons that you become hypothermic is because there is a disruption in those hypothalamic brainairies in particular the brainairy call the medial peptic area that regulates corody temperature it is not much that alcohol makes you cold its that alcohol disrupts the central command centers of the brain that control temperature regulation and that leads you to be slightly hypothermic if you then go get into a very cold lake ore you get into even a cold shower or an ice bath there is the possibility of you going very very far down the latter into very hypothermic territory and that can be very dangerous now in terms of dealing with hang over when the alcohol has been largely cleared from your system well that is where some of this anole lore combines with some of the modern science and says well if you can spike a adrenaline and certainly getting into an ice bath ore getting into a cold shower or any kind of cold body of water provided you can do that safely that will sharply increase your adrenaline and and i should say your dooming that is been shown and we have talked about this on the podcast before you get these long extended increases several hours of increases in dooming from deliberate cold exposure it is well document in humans by the way one could imagine using deliberate cold exposure as a way to accelerate the recovery from hang over provided that is done safely i think o there is no reason to not explore that and if your wonder what safely is and what temperatures to use please check out the episode on deliberate cold exposure cold showers therefore might actually be one way to at lease partially relieve hang over certainly the science from various places in the literature converge to say that but again be careful please please please be careful not to get into cold water when you are inebriated it is absolutely dangerous for all the obvious reasons and it is dangerous also for the non obvious reasons not the least of which is the dramatic decreases in corody temperature that can make you dangerously hypothermic now how would you go about using deliberate cold exposure to accelerate recovery from hang over well there i would look to the kind of standard protocols of one to three minutes from avian six minutes if you can tolerate if your really cold adapted if you do seven or ten minutes in a cold shower although that could be a lot most people are going to experience a sharp increase in epinephrin an agrentleand and a long lasting increase in dopamine from one to three minutes of deliberate cold exposure i really done immersion up to the neck again do the safely please please please or a cold shower we are getting under the showers much as possible how cold while that is goes a very person a person i suggest making it as cold as is uncomfortable such the really want to get out but you can stay and safely without french that even yourself a hard attack because if the waters it really really cold of course you gave yourself a hard attack most showers will not go that cold although probably some will gan please use caution spike your gentian spike your dopamine with deliberate cold exposure safely other components of hang over that could be good targets for trying to alleviate hang over and here i hope you are getting the picture because it is accurate to say that hang over is a musty faced phenomenon it is not one moleculing one receptorates of bunch of things happening the brain an body but is the dehydration associated with ill call calls a dramatic for multiple reasons it caused people to excrete not only water but also sodium sodium as an electrolyte critical for the function of neurons making sure that you have enough social potacuman magnesium chat electrolytes is going to be important for proper brain function to the organ function even for people they have just had one or two drinks the night before it is likely that your electrolyte balance and your fluid balance is going to be disrupted in that is because call also disrupts the called vase oppression pathway i talk to lot about yes oppression in the way that it interacts with and controls different aspects of water attention and water release from the body in the form of urine in the episode on salt you gan ism preferring to cuber labor calm as the sit where you can find that e episode on salt balance and wants to restore electrolyte balance having your electrolights at the proper levels before you drink is ideal some people wo say for every glass of alcohol that you drink you should drink one glass of water i would say better would be two glasses of water given the dehydrating effects of alcohol and even better would be water with electrolytes that certainly would set you up for a better day the next day and if you do not manage to do that to the suppose its kind of get walking round with electrolyte packets out at the bar or what not although i in get my book is a good thing the next day you could take some electrolights upon waking i maybe even some before you go to sleep the night of drinking hang overs made worse by disturbed sleep made worse by destroyed gut my boom made worse by destructed electrolights made worse by the depletion of epinephrin an dopamine that is why replenishing the microfilm with fermented foods love sugar from entifoots that is that is why using safe deliberate cold exposure for spiking a adrenalin and for increasing dopamine and that is why consuming electrolytes a a going to be beneficial the folks over it examined coom a website that i really because it just has much useful information have assembled a list of things that have been propose reported to improve or i should say to remove the effects of hang over and as they point out and i would to point out over the there is not a lot of quality science to support the idea that any one compound can eliminate hang overland that is probably because hang over again arises from multiple organs and tissues and systems in both the brain and body none the less they have a terrific am list over there of things everything from japan's parfait juice has been proposed to do this to a some other really esoteric things even a things yohimbine a frankly when i look at the literature there and elsewhere one simply cannot find the magic substance the one era the one potion that can wipe away hang over getting rid of hang over is going to be best solve by doing a collection of a small number of very powerful things of which have already listed off a few however there are some additional things that one can do for relieving hang over and one of them is to be very thoughtful about what sorts of alcohol one consumes i find this interesting there have actually been studies of which types of alcohol lead to the greatest hang overs there is actually a lot of legend and lower about this a as well some people have said for instance that drinks that have high sugar content lead to greater hang overs turns out that is not the case or leas that is not with the science points to if you look at the expected hang over severity what you find is that at the bottom end of the scale there is a drink that ism no can i tell you for the moment but what you find is that near it is for instance beer the the consumption of beer provided it is not over consumption right it is not far beyond the tolerance of the individual does one or two beers is lass likely to cause a hang over than say whisky and a glass of whisker i should you are not as much whisky as beer of course but a glass of whisky for instance is more likely to cause hang over then gin is it turns out again this is what is fallen out of the data and yet a glass of rum or red wine is more likely to cause a hang over than any of the other things have mentioned far at the top top top of the list of drinks that induce hang over is brandy and one could then say well does not brandy of a lot of sugar habits the sugar that is causing hang overs and this is something that is been again discussed over and over that people that ow it is the high sugar drinks the cause hang over turns out however that when one looks it drinks alcoholic drinks and sugar content and hang over at the very bottom of the list is gosh this makes me cringe just to think about is ethanol diluted in orange juice simple people's she drink this but ethanol diluted in orange juice there is not vodka orange okay vodka is third on the list from the bottom of drinks that induce hang over again this is within amounts that are comfortable for the person to drink that they have enough experience with or that they have the body weight to tolerate without getting very very drunk the point is that if it were sugar that is causing hang over well then the ethanol diluting orange juice would probably be at the top of the list and to in terms of inducing hang over but it is not is at the bottom of the list and brandy is at the top of the list what you find is that what scales from ethanol deluding orange juice to beer to vodka to gin here ism ascending the hickey of things that cause hang over gin white wine whisky rum red wine and then brandy at the peak itsorof the world have weight champion of hang over inducing drinks well what is increasing are congeners within those drinks congeners are things nitrites and other substances that give alcohol it is distinctive flavor and that also lead to some of the inebriating effects of alcohol now then you ask ocaywile what is it that these congeners are doing and what are the nitrates doing and guesswat while they do have effects on the brain and on other tissues their main effects are to disrupt the got mycrobiom what this points to again is that having a healthy got my chromium and perhaps insuring that you bolster you are got mycrobiom the day after drinking is going to be especially important for wording off hang over at least reducing the effects of hang over or the symptoms of hang over or both i would love to see a study on this i could imagine designing the study myself although this is not really the sorts of things my laboratory does but can imagine some people getting robotic and robotic some regularly some just after drinking or lowsugar fermented outs and see what the effects are in terms of subjective effects of hang over but also some physiological measures think that way to think about hang over over all is that again it represents a multifaceted mufti organ mufti tissue phenomenon and the best way to deal with it is as a multisell mufti tissue mufti chemical phenomenon and before i listed off some of the things that one call do in order to adjust hang over again the one that comes out at the top of that list i believe the spaced on my read of the data is to support they got mycrobium and certainly not to in jest more alcohol and i suppose if we were to get really honest with one another and ask what is the best way to avoid to hang over it would be do not drink in the first place we have covered the major effects of alcohol that lead to this state that we can drunkenness or inebriation gain there is a range there be tipsy people can be black out drunk people can be passed out drunk we have also talk about hang over and the fact that it is a mufti fascinated phenomenon and recovery from hang over involves a multifastetet approach next one to talk about tolerance tolerance to alcohol is a very interesting phenomenon has roots mainly in the brain and in brain systems there is not time in the world let alone within this podcast to get into all the aspects of tolerance there are more than ten different types of tolerance there is functional tolerance chronic tolerance rapid tolerance there is metabolic tolerance there is psychological tolerance let us keep it simple forsake of to day's discussion and for those of you that are interested in learning about all the different types of tolerance and aspects of tolerance there is an excellent review we will provide a link to this this was publish in twenty twenty one it is pretty recent in the journal pharmacology about chemistry and behavior insanity or nonsense only that was the first journal i have republish have a particular affection for that journal none the less it is called tolerance to alcohol a critical yet understudied factor and alcohol a diction and while this paper does include aldol a diction in the title it is not just about alcohol a diction here is the basic summary of what tolerance is first of all tolerance refers to the reduced effects of alcohol with repeated exposure and it is caused mainly by changes in negro transmitter systems in the brain that are the direct consequence of the toxicity of alcohol that alcaide molecule that we talked about before there is enormous number of chemicals that change with repeated exposure to septal alcaide everything from habit to dope to serotonin second messing er systems a decisive and on and on rather than going to each of those in detail i just want to talk about the contour of the reenforcing and the tolerance inducing effects of aldol what do i mean by that well here we are back to our old friend meaning the molecule that come up over and over again in these podcast episodes which is dopamine whether not somebody has a predisposition alcoholism or not whether not their experience drinker or not when people initially start drinking there are increases in dopamine or what we call dopamannurgic transmission dopamine is involved in motivation craving it creates a sense i well being at increases energy again typically only at the beginning of alcohol exposure that occurs in most people as a sharp spike as a increase again if somebody does not have aldol de hydrogen's or has very low levels of the enzyme that convert that a septal alive and agitate and the metabolize alcohol another words they will feel sick and lousy in a way that will override any recognition of the dopamine release the guns be the people there listen o this and is thing alcolgis makes me feel sick i do not it locate that a specific subcategory of people but most people experience some sort of mild euphoria that is why many people drink it it the corn estimates are that in most countries and certainly in the us as many as eighty per cent to the adult legal drinking age population drinks alcohol and that number could be even higher now because in the last couple of years has been a then towards increase alcolconsumption especially in the wake of the pandemic and during the pandemic topic for another time there is an increase in dopamine and an increase in ceretonan it is o have an increase in well being an increase in mood but it is a very short lived increase very soon after and actually triggered by that increase is a long and slow reduction in dopamine and ceretonan and related molecules and circuits basely what you are getting is a blip of feel good followed by a long slow arc of feeling not great which is why typically people will drink again and again across the night the seething to understand about tolerance is that with tolerance the duration of that long slow reduction in dopamine and ceratonan gets even longer in other words the negative effects of alcohol that happen after the initial feeling good extend longer and in fact get more robust however there is also a reduction in the reinforcing properties of aldol there is a shrinking of the feel good blip that happens when one firsts in guess aldol this has been measured in animals and humans the first drink that somebody has provided they have enough all dehydrogenase that does not make them feel various and sick right away they feel really good and then as it wears off they feel conalausing they want to drink more they might drink more with each subsequent drink and even drinks on different nights or even different weak s the amount of dopamine that is released is reduced the amount of carton that s released is reduce what you are getting is less and less of the reenforcing properties of alcohol the feel good stuff and more and more of the punishment pain signal aspects of aldol this is the contour of chemical release in the brain that was referred to by my colleague the incredible doctor onolempki whose a medical doctor she wrote the incredible book doom nation she has guessed on this podcast on show roman's podcast on richrolls podcast and several other pockets world expert in addiction as she talked about this pleasure train balance that extends beyond alcohol to things send gamboling and to other behaviors that can potentially become addictive but certainly includes aldol tolerance it seems is a process in which people are ingesting more and more alcohol as an attempt to get that feeling of well being back but what there really getting is an extended period of punishment of pain and of malar from the aldol now you might say what how does that relate to tolerance what turns out what they do behavior and when i say they i mean animals do this an humans do this is they start drinking more and more in an attempt to activate those dopamine and siratonean neurons and receptors and as they do that there is an increase in alcohol the hydrogen the ensile that metabolizes all is increased because t the body and liver have to contend with all that alcohol now you have got again the to hitmodel you are getting less of the feel good chemicals more of the negative chemical release or pattern of of subjective feeling i should say and your metabolizing alcohol more quickly and more readily but it is not taking you to a better place an terms of how you feel that is one of the major underlying reasons for what we call tolerance if your somebody who drinks and you notice that the feeling that you are seeking with alcohol is now requiring an additional drink or drinks plural chances are you are disrupting the dopamine and seretenergic systems of your brain and you are doing that in a way that is increasing the the pain and punishment signals that follow alcohol ingestion and again that is notches on the night that your drinking but afterwards as we is that all bad news well pretty much but the good news is that if you abstain from drink from for some period of time then of course these systems reset how long you need to abstain will depend on how much you were drinking and how long you we drinking for certainly people have ore alcohol used disorder or alcoholics their rainfall should be to quit aldol completely i know there some debate about this and i do not want to get into that debate because ism certainly not om got to trying direct any one's recovery their expert o counsellors and an ends and people it good work with people in fact for some very heavy drinkers and people with serious all used disorder going cold turkey that is stopping drinking completely can a shall be medically dangerous the path o sobriety for certain people looks different than the path to sobriety for other people what i m referring to her or people that are investing again somewhere between on average one to drinks per night whether not that done night to night or whether not that condense to weekend use i know a number of people are going to ask perhaps are screaming is drinking good for me in any way for instance many people have probably heard that resveratral is good for people that red wine is en rich and resveratral i hate to break it to you but the reality is that if indeed resvorrtrll is good for us and there some debate about this some people say strongly yes some people say no other people say maybe the amount of red wine that one would have to drink in order to get enough resvertrall in order for it to be health promoting is outrageously high that it would surely induce other negative effects that would offset the pass of effects of restertral i wish i could tell you different gan on not here to be the bear of bad news but the statement i just made was confirmed by doctor davidson care when he was a guest on this pod cast s confirmed by other researchers who work on resvertralln related pathways i wish i could tell you that red wine is good for your health and indeed it might be through some other mechanisms for instar there have been studies of low to moderate red wine consumption thiwould be anywhere from one to four glasses per week and i do not mean enormous glasses i mean six ounce glasses of red wine and those cases some of the stress reduction that can be induced by consumption of red wine may be some of the other micro nutrients and components within red wines in particular red wines that come from particular grapes an this gets really wants and frankly is not well worked out in the pure reviewed literature certainly not clinical trials at least not that ism aware of tell me if you re aware of a great clinical trial in this well there may be some positive effects of that very low level of consumption ism not trying to take away anybody is red wine on a trying to i take away anybody's anything i would be remiss however if i did tell you that rests veratraoll as the argument for drinking and drink of red wine in particular is just not a good one is just not supported by the pure view research a few other things about alcohol and health the beginning of the episode i reference to study showing that indeed not just heavy alcohol consumption of twelve to twenty four or more drinks per week but also light to moderate alcohol consumption of any type wine beer spirits et camera does reduce the thickness of the brain it really does reduce cortical thickness in fact in actually scales with the amount of alcohol that people drink and this has been well documented in a number of different studies i con provide a link to several of these one of the more striking ones actually shows that there is almost a dose dependent increase in shrinkage of remoter vow lure and in these white matter tracts these a axons these wires as it wild that connect different neurons as a function of how much all people drink and that is also what is been seen in this recent study on that i reference at the beginning in that in the shownote captions again probably the best amount of alcohol to drink would be zero glasses per week or ounces per week for those are you drinking low mounts of alcohol make sure your doing other things to promote your health and for those rather drinking moderate and certainly for those of you that are heavy drinkers please a do everything you can to move away from that and quit entirely but even for the moderate consumers of alcohol you are going to wont to be aware of some of the negative halfeffects in due things to offset those if indeed you are ongoing to stop drinking or reduce your intake one of the really bad effects of alcohol but that is extremely well documented is the fact that alcohol because of this toxicity of a septal aldehyde and related pathways can alter dianamethylation and can alter genuxpression that can be many things in different tissues but it is associate with a significant increase in cancer risk in particular breast cancer and in papular because breast tissue is present both males and females but in women it is especially vulnerable to some of the dean methellation changes well breastcancser and women has a relationship to alcohol and take an all and take has a relationship to breastcancer in women in fact there has been proposed to be a anywhere from four to thirteen per cent increase in risk of breastcants or for every ten grahams of alcohol consumed how much is ten grahams well there we been to think a little bit about the variation in the mount of alcohol and different drinks across the world different countries serve different size drinks and have different concentrations of alcohol in those drinks without going down too much of a rabbit hole just giving you some good rules of thumb to work with there been studies of the percentage of all including different drinks and the sizes of different drinks that are served in different countries and heres a kind of a a patchwork of of those findings in japan one beer one glass of wine or one shot of liquor as it served there tens to include anywhere from seven to eight grahams of alcohol in the you ss one beer which generally is twelve ounces if it is an a model one glass of wine or shot of liquor tends to include a bout ten to twelve grahams of alcohol and in russia one drink of the very sorts i have just described typically will have as much as twenty four grahams of alcohol because of the differences in the concentration of alcohols and the size of of drinks that are poured in these different countries of course there other countries in the world those countries are also vitally important but those of the ones that extracted from the studies that i could find what does this mean well when wee talking about is that for every ten grams of alcohol consumed that one beer in the us ay be a little bit more than one beer in japan or basically a third of a drink in russia there is a for to thirteen percent increase in risk of cancer that is pretty outrageous right and you might think what how could it be that the stuff is even legal well look it is as i describe before it is a think it is also a toxin that people enjoy the effects of i mean in the was at least the tried prohibition on certainly did lead yes did lad to a reduction in alcohol induce health disorders in particular sorosis of the liver it also led to a lot of crime because it became a a substance that a lot of people will still wanted and that people were willing to break the law in order to provide that crisis at to cell and provide but the point is that the more alcohol people drink the greater there increase of cancer in particular breast cancer and that is because of the fact that alcohol has these effects on cells that include changes in gene expression and cancer that is the growth of tumors is a deregulation in cell cycles right a tumor is a aggregation or the proliferation aggregation if stuffsticking together by the way proliferation is stuff duplicating at proliferation aggregation of cells that could be a gliomas glee cells glioma brain tumor right to be lymphoma within the limptissue et camera the mutations that aldol induces to cause this are wide ranging some of those are stringed stare to be understood for those who either interest in cell by also just mention that the very one pathway again this is is super a specialized for the officionatos only you don't need to know this the pity one pathway seems to be unregulated and and we knew this from the discussion earlier there is a down regulation in some of the anti in lavatory molecules that help suppress the proliferation of cancers now days there is a lot of interest in the fact that the immune system is constantly combating cancers that exist in us all the time little little tumor start growing in our subsystem goes and gobbles them up little tumor star growing the man system sense is inflammation sends out these incredible cells these killers cells and tells and and and beats them up cancers proliferate and take hold and cause serious problems when the proliferation of cells exceeds the immune systems ability to gobble up and remove those cells there are other mechanisms of regulating cancers but that is one of the primary one and alcohol hits it again as a to hipmodel it increases tumor growth and it decreases the sorts of molecules that suppress and combat tumor growth again even old o moderate amounts of alcohol can be problematic for sake of cancers in particular breast cancers epidemiologist and halspecialists love to trying compare different substance is in terms of how bad they are rarely do they compare substances in terms of how good they are a but sometimes they do and what they will sometimes tell you in what you con fined in the literature is that in jesting ten to fifteen grahams of alcholday that would be one beer in the you s one glass of wine is the same as smoking ten cigarettes a day frankly it is hard to make that direct relationship really stick because its a question of you know how long people inhale do they have a predisposition to a lung cancer et camera but even if that number is off by pluserminus to cigarettes or even if that number would the equivalent of one glass of wine equals one cigarette per day i think there is general consensus now that nicotine consume by raping or by cigarette is bad for us in terms of lung cancer and other forms of cancer and for some reason i do not know why because this knowledge about alcohol and cancer in these establish relationships have been known since the late nineteen eights the first con landmark paper on this with publish in nineteen eighty seven i confide a link to that favor it's should quite interesting onto read well that relationship is there and yet we do not often hear about it i in fact in before researching this episode had hurry before that alcohol can increase cancer risk but i was not aware of just how strong that relationship is because of the serious nature of what we are talking about and because i would hate to be confusing or misleading to anybody i wanted trust emphasize that this statistic that there is a four to thirteen per cent depend on which study look at a four to thirteen per cent increase in the risk of cancer in particular breast cancer for every ten grahams of alcohol consumed that is ten grahams per day that is one drink per day but i do want to emphasize that if that et quotes to seven drinks per week and all those seven drinks are being consumed on fridge and sturdy it is still averages to ten grahams pray and i also want to emphasize that there are things that people can do to at least partially offset some of the negative effects of alcohol as it relate to predisposition to the formation of certain kinds of tumors and cancers i also on to be clear before i say it that doing the things ism about to tell you is not a guarantee that your not going to get cancer nor is it a guarantee that alcohol is not going to lead to an increased predisposition for certain kinds of cancers and the two things are consumption of bullate and other bevidements especially be twelve no that the consumption of full age and be twelve has been shown to decrease cancer risk in people that in just alcohol but not completely offset it why that is is not exact cully clear it probably has something to do with the relationship between foliate and be twelve and other be vitamins in gene regulation pathways that can lead to tumor growth some point soon we will get an expert in cancer biology and in particular in breastcancer biology on the program when we can ask hem about this but i realize this is going to raise a number of questions and may be even cause some of you to go out there and start taking foliate an other be vitamins and be twelve not incidentally a lot of the reported hang over supplements and treatments havinclude forte and be twelve i do not know if they had the cancer literature an mind when they created those supplements and and products i doubt they did alcohol really does disrupt be vitamin pathways both synthesis pathways and utilization pathways sometimes you will hero if you get your be vitamins helps you recover from from hang over more quickly again the literature does not support that but also again there are in a lot of studies but more to the point as it relates to alcohol in the formation of tumors and cancers it does appear that decreased foliate and other be videments be twelve are partially responsible for the effect of alcohol and increasing cancer risk and it does appear that consuming adequate amounts of late and be twelve might again might partially really want a bold face and underline and highly partially offset some of that increased risk there is an additional category that i want highlight of course and this is vitally important to state even thought it is obvious which is that people who are pregnant should absolutely not consume alcohol feudal alcohol centrum is well known and established its terrible meatuses experience diminished brain development that is often permanent diminished him development diminish organ development in the periphery meaning you on the hart the lungs deliver at camera insulting alcholwhal pregnant is simply a bad idea and the ease i say this at all is first of all it is important to included an episode this but also because we can look at two things first whale we can look at mechanism and the we can also look at some of the lore that still sadly exists out there let us take care of the lore that sadly exists first if you look on line you will sometimes be able to find sadly that some people believe that certain kinds of alcohol are not detrimental to fetuses they will say well champagne is safe for a pregnant mother to drink but beer is not that is absolutely categorically false alcohol is alcohol there is no evidence whatsoever that consuming certain types of alcohol is safer pafetusis than others aldol as a toxin and the reason fidalalcoll centrum exists is because the ability of that toxin to destruct cellar processes remember tumor growth and the way that aldol and accelerate tumor growth by proliferation of cells the wrong cells the ones you do not want to proliferate well all of embryonic development all of feudal development it is not the growth of a tumor it is obviously the growth of an embryo and it is done in a very orchestrated way i started offstudying brain development that is where i got my beginnings in neurobiology and i still teach embryology to medical students and graduatestudens the set of coordinated processes that has to take place from conception to birth in order to give rise to a healthy embryo is dynamically controlled and exquisitely precise with check points and recovery mechanisms and redundancy in the genes that are express to make sure that if anything goes wrong it is prepared et camera alcohol as a mutagen have not use that word yet but it substance that can mutate liana through alterations in dianamethilation and these check points in the selcycl aldol is a mutagen is one of the worst things that a developing embryo can be exposed to and again because it is water soluble and fatsolible ingestion of alcohol when people present passes right to the fetus now i realize that a number of people out there might be thinking o goodness i did realize i was pregnant until a certain stage of pregnancy and before i realize i was investing alcohol obviously one cannot undo what is been done but i want o also emphasize that feudal alcohol centrum while yes there is a full blown centrum that manifests as changes in the crank official development that are very obvious and he can look these up leprosy seen these before or the pictures before rather as to do the sparing forehead size and number of other features of the craniofacial development and of course stuffs going on in the brain to it is a long a continuum it is possible that some of the changes that occur are more miner and thankfully the young brain in particular the early post natal brain is incredibly plastic there things that can be done in order to help recoverneral circuits that in develop well et camera but even though somewhat obvious for should be obvious i really want to make clear that there zero evidence whatsoever that certain forms of alcohol are say for for pregnant women to invest an others absolutely wrong no one whose pregnant should be investing alcohol whatsoever and certainly if people feel they cannot avoid alcohol while pregnant they really need to work with somebody to make sure that it just absorb does not happen because is detrimental to the developing fetus lastly i want to talk about the effects of alcohol on hormones and i want to distinguish between low amounts of alcohol in take higher amounts of aldol an taken again this chronic alcohol in take verses vocational use versus really chronicle meaning alcoholic or alcoholic use disorder where people are drinking in sense amount on an on going basis the literature on aldol an hormones is quite extend give and there of course many many different types of hormones the hormones that mostophen yet mentioned and talked about on this podcast of the hormone's testosterone and estrogen which are present in both men and women that in both men and women are important for things libido the also responsiful for sexual development actual development of the genitalia before birth and afterbirth there responsible for instance estrogen's important for memory and cognition you never want a drop estrogen to low in men or women cause it can disrupt cognition and joint health et camera to keep this discussion relatively constrained it is fair to say that alcohol and in particular the toxic metabolites of alcohol increase the conversion of testosterone to estrogen now this occurs in a number of different tissues this is notes occurring in the testes of males as as occurring in lots of different tissues and it'll refer you to a excellent review will provided lion the shown o captions this is a paper that was publishing the year two thousand but the date are still a quite strong the journal is called of all things alcohol yes literally a journal called alcohol for the publication of data in reviews on allow its effects and the title the papers can alcohol promote a romanization of androgen to estrogens a romanization this process of the conversion of testosterone and other androgen to estrogens through things a rotates son and this is a beautiful review that described every tissue or near every tissue from the ovarian females to the placenta to the liver to the testis in which alcohol can increase the a romanization of teststrondastrgen now in females this may be part of the reason why there's an increase in estrogen related cancers bees cancer can be either estrogen related or non estrogen related their other types of estrogen relay cancers outside of bees cancer but it appears that one reason why aldol increases the riscobrescancer is because of this a romanization from of testostronscuse me to estrogen in males accelerated or abnormal conversion of testosterone estrogen conastioul lead to growth of the best tissue in males called gang comitia or other effects of high estrogen when i should say of altered testosterone estrogen ratios a that is really what is important and these can include things diminished strive a increase fat storage and a number of other things that i think most people i would find to be negative effects i once talked about the fact that drinking aldol can increased the a romanization of testosterone to estrogen i posted that on line and i did not get attacked but i did a get criticized for the fact that it has been shown yes has been shown that small amounts of aldol in questions of five grahams or of aldol in lesions o be half a reason wine or half a glass of beer at least in some studies showed increases in testosterone which was kind of surprising but i should point out other studies have shown that alcohol ingestion causes decreases in testosterone over time there is always is issue whither not your looking a study of acute exposure for sis chronic exposing one dose fires multiple doses an exposure i think it is fair to say based on my read of the literature this review and other reviews that focus more particularly on humans that regular ingestion of alcohol is going to increase estrogen levels whether not your male or female and it is largely doing that through the romanization process by increasing the romatastes ends on yes there some dose dependence but i think if you are somebody who's trying to optimize your testosterone to estrogen ratio regardless of whether not your male or female well then most certainly you are going to one to avoid drinking to much alcohol we have covered a lot of topics and data related to the mechanisms of alcohol hang over tolerance cancer risk et camera i acknowledge that i mainly talk to you about the negative effects of alcohol i want to acknowledge that many people enjoy alcohol in moderation or even light drinking the occasional drink or the occasional two drinks or maybe even on average one drink herniate o seven drinks per week ism certainly not here to tell you what to do and what not to do i do find it immensely interesting however that first of a alcohol is a known toxin to the cells of the body some of you might immediately say what wait what about hormesis what about this phenomenon were if we regularly ingestatoxon it makes us stronger in other wars what does not kill us makes u stronger that there is some reason to believe that might be beneficial in terms of some forms of cellar razilientcs maybe maybe now sorry it does not work that way there are processes of hormesis in which for instance exposing yourself safely to increases an adrenaline throughout know ice baths or other things that increase a adrenaline can raise your called stress threshold but here were talking about celery stress and damage to cells my read of the literature and again this is my reason i invite others to you know provide studies or i would prefer actually collections of studies that point in the direction if they exist that alcohol can be beneficial but my read of the literature when i should say my understanding of what i would call the center of mass of the literature on alcohol is that no consumption zero consumption consumption of zero lances of alcohol is going to be better for your health than low to moderate consumption of alcohol and that low to moderate consumption of alcohol is going to be better for you of course than moderately high to high alcohol consumption on the order of twelve to twenty four or more drinks per week i realize that for most people listening to this it is probably low to moderate alcohol consumption that is part of their standard repertoire and ism not here to give you justification for doing that normagan to tell you not to do that i would you to consider perhaps however the negative effects that we understand that our documented for instance the negative effects of alcohol on the gotmicrobiom and the things that you can do to better support your got microbic the negative effects on the stress system that h p axis that we talked about earlier in the fact that even lotomoderate levels of alcohol consumption can increase our levels of stress when we are not drinking and to think about acquiring some tools and you getting some proficiency with tools behavioral or otherwise that can help you with stress modulation that do not involve call consumption again the point here is to illustrate where the problems lie with call consumption but also what have tried to do is to point you to some resources that can help offset some of those negative effects will they offset all the effects i cannot say that for sure but certainly taking measures to offset some of the negativefects of any call consumption that you might be having your doing is going to be beneficial to you and those tools and photo calls are going to be helped promoting in any case if your learning from end er enjoying this podcast please subscribe tour our you to

became their editor the series rolled out this week and its spectacular completely original i am very excited to pay you the first instalment of the show to day on our show you can hear what its wag i defy you not to get caught up in the story the way that we a were and i with that i hand thing sort hammer for part one of the roman horse affair this my first story as a journalist i had not planned for it my last story but it probably will be given what is happened in the years have been working on this it is about my letter that surface to my city and had huge consequences for been this letter lunged four government investigations changed i national policy and ended careers it is heard some of the country's most venerable children a letter the many people whole seen it agree is ridiculous is unsigned uncaged tide it looked a serious doccommittedy just seemed comical with that is this i member looking of some timetakin onaphisis the info a was i on apartment in play you is inti me were there docking the terra lived upside down i first learned end the letter in twenty four teen i was not internist them was the doctor quit medicine living in burning i enplaned making my breakfast at on him distantly news when i heard about the discovery of a secret communicate between muster extremists they were discussing a plot tin betray i city schools and run them on strict toslomic principles bettentioly with the aim o radicalizing students some one at forwarded the later anonymously to the local government the burma city council but was missing the first and last page was unknown exactly who wrote it who they were sending it to according to the intercepted pages the plot had a cod name operation chosen horse i have toxin when this story about systems in bermingham first broke as hae most om in burmingham all alarmed it sound if possible kits cross bran across rope re flying off to heriot to join this cup call iris and burmingham has been home to quite fun terra my neighbor was a terrain the a who killed five people than tried to run into parliament with the knife he did is planning i the fly for the pertain restaurant across the street from me was not surprise watching as over the next several months operation chosen horse snowball into a huge national story a number of schools in bermingham a being infield prated by hard line i was head lines polemist plot the hardest lot alleging a conspiracy my oath and the government responded with full force schools demands the primmanistic convolved convening his cab in ham to discuss the throw is limited the national government sent in a bunch of investigators including n scotland yards form a head of counter tsarism to looking two die schools a majority was tom fairies of blamingham why i say was all very writing until a few months later when the various investigators finally start reporting their findings that found no plot called operation roman horse that seen no signs that any one had been radicalized no evidence of violence or plan violence they don't bring any terror chargers against anyone work in the schools they looked into but espy old of that does my finding no plot investigate still concluded that muscles he influence o schools in a dangerous way give my officials snapped into action things that should not have happened in our schools were alive to happen a children we expose to things they should not have bee expose the full out has been huge crime minutes ta day caterings wo that is calling a special meeting officials removed educators revamped schools and renamed them they man dated all schools in the country star teaching with that terms brutish values to make kids let susseptacle to extremes ideas they be to tritons count to extremes am lots by making public sept to workers teachers and doctors part of the states o vats operators to night when form on their cool workers and students and patients to day the providing narrative to the trona horse affair is that a mention wastes were up to not there is another very of the stor to that vision of the trona horse affair is that nothing happened that the is based round educators were settee and the nation felt for it and always seemed to me that this a simple way to finger out when ready happened the letter even with a the government inquiries no authority no the investigators e a fired out who wrote remarkably not them even tried and that to me seemed a pretty glaring overside the reason the country was looking at these schools to suspicion the reason the we investigate him at all was because this dodgy lotto showed up for trying the people who worked there as nefarious plotters claim whin they was sneaking the limit to schools a roman horse the letter is what put the idea and authority's heads i did not see how you could know what operation roman horse was or was not unless you got to the bottom of the roman horse chatter who wrote it and why a few years later i decided to go to school for investigate of journalism but my professor was not completely sold on the story i wanted to report must today project operation roman horse this was investigative journalism he wanted me to not something new not rake over some years old story as a doctor them ism familiar with the concept of a second opinion the right before my masters was set to start i went looking for one a doctor came to see me for a second opinion one night in fall twenty seventeen ism in a theater in birmingham after my my case as town came out i went around doing some cans afterwards people w sometimes come back stage to chat and the sky comes in introduces himself as hams a bird he said he was changing careers to become a reporter he was beginning a master's program and investigated journalism the next day actually and he wanted some advice he was speaking fast i might walk away at any moment to be fair i was told that had five minutes o fine read after which i be schooled out the building i did not know that anyway hammer ran through the churghon horse story for me elevator pitch style i never heard of it but a guy was with back stage a produce ring from the b b c he had and jumped in as hams was talking ye ye roman horse he said that is a big thing a while ago some bad stuff went down mule educators of ben out to know good but who is cleared up old story there was something hams as said though which afterwards i could not get out of my head he kept talking about a letter which had set off this whole cascade of consequences whose origins were still a mystery when i got home to new york i read the letter it looked a caricature of a missive between two terrorists filled with his homophobic tropes about conniving and scheming muscles it is missing pages parts of it are too dark to read i got damned in the zero's machine it instructs the recipient to destroy it after reading it struck me as a funky document for a government to take seriously especially because from what i read the government had not even looked into who wrote the letter or why there was a strange lack of curiosity about this instigating document i thought to myself seems somebody should try to figure who wrote that thing and then i thought we wait this journalism s students doing that maybe i had a give ma hand and here we are years later at the end of a dizzy fascicle and enraging investigation and which one mystery led to another led to another tracing this letters path of destruction across multiple con and defiance of many an have the officials and some a aggressive attempt to shut you wrpoian down from serial productions and the new york to ism bran w ism how tosiece presenting to you the most elaborate student project at this is the roman horse affair i got the call from bran while i was in class my phone stored ringing from a new york numb i asked my professor if i could take it he said no i asked a pocacal use it toilet he said yes i answered and bran told me he wanted in on my investigation but that would need to produce i said shell old shell it'd no idea what produce it did soon he stout ta getting in touch with missions for me

stitch up the event hash tack was roman hooks an thy were trying to clear their names they never got n their lives back on track after the story did down they lost their jobs and been made into pariah

a volunteering a working officially in schools again to hears in front of us in his office chair confident erudite framed by his bookshelf filled with taxes about his lam and brutish history i pull a copy of the letter out of my back pack the is are completely anonymous letter undated the claiming that there is a plot too take over and islamizes the schools in bermingham led by thahelalam which is myself but i spent from a a vantage point were i actually know the truth i know the reality to here denies being an extremest he denyhis engineering a plot he says the reality is that rather than corrupting schools as a radical conspirator he a first generation immigrant from a poor pack standing family was responsible for one of the most miraculous school turn around in brutish education until he says the letter arrived and destroyed him the story of this turn round its not a secret it is one the her shad with tennis before both has done a much good and tells a wearing his name but this back story does explain why the brogan horselatout was persuasive because the her told us some of what was in that letter was true the hare begins the story one night in nineteen ninety three when he is watching to and a shows attention i just happened to be a lying on the shophar real and the program came on it's documentary part of the b b c series panorama nine times out a ten i would

facts emerge the present to reports the paisano museums are incarcerated at this proportioning high rates she says that some of the highest rates of joblessness the suffering from devastating held the shoes terrible housing domestic violence with one under lying course of it all a lack of education this the number i fin was shocking by twenty per sent to while students would leaving school without any qualifications meaning they fell to pass the exams the would essentially be the equivalent of a high school diploma in the us and that rate twenty per cent was roughly the same for most people of coloreds well but for parkestanes in barngladations and astonishing fifty per cent ho no qualifications whatsoever fifty per cent half of us were basically hiding school that hit the here hard that the extent of education failure was a bad that we were at scoff creating and under class of museums who were basing the uneducated prone to crime in in employment can of sat there n i it made me feel guilty actually guilt because i was one of the few people who made it from my family one of the first ones to make it into a an to university and to have a good job and on but they was also a sense of humiliation really because i was from this community the here is family going to inland in the seventies when lots of people from dismay would moving here largely because the brach designed his huge dam the flooded swat of land and displace tens of thousands of people a one solution the blitz got behind was to invite displace martinis over to inland the could improve the brash economy by working en brach factories and mills which is what the heres that did there arrived in inland as a nine year old would not speak any english and would ha become fluent for several years i knew one word of english only which was f o a see i me i do not know exist aid by no salary that is it i can really i could not speak an english one's came here i any speak ford out is likemute it in forbore that is what i knew football last that ye arrived here and the first school when i came here wee we i is growing up angry and andianated from white society now they here watched as the documentary captured the next generation baking kids who a morning brain being educate in state schools still struggling to read not able to record basic english words the camera out to park in bamingham it looked at the here word and park which right across from what he went to school in an a mark i recognized the park because used to go and play there and then i saw some children as at all that is our neighbors children i recognized the kids yer even those from a distance but i recognized who the ids are we fondant in canter with taxation lads in a park in a muslin quarter of burning these alien lads we use agent to mean situation by the way the shipping school and the here new which school they were skipping is one he would gone to as a kid it next at a park parked school another majority was some school with miserable academic results it is a secondary school age is eleven to sixteen is a school wet the here had done well enough to make it to college and the university before getting a good job in ten communications document to made him realize how rare his success was and how little he done with it the here decided do something he started a tutoring program for kids in the neighborhood for when he was really interested in was volunteering at his old school parked and what is known as their governing body in inland a governing body oversees house schools run a corporate board does a company its sorter a schoolyard in e you ask accepted specific to one school they can have a lot of influence any way here says one afternoon a couple of party parents he did not know nocked on is more we hear interesting becoming governor they said it was why read of mind though actually to hear a been talking about wanting to be a governor of a recent wedding and s parents out wind it w resentment and frustration ad been festering for years among parents an you dark who been trying and trying to get the authorities to do something about the dismal schools the parents at the hearts door had join the park for governing body in an attempt to make a change but they did not speak fluent english and had not gone university to her was a professional with the degree who still lived in the neighborhood we loved to propose they told him and with that to hear found himself at the next governing body meeting of parked school being voted in not only as a member but as the chair that is when i became a governor on the seventh of canary nineteen nineteen seven he remember the date ye a what i was a was to remain there for eighteen years when to her started parked was one of the worst secondary schools in the country only four percent of students were passing four per cent the national school inspection agency had recently placed the school into special measures the lowest possible ranking and emergency starts basically meeting parky was in danger of being shut down there were brawls breaking out in the school yard on a toward the building t hear saw vandalized bath rooms with stalls missing locks and toilets missing seats but were to hear really trained is focus was on the complacent teachers and administrators we initially just startled by saying that o is y children should be achieving fire though the achievement was not acceptable and the fact that the school was to blame for for the failure this statement obvious to to hear that the kids and alarm each were his capable kids anywhere was met with massive resistant e was very difficultetting the school to accept the they were the problem people did not want to accept that because they were that that they been blaming the community full an may be try decades they had such a low expectation of children one thing to hear noticed urban was that the staff of this school with nearly ninety per cent packastany students had only one full time packastany muslin teacher to here began searching for more mole staff and governors he gave presentations held work shops he became a fixture at events surround spirting hem standing behind his little table or booth e evangelizing for people to get involved in their local schools i lofty a ha ha i loved i i the children the is e i felt as i could make a difference this is mas who saying the first mole teacher to hear hired he taught mast i could use my languid age my background wandestanding were they come from to make a difference i knew their families mascon point to ha specific moment by the way when he decided to go in to teaching there is a anemone program i called an under classing pot of the powerful segment mas wo saying says from the very beginning he encounter zeros prejudices among the most y white staff i a group the childrenlone to me and the see that lilies one teacher in school he always calls us packed he sees collins packeesis to g in the joke way but we find the offensive then i would tell any one else with the telling me that look the these sweating acts that is as let in any context but especially shocking for a teacher to say to packsany students model dam i think the best thing to do happy parents it the school he talked this to the precedes for doing them in case the parents didst know he says eventually the school looked in to the teachers behavior and while you investigating a he designed and he gave the final leaving speech n the staff room angels he should be anal who domino in the school not the kits and finish off with the words the west is the best and old teaches craft old teaches cleft the racism was pervasive rosin fears a former governor and math teacher say it one of his first governing body meetings he was shown a list of places the students had been given work placements through a program at the school and it was all restaurants supermarkets clothing stores and it was no e are doctor sere alophamo anything that and i did in how is it that that did the children designed these and was on says the vice chair told him well the apparent want them to going become doctor an engineers an e centra u realities these kids will become exedra is shop keepers we have on to prepare them now and for a good while i was struggling to process what he was saying this is me a brown person an muslin and he saying to me that they deserve to have these kind of jobs this is this communities robin society ais that is ray we just file the kids we just file the kids and did e feel about about it didn't the we didn't w i li feel nosy john bracelet was one of the non muslin teachers at preview he was a teacher who would reenter since the ladies he was frank with us about the bigotry that he and his colleagues hell towards the students and their families an we we we we that we were a superior cute and we look down we look down and these people who did not know about education your tucking to yourself here soon about myself almost out talking about on a many of the people a always the teachers attitudes are documented by the way a former head teacher of preview a head teacher is what we america call a principal did a masters thesis while he was at the school for which he collected opinions from the staff including from john as to we muscle children were drastically under performing compared to their peers in the thesis teachers say the kids parents are ignorant wrongly claim the students tod speak english the teachers try for a while on teacher said but end of feeling who gives a dam that is a quote it makes john cringe to think back on it the say when move wiles from the situation that the e tom you can realize o l for the is i do not only think about about the think is am it is to embarrassing once we created the shift in the belief of the teachers then ti job became much easier the says by thirty two thousands preview was changing the school began taking basic but transformation steps setting individualism to cave men tits for each student the followed them from get year a prepares students for qualifying same which amazingly had not happen for schoolstart of woods trophies for got barks by parent toe ceremonies when they kids did well thee vent to governors hide a new head teacher an almost to one from gill school who embraced parkfews new aspirations tescostard to rise student heading to cottage party's reputation was dining around but the other changes the herentytues a preview which later officials would pe us suspect change then investigate us wot point to the trade marks operation trocar horse it is coming up indeed it is when hams and graham return that is in a minute the ciao to bagradio when our program continuous this medical mi from or glass to day on our program we are playing part one of the news pad case from our sister company serial productions shall as called the roman horse affair and we pick up with brannomsa where they left off you do not get label the leader of an extremist conspiracy simply by raising tescoresthat your neighborhood secondary school the main accusation against to her alarm the overarching assertion of the roman horse letter which the government supported and which is defined to hear his reputations since then is that he was itemizing schools this is not a word am particularly fond of islamize because is the miss an relation of what some assumed non atomic base line has this story been insomized by harass involvement yes it is a word that is not inherently negative but gets used that way any way that is what the letter said to here was doing is lo mining schools and finally enough it is also what the her says he was doing we were valuing the cultural and the faith background of the children and we were lying that to be express if you we hated for children they could perform there in a daytime prayers if they wanted to a we made ta prayer facility available for them in a room religious accommodations this are legal and brutish schools by the way whether there explicitly designated as a religious school and i which park few was not it was the equivalent of a regular public school in the yours and since ninety at per send o the children happened to be of these looming faith background we obviously a caring for the constituency that the school serve in mine with the regulatory a requirements here described to an educational philosophy that the way he and other parked staff talk about it reminds me of aero centric or black excellent schools in the yours that students would do better academically when there schools in corporate and cerebra who they are and there is research of backs us up under to her's leadership parked allowed students to pray if they wanted they install facilities for rode the ablutions you do before prayers they celebrated roman and altered the schedule during that month to fajita fasting they serve to was food and i felt that i know this was or school on we were proud to say that this is our school we wanted our children to say that this was their school and that they were proud of it in the was of the trove o horsehair government officials would declare that the way the her in his colleagues for running parky school i under mind coon call brutish values hat they were limiting the children ability to thrive an modern bring which an interesting charge to bring against the her because i have to say i have not jersey met in english okay more confident that he is brutish than the her deciding whether not to noise o brush as a for and personal thing for us speak for myself even though i came to inland when i was eight and became a brush citizen with the brush passion even though i have a brush education when to briishin university work for brain's national help service i don't call myself brush was never riches about nationality i do not readecare why i was called but sore it'd also picked up on he subliminal messaging that in order to be proper brutish you had to be white the hare on the other hand no only calls himself brutish but the proudly i got to talking to the hare by this one day he and bran and i were gan tee a my favorite the shop on on a mark road this is the hang out as we sat outside in one of the main thoroughfares of a comic plan or on t corner from the the her group but double take a busses passing by sweet shops and fabric stores and lark chippies i told thing my reason for why it find only recently sit cooling myself brutish for longtime i never cold that bra as about there i been ring a book about the brutish empire and i learnt how rich india which at the time in glue pakistan was according semeconomist before the rich took control believes this this i is a roughly a an chop aby tweeny for per sent us a at after words economy at the time tree present o worlds action time i real us nation in the world why twenty for per cent of the worlds economy is roughly what the mesh controls to day i know this is somewhat of an apples and oranges comparison because the world was not organized into a goblin economy back then but it does show how rich india was and relation to other countries at the time when the brutish left the indies of continent after some two hundred years of economic exploitation india parks ton ore among the poorest nations in the world i don't learned the stuff in school because bro's colonization of a carter of the planet is not compose part of the national coricadem which why i only discovered as an told i much to the wealth a seen bra n was actually extracted from the place i come from eyes at from that one own ta anti what as a rich i was as to hm brace i own this country is i my money with which you raise everything around me yeas of the army us very similar to the position i am arrived at except for me proclaiming on brach somewhat a finger in the eye they here it is sincere it also came to him nature in life he says how's an event held by brach must em organization n they began saying very lily you never going back to octan hour children an ever going to move back i slogan is gonna happen that is was i wen think it a that pay ut because our parents spoke that to us our homes an partan the a botany pat apparent spoke to us tat my father never told me we are brutish because that is not why you feel you be loved in poke most of his like why would you say that the people at this event was saying you live here now we were part of this country and that it was important as mustlims we should been benefit to this country ever since then i been kind of this sing the idea that we are other that we are outside us that we do not belong here i son is part of brain is do not alien i do not accept that an you see this is why you knot off the here not only was in cooperating slam into school and academic strategy it was also of brutish value it was very nicely wot during a tan dining a home an a mi schools a li i do n ani to have a different life as a when in if find if i pain a how when a peas old as a i these are two students who graduated from parks to you in twenty fourteen when i using their names because such is the stink of the churchman horse scandal they dow not potential employers to know where they went to school they actually keep it off their resides when hams and i met them four years after they graduated they were both siding law university some of the first in their families to go on to higher education they been best friends since school the kind of friend ho do not need words to communicate as yet i i tent this aha i e i the this the the students told us about these assemblies they would have in the mornings which included religious teachings and sometimes prayer they i i this is something that has an america made me do a double take when i first heard about it they idea of teachers an a public school leading prayers during in assembly is not normal to us but in brain there is no separation between church an state the queen is head of both not only is prayer aloud in schools some form of worship is legally mandated in all schools that are publicly funded schools do not always adhere to this but students are spoke to take part and was called the daily act one collective worship by fall it spot to be broadly christian and character but schools can applied ta change it to other faiths if that better suits her students which is what partner did it got approval for its worship to be his logic the students told us at parties assemblies they would did the main hall and a teacher would tell parables or lessons usually from his warm by other faiths to do you get member actually learning things in the assemblies are did they make you think over they just an a boring teachers bob above ablating n i re ireintra as anis because om i did not lean this from anyway ti they still remember this one assembly all these years later about charity mu i can they say when your giving hire to yo put your hand in your pocket and take to do not a how much you give in just put it in do not count why you given in what you have life beat when you give you receive a tenfold here at cuts wat my kuppulto you likely sometimes that i see little is as ingot thinks that i for while it ma ow a i a a a a the cardiac l i i a is ti a an an a li win cat lily said it that i ta ye i hae something you left hand as tat you a we your i hand gave here what the hare became chair of pages goinbody in nineteen ninety seven four present if students for passing by twenty ten that number was seventy one per cent a seventeenfold increase we have not changed the children we had not changed the parents but slowly but surely we took the results for the they were consistently in the seventies which means the school actually is kind of guaranteeing and outcome bark was now actively preparing its student for the eventuality tat their academic success would leave them out of see birmingham something that i lie to said to me you live in above again the former party students a another like was the e lives in in tan comes you got at ass your very same you do not know what i like simply branch i remember we lean about the population in how its divided into and and a the he was something to mesa on the population in this alien an o as that wo dit to the say o as a t a a are a li everybody i was it w i coma less i proud i a a o a o pad the cases actually two person parasang seven present avion but point being there was a vastmacharty the population that these students and the classmates were not bumping into dato day in alamrark the school organized visits to cartridge in o varsity they took them on camping trips the visited the houses of parliament an onion some soon as one an a week on trip on a still with citron all over including anon to white kits e we we were used to mingling we people who would not pack standing they were exposing us too guide a c mi i a to baric we for you get parents climax to get their kits to park view the school had a waiting list we were you have given all kinds of accolades nationally in the press we had officials coming in in and but of or school really the same what your doing perhaps we can learn something and they invited us actually that why do not you support o the

some people may not be of her it that he said if fer sea easy relevant to me that their problem an two hasn't in twelve part you received the ultima of validation what was probably ts proudest moment in the heres nearly eighteen yeas there offs that arrived for an inspection and deemed the school out standing the highest writing possible among the many things inspect of praise depart or you bit the quit while range of opportunities for sort to a development including voluntary fridge prayers in his time as cero governors the hare had taken part you from the lowest ranking the huge of close to the very top the parson in charge o stead chief inspector said quote every school in the country should be this less than two years later on nonmember twenty seventh twenty thirteen an envelope arrived on the desk of the leader of birmingham cite council a man named sir alert bore inside was a cover sheet addressed to him marked very important confidential mister bore it said this later was found when i was clearing my bosses files and i think you should be aware that i am shocked at what your officers are doing you have seven days to investigate this matter after which it will be sent to a national newspaper who i am sure will treat it seriously sincerely a n anonymous presumably behind that note was the roman horse letter four poorly copied pages shadows at the edges instructions to destroy after reading the letter was written as if from a collaborator of to hears describing a conspiracy to here had been running to take over and islemiz schools by deception it took weeks for to hear to learn about it he heard rumors there was a mysterious letter making its way around birmingham around the city council in to head teachers in town which named him as the orchestrator of a plot one of to hear his friends rush to his house to tell him that had been getting a hair cut over on washroom heath road and after wards his friend's barber had beckoned him into the back room in the shop and showed him a copy to hear did not know what to make of it finally he got hold of the document himself you obviously i was thinking what is the source of this letter who wrote this letter why was this letter written is most ringing in my head the front page was missing there was no dear whoever it distracted as if that been going on for a page or more ready and the letter ended mid sentence too with the phrase i would also there is no sign off which meant to hear could not tell exactly who was pose to be two or from but whoever wrote the letter said explicitly to here and i i supposed to be from somebody who knows me well in bermingham and he is talking to somebody in bradfond another brutish city that is home to a lot of museums he is talking about to here what he is done here we can do over the an he is your friend or your yes foci who have whoever it is yer can you keep reading just the first few paragraphs o he operation brogan horse has been carefully thought through and is tried and tested within bermingham to here and i would be happy to sport your efforts in bredfort this is a long turn plan and one which we are shore we lead to great success in taking over number of schools and insuring that they are one on the strict is comic principles in bermingham the benefits the main tactic of operation roman horse is to target head teachers at the schools you want to take control of to make their lives miserable that tell resign or else be fired at which point you can install your own people who will implant illogic extremism in the school the author gives several examples of schools in birding and were to hear in his cronies were supposedly in the middle of doing this we have caused a great amount of organized disruption in birmingham the letter says and are on the way to getting rid of more head teachers and taking over their schools while sometimes the practices we use may not seem the correct way to do things you must remember that this is a jehad and as such using all means possible to win the war is acceptable what was your feeling are your attitude were you laughing at it were you actually kind of taking it seriously and frightened what waning then can i i was not laughing actually because i knew the serious nature of the allegations that were being made but as far as the claims does the themselves are concerned they were laughable i knew that there was something not right what was going on here to her contact of the burning ham city council were the letter was first sent he done training for them for years in as it look i work for you and this letter apparently going around play mind certain things and ism surprised that you have not spoken to me to at least to get my view on the matter at least ask me to explain all if i know anything or whatever something and the gentlemen there actually from this city council he said mister lam to be to be very honestly you we do not think anything of the letter we think it is a completely bots i hokes letter and were we do not believe there is any truth in it and therefore we did not take any action we did not do anything with it did you feel reassured by that or and not really know because then the letter began to be printed in the national media as well some one leek the letter to the sundae times of onion and from there it became friend one story an t to tanddosins in at tell telegraph spectate ski the many of them giving creates to the letter saying the extremeistic to here had liege inform treating you car schools for years report is camp outside part view this do not t here don the street we tried to put these allegations to the academies chair of governors but to hey ala timed about his house we misterlam mister la the given went gictinto cate to investigate tho sword park vie ousted the school inspector arrived wot two surprise inspections and then we had the education from thegagency investigation which was about tends i thing they were in there for ten days and soon as they left we had the prom you see price worth house coopers a big outside ordzingfim looking into the financialist affairs of the school then we have them a for for five weeks in the school as wen a said what are you looking for a id ply what are you looking for you being here three weeks you must have a family there was more the secretary of state for education called in eland's former counter terror chief from scotland yard a man named peter clerk and the burning ham city council appointed its own special investigator and they scrutinized park view along the twenty some to other schools and muslin neighborhoods in the middle of the mayday some politicians and journalist were saying that the letter itself was likely a hooks there was some obvious factual and accuracies yet the government believed it still warranted this action honestly i do not think any authority explain this logic with much clarity at the time but my understanding of how the thinking went as it even if the letter itself was not an actual community between two real life conspirators it could still be pointing at a real problem even if it was fiction the thinking went the letter could have been fabricated by some one who had legitimate concerns about muscle extremists scheming and wielding influence in schools and maybe the letter was their creative way of raising an alarm rather than look into who wrote the letter and why instead the government put out general public cauls for information about these schools and people started coming forward mostly anonymously with come plaints again investigators found no evidence of radicalization no evidence of violent extremism and no plot what emerged instead was a panic ran bag of is lot adjacent allegations many of the same things authorities had celebrated up to that point but apparently now were seeing in a different light these educators were not merely allowing students to pray they were pressuring them to pray they were not innocently recruiting around muslin staff they were hiring their buddies who thought the same way as they did and possibly discriminating against nonmuslem candidates in the process school governors including to hear they were not holding head teachers to a high standard they were pressuring them harassing them and exercising more power than a governor was posed to investigators also said they would found instances of intolerance towards else biticupeople and unequal treatment of women and girls they said parkfiew id held assemblies and invited speakers with anti western views and that the hear and people alined with him a legally subscribed to quote and in tolerant and politicized form of extreme social conservatism that claims to represent and ultimately seeks to control all museums all of this at the then secretary of state for education put it tat she presented the findings on the charge in horse letter to parliaments went that students instead of enjoying broadening and enriching experience in school young people are having that prisons narrate an holding denied opportunity to flare in a mort to to couchoverson it is but is reason and with deep sense of injustice and sadness that to day we are touch are intention to resign our positions a you education of trust an ala you members to humorous possibility after months of scrutiny and early jury twenty for teen to hear looking tired and stressed stood elector outside parkvewscates and resigned to here told us he and the other parked governors only agreed to do that because the department for education promise that the head teacher and other on the ground leadership of the school would be kept in place but was sooner a school opened in september all of those people was suspended all the leadership was spastic resect ruthlessly they went about destroy the care is destroying the reputations and they did that systematic we had worked for ten fifteen years rely to build this school they destroyed it within months the government rename the school it is no longer park view it also notified nearly every teacher in governor you just heard from to here included that was bringing proceedings to band them from education for the rest of their lives in the years since student achievement has plummeted at the school formerly known as park view from more than seventy per cent passing two in recent years from the low forty to mid fifty per cent range are story the head told us that fast meeting and its makeshift token room that this letter which is never foot investigated that described a plot call operation trogon horse which never found to give existed inspired old of this the trying of careers and an educational movement the famongring had lines against must is that continued to distal the government instituting policies that encrust despite brazen own each other we been told him with the her for a couple of hours by this point the time

probably hooks that's never seemed to matter wet the customs in bermingam were conspiring or not does not matter theintimation at their work has persevered to the extent the pianist as former chief staff was outrage that some people in a community center would dad say otherwise but we do not need to sell for a social fact because they are actual facts why up to this point has no one cared about who wrote this letter and where this letter came from when that is my question that is mi my sty what have been arguing this is why i went to the police to see what they could to this is what i said wrote in my letter to the burbingham city council that you need to get to the bottom of who wrote the letter this is what i wrote to the department of education as well you need to get to the bottom of the letter who wrote the letter because the we than unravel why the letter was written you see this is what have been arguing but the payment f education is not interested the police are not interested the burial city council is not interested in answering that question why because they have used this letter and on this hokes they have built much policy do you think now they want to launch an investigation in to the letter to have it proven that he was written for completely different reasons yer how would that make them look but your monkeys as have been sain if you could just

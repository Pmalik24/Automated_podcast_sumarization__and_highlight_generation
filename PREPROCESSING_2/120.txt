the bi administration uses medical to cram down pricing own drug companiswell claiming relations but the law of unintended consequences is undefeated the national archives reveals there are fifty four hundredemals from jobidon using duodenums and hurricane italic prepares to make landfall ism benshpiro this is the bench pro show to day so sponsor express vie can you lecture by sister being seen in sold the advertisers now ma neither at express we can right out express be piandacoms flashes upon old saw in politics there is no such thing as a free lunch well apparently there lot of people out that who believe there is such a thing as free medicine and the way that they are basely macnicases is that big farm in the united states makes a lot of money now there re lot of problems with big farm for sure there are drugs there really not great for people that are marketed as though they are amazing for people a the most obvious example being oyconton but it is also true that every single drug you take was developed by big farm everysongal medicine you take was developed by big farm big farmers responsible for oxygen her all responsible for deal he big farm is responsible for the earn vexing that you did not want to take big farm is also responsible for all of the keep mot there medications the a mother is taking big farm is responsible for all of those thing in the medical advances in the united states have led to a tremendous expansion of life expectancy in the united states the the fives er canter survivalrate in the united states is much higher than anywhere else on earth the reason being we had better medicines than anywhere else on earth it also happens to be the we develop a huge number of medical patent right here in the united states will the reason for that is because the united states when it comes to drug pricing is maybe the last country on earth that actively allows patients and doctors to by drugs at the price big warmup is selling the drugs at as supposed to using the government to cram down particular rising now this been of bugaboo for a lot of politicians because they look at canada or they look at germany or they look at rope or any place else on earth and they say what their buying those america drugs for far less than we are pang for those america drugs this is what led yesterday the biding administration to through the in elation reduction act that in nothing to d with inflation reduction at all it turns out the preach the entire thing was about giving away money for green boon goggles and also apparently screwing up the drug markets yesterday the us government name ten drugs tat will be subject to the first ever price negotiations by medical taking ailment from the most widely used and castle's medico's in the country according to the waltzer journal at stake is arguably the governments strongest effort dates to tackle high drug costs if drug makers captprswat course to scuttle the negotiating powers that medicare was granted last year on the list of garlanded medicines announced by the by administrations whose d our treatments for cancer diabetes an hertzes that can cost tens of thousands of dollars a year or more including t the blood a thinner eloquent and diabetes treatment guardians medical spent five a fifty point i billion dollars on those drugs last year according to up organ chase the ten drugs include many drugs fighting diabetes is anarthrightis drug from actin called and brigleton the list there their siriasis drug from johns and johns stay us vena a health polity professor at vanderbill university school o medical that is a major step toward reducing drug spending and of course jobidon is very excited soul all this he says we pay way more for prescription drugs than any other economy on the world in in the world and here he was yesterday explaining that if it sold in chico your paying more money than if you are buying it in pronto or parts o copinmar hard mariner chico oo phone i cay well that is true but the reason that that is true is because basically the united states has loud a bunch of other countries to free ride off the prices than america are paying what exactly would the downs from effects of this according the waster journal the positive down stream facts would be lower prices those would take affect in twenty twenty six medicaid would save estimate a twenty fie billion dollars a year by twenty thirty one the savings women mostly go to medicare because it pays the bulk of the cost of the drugs the reductions would not directly affect the price patients pay at the fantasy counter but the price cutswould have an indirect impact ion people spending medical plans to use the savings to put a two thousand dollar angel cap and how much member's have to pay out of pocket for drugs starting in twenty twenty fives tut towns again unalloyed good right everything is grate it is oust there is only one problem which is the medical innovation in the united states about to crater and when the government can cram down pricing an any particular area and remove the profit margin from the from the actual pricing mechanism that means people are not going to invests the kinds o money that are necessary in order create the drugs in the first place in the same way that rent control decreases people building and constructing because with you build a new apartment knowing there is no profit in it the investment in the by text were it's going to utterly dry up if the government veamedicair continues to cram down policies this one by the way the policy itself is absolutely wild an mean the way that they are cramming this thing down is that they go to the company's that the medicaid goes to the companies the produce the drugs and then they tell them that they are now going to be subjected two this serve arbitrary choice where they where they pick your drug out of line up an they same from now on we are going to cram down a price on you the same can only select drugs had been the market for a certain period of time for instance a small molecule drug a product an piliform span must have ben on the market for nine year's a more to be negotiation eligible a by logic drug if acseenorgin thereby must have ben marketed for thirteen years or more for elite ability they're a couple of exemptions the drug makers can use they cons that they're small dialect than they manufacture one drug or by logic drugs hat have a high likelihood of getting by a similar competition within a couple of years on list there is no rest to cram down the price there is gone to be somebody win velvpsage ceric but the this the start of the negotiation process basically they're notified by medicaid that they are now subject to a price cram down and they have to decide then whether to enter into talks if they choose not to they would then face an excite tacks skating up to ninety five per cent ninety five per cents they they would still beagle to sell the drug to medical bout medical would then playback the the power the father government ninety five per cent ninety five per cent of any income from that drug or theywoud have to leave medicare or medicate all together which by the way does not help patients on medical or medicate a whole hell of lot a suing drug companies than enter into the talks the final legotiatorate on the first sent drugs supplies to the farms counter starting canary first went twenties what is the downs from effect of all this will here is the thing that people are not seeing to develop a drug yes your going at the drug you see it come across the count a you woo look at the sticker shock on that thing that is and does not cost near that much to produce the drug the amount of money that is put in a in d on drugs is insane i mean totally crazy i know this because i personally in vest in booted companies the amount of money that is sunk in to by ten to develop a working drug is totally crazy and i promise you you are me the prophet margin from these companies there's just be less investment in the were drugs that would been produced just will mot be produce it'll get to more on this in just one second first i want a talk you about dailywars most trust priest pardner in for mere sponsor of this show expressive v in we are living in the era of turned the internet is to the frontier of a battle for

comes down we've to see the downs from effects the price's on those drugs will indeed come down it is the drugs that will never be developed that are the unintended consequences in twenty nineteen alone the farmer critical industry spent eighty three billycan dollars since twenty nineteen high three billion on a and respiration development according to one twenty twenty study which covered six hundred thirty two neither applied drugs and biologic agents approve by the f t the estimated median capitalized re search and development cost per product was nine hundred eighty five million dollars counting expenditures on file trials which should count because the vastmajority of drugs get are originally developed never make to market some train eighty five and ninety per cent of all drugs that enter cases one test no never make it through f ta approval process but they cost a wat o money s that means that for every drug hat actually hits the market and it is not that men drugs every year it hun ma i doeskin couple does not drugs hiding the market eerier it is costing almost to billion by some estimates som recon one point the and two point four billion dollars a year two develop each one of the what to one going change to point for billion dollars to develop each one of those drugs that is ho much money these companies have to spend up fronts to even develop a working drug how to the make that money back what makes a profitable why would they spend one point to reach to point for billion dollars ism cretin a drug or risk hundreds millions of dollars on drugs that aren't t ever going to make it out of face three well the reason is because on the other end there have to be some sorts of way to earn back that money now america do bear the grunts the cost because other countries are free writing we also capture the industry upside it used to be in the nineteen seventies that a huge per sextant or drugsirecture developed in rope to day a huge per senator drugs redeveloped in the united states according to one twenty ten study the united states account end for forty two per cents of prescription drug spending and forty per cents of total getup among enervator countries an was responsible for forty three point seven per cent of what are called n m es new molecular entities according to the belay the bear of later statistics the farm critical an venison manufacturing industries responsible marabout three hundred thirty two thousand jobs in the united states not iota big business and to big business because there is actual freedom of pricing in the united states to what exactly would happen if medicare gets away with cramming down this pricing structure according to national views jeffsimeari drug development wouldrop off and that's not a goring gamins going to s b o the congressional budget office has predicted the scheme provided for under the inflation reduction acts would lead to a manufacture revenue loss of fifteen per cent such a cut and secedes predicted forty five new drugs per year which you just round seven few a drugs per year that means a hundred and twenty one drugs lost over in eighteen year time horizon as one report estimated which drugs to be most likely to disappear the drugs most likely dispirit action be the ones that are for rare conditions right the ones that have less of a profit margin to begin with those drugs wore just go away seen forget about drugs being develops for the rare condition the our mother just got diagnose but those just not going to be in the market any more because who the he's going to develop then if there's no money on the other end there is another solution of this by the way that solution be to a restively make other countries pay their far share when it comes to america medication we cold use every leaver our disposal in words do that and this is where a trade war would actually be somewhat useful saying to candida or saying to the national health service guys are going to pay a medical companies what we here in the united states pay and we are going to use the leavers at our disposal in order to make that happen that would be well worth while he is right now basically america is subsidizing the rest of the world when it comes to drug creation but the solution to that is not for america government to then cram down a pricing mechanism on the big farm a companies and the drug companies and medicine companies whet when you do that you just get rid of all the invitation imagine first second if the united states in any other industry decide that rugescin a racket down cost suppose it government cost on any other air of america life i take the taxector or or take the financial sector ride skin a racket up taxation and were going to do in order to lower supposedly the cost o the america tax packages can attack that reticular sector what due think happens people flee the innovation goes away this is simple supplying demand kind of stuff when you get rid of the profit margin in particular product line there is less innovation there is less investment in that area it is very simple but yourbide does not care about that he cares about the top line look that he is bringing down cost the lostonovation is of no consequence to him whatsoever because when it comes to bide comics second order thinking is completely irrelevant it is all first order thinking i do not the price that drug therefore i will use government to cram down o new price on that drug sure means that a bunch of drugs aren't con participate medical you've stunned have get them over the counter sure it means that you are going to lose the invasion by these companies or have them base themselves somewhere else but at least you will feel good about having supposedly brought down the cost by the way democrat's care about the cost of metical sit is since when a democrats care about the costometicar they on en restructure medical medicate social security which represent sixty six per cent of the america mandatory budget every year any time anybody mentions maybe should restructure those programs in order to lower the cost thought none an not the cantuchit parent the only way to touch et is to confiscate money and innovation from the private sector genius ideas went to another genius idea that is going under the rate a and is being crammed down by the biding a ministration the the national labor relations board in just one second first it can be very tough you maintain a healthy lifestyle with the busy schedule ism pretty busy and hive another problem i have vegetables that they are bad but i still need the nutrition to be gotten from vegetables balance of nature fruits in veges or great way to make sure you are getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day through balance of natures advance cold packing process the fitments of minerals and vital nutrients of the fruits in veggies ore preserve you'd get that vital nutrition in each capsid balance of nature is a whole flat supplement nth no additive fillers extract synthetics pesticide ore ad ad sugar the only thing their capsids the pure fruits and t e veges the stuff hounded balance of nature sin t bunch that product at down to the studio it is covers i'vebeen taking it it is great and it is very very useful ism joined by other members of the dailywarestaff in taking balance of nature it may be keeping our company running the point i was really excited to find out as i say that the product is certified cover if you are a occur keeper than it is good for you but to balance of nature d to come use protocol should pure for forty per cents off your first order as a preferred customer that is balance of nature dot come promocochr pure get forty per cents off your first preferred order again balance nature o come promococh girl forty per cents off your first preferred or locates of the other big move the bid administration has made over the course of last week is going completely in noticed and it is going to utterly rack a huge number of industries what exactly is this big move well the national labor relations board and ism an to say it up front because they have actually come aft from is mane jokes about them ism not getting they literally sent us ha letter because i won it's made a joke about my employes and unions we aby by all laws and regulations here at dailywar also the national labor relations words a joke and garbage institution that shouldn't be a part of america government it is effectively speaking a tool of organized labor against the america tax pair and the worker and businesses that is what it is the analarby is a blot on america life we by by all file laws an regulations here daily ware o case with all that is at i to keep saying it over and over because the fa acoustic and alary literal if you make a joke the literally will launch an investigation into you requiring you to obtain a layer to explain what a joke is is a thing that that then just haven to details given to ben dominate over the federals to tame do bunch o people these dolts over the an alary or union base socialist they they they have decided they have now issue a decision in the case called sex construction material specific they bounce the new frame work for determining one employers are require to bargain with unions without a representation election ' normally you would have have representation election right you have your entire base of your employs vote on whether i form a union or not now ism not even in favor of that i think the national labor relations act is ridiculous on its face if employee wish to unionize then by all means go ahead and unionize but that means the you have to get all the employs to be part of the union not by voting in majority but by getting i to actually join the union if i do not wish to join union i wish to independently negotiate my salary with the employer that should e my prerogative and free country i shouldn't be forced to join a union just to is a majority of my employes well of my fellow employs which to join a union what ism better at my job than they are what if ism willing to work for less beaks any to money what that their bunch of reasons why you might not want a then union which as presumably we in then membership in the united states is dropped to oaf small fraction of what it once was union membership in the private section in the united states is now what seven percent something that there is a reason for that i'secause unions were not doing their jobs there is bankrupting the companies that they were siphoning money away from in any case many of these unions no cotton h they would have representation election they've the end of the the national labor relations act posit is that if a majority of members of your employ e base vote to form a union you then by law must negotiate with the union again as this say that is ridiculous you should be able to say in wish negotiate with the union and ism sorry if i lose them those employs with their other employs out there but that is out the national labor relations acts as we by by a laws and regulations here the dailyware o case here is what they foreknowing now at least these take to hold an election these to have to actually haven election now the national labor relations board i saying the opposite they say the new frame work effect will both effectuate employs right to bargain tho representatives of their own choosing and improve the fairness and integrity of for conducted elections under the new frame work when a union request recognition on the basis than majority of employes in an appropriate bargaining union have designated the union as the representative and employer must either recognize in bargain with the union or promptly file a petition seeking election e let us be clear they are now saying there is no election if there's no election is determine whether a union was formed at the local amazon plant ire's just some union organizer went through and see had every sign a petition saying i wish to join a union now on the promise of that is can being an awful to pressure bare unions for years are brought enormous mounts pressure to bar an individual employes you knot all your bodies all think if you do not sign this here petition you are screw bob over there bob knows were you live which is why they are they are use to be in this country when we go o vote there is the secret ballet with with unions there now moving against that that not massively saying no more secret ballet you are gong to be able to go around s to your other employee and yougingto have them sign a petition and now the company has to choice is one they can either except the union as fully formed and negotiate with it or they can petition seeking an election however if an employer who seeks an election commits any unfair labor practice that would require setting aside the election the petition will be dismissed and rather than re running the election the board will order the employed to recognize in bargain with the union what is this mean this means let us say that you find out for example that somebody his actionmean pressuring employes inside our company to sign i petition and then n elect and you fire them for interference with your labor force the anal by could come in the back door in the to oh you and allowed to fire that person and now you are automatically forced to bargain with the union automatically forced to bargain with the union it is a major change this is why the america prospect is extremely excited they say the semi decision was proceeded by another one day or alien in which the board also long party lines set out rules for representation elections which required them to be held promptly after the board have been asked to conduct them curtailing employes to ability ability to delay them often indefinitely a lot of the employers would basically say let told an election but let us wait months we can actually pull people and give them som material as to the cost of of implementing a unionist now the worth hin up got a hold the election right away let us just be clear no election us setting the first place can get people to sign a petition two if they do request an election the lection just o be held now and three you are not allowed you take any action the and our b deems you are responsible or bad and if they will just automatically declare the union as the america prospect a far left magazine says taken to gather this one to punch effectively makes union organizing possible again after decades in which in punished employer i legality was the most decisive factory reducing the nation's rate of private sector union isatin from roughly thirty five per cent to a bar six per sent all this is rude by the way in a perverse and stupid version of you canonic history and which it was unionization in the america work fore the led to america prosperity that is unbiased in america economic history it just is not ill get to that in just one second first leyberedy signals that fall is fast approaching

shipping of case to all of this is rounded in the version oft economic history in which it was america unions that built america that is not true has not truethererare certainly circumstances in which unions are necessary and good to miners unions would be at excellent example while it say you have a company town and the company town is effectively in oligarch and you have to have the ability to unionize in order to change conditions the company town however unionization in america car industry absolute destroyed the america car industry in the nineteen fifties because america was the only place capable of actually making cars were the only industrialize nation on earthman had not been wiped out by world wore to get big prophet margins and the unions organized and they sign themselves extraordinarily rich contracts and those extraordinarily rich contracts end up easily bankrupting all those car companies by the seventies this is very often what happens when unions are giving outsize ability to organized this particular try the public sector by thewayouon talk about the bloated public sector and united states private sector unions in some cases are at least understandable public sector unions are blocked public sector unions are the most corrupt bargain in america politics essentially what happens is that you have a bunch of union organizers and they negotiate with legislators for some sort of big give away deal including very often the ability for the states to actually take out of peoples pa check union dues in hand over the union the union then uses that money to get a bunch of democrats elected and the the negotiates with those people to sign more give always for themselves super duper corrupt and its one the reasons the cost of government has been sky rocketing year on year for literally my entire life time beyond if you think that the combination of this sort of top down economic controls centralization of america can of of control of theamerican economy by the my administration is gan to have long from affects are wrong it is can have wild the facts when it comes to the drug industry isn't hae wild the facts when it comes to business over all with regard to these new unionization rules in he by ministry of hebenminestrition and care they are understand economics and do not care about it n the there there small children it comes t economics i do not high prices therefore i will use the power of government to yell about high prices to bring them down i kep their second order of facts of this sort of stuff they are unintended consequences always these the kind of idiotic thinkers truly ho believe that it in in what they call the broken windows fault yo w the hard economics that if you throw in rock through window just helped the economy because now somebody has to gob new pain of glass neglecting the fact that when you break the window that shipowner was going to use that money to invest maybe in another employe maybe that shipowner was going to by new equipment and know they if to waste their money on another pain of glass and that this this bizarre notion in economics that the only thin you have to focus hone is the thing right in front of he is supposed to all of the outsides effects beyond that thing it is the death of actual efficiency it is the death of actual invasion the administration doesn't characters looking for give wast the political allies anyway meanwhile jobidon has to lock down those political allies because the entire america public knows that jobidon is unpleasant there is a growing impression that he his corrupt that growing impression should ben launched at the beaning of is political careericause you ben corrupt for literally half a general half a century at this point in america politics but the the the biggest thing that sticking to right now is that the man obviously is no longer with it yesterday green john pare tried to defend robin's virility sand hell he did go to you crane you mean he took a plain and then wandering around their wow shocking stuff there green but ism talking about what america see when they turn on the t v and they see jobidon's been in politics since before literally since before you were born and that he is es moment's aged what moment's talk about ask we all do let us talk about this and you all talk about the back when we were e wear for a marking the one yer adversary art the of of the war and you can onprovocor by inn when did the present he wet to kith and he was there with the with the alarmed glaring in the back and people were impressed that he was able to be there and look strong and represent a represent the camera the america people ankle in a warn country i know that ta she she has to do this for loving but i got to say that is that is not pretty weak sauce even morning does yet really conto concern about his age eighty nine per cent of republican say lion is too old sixty nine percent of democrats say he is too old and seventy four per cent of independence say the same this ti something that the white house the bison campaign cannot avoid it is a reality it might be in comfortable for some people to talk about but when you have private dinner parties when you go out and at the ice create place in the summer people do even democrats who jo bin and and plan to support of they do have concerns about his age yes they do en is just o e just fact to they have o dead war thinking the fact also the supthac those democrats i thinker are highly a highly a pussy o was too old arvo for moral for yet it's problem even his own party knows the man is too old and by the way he is mean yesterday join forgot the name of his secretary of homeland security a a hundred america here he was do in that your of security i ja jo the gage the j ye he he is lost but i is congius that he is lost there's also growing perception that he is a nasty person which of course is true i been talking about this for a while the the farad of jo bison captain of empathy was always lie jobidon is a pathological narcissist which is the reason why any time some my els to suffering he immediately stretch talking about his own idiotic experiences oh you just lost a child in a fire in my ism a tell yo about that time the ma kitchen gotten on fire for twenty minutes oh you lost a child blown up an oufgantisan ism to tell you about the time that my son came home in a coffin drape of the flag which is not even true that is to jobidon is hell no others a new book about the last couple of years the bid administration by franklin four who is a bison ally rite some who's friendly cordon and ism the boy is call the last politician in sick lion's white house in the struggle for america future and do for talks pretty openly about the fact that jobidon does not care about people by jobidon is is not a person who is truly empathetic that his his famous empathy goes away the minute that essentially the minute that a crosses his political streams as long as is run quote for a man vaunted for his empathy he could be detached even icy when confronted wit the prospect of human suffering that is what former says about bison that is becoming increasing with clear to people and it should be clear to people it is on of the reasons why his approvalrating s tumbled in the a from a vafgannistan it is not just that by the way we now have in formation that the national arrives has some five thousand four hundred jo biding emails using fake names to dish government information to hunters and others as vice president of the united states according to the nor post the national arrives an records administration has admitted it is in possession of nearly five thousand four hundred emails electronic records and documents puttsentially showing present en by using a sudan him during his vice president bet's presidency marry can firm the existence of the trove and response to tune twenty twenty two freedom of information actroquest by the southeastern legal foundation the request sought emails pertaining to the could of robin ware robot el peters and j r b ware those are the it but by the way very very odds a non brilliant sudentems right there robin ware would be josh robin net bison and ware is demo ware gatigis genius level stuff right there from job what what amazing sudentem the south eastern legal foundation on money filed suit against naira for the release of the records the say all too often public officials abuse their power by using it for personal political benefit when they do many see to hide it the one way to preserve governmental an tirade is for narrow is release bisons nearly fifty four hundred meals two s el f and that's the public there accusing naira of having dragged its feet since the fayer request since tune twenty twenty two earlier this most the house overs may chairman names comer demanded the naira hands over any unrelated records in which jobidon used to student him again ism confuses to under what gigs naira is denying access to the deals it is the national arrives i mean that they should really be giving access to the deals alive very suspicious none of this is going to benefit jobidon i came meanwhile it is time for these stupid racial controversy of the day we actually have a couple the stupidest racial controversy of the day is non racial at all according to fox news come videos circulating on as this week depicted a young elementary school stunting colorado springs cholera being removed from class having a pastor flag patch on his back back the clip appeared to be recorded bi japan's mother a she her son and schooled minister discussed the boy being pooled from class at the hangar school that day because of the batch according t the staffer at the cholera charter school the patches is eruptive to the class from environment an that it had origins with slavery no it don't no it really really does not the garden flag for those who know nothing about it was formed in seventeen seventy five but before the america revolution it was formed as another virgin of the snake flag the can of the join or i flag the was actually in play for the colonies since the seventeen fifties and as nothing to do with slavery whatsoever at all it is twelve year old kid whose campaigning for vice pressor i love that the school is basically running a steel dose ops on a twelve year old kid it is strong stuff happening right here i apparently jane mom disputed the school staff member throughout the meting arguing the flag originated during theamerican revolution the video opens satin his women in named schooled ministers son down for meting in her office to discuss the child dismissal from class and the staff member explains the reason the don't want the flag is ism is due to the origins of slavery and the slave craters of toe found of the o as a her were e isjuto is forget slavery was reason es donsswaeri eyas big this adjust sitting there being all the inspired ministrations is filled with more o i the a the family has tat turned over some of the meals on this miss blank as discuss and providing of the ration out for determining the gads in flags considered an unacceptable symbol first case when et else required the complaint to be reviewed tide to con federate flag an other white supremacy groups including patriot groups and also tied to hate groups apparently the idea is that if some bad people use the godson flag this means that the godson flag is itself bad which is kind of heard base i know a last bad people who use the be alemflag i do not see anybody on the left saying its bad and the more back respectfully everything can be con ordered races and tide t whitespremacy it is ad because when everything becomes race is nothing is that is a problem for people of color me when we actually need to cry races hm an oppression and it is actually happening known will take t seriously i thing making everything races is races ellewell all tipebeen random things i see from the school and type in races into the gouge searcher let us yo what i can come up with air racist math racist definitely racist as a person of color i agree totally racist u good stuff right there e again it is amazing but by lays is petty that even the governor of colorado whose a democrat hard policy's to no this is not a thing a hard police was this is this is ridiculous he as shard remarks is that i thing its preteen could express themselves in different ways as long as are not writing a disruptive environment certainly the gads an flags a great iconic america flag other its have elgyou be tee flags other have flags of major political parties it is it is tit is re thitculiaves are by the way even comparing the gads an flags the else be the flag is absurd the godson flag is just a flag that symbolized the united states by thewy we on be talking with jade in a little ben later on in the showering member block apparently there they are doubling down but not on the godson flag the'realowing him the godson flag but he has a gunfight's patching that has to noway apparently patches that are associated withe actual amendments to the united states constitution those probably need to go away i have serious questions us whether the school is banning others

his it was setting a precedent what they wanted was to real to turn for parents especially when theirestanding up against transcend with what is being pushed through the schools by the school

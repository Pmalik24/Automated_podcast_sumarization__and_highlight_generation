welcome to the hubermansciencescience packed mandrhuberman and on a professor of neurology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor and gallant doctor gallant is a full and tenured professor in the department of connesiology at californium state university in fullerton he is also a world expert in all things exercise science and coniology today you are going to hear what is essentially a master class in how to build fitness no matter what level of fitness you happen to have he talks about how to build endurance and the multiple types of endurance he talks about how to build strength and hypertrophy which is the growth of muscle fires if you are seeking to get stronger or build bigger muscles or build endurance or all of those things to day you are going to learn how you also going to learn how to build flexibility how to hydrate properly for exercise and will also talk about nutrition and supplementation what makes doctor gallant unique is his ability to stand all levels of exercise science he has the ability to clearly communicate the sets and repetition schemes that one would want to follow for instance to build more strength or to build larger muscles he also clearly describes exactly how to train if you want to build more endurance or enhance party of vascular function what is highly unique about doctor gallant and the information he teaches and the way he communicates that information is that he can take specific recommendations of how recreational exercisers or even professional athletes ought to train for their specific rolls and link that to specific mechanisms that is the specific changes that need to occur in the nervous system and in muscle fires and indeed right down to the genetics of individual cells in your brain and body in order for those exercise adaptations to occur it is truly rare to find somebody that can stand many different levels of analysis and who is able to communicate all those levels of understanding in such a clear and actionable way indeed doctor gallant is one of just a handful of people to which i and many others look when they want to make sure that the information that they're getting about exercise is gleaned from quality were reviewed studies hands on experience with a wide variety of research subjects meaning every day people all the way up to professional athletes in a wide variety of sports it is no surprise that here not only one of the most knowledgeable but also the most trusted voices in exercise science doctor gallant is also an avid communicator of zero cosmic consumer information about exercise science you can find him on integral at doctor and gallant and also on twitter at doctor and gallant both places he provides terrific information about recent studies both from his laboratory and from other laboratories more inept protocols of the sort that you hereabout to day if you are not already following him be sure to do he provides only the best information is extremely wants and precise and clear in delivering that in formation ism certain that by the end of to day's conversation you will come away with e tremendous amount of new knowledge that you can devote to your exercise pursuits before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens t lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there risen i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stop come slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still decision in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five are travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar one talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc come slash supermen and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you wan a try element you can go to element element do come slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor and gallant well em doctor professor and galopment s a long time coming we have friends in common but this is actually the first time we have sat down face to face ye ism very excited yet therefore only a handful meaning about three or four people who i trust enough in the exercise physiology space that when they speak i not only listen but i modify my protocols and you are among tho three or four people first of all a that of gratitude thank you i you have greatly shaped the protocols that i use and i i know there is far more for me an for others to learn your professor you teaching university and you have a tremendous range of levels of exploration muscle biopsy literally images down the microscope all the way to training professional athletes and everything in between you are truly an end of one and just to start us off i would love to have you share with us what you think most everybody or even everybody should know about principles of strength training principles of endurance training and principles of let us call it hypertrophy power in the other cut sort f categories of training this could be very top contour but would you think everybody on planet earth should know about these categories of personal an athletic development well that is a great first question holy cow ah i think it'll started this way i tend to think about i there is about nine different adaptations you can get from exercise i fat loss is not one of those it is a by product but that is not really when ism getting at ism d we can kind of categorize everything that and never er at we can talk about or what the concepts that you need to hit within each one and then you can have infinite discussion of the different methodologies it and that that first thing that hit is the concepts are actually fairly few but the methods are many right people have said that in iterations throughout time ism if you walked from the very beginning the first one to think about as wold as call skill this is improving anything from say a gulfswaing to a squatting technique to running this is is simply moving mechanically how you want your body to move judging to globally all that skill from there were i getting to speed this is moving as fast as possible the next one is power and power is a function of speed but also function of the next one which is strength if you actually multiply strength by speed you get power and the reason on making this distinction by the way is somebothese are very close and ism going in a specific order on purpose here for example power is y to set its a function f speed and strength if you improve speed you have also likely improved power but not necessarily cause it could hat come from the forest direction either there is carry over the lot of things youwould do for development of strength and power i they are somewhat similar but there is differences right things t you would do correctly for power would really not develop much strength and vice visa we get into all these details later whence you get past strength an the next one to a down the lists hypertrophy this is muscle size right growing muscle masses one way to think about it after hypurchopy you get into these categories of the next one is these are all global endurance base issues and the very first one is called muscular endurance this i your ability to do how many pushups can you do in one minute e things that past muscular endurance you are now into more of an energetic or even carry of vascular fatigues you have left the local muscle and you are now into the entire physiological system and it is ability to produce and sustain work and we can get too a bunch differentiations with in endurance but but just to keep it really simple right now the very first one think about this as i call this anerobic power right this is your ability to produce a lot of work for say thirty seconds to may be one minute kind of two minutes that the next one down then is more closely lined what well call your vial to fact this is your ability to kind o do the same thing but more of a time domain of say three to twelve minutes this is going be a maxim tartrate but it is can be well past just man hartwik then after that we have what i colony duration endurance this is your ability to sustain work the time woman does not matter in trips of how fast got you are going it is how colony can you sustain work this is thirty plus minutes of nolbreak that as just an high level over view those are the different things you can target and again some of those cross over and some are actually little bit contrary to the other ones pushing towards one is make a sacrifice something else as a is an over all start that is rough y what we are looking at within all those though they do have similar concepts and terms of there is a handful of things you have got to do to make all of those things work and we can talk about as many those as you want be t one of them is functionally called progressive overload which ever onerous are trying to improve at if you want to continue to improve you have to have some method of overload and as you well know you have talked about a lot adaptation physiologically happens is a by product of stress s you had to push a system if you continue to do save the exact same work out over time you better not expect much improvement you can keep maintenance but you are not going to be adding additional stress in general you have to have some sort of progressive overload and we can talk in detail about what that means for each category but this could come from adding more weights this could come from adding more repetitions it could come from doing it more often in the week it could come from adding complexity to the movement going from say a partial range o motion to a full range motion or adding other variable there is a lot of different ways to progress but you have to have some sort of movement forward if you have this kind of routine you've built money wednesday and sturdy or something and you just do that infinitely you are not going to get very far t hat's i guess the most highlable over view of all the things people can go after and then we can go from whatever direction you aunt there i love to do the deep dive on each one of these ever a several hours a why i and i imagine that overtime we probably will a it'd love to chat about a couple of these in a bit more depths in terms of defining what the progressive overload variables or y after these different categories maybe we could hit the am to most common comminations of these nine things the first one being am strength and hypertrophy and ma we could lump power in their a maybe not a you are you are the exercise is yes ones ye but strength and hypertrophy which at least bear some relationship yet and then maybe separately we could explore a sustained work en durance this thirty yet its are longer continuously cause i think many people train in that regime ye am and probably i something a vet two man inarobi e well because i know that a number of people now incorporate am called hit or high intensity interval training i think with the hopes of either shortening their work outs and or am gaining some additional party of vascular benefit if we could start with a strength and hypertrophy i know many people want to be stronger they want to grow larger muscles or at least maintain what they have ye what are the progressive overload principles m that are most effective over time for strength and hypertrophy the afloat it'll like you go a little step back with every one of those categories i talked about you have what we call your modifiable variables this is a very short list of all the things you can modify the different variables within your work out that can be modified that will change the outcome fancy way of saying if you do this differently then you are on to get a different result ism modifiable variables i the very first one o those is called choice sic is the exercise choice you select now one of a i n a go double back here some kind of doing a little bit of conception follow me here as ism going up a lair to come down a couple of layers a i have these fundamental laws of strength auditioning that that it'll a kind of a little bit of a joke but progressive over those one of those laws another one of those laws is you are exercises themselves do not determine adaptations here is what i mean if your i most get stronger you cannot select an exercise that does not determine you getting strong if you do not do the exercise correctly and not been referring to the technique that of course matters but if you do not execute in the recut fashion then you are not going to get that station if you choose i not get stronger found i do a bench best well if you do the wrong sat range the wrong repetition rings the wrong speed you will not get strength you may be get must en durance and very little strength adaptation the exercise selection it self is important but it does not determine the outcome adaptation the very first thing you think about if your i want to get stronger are ad muscle is not the exercise choice it is the application of the ex excise what of the sets or the reps for the a rest ranges are you're using that is going to be your primary determine it now some exercises a certainly better for some adaptations for example i a dead lift is probably not a great exercise to do for long duration en durance you could theoretically do thirty straight minutes of dead lifting but it is probably not our best choice right it is probably a pretty good choice for strength development i could your to do low repetition i said range ism you could theoretically do biceps curls for power butprobably not your best choice i single joint isolation movement is is not the best for developing power you v ever done a bice of girls fast as you possibly can that is i can i go well in theory any exercise can produce any adaptation given the execution is performed properly now that we have understood that a little but t exercise itself does not determine the adaptation coming within each one of these categories exercise choice is not important variable because it does lend you two things what movement pattern your in in an't other words if if you want get stronger and you are thinking of a what exercise to i do you need to thank think a little bit about what musclegoups to i want to use and that is going to be leading towards the exercise choice for example i want to use my quadsmore o a fine maybe you can to choose more of a front squat give a variation a noble squat the bar the load is in front of you you want to emphasis may be more of your handsprings includes you in i may be put a barbell on your back or do a different one the exercise choice is important to the prescription because it disjoin o determine a lot of your success you another kind of simpler way to think about this if you are a beginner or moderate intermediate or may beau do not have a coach you probably want a hedge towards an exercise selection that is a little bit easier technically you maybe do not want to do a marble bad squat it is actually pretty complicated movement maybeyou want to do a little but more of a again a noble squat or even use some machines or a split squat something that is little it simpler because you do not have a coach you are not a professional outlet the likelihood of successes higher in the risk is now gone lower the very first variable within all of these is the exercise choice the second one is the intensity and that refers to in this context not perceived effort while that was really intense work out it is quite literally either a percentage of your one rep it man or a percentage of your maxim of heart raped or view two man for the strength base things you want ta think about what is percentage of the maximum weight i cut lift one time and that's that is a recall one get man or it is a percentage of my heart right right if i tell you to get on a bike an i want to do intervals and want you at seven i percent ism typically referring to seven if i percent of your man heart raped or viol to man or something that if i tell you to do squats at seven i percent that means seven if i percent of the maxim out o wash you could lift one time or close interns o determining one relax i confess a if never have she takin the one relax for any exercise but i have some internal sense of what that might be for yuan what range it might be is it necessary for people to ass there one repetition maxim we before going in to these sorts of programs no not at all i think a more intuitive way is to take a repetition range i we o you does a couple of boys there are i equations you can run and you can just bugle these anywhere an and these are called conversion charts and it says of if i did seventy five pounds on my bench press i did at eight times you can just run an estimate to say the oka you are probably going to be able to bench about ninety five pounds for one rimaxts or something that is a very easy conversion chart just pick a load thatyou feel comfortable with but it is it is kind of heavy but not li crazy heavy and do as many repetitions as you can but a really good technique and then look wat that number would be convert suffer than doing an one repetition maximum for for that the general public who has again no coaching it is a prefer a professional o that it is i any safer but are i not even a professionalothin but a trained person with a coach but for most people yo that is a god way to go about it ism you can also just kind of do it with feel in the sense that say you want to do a set of five repetitions and you do the load and you think it get it done one or two more and then then you cannot have an idea of of what that number is going to be if you think man that last one i had to count a really really really get after it than maybe just call that that number right ism see do not have to get overly concern in fact when we start getting into these number ranges you're to see that they are all ranges i out were not kin to give a specific ninety five percent for one of these exactoryes rinse it is not that precise ism for most of em in fact some of my ciperchfy have enormous ranges that you would almost cannotmess that the intensity in that case does even matter for the most part because that is not the primary determinant ism some of these your in to see intensity is to determine and some of these nice volume is the true determined ism intensity it is a see en choice was he very first on a manipulable veritable intensity was a second one the third one as would call volume and this just how many reps and how many sets are you do if you into do three sets a ten that volume would be thirty i five sets a five that volume is twenty five it is s simple equation how much work he totally do i the next one pass that is called rest intervals this you most a time you are taking in between typically a set i then from there you have progression much as what we started talk about this progressive overload are you increasing by weight or reps or restminables or complexity or whatever all of those things i can be changed as a method of progression and maybe you want o go i progressing from a single join exercise a a leg extension on a machine and you want to progress by moving to a whole body movement a squat that an of itself you do not have to change the load or the reps or the rest that is a representation of progressive overload and it is probably a pretty good place a start because number one especially for beginners you want to make sure that the movement pattern is correct do not worry about intensity do not worry about rep oranges or any these things you need to learn to move correctly and you need to give your body some time to develop some tissue tolerance the you are not getting overtly sore in general soreness is a terrible proxy for exorcise quality it is really bad way to estimate whether it was a good or a bad work out especially for people an that begin or to middle to moderate infant even the that for our professional athletes ism we do not use sordid as electric of a good work out i it is it is a really bad idea for bunch roses on the same token because stress is required for adaptation you do not want o leave it the gem in feel i do not ley do much there has to be there if you think about soreness on a scale of one to ten you probably want to spend most of your time and the three you post exercise ye in between workouts totally and i i know we will talk about recovery extensively later but if one body partner set of body parts is sore is that an indication that one should stay out of training i would imagine the answer is no an in most cases i and secondarily to that if a particular muscle is sore does that mean that muscle is not ready to be trained again you have answer to both those is the same which is no i you can certainly train a sore muscle you you need ted i guess have a little bit of feel on that right if if you are sore of say in you are moving around a little being man's little bi are you can train if you are i cannot sit on the couch without crying because my clues are sore we we probably do not need to train again it feels him firing counts cloning yet in that particular case it'd say you have actually gone the place of detriment because now your can have to skip a training session and now you are behind your actual total volume say cross the month and i can be lower because you went away too hard in those work outs had to take too many days off few between you gin to see the your to cover less distance o in the course of a month or six month or even a year you want to walk a pretty fine line and for most people i would say hedge a little bit on the side of less sore than more for because frequency is very very important for almost all these adaptations i training frequency which is the last modifiable variable right frequency s a how many times per week are you are you doing that thing those are i in up r or globe things that we can play with when ism trying to manipulate and get strength verses ipertrope or at i want a little bit of both all those variables are the things that are going through my mind which one do i need to move in which direction that i can get this outcome and not this it'll come over here for example some folks might want to get stronger but not put muscle mass some folks are is kind i want both and that is a lot of your republic only tittle stronger and lo bat more muscle great but there are in dances were people for performance reasons or for purely personal preference like got o won o get an you muscle great but i want it stronger also if few minute emulate those variables correctly you can get exactly that very little development of muscle size and a lot of development and strength and this is why we continue to break wold records in sports power lifting and way lifting that have weight classes there is a top number that we can hit it from o bodysize but yet we continue to get stronger and faster this is very possible if you understand how to manipulate almost variables i s that being said we can start off with you want t to go strength d yesterdrayand i i love that you mention the fact that it is possible to increase strength without increasing muscle size yours not dramatically because think it is not just weight class athletes i know a lot of people who for aesthetic reasons they would to be stronger their hearing that having strong bones an strong muscles an tenants it is great for longevity and for avoiding injury and many other features of of life and and yet they do not want to fill out progressively larger and larger r sizes of clothing and we can go harder to the mechanisms on that piece if you are we can save that come back to it sure i what i love to both a what i love to know thou was if we could define some of these modifiable veritable yet in the contacts of strings let us say i possum yes er somebody who i come to you and i say and unless you are say for sake of of a balance here cause she entire does do some way training i bring my sister in i say me and my sister both want to get stronger yet what modifiable variable should i how should we modify the variables love it are it great oman you inception on you one more time one of my other laws of this will be fast i promise of strength conditioning is in general the default is all joints through all range of motion this is important because it is can answer you very first question on this strength cantergoy in general the ankle should go though the full range of motion the ankle the ye should go through he full range of motion than heth hip the elbow it camera camera right across the work out not in a single movement well i would hop unless there is an amazing exercise i have not heard well there are some exercises that we are gin a call more full body think about a full snatch tie you re to take a lot of your muscles a later your joins through lot o range of motions ism other ones an isolation we call these single join exercises imagine an a bicep crow you've one joint in that particular case the able moving the shoulder and everything else is pretty much stable this is how ill different a mouth i join from single join movements i but yet across how what d you say does not he hap to be to day but maybe throughout the week try to get every joint through full range of motionnow a couple of quick carrots that i am not advocating using full arrange of motion an allowing really bad exercise technique n i say full range o motion that is the default that does not mean every single person can do that for everything exercise it means that is where we should be striving to and that is our starting point your gin to see a lot less injury and a lot more productivity out of your training session the fact the science is fairly clear on this one strength development as well as i perry is generally in hands the large arrange of motion of training and the mechanisms are somewhat understood on that i that being said if you have to get into say a bad rat a position with your say low back the spine is a very good one your in general the spingesates very neutrals we call it now no flection no extension speccing he lumbar region if you if you are doing a say a dead lift and in an order to take your knee through a full range of motion a dead lift you have to compromise your back position that is no boy not saviors reside do not kill me in good positions on e doll till yourselves yenportantly why that matters is if we walk through strength the very first thing o ma go through t the exercise selection let us choose an exercise at which ideally has a full range of motion or close to it that does not in duce injury for you that you can still maintain good back and low back an imposition and everything else i you feel comfortable with you can feel strong but you do not feel all my gosh if you have never snatched before having you do a snatch for a maximum even now seventy five percent that it is terrible idea your nock can feel confident is can be a train rack i would rather put you on a machine bench press seen i feel stable i feel safe here and i can just express my strength exercise choice in generally in general full range of motion and you want a cold of balance between the movement areas this is an upper body press this is pushing away from you bench press things that over body pull pulling an implement toward you a bent row pull up i the pressing should be horizontal perpendicular to your body as well as vertical s this is lifting a weight overtopped your head lifting away away from you the pull version is pulling horizontally to you and pulling vertically down pull up things that i from the lower body we typically call these hinges it sort of funny muscle thing that no one can laugh at but maybe mean you here is well categorize muscles as our movements exercises as pushes and pulls right a squat is tends to be push wat you are pushing away the ground a dead lift is a pull who ere pulling the implement up to you but reality every single exercises only ever a pull was muscle does not push things away muscle can only contract and pull on itself and again supernarything the must we put ad an most that is don no but i think its it really important point because it also am speaks of something the you will get in too later which is that you just error chain anterior only i and if that is a mysterious to people w become clear i before long pus error chain anterior chain a makes a lot of cense to me because of the way it is grounded in the firing of motor neurons which is ultimately wit controls muscles it sos o iron nerves all the time exactly it also depends on the lends through which one looks it life and and exercise of course i lends is primarily anurous son it i that i but i realize tat he imports i this idea of a pushing a m a perpendicular he body overhead pulling both toward a toward the body and from overhead that just makes really got into it i said especially since a lot of you're just listening to this and not watching it son your mind folks you can think about i pushing away a plan shore overhead ism lifting something overhead and then pulling toward a your sideline or toward your body rather and then pulling yourself up a pull up in the p class for those ye the lower bodice this same thing right its some sort of pushing away a a squat or a split squat or lunge or something that and some sort of again we will call pull or hinge dead left or remaining dead left or a handspring curl or something where you are contracting and calling pulling the thing in and you count s put these into a thousand different canteguaries if i you are really in that field you can want to ad a bunch o other ones but that is is a rough conception if you are going to do a single work out you could choose four exercises and you can choose one of each one press upper body press one upper body pull one lower body hinge one lower body press and then now we be a decently well rounded exercise ism that is your exercise selection and if you are taking those through firing to motion you are a great spot terms close as you can the next what is intensity if you want to develop strength this comes back to one of my favorite sciences of all time happen to be nerve guy actually in generally i to shit on nerves as much as i possibly can futon a muscle guy but i have to give henchman some credit here i know that it as beinsize prince of course right this is a series of papers indican the nilgais an nature at least some of them ye ye in nineteen fifty four o fifty six or something yeareyou can fact check me assure y will i but he basely outline this idea that look it a there is a certain recruitment threshold needed fur our on to fire and we have muscle fires in we will call fast which muscle fires an solders muscle fires and in general you are going to activate the slow twitch one's first because they tend to be associated with low threshold moon o is not exactly that way but it is its counsel out right well the only way the you activate some these higher threshold neurons is to demand the muscle to produce more force and it is fairly specific to force right is not something you can do over an endurance than right unless it gets really extreme and the big happens i in general the only way to use these big chunks of your muscle which are incredibly important for aging by the way one the major problem we have with aging developing our development of aging lated issues with muscle is the fact we lose fast which fires preferentially and then we have major problems as we go down the line because we have lost a big chunk of our strengthen size you want to make up these fires stay alive and in fact look e if that being said the only way to develop strength is in to challenge the muscle to produce more total force if you are fairly untrained or new i guess i sure ta state is all the being as well one more inception than it'll stop when it comes to this level of detail er of excise prescription a a fairly untrained per con is gone a respond basely the same to every single thing you do in fact we have done this in a lav many times we have done training studies doing things thirty minutes of circling and seen huge increases in muscle strength and size which is not a prescription for most people tons recipes but people at a really untrained if you did plough metrics or strength training or endurance running they all just get better at everything that baby got kind of a side if you want to be more intentional more specific to the to the goal of strength you need to produce more for specificity matters right we have size principal to help understand this and we have our lows of specificity which say said principal right specific adaptation to imposed demand the adaptation you get or the result of your training is going to be reflection of the demand that you imposed if you want to get stronger you need to impose a demand of strength not repetitions this has to be the load has to be very high ism in general your probably looking at above eighty five per cent of your one er at man if you are moderately train may be seventy five per cent we will work lowly trained again everything works but in general we want to be pressing a load that is very high because the intensity demand is high that is going to force you to do a low repetition range you cannot do twelve reps at ninety five per cent that then it would not be ninety five per dentin your one man by definition true strength training is really going to be five repetitions per get or less strange that is where most of it is going to occur passes phish we have covered choice intensity and i repetitions right the total amount of set tat you do it is really cot up to your personal fitness level right ism if you did as little as three cents per exercise that is probably enough work sent totally behave totally work sets right get fully warmed up and build up to that eighty five per cent do not just walk in the gem and thready five per cent on a go thank you that is a that is a important distinction ism work your way up do some like a very classic warm up thing would be a sad ten at fifty per cent a set of eight at sixty per cent a set of maybe eight again at seventy per cent and then maybe a set a five at seventy five per cent two or three or four sets kind of building intensity and lowering a rep range and then you go after your two or three working ends ism also in terms of restorable now because we are trying to the primary driver of strength is intensity it is it is not the jolly right its the intensity in order to maintain that we have to do a low repetition range but in addition we also have to have a high rest interval because if we start to we have any amount of fatigue in cur and we have to then else or reduce the reps or reduce the intensity we have lost the primary driver we have lost that main signal the number were to throw out typically is to to four minutes ism to imagine you id you you are set of bench press and you did five repetitions at eighty five percent you probably want a rest two to four minutes before coming back to the bench a doesn't mean you have to sit there on your poem act fact please do not every on will think you for not doing that i promise ism you cannot engage other muscle groups as will you call somersetting you are doing your bench press and while that two minute clock is running for your chest to rest you've go over and do your dealers and you you can kind of move back and forth and this is how you can make strength training it not seven hour work out if your professional out that you arguing to take that time because you want a maximize the out come ism so we have done this action or lot to supersede will reduce the strength gains but by a tiny mount and most of us do not care enough relative to it is going to triple the length of your training session it is not worth it for the average per and i will tell them the as supersede for someone who is trying to break a wood record in way letting or airlifting i do not supersede interesting ye i think have found that ism i do not recover particularly well from strength and i percharpy training i do not work out or the next i from work out to work out unless i keep the total duration of those work outs i to say no more than sixty minutes of work a real work ye ye maybe seventy five pass seventy five i find the i just starts od it's i how have to introduce additional was days er i just get weaker over time i it'd set i count a a limit at fifty minutes and then i i usually violate that land then up doing sixty minutes ism ism excited to hear that one can supersede exercise is as long as they work different muscle groups of course ye outright ism i would not want to to bench pressing over head press superseded cause you can e can i think that is is goes without saying for most people but just to point end out but that i could ism do some put pushball pushball n without compromising total intensity that much and i it'd certainly would be willing to give up a lit a a rapture there or a few pounds here there ism and may ask whether r not ism in doing that one gets any even tiny bit or a more of additional benefit in terms of cargo vascular work because i imagine after all a even a one rap man which have never done as a much a minute let us i get three raps on the overhead press and than i get ism four raps on a waited pull up and going back and forth no doubt going to be breathing harder than if i was sitting there testing away on my phone in between sets yet of course you ain't dentin fact in general one of things that all present of my class is a giant list a fact on the top s all these different exes adaptations i started the conversation went on the the vertical column are as many of the physiological potential adaptations one would get changes in indogenist p h a blood pressure emphatic changes bone tensity all these things writing of have this gentlest and then you can run a matrix and you can start to look at look k if i do speed training and my going to see changes the nerve nervous system well very much right that is the primary actor reason those things work very little change in the muscle system it is almost exclusively explain by the central or serial nervous system rang on that same token are you get expect many party of ask gravitation from speed answers know because i thou we did not cover it speed is very low intensity very low rearrange very high rest well as you go to strength and then you go to high percharfy you start seeing more and more increases in cart of ask adaptations because you are doing exactly that right you are restarting to reduce rest and you restarting to increase volume but you argon t lose things bondmen a adaptations be cause the load sirs to go down you can look at this trick kind understand if ism a person who wants to kind of maximizes the adaptations i get across my entire physiology for the a least amount of work you can choose these different adaptations to go after that are going to kind of land on these things right and and exactly s you mention if you are going to take five minutes rest between each rap let us say the extreme you are going to do three sets of one repetition for strength at ninety five per cent youregoin to take probably five may be seven minutes between each attempt you better not expect many changes in your resting good pressure there is no party of askers strain there you begin t put it together in a circuit well going to lose some potential strength adaptation but you are get to gain something there all these things are it is not about good or bad or right or wrong it is always about what at advantage you want what disadvantage do you want and i can cut really in to the chase here on one o these things cause we will get to this eventually if you want to know the ones that are going to generally give you the most physialoni tough to adaptations across the most categories you are almost always looking for a purchase trip of training and then's this anaerobe of conditioning piece ill going to that is going t hit the most systems at once that is great to known we should deafly i go a obit deeper on those types of a what the modified were verybles are for those categories cause i think that ism messing the vast majority of people want to be a bit stronger may be ad some a lo bit a muscle or more am get make sure their heart is healthy and et camera a this is wonderful n i think is clarifying certainly a lot for me is for strength that's i guess training frequent frequency what should determine training for would see and i had the great a benefit o long time ago when i was in high school actually i paid for a a session over the phone with mike men sir oh e lee mike men a so to be friends i a li o try at the time i was pretty young and my mother kept saying my wise is grown man calling the house and we would talk all the time about trying but he try to convince me to train once every five to seven days a very few says very high intensity am and i must say it work incredibly well surely was i think with my recovery am question which was not very good a thing is improved over time bit was not very good it was remarkable but of course this was the time when i was full of the most an a word ain my own version of a an allextioi outs if you really had he id a long arch of puberty an you were untrained i was mostly entrain a been running come countries and scape ward an in playing soccer and doing we t all the things that are the antithesis of grouse it was literally unpeople prize impossible to something forty pounds a muscle inside of twelve months it was crazy i up believe but but and then of course that stopped working over time and then you start going down the the um the odds of trying to lying the thing that is can a work that well in yew eventually realize that it was because you were untrained right a training frequency is is crucial let us say that people are doing these whole body work out as you've describe them not alternating upper body lower by cause there is many different splits if we taught does not pride does not make sense to go into ism splits in right now but how often can canon should one train a muscle and how do if a muscle is recovered locally and how do if your nervous system is recovered systemically of this is a bunch of really angel in questions ism not sure exactly what right you on a goes it'll start here um as i mentionearlyor sorties is not a good barometer of excise quality because some types of training ore going to induce more sores as sum are going to induces that is important to this conversation because when you ask about had you noel muscles ready to train again why the question is what e training for if you are training for hypertrophy right muscle size muscle grow we need two hedge towards recovery because what you are trying to do is cause a mass of insult there allow then proline synthesis to occur building of new tissue which takes time forty eight to seventy two hours by kind of out a minimum that process needs took her if you are doing actually more strength and this is a differentiation between hypertrian strength then you did not induce action much damage in fact you are generally not going to get very sore from true strength training very little unless you get really heavy did a lot the primary driver of hypertrophy is not the same primary driver of strength we talked about that drag that is intensity driven it for vow for hypircth beat's not intensity because we have different mechanisms we have different outcomes even other closely a line strength is not on a cause lot of soreness therefore intensity is the driver therefore frequency can be as high as you want you can train every single day the same exact muscle if speed or power or strength a the primary training training told because you need stimulus there is skill as skill as well right practice that that as much as anybody developing a new motor pattern requires a lot of repetitions right you do not need a tremendous amount of rest that is not it is not a damage thing right it is a patterning issue strength training in fact if you look at again true strength professional at least there going to train the same muscles basically every day we got a squat every day is that because the the primary mode of adaptation is recruitment of these high threshold motor units it is it is mainly normal at not at once can say that in this i get all fifty l ism not saying that that was assume there was a question war if we were o line put in comets with the bastion war we your of without a block you i just that is to already one probably twice i of get the early adaptations to exercise specially staring training our head towards the nervous system no question about it people always say central nervous systembut it is probably more furfural whatever see antics probably but pedantic it is nerve if you train to day to morrow morning your nock can wake up with the actually increase in contract o proteins and muscle your muscle might be a bigger due to some acute swelling but you could have an in an pretty acute that persists change in and the nervous system will call it that allows you to be stronger within a couple of days sustained hi perches probably more along the lines of four weeks we we can see that right we can actually see changes in the culture sound ow you are making changes immediately that preaching synthesis processes happening i very fast and is on o last it just takes us time to measure it in terms of a noticeable change in your whole muscle sizes that being said the first four weeks we typical they are primarily nervous system after that now were see starting to see most of the changes coming from the muscle side of the equation wit strength development it is a commination of three areas in fact all muscle contraction has these same three things it starts off both some signal right from somewhere in the body whether it is hallway up the top or at the level of the spine depending on if this reaction or an actual conscious control from there that some signal mastic tell the muscle tho contract as signal is one two it is muscular contraction and here is a lot of variables inside the muscle tissue itself that determine its functionality and if we took an individual biopsied took a muscle fiber from you and took when from me and we took those muscles out and put them in a petty disco and i tied one end to a fore stranstucir the other end to a thing the pulls it and we soaked it a bath of calcium and the munch o other stuff even if they were the same size your fires might contract a lot faster than mine even relative to size i or not or slower or there is serious properties the intrinsic fires themselves determined a lot of functionality from there muscle fires do not cause movements muscle fires simply contract they are all surrounded with connected tissue and that is all surrounded with a bunch of more connected tissue that all surround to do a muscle that muscle is in surrounded with more connected tissue that all comes together into a giant pendent that tendon attached to the bone it is the pulling on those tending that action move the bone the costumed movement that is area three are one the nervous system area two the muscle contractionary three some sort of connective tissue thing change is happen at all three up those levels and we are not even now talking or even enter the discussion of you mechanics than you changed say the venetian angle of the muscle which is the angle at which the muscle fires lay relative to the bone it this is was if mechanics as it pulling perpendicular to the bone is a pulling horizontal to the bone or some sort of angle all of these things do germane human performance whenyou are talking about again that strength development you can see tremendous improvements in total force production by manipulating all of those areas and you have not touched changes in muscle size if you change muscle size in a true sustained fashion whether this is sorcaol plasmic or contract a prolines you have given yourself more opportunity to produce more force it does not guarantee you produce more force i body builders are not stronger than power liters you even know they have more muscle but body builders are probably stronger than most people there is a relationship between muscle size and strength its in this not a one to one guaranteed ratio and that is generally because the although the muscle has been aided they may have not change the you mechanical considerations ay may ism not change the connected tissue nor the nervous system and that is why we see this giant relationship that our value is pretty high between strengthen and perry but if you really want to get to the ends of it it is not and that matters to your actual question ten minutes ago because again you can train strength daily on the same muscle but if you want to allow for that process of connect a contract lie prolines to to add and girl then you've a have to blow some recovery because if you go back into that muscle too soon you can have blunt the response you get a topic an a cut it off you have all kinds of of problems going on in the cell that are got i just attenuate that that growth response i gaveyou the answer for strength train the answer for a certify is probably less than three out a ten on level of soreness you can go again in general you are probably looking at seventy two hours is the optima window if you trained your your shoulders on money you probably w don't on a train in again on tuesday if i speechifies ago maybe wednesday maybe thursday's best something an every two to three day window is is probably and we do not we live it more now about why that is the gene cascade the signaling response happens will the signaling happens instantaneously right within seconds the gene cascade is probably in them peeped in the four hour window the depending on which gene you want to look at but is this kind of a snap shot but the preaching synthesis process is twenty four to fortnight hour thing and it tends he cent of look let that thing finish and let that signal go back the base line and then had it again and then head it again and now long as you are providing the neutrino the recovery should happen and you should be able to sustain the same work output in the training session the stimulus stays high and the recoveries the r and you can now continue to grow mostly you mention forty eight to seventy two hours for hypertrophy what if be for whatever reasons the the training split a life style factors et camera somebody say let us use your example trains a shoulders on money am ideally they would train them again on thirsty in there particular instance somewhere wednsday or thursday but they do not they wait until sturdy or sundae for whatever reason maybe it is more compatible with their work work another exercise casual whatever the reason are they actually losing hypertrophy that they gainedwher they miss a window to induce further hypertrophy it is probably better think about the latter it is not that your lost it suceyuve just come lost an opportunity to to make more progress i i will save you a little bit and can i going back to your hit program this is the original high intensity training the the sense are thing right it is not the hit with one eye not the high intensity interval training but high intensity training at re one set to absolute failure to maybe too for each muss the group twenty men at work out dividing your by in the three into a three way split and then literally training my ashing six times a month which must be would think that is absolutely crazy there is no way that is on o work and i can tell you it if you are untrained you you grow a weed just if you train hard enough even i r trained look at the people mike tried he put a lot of body builders on really high levels now they had the same similar help you had at that time for any way to be very clear i was not a fa has othoniss and about in fact i w access was just as good i probably was i was it measuring my levels there but i probably would i grew easy and gene in general intend to grow pretty easily am from wait training but thee but an i should say that to mike's credit and i think this is an important message tat he was the one who really said look uncles you've gong to make a professional career out of it redo not run the health hazards of examens morons it it certify not at your age he deterred me from that which was great because it never entered my mind it just was one o those things where i might fencer said do not do it and he clearly done it right ism so speaking from an infortaned place it never entered my mind but also i was what was really wild as i was continuing to run across country a and there was it there was a a trade off there at some point of bit nor when you are young you can get many people can get away with to with what at this age would surely place me into a state of overstraining even at low volume was yet well i mean the the whole field on interference effect has changed quite a bit i recently while we and come back to if you not ism but distant to finish out the the do here wit that last question i if you want to take five days or six days for between each mossgroup you can do that fact if you look at the research it is on to show that frequency is not at important it will something it is unimportant but it is if you can handle changes as long as you get to the same total volume you can do that you just have to do a lot more work in that one work out if you care about the six week eight week thing if you are ism in this for the next sixty years it is probably o we i ism but it can be there that the challenge with splitting up your training sessions for ipertropy into smaller numbers once or twice a week it is just difficult to get that number it is typical to get that volume done ism volume wise the more recent medanalysies arguing to say that your probably looking out around ten working sets percussed group per week seems to be cost the minimum threshold that you are on one a had if you did three sets of ten at your shoulders on money three sets of ten shoulders wednesday and three on grin that's nine working sets if you wanted to use three different shoulder work a exercises on money and hit your nine sets it is not really acting you be dot much different the problem is tan is kind of the minim you probably want ta look for more fifteen to twenty and in fact well trained folks twenty twenty five that becomes very challenging in one work out fact defuncule you can bel to do it it and that is where it is not frequency thatloks it kills use to effect you have got to get because a total driver of strength is intensity but the total driver of hypercrview's volume assumed you are taking it to fatigue river muskie a failure it is just have to get enough done if you can i and if you want to set your scendrul up that way you probably remember if you do those types of training sessions where your just going a completely exhaust a muscle it is going to be tit it is can be sore for while you your your probably not going to come back and that is sore the logic behind that will just take the ting to tremendous failure and give it six days to recover it can work is is not the best i think is one going to think about foremost people it is also hard to do those work outs without a training partner if you really want to do them grand stimulant and headphones and all kinds of others tear well away the ye stimulants are not i do not certainly do not recommend those it maybe a cup of coffee r to if that is your thing but i and maybe some of the safe for supplements but certainly not you sorts of stimulants that the guises in the seventies and eighties or going its or sill is or still use a you talked about repetition ranges broadly for strain training five or less you said frequency could be as often as every day yet rest two to four minutes maybe even longer if you are going for one repetition maxim for hypertrophy sir what are the repetition ranges that are effective and what are the ones that are most effective if one is trying to maximize some of the other variables people do not want to spend more than an hour to seventy filling its in the him because i think that a while the deranges might be quite broad as you dude to earlier there is the practical there are the practical constraints ye what what repeat inion range is or per cent of one re petition maxim om i should people consider one thing about hype it ism the quick answer there is anywhere between five to thirty raps per set that is going to show across literature pretty much equal i birch females ism and we can have really interdiscussion about why that is but ism just remembering one thing from a second a go it i wat to give a better answer for the frequency you can do every single week for strength a every single day for strength if you want though what is probably mentally viable to twice for week permuscle hamstrings strong twice week that that is a good number to get most people really strong you can do every single day you do not need to o i who want to make sure that i was not saying you have to train a muscle eight if i per cent every single day to get strong two is a good number threes great but probably even too is really effective got it this explains to the high frequency of of training for strength athletes that is always mystified me road the very long work out to make sense per is very long never haven't train twice a day even whittle squat in the morning squat in the afternoon everyday with they are eating in their sleeping the to soft have time for anything else let's weather prose that is a job right that what they do ism a your i perhaps ism strength training programming it's somewhat complicated because of that is not the danger but you can have to pay one way or the other right the risk is a little bit higher was he loads higher and you have to be little more tactically proficient when it comes to hypertre training the way i explain it is it is kind idiot proof the programming is idiot proof the work is hard though you usual range anywhere between your five reps an thirty can you get somewhere n there perfect it is all equally effective you cannot screw that up the only caviar for hypercube is you have to take it to muscular failure and you need enough rest for the adaptation and procingsensis it our yen if you recover faster you can may be doit more frequently and if you do not may be less frequent and by that logic should people perhaps experiment and figure out what repetition range allows them to recover am in concert with the training frequency that they can do consistently my recommendation is i think you should actually set your a use the repetition range as a way to have some variation because most people do not want to go in tho empty three extend he tanto get very borne very quickly and i i think you should actually intentionally change the rest schemes for simple sake of having more fun it is a very different challenge the mechanisms that are in during his perched are different but there is only a maximal monigrowth that one can get right and you have as best we think it now and and some people actually well the shows that we know really clearly about the mechanisms of mosliperch we do not it it is still very much a guessing game but the three most likely drivers are one metallic stress two mechanical tension and in three muscular damage you do not have to have all three one is sufficient you can have a little bit of one or two and you can con it we forget it to play here we were t talked about the muscular damage a gan it is very clear more damage is not better but it is some what a decent proxy right u get a little bit of surpass is good yous do not get sorts compromising your total volume it a mechanical tension is contain strength this is why if you do even such a five or eight and your conicloses that strength en you will gain a little bit a muscle not optimal muscle gain but you are gingko gain some because everything in these my physiology is not cut off at four raps and then five raps is at different thing right it is it is always a blend think of it as a a fading curve and you get closer to the end it fades less effective as you get closer to the middle it is more effective anywhere between eight rep's per set the thirty it is equally effective past thirty it is get a blend out past eight the five to forth threetscen a blend we know less or there meltable express is en the damage is the the or sorry me cynical tension is the one that is heavy a muscle damage yell one a third one is meltable express and this is i i get a e bit of an airy of scientific contention but something is there i know somethings there we just were just count of fumbling to figure out what exactly it is and this is meatball express is the burn right it it is there i it is why blood flow restriction training probably works that is done very light her no mechanical tension there is very little damage but somehow it induces a go at amount of hypertrophy very painful duly boy i tried this i eve a friend former special operator who was on the east coast and took me through a blood fly restriction i training protocallin at harken i i do not think i i actually cried what o probably but i might have cried out once or twice it was unbelievable especially the lower body move yes i now was a humid day it'll claim will bit a gelt no but no it was brutal it was really brutal and i of to the best year your life in still brute oke well that manes we feel love it better it was intense i and i and a people should know that it is important to use the proper cuffs for these things i do not have any a relationshiptaning the companies tat sell these cuffs but the reason is that rashly need to block particular avenues a blood flow you cannot simply since awful muscle we cannot turnip get a muscle and train not a g can actually i kill yourself that way i an it woodlot yet you and i if your interest in bloodflow restriction train imagine you have some content about this or will at some point but also there there are resources on line that people can et out yet a a question about hypertrophy train i think many people are wondering about train to failure or do not train to failure assuming good form ye assume a good for great i the answer is both you want a train to failure but you do not need to go to extreme failure you do not need to necessarily go to that a partner has to lift the marble off my chest but you have to get close you have to drive either heavy stress damage right or or pump and i really easy practically to think about this sun i heard mike is your tell runs coming on reticence peurtization years ago out line this at a and i see talk and it was beautiful i thugs this is a most eloquent way to explain the context about trainer pirchfe only look for three things in your work out and let us say the yodel how on a particular muscle to grow that is say you hat your gluten to get larger o when ore doing your glued exercises never one are you feeling the glue to contract look a does not have to be there but that is a good sign if it is of a let us say i did not really feel my glue contract i felt it more my clods or my back o we did you feel a big pump afterwards now i don't rally to a pump there either words ordering o a grit of with three next day did you feel little bit of soreness there at all no i did not we that's a very goo kinda care did not feel it during the work out you felt no sort of pump and it did not get sore do not expect much growth did not has tribute the work across a bunch of muscle group adjust likely other muscle groups were too involved right especially if you are no but man my back to really we that is a really good indication of telling you what the hell was moving and in terms of target if you were to put i get a one ta you ten scale how much should i feel it burning during anything less than a three rate's probably not doing betray but it does not seven is not a ten is not better than seven you need to feel it but it does not have to be whole my gosh ism dying here cornus same barometer right if you can get three three and three you are probably in a prettygood spot five five and five is may be better but you do not need to go much past that i want you to feel the muscle group either working or if you i did not feel e much when you red to pump the next day got really sore then you your still you knowing not a good path i i gain really sore is in who little tender but next day it is okay they after that i could like out train no probe that is really what you want to go after and i terms of understanding is this likely to produce some growth or not excellent excellent very clear parameters and recommendations i know a benefiting men benefit a lot of people if you be willing to throw out a few sort of sets in t e get parameters that could a act is broad guide lines of people who want to a explore further it i realize that with all these modifiable variables that there is no one sizes fit is all for strength i love this five to thirty for hypertrophy the but o thing do not thin have ever done a thirty reps at of anything but but now that you have grown that out that i see it is a bit on at all in possum about thirty you arguing to get an insane pump you get a burn crazy but you will not get superstore as om can mentions toot low it is light you you can you can get away with those things and you it is hard because your mind is go wonder you d get it reptwiing you ma come done and you now there is there is a lot left here to get thirty were a set of ten is is much easier you just o sitcom more toomore sat thirty's i got sixteen more s it is awful but you are not counting is work it is tot air pro and people tend o dis kind on check out thirty's possible but little bit extreme extreme but it'll recommend a all of em that it is a really fun play you can do different in the same work out two by the way you can do one set of ten a push ups and then take little break and then to a set of twenty fine ley you can you can mix in mass these things ism there is no magic recipe that has to happen for all this or do it different monkeys are my sets to ten days wednesdays are my set of twenty days and fridges are my set a thirty days and you can have all kinds of fun there and it is hardest grew up great that phrase is always reassuring for strength is very a sets in reps pro to call that you have that is a pretty sure fire wait a to just think about a really fast answer for power will see power strength is what i does call thethree to five concept re i pick three to five exercises if you are feeling better that day choose in the higher end if your feeling less that day or you have a shorter time frame the train go less there to be three gets or the exercises rather or five exercise most three to five exercises do three to five reps three to five gets take three to five minutes rest in between and do it three to five times a week that can be as little as three sets of three for three exercises three times a week that is that is a twenty men use work out three times a week it can be as high as five sets of five for five exercises five days a weeks it is very broad and allows people to still stay within the domains of strength and power while still being able to move and contour tor their lifestyle and an soreness and time in all those things the only differentiator to pay attention to between power and strength is intensity if you want strength this is now eighty five per cent bless of your mac rim if you want power it needs o be a lot lighter cause you need not be move more towards the velocity and the spectrum because power is strength multiplied by speed while getting stronger by definition can help power you probably want to spend more of your time in the forty per cent the seventy per cent range cluster minus that is it both them concepts we the work everything else the exercise the reps the the frequency all that can be still in the tree to five range just change the intensity depending on washout come you on the nervous sister obviously plays an important roll at the level of nerves controlling the contraction o muscle fires but of course we have these upper motor her on which are the ones a reside in our brain that control the lower motor on the control muscle and this takes us into the realm of were the mind is at during a particular movement and to me this is not an abstract thing i can imagine doing work outs that are mainly focussed on strength er mainly focus on hypertrophy and in the case of strength an mi trying to move waits and when ism trying to generate hypertrophy it it trying to quit in not challenge muscles in other words if i just trying to move weight away from my body o you push pushing a bench press or an overhead press i do not know that i want my mind thinking about the contraction of my medial dealt i think i want my mind in getting the weight overhead with the best proper form best excuse me and proper form and certainly with hypertravy training best improper form is going to be the target as well but that simple or i should say subtle mental shift changes the patterns of nerve fire recruitment can we say to get stronger focus on moving weights still with proper form and safely and to get hypertrophy focus on challenging muscles still with proper form and safely it is very fair yeas is a snap on answer it is a very fir thing to think about i intentionality matters for both in other words if you look at some interesting science has been done on power development and speed development the intent to move is actually more import the the actual movement velocity if if you are doing say something for power or strength and you are doing just enough to get the bare up that will result in less improvements in strength than even if your moving at the exact same speed but you are intending to move faster and this is one of the reasons why good coaching matters if you're coaching enough through a power work out especially and they are doing enough to just lift fifty per cent the wonder at man it is not going to generate as much speed development as them trying to move that bar as fast ti cannot even if the net result is a same my velocity terms out nerves matter that is i men i a si i say amazing but as a nersantis if i say amazing the nerves mar what is amazing to me is waif i understand correctly what you are saying is that even if the bar is moving at the same speed same weight yeti my internal representation my thoughts are ism trying to move this as fast as possible converses ism just trying to get the bar away for me and and get the weight up ism going to get different out comes yet this is quality of workright this is did you do enough to just check off the box or did you actually strive form adaptation i similar concept act your works it hypertrophy in terms of there is a handful very recent studies tat a look that will call the mind muscle connection and this is doing things imagine a by secret and you are simply looking and watching your basis n you are thinking about contracting at harder even though you execute the same repetitions at the same exact intensity and national indications are the mind body connection are going to result in more growth then not you just gave i authorization for for people to look at their muscles pleading in the him please do yet of course right is is but thesolity is still ruled out it'd rather you look your muscles in your form ism fine of it i those are ignition we do not have a large depth of research to support that and may be some stuff will coming counter but it it does it matches what folks that community of the same for a very long time i here is actually some stuff on simply flexing an between if you verging a body be the that they will do their set of bice of grilles and the we'll get you ma flexing check anta they're little this is anal did right this is if you go back to pumping in iron wore college wait rooms i can say i he for some reason there is something about that age group ye there is a lot of checking of bisects in college way rooms for reasons that es escape me if you ever interact with my wife yo she will be the first to tell you i cannot walk past a major without check on something to that you cannot i in i cannot of not hurt me ism got i cannot well then it'll be careful not to disparage then has nothing to do with the hypercrap out v dislike ism a muscle gat some always thinking and tinkering are whatever but yet it is a i think it is very much worth your time to do a higher quality training session be more intentional be present then just executing the same as i work od i think that is global very clear to be to your d vantage if you thinking cumin it i do not won t work out to day i got all this going on or a tired of whatever ism just on to do the work i noways get through it oke if you can go what though man a cot fifteen minutes out of this thing h get my head right ism a good too twenty minutes of quality work done that is that is your best option by far you alluded to the fact that am even just looking to particular muscle might a benefit in terms of the number fibers you can recruit or exits potential for hypertrophy give heard before and i certainly i have experience that muscles that for whatever reason genetics or o sports that one played et camera muscles that a we find that we can contract to the point of almost the slightly painful contraction seem to grow more readily than muscles tat we cannot recruit very easily and i and there and the real i mention sports that we played earlier as i b just after watch the olympics to see that you swimmers obviously are very goody engaging their lats am you look the chimneys they seem to be very good engaging everything ye and they go through a huge number of different dynamic movements that explains that am i find that if people say oh young i cannot get stronger in this or my a whatever body party is weak interns of inimitability to engage hypertrophic i seer that oftentimes that can be because of an inability to jet that to engage those upper motor her on to deliberately isolate those muscles i are the ways that people can learn to i engage particular muscle groups more effectively over time forsake of hypertrophy or strength or for cases of trying to overcome injury potential or injury because in balance all a bad i across the board yet this is act very common and i think every one is probing on to this there is some part that you just cannot get going for me that was lats that was a r enjoy my back muscles for years i could not activate my lats or my robots see the the muscle groups that connect your shoulder blades o shut a squeeze your shoulder place together that set a muscles the cull your ronboyds ism your lats of course or more vertical and and pull your cot up and down a no matter how many at pull downs i did bent rose pull ups could never see any developmenthere no increase strength and it took me grubby decade to figure out how tho held actually get these things on in fact if you would have asked me even in my colleges as a college player a flex your lats show me your lats you would have seen no no movement there ism when i was doing a pull up in that particular case the only way i can get the bar to move was be was by using my biceps i a snags muscles suppose to be a secondary or tertiary muscle in that movement but for me it was primer because of my over strength in my biceps comcoupled with my lack of activation in the lats you are compassing the same movement actually a kind of easily to think about this is imagine doing a bet row imaging you are you are bent over out of out o forty five degree or horizontal angle andyou are a pull a a barbell to your belly button i now you can actually do that exact same movement with very little back muscle activation by simply flexing your elbows more and you think you are the barbels going all thewy down as comingall they up to touching my belly and you think you are doing a great back development exercise hen in fact because of the way to your executing the movement you are going very little back development and this is an a really good example of why someone has done a specific exercise many many many times be at failed to see development in a muscle group which goes back to earlier part of our conversation which is why exercises themselves do not determine theadaptation it is the execution the matters right it is the technique it's the rep range all those are going to termite your actual result if any time you were your you are banging your head against the wall and thinking why am i not getting movement here growth or strange whatever it is almost one of those it is guarantee to be on of those areas right your probably not getting ism the muscle groups to actor a in that particular example just because we are here try imagine doing that bent rode instead of pulling the barbel to your belly squeeze your shoulder blades together first as far as they can possibly go and then bring your elbows up with out changing the angle of your elbow tho words without bringing your hand closer your shoulder keep that same angle come up as high as you possibly can and then finish out the movement that is going to guarantee a a utilization first of the back muscles and a a finishing with the biceps ism at the end which is how that movement is supposed to go how do you coach in to that well it can be a number of things whenever ism dying nosing movement quality i look for a handful of things but very first one as a awareness you be surprise how many folks when you simply tell them that muscle group right there and maybe you give a a tactical prompt you touch it or you put something against it ism this is actually why am jumping over the ace but this is why things a belt work very well for actually increasing of nominal strong a a is conception ut there as if you wear a belt when you are lifting then the belt can a does all the work for you in your abs get weaker that can happen but the exact opposite can happen as well if you take a belt for exampling and you sent it down really tight and then you just completely disregard your midsection you will see a loss of strength in your midsection because now the belt is doing the work but you put the belt on just a little bit kind a tight were you get some sensory feet back and you think about using that belt is a way to activate the for musketeer you will act to see higher and if we look out en g activation the for muscles would be activated higher to greater extent then when the belt is off because a proprioceptive ye hundred percent and for those that a wondering what purpriacept if he back is probe set if yo back is that i their nerves a that extend out to the muscles that control muscle contractions but then there are censoring puts from the skin and muscle that go back into the nervous system in those work and in concert and that that he back is proprioceptive i thing it it literately translates to a knowledge of wear one's limbs t are and what is happening on those inmate yet have am seen i do not you i do not have a training partner but have seen a in him's wears some will be training in some on would tap the muscle of the person who is doing the work in order to at with this is conceptual tapping of other people's muscles not a walk around any touching people's muscles please am that to provide that popraceptive we back that that person doing the exercises it becomes more aware of the muscle that there spot to be training and it seems that that is probably an effective practice ye a i give you two examples toll go o the back with that pulling movement and then it'll stand the belt treacly quickly a very easy example that you can do right now ow listening and learn this from brine makes here mutual friend it if you take your hands and open am up i you make an ell with both your hands and now take those and put hem around your waist just above your hipbone now what i want you to do is press out as hard as you can on your hands with your cork and you can feel a lot of coractivation most people think coractivation is the front of your stomach right your six back but you need to do as great a cylinder around your back it is the front it is the side and it is the back if you take your two fingers point them now put them just outside your bellyful can you move your fingers why just moving your hadmuscles ninety per cent of people can sit do yes same exact thing now go to that same position just above was called your basic o your anterior superiors by right up that frontier hipbone in the front can you now move great fifty per cent of people are not into petty movement there really take your thumb and go right above your passes my what ps is posterior spirit i expire right now can you move most likely now for rid i do a many low back extension do not just with your core musculature verily ye maybe it in panty people cannot if you cannot perform that contraction you cannot stableige your spine only wait to get stabilization your spying is then to go through hyper extension and now there's a compression stratagem your putting in your spying it is better than rounding your back i can going forward but over extension is not great either you wont to e able to flex the musketeer in a cylinder fashion you have con con control if you go back to our very first things and with your hands open and you put i my here and if you are i cannot get activation if you pay a mention your thumb right now just move your them and now you see activation back the a don't now if you can imagine turn that on just a little bit and now notice how i can do this by the way at the same time ism talking you have to go we don't hae control right s you have to been the separate breath from brace now if i can put my possessself in position and and kelly start as ala said twenty per scent you me twenty per cent activation here and now i can squat i can hinge i can jump i do not been to be lock down o on to per sent scream to be able to brace my spine that is can be in effective and wasteful on to be here with a belt provides that proper septime feed back ore can put it on twenty per cent and it is just a reminder if i do not press against the belt the belt slides and falls down a little bit it is not on superteight if it is on dang tight doing the work and forget s we just want a little bit of feed back there same thing with your upper back for having a difficult time activating those tomboys of those lats someone can do a simple thing were they take their finger put a right between your shoulder plates and you just tell them things have squeeze my finger squeeze my finger as you are doing your bent row her your pull down you can touch the at you can do ism just visualization stuff just imagine a three de rendering of that mustergroup and you are watching that muscergroup contract it is very powerful and very effective ism to do it a touch am a visual all the stuff can help get people i to activate outside of simple awareness i typically e centric overload it is a very effective way for a activation of a difficult to target muscle the lowering of the bar or the lowering of the weight the movement of thewy away from the body it is not a scarily was lowering cast can a depends on water sure by doing rat miss things a pullup case if if if ism going to do a pull up and i have poor at activation i can still get the pull to muscle movement executed by contraction of the by substance things that however to make the movement simpler imp an to goal that to top main stepping on a box or something going all the ay to that top without pull of position and starting from that i want you o simply lower it your control and you just simply breaking the movement down into smaller pieces that allow you to to focus on the execution more it is going to be great e centric are great for strength development very good for hypertrophy and allow you to folks on control i i ism wiling to bet a huge percentage of you out there who have never had a sore at you not done a lot of pull upland things that if you do that eccentric only you'll probably wake o the next ting on of gas i feel it there and that is the sign even if you did not feel it in the work out but it got a little sore the next day keep down that path and an eventually be able to do a concentric maybe take a break maybe do an geometric we just whole that position an eventually work that into it and to a progression where you can do the concentric es centric and have some metric portions and get activation that that may take you six weeks may take these six months but that is general a pretty good strategy for learning haw act that a musclegro terrific suggestions is it true that e centric a emphasized movements might require a little bit longer recovery ere they lead to more soreness than theocentric movements yet the they typically can be there also higher force out but very good for strength development but they are going to lead on average two more soreness more potential for interest tell you a disruption that is can be associate with pain there is there is not as much o people will explain muscle soreness as a result of mycrotrama and mycrotares the muscle that can happen but that is not the norm most the time it is things destruction of calcium that is on to lead to excess of swelling ecessof pressure and that is sing to be then translated as extreme paints that is probably explaining more muscle soreness then actually mycrotrama runic i was going to get to breathing later but maybe just for now if we can do a a a brief we will for into to breathing as it relates to wait training is there a a prescriptive for how to breathe during resistance training here ism thing with weights no necessarily body weight only movements although i suppose it could be that applies seventy five percent of the time just seventy five per cent the people what i was taught and ism hoping you can tell me this was wrong because then there might be more benefits that awaiting me but is that i should exhale on the effort an inhale on the less sir effort portion of an exercise is that true is there a better way to breathe there is a better way to think about it number one if you can breathe an brace in this conversation goes away you can main remain a you can maintain intend muscular intradominal pressure who'll breathing then i do not really care when you breath very challenging to do at very heavy weights if we flag this on two areas of a paradise paradise one over here you are going to do a get of thirty and you do front squats where a barbell is sitting on your throat if you do not take breath this is going to and one way in one way only you passing out clearly has to be some breaking gravity the other end of the spectrum is let us that you can i do a vertical jump you do not need any amount of breath there it is never can happen right the question is what about the middle d ism doing some sort of strain training there well number one make sure you are brace and then you can get away with less need to work about it ism in general a a decent strategy is to maintain a breath hold during the lowering or eccentric or most dangerous part of the movement and then you can exam on the concentric portion if the bench dresses are example if you held in bract lowered in a control and now start end the concentric pushing away for it and then you wanted to take an expiration during the last half the concentric portion that that is and case strategy if you are going to do a single rep you soft need to worry about it you you can just avoid or omit breathing entirely you can be just fine if you are doing more than that especially three to four to five to seventy you can have to have some breathing strategy a very common one is i probably every third breath infant t do ex cell the third reset breathe something that if you you you need to breathe after every one at decay but it isogon to get wastefulkcou you have to take time and between reps of sitting there if it is a squat that is different i press a dead lift if you are resting the bottom that there is little bit a game here in general those as that seventy five seventy five contrary thrown out if threw out breathe in do the lowering an exhale on the out if you have to last reps do not worry about more reps than you need come up with some sort of breathing strategy about breathing in between sets a and maybe even after the work out ye this is only i thing a lot of people overlook and because the it is the case that recovery has to do both with the specific activation and a to muscles and the nervous system but also the tacks on the nervous system can also take place between sets if you are really geared up between says and you go to riddle and as high and between sets ore close to it as you are during your sets you can imagine that the recovery would take longer or at least that you are not spending a drendlein in most sufficient way if there is such a thing ye far you are not ta see any aptly that i work with just breathe between whether it is in between awnings or in between rounds every single one themes going to go back sit in the stool and there not immediately be into a breathing retake a very intentional one there stop at different for rally depending on the sport even a p ja golfer there is going to be a we just set our ball yore moving the next one were got to going to breathing strategy every one omit is it is a huge area a potential benefit and consequence if you are just ignoring it ism in general we want to do any sort of calming breath we want ta restore it depends on if the it is pencil wore combating or commanding low oxygen or high seal to that strategy's going be little bit different but in general that is a huge time opportunity to get better in fact om people can go back and listen to some of your earlierpitols o you talked about will you have spoken about i think on the show when a norposticity works and if you are losing that opportunity post exercise you are leaving gains on the table if you well not only are you to see everything out that set i work with mostly have a reason gravity in competition we are not going to just finish a work out his five drink water and walk out f o you there will be a down regulation strategy that is heavily involved with some sort of light control as well as breath control ism the individual prescription on that there is a ton a variation with what you can do the easiest thing is do something that calms you down most likely that is going to be moved towards as much nails or breathing as you can possibly do and i really easy rule them is a double exhale length relative to anyhow if you need to take a i for second in hale double that time and breathe out for eight seconds a box breathing is find equal in had equal hold equal ex hale equal hold for second in had for second acts hold at decor et camera a triangle is fine too there is a lot of ways you can get really complicated what brave my kendo will do in rob those guides have forget all kinds of systems for in hale let si control in can be of promise but some strategy of calm ism we are gone almost always put you on your back or close another were n to cover length ism we can do some we have done actually a number of a musical interventions as well but you can as just as simple as sit down a backroom if you have to and just breathe for five minutes that alone is can be productive that is great you are breathing in the locker room for five minutes i surest closing your eyes or you get some funny looks and if a you will still get funny looks but you will not see people looking at you exactly a i love this and i started doing this because you and crime my genie informed me about this and it completely change the rate of recovery for me i realize that i was leaving work out both endurance work out and strength hypertrophy work outs feeling great but looking at my phone getting right into y'all and meatingri not concentrating on my breathing and all i did was to introduce a on your recommendation a five minute down regulation exhale emphasized breathing a a a bunch of different brad's physiological size box breathing exile emphasized t twice as long as the in had coma component for five minutes and i noticed two things one i recovered more quickly work out to work out no question about it yet the numbers am told me that and the other is at i used to have this am dip in energy that would occur three or four hours after a hard work out and i always thought that had to do with the fact that i generally eaten a meal at some point post work out turns out it was not the meal at all ye it is at that that a dreamland am ramp up during the work out i was in clamping that at the end and i think eventually it sly thrashed and then three for hours later ism a having a wartime even reading what is on the screen in my computer thinking make it is the screen maybe was what right lunch turns out the down regulations allowed me to work through the afternoon with no issues whatsoever yet it is really been quite powerful and saw it grateful to you for that and i think this is something that i think ninety eight per cent of people are not doing and it is only five minutes you u you hae to o five give me three if you really have to push it give me three and you can even do this you can safe time you can do this in the shower f we have to you are you are done you are finish drink water whatever has to be and you are getting a shower you raring you ready just give me three minutes the shower it is not ideal but as little as that it can pay huge diligence you need some sort of internal signal that were safe throttle down here for an a move on that has to happen i it to gone on here but i i think we are make the same point in on over again it is this big drain to it and you are saving energy i in the energy here is curl energy i think fighters do this good fighters learn to do this between rounds sprinters learn to do this between events i think human should learn how to do this between any i sort of interval type activity including work shgagemen i men is such a powerful too do this for one minute after every important whether it is an individual high vital interaction or if it is as you listed a nice forty five minutes spent to work and your deep intort when ever find just give me one minute set your warm just one minute and that also well pay evidence i love it and as i said it is made o a outsize a different positive difference on my training but also activities outside my training which is for me ism not a professional athlete i train for health and because i enjoy it but when a really hard work out starts interfere with the ability do the other things in life that is not a good situation this is truly terrific there is a lot more in each of the those categories of strength and am hypertrophy but you have given us a tremendous amount of valuable information there maybe now would be good time to shift to endurance and of the four types of endurance i it maybe could remind us what those are what do you think or the two that most people are seeking or pursuing in terms of health and aesthetics right i ma realize that we probably have athletes out there as well but think am when i think health in the satins i think o cave the ability to do sustained endurance thirty plus minutes of some on going activity how does one maximize that work i water the modifiable variables and then maybe could tell us what the the other major category is yet that people ought to have in there ism kit when starting off with exercise choice one thing as soon as we cross into the endurance world and this is true for all for those categories exercise choice seems to be very concerned with eccentric landing you do not need to avoid it but you need to recognize it relative are compared against those other strength and speed once the volume is low osmose ones o you have some e enteric absorption its a ka but as we sort of talked about five minutes ago more eccentric means greater chance to muscle damage sorters if you take something and magnify it across thirty minutes or even five minutes but a maximal exertion you have a recipe for blowing up you can imagine i have not run and forever and have just of listen to this german lapodcas and am take omen to get into my down toe training whatever and i start jogging i mut do i no i remember when i was i used to built to twenty five and you just do a twenty five minute jog the a count of e centric landing that just occurred on every single step because you're never with running even slow running you are never have two feet on the ground the same time it is a one foot land one foot land your entire body mass plus gravity unto one leg at a time repeated now hundreds of times that e centric landing is gone to cost tremendous ornis you are quads a gin ta go your a probably genet shinsplints which is with this in those entirely cause by eccentric landing i in when the tissue is not ready to tolerate that if you are not landing correctly this is when ne pain happens back pain shoulder neckpain cause we compensation any time we start pressing to fatigue let us be very concerned with there mi initial i recommendation is start with activities exercise choicewise that are mostly concentric base think about a cycle when you are writing on a bike you are pushing the petal but you're never landing and absorbing it you could go out into a forty five minute bike die you are not going get that sore because it's not a lot a eccentric load ism swimming similar thing here wright there some eccentrics when you are hand it is the water but fairly menalmost mostly a push push push push push no load rowing similar thing mostly concentric ism pushing a sled is fantastic going up hill running or even walking hard up hill all good cause here very minimal landing relative to running down hill which you be a very very bad idea ism to start when if you are huh first jumping into these things progress your volume for endurance very slowly if it involves eccentric landing it really bad strategy we be to jump in and do say circuit training class tat involves a bunch of boxjumps right this is not a good way a to do your first bore ray into conditioning you are going to get incredibly sore because you are jumping in landing you are not looking at three to ten ex bodyweight in terms of absorption with a single land even if you just jumping be careful of that ism in any of those endurance areas of exercise choice what to pick pick the one the you are most technically proficient an becaueyoue into do it a lot its can be lot of re petitions whatever one you feel the most join if that is rowing great that is pushing a sled it does not really matter ism you can do this actually with weights as are preferred way by the way with our athletes we might do a thirty minutes circuit where we do a five minute farmers care my with a petty like ways you just in a carry some waits in your hand an us a walk up and on the street for five minutes ayouou just set that down and the your gong to do say a three minute plank and n you to pick that up when yu'regotg do body weight squats like slowly and just temple and you non do handful of different exercises the out the do not get paperboard or a very simple one at the thirtyment work out ten minutes on a tried tell ten minutes on a bye ten minutes on oral for those other a my got i cannot do thirty straight menus r running o break it up in to three or four different exercises that a all fairly save that is how i would do that long duration piece to it precise choice and then in terms of heart rat during that that period i mean how much mention should we pay to this i the don a very broad am prescriptive have thrown out on this podcast a for times pase on my real of the literature for most people that are orient toward health including people their working on size and strength gains i pertain strength of course a that getting a hundred and fifty two a hundred eighty minutes have called zone to cardie ye a can just have a cop just barely have a conversation but if one were to push any harder you would be able to that kind thing its just a as a a a generic recommendation that almost everybody should follow in order just keep their carry of vascular system healthy but i know there is a lot of new aunts there and some people would to be able to run continuously for an hour at speed right ism ye i'veyous not sprinting but what are some of the am finer finer points on yet long distance en durance i how often should one do it okay a frequency con do it daily i even when straight doing strength and hyper no question with i thing is an important point for people here cause a lot you will think thatched are going to greatly i finish their strength and hypertrophy and your gains as it is often called am by doing in is own to cardie on too you have almost no ability to block your hypertrophy don't too truly its really within that category if your talking about conversational pace there is very e fact there is strong reason to think that is not an influence hypertrophy for the overwhelming the dropping people an might even help it by increasing blood flow to the very absolutely a does it matter let say some one's doing primarily strength and hypertrophy there they are primary goals a strength and hypertrophy and then they are going to do they're gingko hit that hundred and fifty two a hundred eighty minutes own to cardie per week assuming their breaking that up into three or four sessions does it matter if they do it in the same work out before were after does that matter a i tend to do just by way of example for people certainly ism just one a one example i tend to do a resistance training one day then it'll do on to cardie next i jog cause that is the thing i prefer then it'll but do strain upper to re train the next day and then in jog for is own too cardie and then i take one full day off a week have never actually done the on to card on the same day but were i to do it on the same day would it matter if i did it before after my my strength of perch returning not really you are gin to be just find interference of facts the interference of fact is what the called this is all the way back o nineteen eighty a bob milkman stuff right and an he was actually working in a lab with john alarm whose one of the the fathers of exercised you chemistry and the sore the story goes it i hackman came in he was the strength training guy and and basin almost all those initial exist physiologist were conditioning folks right it is almost always swimmers and runners a that is why a bulk of the exercise physiology historically is is shaped in that direction in those sciences were interested him hackman was there in the cabin in the how much of this is myth or not whoretheyknows but the story goes i that this sort of chipping back and forth and yeuknohow from a piano stock can haw that rasing works little bit and eventually luck got unto running with us and he was you gossip lifting with me and con it goes back and forth well whens n that equation it is not the stock right it is the pe i gets tin is humans is okay finds we stretch running with lazy an n eventually such realize ism getting weak ism losing strength tan i got just can i think is his bench or specifically was going down or maybe a squat and can murder who knows it is even real but point is is going along and themintialy sorts to cat alible bit of animosity and is actually on is good for me and then banana and they did what any good sciences or do and said well let us find not right and that he run a really famous experiment where he took a group three groups one group did a a endurance piece r at the steady state party one group did a strength training piece and then the third group did both f those work outs combined not a reduction both both volumes stacked on top of each other and the results are fairly predictable in turns of the endurance group only had the greatest increases in view to mass an endurance marker is the strength training group by the greatest increases and most lie perjure but where the interesting part was an where this whole field started was the combined group since his concurrent training is what a generally called your going concurrent things and typical that means hypertry in strength stacked on top of some instar state durance in the same work same same same wort to our block or same weak it does not really i an be got find of all these well the concurrent group saw the same improvements in real two acts as the endurance group and he is like woke the strength training did not compromise the endurance adaptations however they saw much lower increases is strengthen i perform and it was the conclusion was the edition of endurance work compromised most of growth and strength development however the edition of strength training to your endurance work well not compromise your endurance gains now that second piece has been shown countless more times right if you an endurance ally adding strength training is almost always going to be massively beneficial very little chance of jecturemen for it is why every durance out ladies can have some sort of strength and power component to their training the controversy though came in the interference effects o how much in durance training really blocks muscular development and for ye reis myself included was we preached hard you do not do not do these two things at the same time a my friend my college even merit has as a really nice reveuarical jimmy barley those two gites put this sing found you go read that a were they cover all these things they have got some nice figures in the but the general answer here is interference effect is sort of real but it is probably greatly overblown it matters you talking about a twenty minute jog at conversation pase that is probably doing very little a with the assumption that are you doing in eccentric bass exercise running will then you can have more of interference effect than cycling that makes a tonocense if you think about a right what is your total energy in tic if your eating sufficient calories you can still be an anabolic state if the edition of extra energy expenditure all it really is mark the cardie put you in a negative energy state it is being it is goes become very difficult to go through cannibalism those things matter a if you are talking about doing running a few lapse around the tract as a warm up that is not interference effect what were really talking about as a big volume performed consistently now after hackman came out this paper paper nineteen eighty people followed it up in the nineties in to thousands with mechanism and we started o look and see we are to we ha there's this sell sideline pathway that goes down call m tor an d that is what leads to muscle growth and then on the other side of the equation as a thing call am p u which is more also cited with mitocondreobile genesis an endurance and there is as little molecular between at the time most people would point to t c too well turns out am you activation is fine if you active at m tour as no bearing on m p q but if you active a the m puts can actor a t my too which in hied tor and it was we had practical outcome i need hackman you are gingko get weaker now we had mechanism s that story became very very strong at this interference effect this is how science should work right when you see mechanism match up with practical human outcome strong as we on it was still wrong them it w just took more science right this is why we always have to give science a bit of time and a u have to be willing to to follow right and again even me in the field who has a practicing of background and science i felt very strongly this is a big problem it just dipterous to be the case a enough studies came out where my of it is probing not that biradial unless the east the movement is heavily eccentric base the volume is very high your trying to maim i most growth and energies not controlled if that is not all the case interference effect is probably not something most people should worry about a when you specially when you compare that against the well boundedness that you need for total physiological health probing to big o very reassuring me dear because i do enjoy lifting waits that i real my enjoy running and i love running outside i believe i used to experience the interference effect when i used to do a very long run on sundaes i would just go for out for you two hours or you that i do not know that i ate enough for who knows i was feel i enough for a more a my love to eat but that long sundae run always made it hard for me to make aggressive yum i gains in strength and hypertrophy in the him where as when i cut that to thirty minutes three or four times a week i do not see any interference of at at all probe cereal and i have not trained specifically for endurance in a very long time i do not i have not experience the non interference effect which as you said before most if not all endurance athletes probably a at leas should be doing some sort of strength wore just to keep the under carriage strongest i think yet there is buncariesi apostle t what are some photo calls that people could explore for continuous insurance training and ad have thrown out this under or fifty to under and eighty motion to cardie but that is really the u that is really the kind of kinder garden of endurance yum and there ism pro been generous is by the nursery school of endurance that every one should do what sorts of other photo calls i realize that can be very gold directed but is it unreasonable for instance for somebody to do four hours of z of continuous insurance training with intervals in there is well to get it kind of all around hart health and the ability to go long distances ye it'll answer this to is the very first one the tackle the the long duration endurance however pert f it i you asked really about heart rays on a to me that is almost wholly a tell of it it at does not matter right if you are moving your moving that is that is the functional piece here i i you want a push it and go at a non conversational pace that has tremendous health benefits if you ant o do it a litlebislower fine if you are out the pace where you can have a conversation to me i do not even count that is exercise that is not to is not a pejorative by the way i that is just general physical movement it is extraordinarily clear you need a lot of that you need a lot more that than we get you can do this in a couple of efficient ways just taking your one calls moving if you got a thirty minute call every day or most days the week and you can do that wile moving you have checked not that whole box but a pretty good trunk of it and that could even be done inside honor t resisting back and forth ism a big pacer the a yet you meet to you pro me saw me i come walk up and down all over the place i most the time when i m i my office working i come ism shuttle box saying i come to an airs close not even intentionally ism dislike you have one of those tread mills under the us i do not but every lab i ever came through somebody did we did an episode on at work space optimization and the date on those tread mills yo party interesting they evilly increase alertness for which for obvious reasons that even a low bit of movement is going a generate no not bit of a drennle and pacing around moving taking calls moving get a ox when you can and then in terms of building in durance i say somebody wants to quoting get into better shape yet they already mayor may not already have some size and strength that they are happy with and they just want i get in they want improve their health yet i weasel is that under fifty hundred an eighty but this thing tick over into a different photo call ye o case i think the way that i can outline a weekly schedule just as a conceptional model here i that longgeration stuff is not even counting as i mention i is to say this is what you need to do as a human for we have not improved if you are extremely unfit you may see some changes in cent of ask for help the for the most part this is just knocking out the general physical practice you need to be iron functioning whatever that time to mean is it only care i is is not a huge concern of mine what i think you need hit or these notes you need to do something once a week that gets you to a maxim hurried now i do not have to literally mean man but clothes this means really sucking for ever really as high as you can possibly get you can wear a heart my money if you want but maximum hart rate the the rough occasion we say is two under and twenty minister age if you are forty years old you are maxim hart rate is probably about a hundred and eighty beats per minute now i can tell you flat out right now i my man hart rate is close to to ten which means ism can years old take the number with a gran soul i have had a bunch of professional outlets who rein there twenties and the man harries one seventy five and they are way better shape than i am maximum hart raise is not a good proxy for physical kittens it is a rough number an easy way to do it as if you have a hartal wonder anything that do the hardest work out you can possibly do see what the highest number you get as as soon that is close that is if you wanted to start it two twenty master age that is fine to i do something thou where you yup this is death i this is really really challenge or hollow however long that take you that can be thirty second go on an sardine or air fault bike that could be a i i do on of the things where you kind i spent run as hard as you can her in the straight away on a track and lock the corners con of an old classic back when a you an i ere kids interval training they all do that ay more i guess i do not know how i we to talk about it in p class we had to change and if you did not bring running shoes yet to do it barefoot oh i love in a i love your teacher ye it was not a we or football baseball baseball teems were not that good but i only running cross country just just where i drew up o a brutal brutal coaches that yet they would make the the all kids do these runs yet it can be in the the thirty probably seconds at a minimum it it is hard to get you to a true heart rate man in shorter than thirty seconds you don't get to total sock an under twenty seconds but getting to a true hit ate maxis is probably to take more than thirty seconds it does not really matter what you want o do it can be again a spent up hill it could be w you are talking that con be purpose to death an whatever whatever you want to do till this havenanmy centric component i at et york ye no question about it i but if you do to actual death by the way if you just did in to do as many berpieceas i can for ninety seconds it probably will not take you much longer in that to get to close to and it is that do work out could be once a week get to bad art right touch it i love it touch it is not the best but it will it will work i and what are the specific benefits of that provides oo gan earlier in our an our chat we we outlined the run specificity specific at a poinadoptition to impose woman if you are never getting to that high of a pace you are never it would be trying to get stronger but only going to sixty per cent every party of ask or adaptation that o curs with gun masker training is to simply going to get to the toper end by doing this if you just start at the hart itself stroke volume increase thesis amount of blood that is end out our contraction a cardiac out put resting heart rate if you go o the epithelial function you are talking aby nitrickoxide release and you will thermal health in general i salary mot o conjure hallway down you just walk through the whole system bellman air exchange to the longs all of those are going to benefit by being challenge to their maximum it'll teach you were your vomit reflects ye right but do not know come stress is what causes adaptation right if you push your k here is a difference if you did twenty five minutes of steady state you are not challenging the same thing as what we just talked about ism the way that i explain this is if you understand the point the point of physiological failure then you understand the place of adaptation that is it if you and i both go run on a we do to both did a veal to matters classic veal two man tests is going to take eight twelve minutes and it isogon look something this or e beg n it in a treadmill and we are git a run and every minute ism an a to slightly increase that treadmill either the speed of the grate most the time its o speed right we we get to a high grades say ten per cent great or something and then we go five miles forgoer five point too five point four my and we just go until you cannot go any longer now lit say you an i did that and we have the same exact time frame and we we both went eight minutes ism the time you last is not the this that we care about right it is that this the volume of option that you breathe out is what determines it pellet say n t the same time to main and we hae the same vial to man to say hey ware both fifty mill leaders for kilegramper minute which is a will cat number but that is nothing to be extremely proud about just because we have the same number does not mean we have the same play point of physiological failure and this matters because it can answer the what do i do about it then question right if you got off and i and i s er t asking a series of questions and our and biscuits an while you quit and why why did you jump off the tread m why you stop and you were my chest i could not catch my breath i thought my heart was going explode look kind great if you ask me and i said my legs er on fire was breathing hard but i could not take another step this is a very rough indicator of different places of physiological is eruption now what have seen a lot with my professional treats special fighters there ten they are going to generally fail their legs becausethey do not often do a to of strength training in their legs they do not do a lot of leg work their fighting on their back literally a lot or on top around their need there there legs ten to give out before there some one who fails in the cart of askers system get say you did a lot of leg training ism typically can durance outing who that is not can be their issue it is this long to be the cut reach a heart raised ventilation threshold that is they can no longer handle if i put you on the exacting train protocols it is not can be is effective because you are going to always fail at your legs and never on always fail at there cotton asker system i need to flip that rightiyou need to put you in a position to where you can reach a true heart raid or ventilation challenge why your legs are still hanging in there ism or the opposite the training critical is based on that point of failure i the adaptation is in the same thing if you are failing because of your legs then you might see a greater increase in complinization in your legs relative to somebody else whose failing in their i cartivascosistem they may see a greater change in and something on that side f the equation that it matters how your failing at all times what i love about this is that it is it is sounds it is a thermometer for where one is week in needs work but also provides a stimulus to improve the very thing that you need that is that is the tewordan to just get real brass tax about it it would be once a week out ninety ninety seconds near maximum heart had it'll make what i do more could i do five or six of those ninety second bouts no question you can do ism is long as you touch that maxhart right ism good right i deal world probably four to eight in that single session ideal quit right if that takes you twenty seconds or ninth seconds it is fine ism if you out to do thirty on thirty off you ought to twenty on forty off forty on twenty out those numbers do not matter and is there an interference effect of this on the other sorts of train that we have tout a intends to be complimentary there there's the the evidence available suggest that this high inferable stuff is is more likely to be complimentary to perry training ism probably because i lactate and some other cool things ism which are very beneficial molecules of people on understand they they think it is bad it is actually a hugely beneficial thing am it can be interference can providing your friends if calories are not accounted for our forests on account of for and other things but in general it is it is probably of ism i would not at it to your equation if you do not need it for maximizing i petrify but for the person who wants you tistget well round i physiology the i would not hesitate am to do these even the same session or different sessions trifid and if that is done once a week and the hundred fifty to hundred and eighty minutes or of his own two cardies done in the rest of the week i y ever since doing their strain tan i perjury training we would hope what other sorts of endurance practices could one in corporate you mention muscular endurance the t e it would a wait or the ability do a plank yo was that is tat ombtlhing is that useful for anything yes that be doing planks and walls none it is extraordinarily useful ism let it hold on muscular durance i when a finish one more thing on this side if we are building this week of endurance ism once a week hit that number if you can do repeated bouts and we talk four to eight that is fantastic if you cannot muscle the the if you cannot manage the mental energy every week do it every other week it is still very good right cause i get it ism a working person too is sometimesyou dislike i cannot those work outs feel incredible afterwards but man they are daunting if you love the stuff you could do it four times a week if you hate it though it is not realistic to think you can beagle to knock this out you gan ain a doing seventy eighty per cent which is not can get youth benefit just do not do you really have to git that is you got get up there close i have some one chase i would say the ism i to wheldn' doing this this kind of work in in my mind ism thinking that ism easily being chase by somebody with it with a sringefull of poison yet and father other ways out of the situation and for the benefit of what we are talking about the one ism referring to is just just run yet yell my motivation is typically if you just get this done we are done in a couple o minutes just get done do not go here for nothing to do it went you show up check can ant's over really quickly breathing down regulation after hundred per cent you have to right it is easy turkey if you absolutely cannot do it do it every the we that is twice month you e twice month can be done on the road can be done at twenty minutes do really good thorough warm up do not just jump into those by the way right away it is not can be as beneficial really nice good sweat broke i really god warm up and then give me four minutes o hard work of ore done right get out o there ism if you want to use a bath or hot firmolstress to kind eight in that warm up process find getting us on i getting a hot bath we really hot get up there warm up nock it out whole thing is twenty minutes post five is breathing you rout i on it our doing this it is but you hot a pike right there have got els sort evereevery room in this tedious as he every piece of equipment it seems i want that once a week realistically every t week if i have to i want that physical activity piece call it what ever you want long duration thing id really you will do as much o that toughyour nose only you not tell do the interval stuff it knows only the men of do not new try but if you can go that whole thirty minute time or twenty or forty minutes whenever its can to be ism that is actually good way to regulate intensity go es hard as you can will still being able to breath though you knows only if you have to open up your mouth a little bit fine but try to stay there what you will see is very quickly you will beagle to increase your work out put while just bringing trails which has a bunch of other be not to benefits the other piece i want is this middle ground which is can you sustain hard work for at to twelve maybe as little's four minutes it'll give you four to twelve minutes is does not have to be quite as high as the first one you do not have to get to hart in man but can you get somewhere in the eight percent range and can you hold that for four minutes maybe give me two minutes two minutes o rest and do that twice something that i ideal situation is what a runner would do is will all mile repeats cause they're running four or five minute miles whatever time it takes this to finish they call arrest that to one to one work to restoration five minute mile rest five minutes and go again that is probably pretty unrealistic for a lot of folks that well the five minute part is unrealistic for most of ever may oud be in a eight minuteseight minutes fine probably something thenar particular case just do height hundred meter do eight or meters you something that takes two to six minute to work i it is a lower intensity than the man of but is a much higher work load ism that is probably going to give you you might even argue the most can of ask your benefit because it is sustained work out put and that is very critical the downside of kind o that conversational pace it is physical activity it is movement it is blood flow with emphatic drainage it is not very card of asker challenging the your you are just not gin to get an optime health am just walking actively two to six minutes of a hard work of hard work with then an equivalent amount of rest in between then then repeat how many terms once if you have to if you needs to be one rap if an easy be a six minute thing and then down wiggly breath twice if you can do that six times eight times whatever whatever you can really do and you can just take that this long of the training session as you want or short ism exercise choice can be what eve you want again you can do sold pushes or could be a kettle bell circuit or any combination of things where you are just your working andyou are not giving yourself an break you have got to be able to hold on at a very high waste product production level was well as a hide demand for energy and then bring it down and breathing during this two to six minutes of a hard a output is mainly through the nose or combination know and mouth real tat getting too technical wells probably i it but you tell me if its technical ism your going to try to maintain nasal only as much as you can but you can lose it a some point ism is you you go through the bran an and robs our system and learn more and you can sent counsel what you are o be in if you have to go nose in mouth out or something that but i do not really care to much honesty in that range ism getting most of my need only stuff at night and training in everything if you have to open up the throttle there to get the work done that is o oh then noble actually go to your ante your question which was must an burettes go back that piece muskier endurance is incredibly important for general maintenance of point health an other words ism you have got form follows function right it is a very classic science he physiology saying meaning you have got a couple of different there is a bunch but to make it easy two different types of muscle fires fast twitch and slow twitch faster fibers tend to be but there not always bigger they contract wit t a hire velocity it is why they recalled fastwitch but they tend to be more lithic and thus fatigable slow twitch are tend to be smaller they'll not always they're more pact it mine of contrary there were generally better it burning fat as you'll but contract it lower velocity well we have these two type that we can regulate function for you have some muscle groups that were going to for i we go back up a quick secondeach individual muscle in a human body has a combination of some amount of fast and some monolog that percentage of fast for slow differs from muscle tho muscle it also differs from person to person easy example is your calf musclthere is there is three but there is two primary muscle in your calf once all the loveliest one's a gastric the the gastric is one or if you take your toe and point at toward your face and then fleets that is the one that pops out yuan on the medial side the inside the loveliest ta we call an anti gravity muscle and it is generally about eighty per cent to eve ninety per cent slow twitch and that is because it is supposed to be contracted lightly all time must be on permanently it is it is man to keep yo we call it anti gravity cause it is meant to keep you erect up and moving your spinal erectors supposed to do this various muscles for postural or are generally slope with muscles stresses be on all times not produce fast not produce force but do not get tired the gas rock is the opposite it is not activated very often but hone is activates it is meant for extreme propulsion this gives us the ability to reach up and scratch our eye ball and also punch somebody right we have to big to regulate foresaw but which is going back to hangman rid controlling what we use when we do not use while also not wasting energy which is the the downside of activating a big threshold motor non is it is it requires a ton of energy ism more efficient mote of energy but the total amount is really really high muscular en durance is going to help those slow twitch muscle fibers and slow twitch predominant muscles maintain they are working job if you lose your muscular enduranceability in your spinal erectors are your calf against our slumping into bad positions your going to be getting a putting joints in in am movement pattern that they are not going to be the most happy wit it is more than about than be able to dis maintain a two minute loquat it is about maintaining integrity and allowing that muscular sure cannot fatigue when you ask it to do heavy and fast what i mean by that is you have got a whole combination of muscles in your shoulder and we will jenlycoltes the road theater coff muscles well let us imagine those slow twitch postural muscles get fatigued and they strict to lose contract title mention and then you to do something heavy or fast or an injury situation those are already free fatigued you can relying more upon the fast with musulfibres which are there less for posture integrity you are likely to get out a position and this is a whole recipe of to is my show their is hurting got my back that is very often a case of the sold with fires the sullies muscle groups losing muscular endurance been to build that backup that they can control and hold the joint in the position n the fast which fibers icanincontracted force ism hoping that what ism to say next meats of what you said a accurately my experience is that getting injured a lifting wags or even doing house work or yard work almost always happens when ism not paying attention fatigued that is kind of obvious but also getting imposition to initiate a movement setting down weight or lifting weights off the rack or or picking up dumbbells that is almost always when i seem to activate this lower back thing that happens every necklace or eight months and what you are saying if i understand correctly is that this muscular endurance from wallets or planks or things of that sort may be ogive us a few other examples he of of these can helpless because they actually prepare the system to do what we normally think of us the more intense work it is it is really that it sounds its really the architecture of of the body tatincludes nerves and muscles andeverything else of course that let us there limbs and another kind of action end of the body do do its best work ye legit rest its own power and force yet we have actually landed on one of my final laws of strength condition which is similar to one i steer her right i said exercises do not determine adaptations application determines at station sound similar but it is quite different there are no good or bad exercises there is only good or bad application here is a great example of that my you i not get hurt dead lifting because deadline are dangerous you only get hurt dead lifting because you either got in bad position you got bad position because youeither started in bad position this is one of thing you just said or you ended up in bad position you did too much volume you did too much intensity or you did too much complexity those last three things all hurt you because they result in the first one which is out of position or another way think about this if is not a a invisible change in position is stress got put into a part of the system that should not absorb that much stress you did too much of it you did it too heavy you got fatigued and you broke position you got too heavy see you broke position you you made the exercise too complex you put too many moving parts in it you put too many joints in it and you got on a position you did that too many times over time now we have led for either in acute injury am your back pops and you foronfloor or dislike man as thing is hurting over time all these the result the same thing you cannot ever blame the exercise for causing the problem is always either the user or the coach you programmed to way too much here and i cannot handle that position or you yourself when into i too much if you are getting is little tweaks and in problems going on you have made an error in one of those things simply back off reduce the complexity right i got yourself portability less moving parts do less volume do less intensity in fact if you look at the people from the physical harpy world in terms of the pain literature it is very clear that just stopping a movement is very rarely going to work but you wanted to was back off all the way down to just below that threshold of that is what aggravates it and you want a train right there that is going allow you to do two things and we one tissue tolerance and the number two deesentinization a lot of pain summand you can prove speak a lot about this is especially things low back pain is there is not necessarily often much damage there it is a lot of hypercentitization i just painting a pain signal oh wanting the movementirely does not get that signal till why you need o train just below that signal and desensitize it you want to make sure that the musk endurance allows you you've just putting volume right below where you start to get a twin and it is beautifully effective for that have experienced this right side lower backpaint for years sometimes shooting down the hip the two things tat really helped a we are doing after to work you a hat's off to geese over to sky and trick who hasn't ouzo crate a lot of popularity round y am tie work but i turns out joints full range a motion you're about spot lethe something about stabilizing the stuff from the knee down help my back and then also some some network and a friend's in are always teasing me that my him is filled with t the most bazaar equipment inn doesn't look any other ta lot of is just design to keep me healthy an and still training but a i love this idea of of getting right at the below the threshold of pain activation and not simply going into to complete a non action or just taking nearly ask as that action can be detrimental a it'd love to talk about a few items that support training of all kinds and where there is a lot of confusion and indeed a misconception and mystery and just get your take on these and and i just want acknowledge at the outset that for some of these there is a lot of science for some of them there is less science but there certainly is a lot of am experience in in your sampan and those categories or cold heat and hydration ah because obviously whether not your runner or whether not your staring training you are human being i you been to hydrate a but in terms of work output and a physical work out what may be incognito work out but may we tackle hydration first i there is what i what i call a i think is now come to be known as the the gasping equation which you really do deserve credit for because i think that pea pill am realize that there are range of solutions out there but there is a really a desperate need for a straight forward solutions that work for seventy five per seven people seventy five per cent of the time hydration is key babe you could under score just how how key it is for us and then what is the galop equation as as i call it that i think others are now referring to it ye get ism benefits ifidration slash consequences of a mishidration we that dehydration romeo physiology has or mediccurvs my not give by thy we think about this intromstoxicology what this means is at some point giving you a dose of something a testosterone very easy example if you are clinically deficient or low into stostron and i give you a little bit in i brings you back no normal range you generally see an improvement in health and functionality taking you though from normal to superfine does not always necessarily provide additional benefit in fact if you continue to go its can to provide detriment had everything has is cur and then some things are hermetic stresses which means i gave a small short fast insult is actually beneficial because you come back bigger faster i stronger and that is how i station works basiccor mes came vibrations the same way at the end the curve here if you are under hydrated by all know you could i right you have to have things in fact water is the only thing that is you ubiquitous across biologist in terms of every living thing has to have it there is no other video in mineral neutral that is required among all living things with exception of water that you give you a pretty good indication of it is important right you it a have this thing down here the bottom if your d hydrated i give you more its beneficial effects however if you are up the top already and i continue to give you more water pass that now we run into actual problems and we can give what is called camp on a premium it is more common than people realize the uremia being actually not referring the water but that the sodium concentration being too low and you have probably talked about that a length of of why that is an issue if soda batascium balances inside outside sell come off you hardtops i must contraction ends an all these sing some you do not want to be over or under my dated understanding the this rough equation i of loosely calculated one day is helpful for that ism i think the most context is is talking about how much water to drink throughout the day and how much water to drink during exercise the the very easy answer is half your bodyweighten ounces per day is a very loose guide lane for total amount of fluid consumption if you a two hundred pounds aim for a hundred ounces of water i a very easy number if you hit that you probably soy ninety per cents our good night present the time alone if you then go to exercise you need tan account for that fluid loss with exercise and in general you want to consume a hundred and twenty five per cent to hundred and fifty per cent of the amount of weight you lost in fluid another words if you worked out and you were two hundred pounds naked and you an did your work out and you dried off and you weighedyourself again and now you are hundred ninety eight pounds you lost two pounds of water as thirty two ounces you want to drink back about a hundred and twenty five per cent of that staid of drinking thirty two ounces i want should drink forty forty two forty five something this is one the reasons why is unless you are drinking something that is have tonic meaning the same exact concentration in your blood that your in your fluid you are just gingko go closer that hop enter uremia you argon to get a bunch of barer defector reflect responses and you are going to actually think you have to much fluid an you can you are next it out wits i not weighing myself before an after work outs and om is there a short hand version of this that you know after training for an hour i should drink at least exrevounces yet that assuming it is at at cat of it installer you no ism not sweating superheavy yet in that particular case you could probably got something if every one in the world dis i twelve to twenty ounces that is probably pretty decent and they are probably doing that ye ye and when not electurolights aid consuming salt potassium and butut that thing only works though if you are coming in at of the migration then this is the problems is why you have to you have to flag this starting with a good total daily myth water because if if you are coming in and you are all i drink two or three glass of water a day then you might we need to rink fifty or sixty ounces postwar out could your weigh behind that all twelve ounces or works if you are already generally very well hydrated and if people are drinking youon't for to six glasses of water day but they are also drinking a lot of affine in any form than they are going to be creating wore water in most cases right well because affine of dramatic of skinny is but jinni is not either it is not the diabetic that we used to think about it as i it is still fluid consumption it is only a diabetic if it cause you to street more fluid than actually was being antic i if coffin in take is in a normal range i do not i don't have to worry about the diabetic effects if some one is drinking twelve cups of coffee day it work work an other taking affine pills or something now the excretion is on out kicked the coverage now we are now probes rectus there's no fluid consumption with the affine pill in general things tea sumption ism not superworried about those things you can count those torture total total fluid and take if you want s if you are i drink sixty ounces of water blue twenty ounces of coffee and then now this i you can ad not all happen your to be totally o k natural for you also have probe with synthetic forms of coffin were natural forms of affine natural forms are are a pretty o k you lost not et camera ye all that settle form as were it gets drink always e always right general i eat real food and things you be just find ism the last priest to consider is you are diet quality matters because i the fluid content in your food can very wildly something a bagel i might be you five to ten per cent water or something a water melon is ninety eight per cent ninety five per cent something in a huge rain even meat is very high per centare a fluid in tike i get to really high even after you cook it there still a lot of food in there if you are eating a whole food mostly whole food basedyet you are in erogenous hydration is actually pretty high already just from your food if you are eating a very highly process de hydrated overrated diet you have your way low on hydration just in your food you have to fact or all these things in a fact one things that happens to us constantly with folks that go from a highly process low quality diet to a high quality one is it just the just pean on stop what the hills going on will you are actually have brought in sixty additional dances o water an your diet relative of what you used to have and you have gone from ten grams is sodium there to four to two sometimes once sometimes yet is a very low cause you are not salt are you salting your food no of a well we do not have sodden take that we weigh down everything that were considering is based on thus lets as some some one's eating a a pretty well balanced i at their drinking six dances o water n may be taffy in coffee in to e things that i we do not exactly know the total amount of sodium oneshun and take it is very clear high sodium concentrations are still associated with a lot of negative health out comes especially in combination with for physical activity and combination with lawful quality and all the comobinities that is a very bad thing you need be very careful about those things ism if everything else is o ka we're cape playing of the little but higher salts in fact your you are probing to feel better you run to feel generally pretty good i you just it seen to be very clear if you are over weight highly stressed and you do not have lot of the things ticked off and you have known cormobidities you really need to pay attention to salt an take can be very nasty ism that being said what were generally going to look at folks is are you at least can we categories you is a low sodium or high sodiumswater if there is a whole list of electrolights you can look a that are gong to have something two hundred o foreign milligrams preserving there is a whole list o these things ism if you are low sodium sweat are you are unprobigana send you after one of this if you are high sodium swedes there's a lot of elect lie supplementsthat are closer to six or eight hundred even even a whole gram ism persingle serving size you want to play with that ism a very if your low sodium for high sodium solder we ash have at episode on salt we put out dead work coming out soon if has not come out already which is i when look a the hazard ratios you have salt and take i basically your probability y of really bad things happen to you goes way up as you get towards you would a lot of sodium in taking ten twelve grands o a day and i it and this is translate the teaspoons of fault et camera but also very low sodyouman take is a problem no cloviti i say it is not a perfectly you shape it is cut of a jay shape a server a cut a hockey stick shape more r less but ism how would i know if ism a low sodium high sodium we seen goat just a win my sweat or have someone else no hand the you find a superfriend wo lick your sweat for you a same wow no no willing volunteers that ism aware of but would i be able to tell yet ism you can get what testing done actuallyouhave a a number of options ism the kind the original one that most of us use in the background for many years as called lebylin ism they will send you out a little patch a were that and in the lab and the they will measure at directly lav i sent a back is a hundred an fifty buck sir do deny into low medium an high many the'reget at do that there on to go you very there can to tell youexactly the milligrams and and the fund actual tell you what products as stuff and ism that they are exactly match you do this with that with professional laugh we have many times yesterson ism you can do a more consumer great version gathered has a patch for twenty five books you can get two of em you can put that cat patch on your left forearm and down all the gater at and you can do a work out measure right there and click it over and the willtell you exactly not only hired with again the will tell you the milligrams of sodium they're in your sweat and unit can figure out again in a high medium or or nonstop they much better on ay a slightly higher sodium in take most be ism but in my cobrhidrate i do ecobridrates one one of those that it is pretty moderate by rhinal clean food i i notice an i tend to be slightly low blood pressure again to literate that the warning there that if somebody is a presa pretensions has i pretension n robes you really you need to be careful with your sodyouman take but many people seem to find that they feel better when they increase or sodium in takin there still in that healthy portion of the have ratio most of the ashes is a in general undergo higher in salt when they come wen run the stuff were hand fault all almost always a very few times have i got ow when you cut this back when the exceptionathat once tat come in tat he porting feels an o mi i get your fifteen milligrams artery fifteen grams a day causey are eating nothing but garbage work to come down yore to fill way better and all this bloating and everything else that can a happen go down'youcan do that there actually more there by l censers that are coming out ism there are not a available yet but there coming very soon in this space the can be i give you real time matrices on ism salt you can pay attention to those i have not seen one use when personally i do not want a ism thispous but how hooter bat it is but i know that those are coming i from handful of companies an easy way to do is just look at ism wear hat or wear some sort of head band or something and do your work out take it off if you see a just huge white band or if it is completely clear and that is can tell you big white band you are probably a high saltwater completely clear very little coming out that is great an out i can see the the posts on histogram now people showing there there salt band of from from from sweating sissy salt is is essential for many physiological functions you soft want too his e too low but if you are losing more make sense yo would need to take in more half of my body was in ounces as a just foundation of of a fluid in take coffee an tea could be included in that but that should probe mostly water or think similar to it i what and then during exercise you the how do i want to think about this again let us ay am a let us ay him a high salt out put than id want to drink may be forty ounces water with or wore more yet it'll get i'll'll do this easier om let us talk about free and signposts what to drink or if you you come in having hit these rules you are drop and are work out can be as little as five or six ounces easily a couple sips of water fine ism if you come in poorly highdrated than you may be need to go more twelve but here is the deal if you start off a session in a bad spot you are not in a can catch back up you u just you are you are in trouble let us say you come in you did you fall a direction five hundred milligrams salt before five hundred telegrams after a very easy rule a pick whatever source you want that is a couple of sprinkles of table salt if you want him a land that is fine you will have two hemilans actually a fairly low sodium salt is not the best for for this purposes ism if you are her salterswatter little more if you want to go choose an elect light of which there are infinite ism you can look on the packet and it'll tell you you two hundred fifty milligrams for serving or four hundred or six hundred or when rapidly but around five hundred pretty five whenterposts is a very general rule and then during is thinks to you i my famous galloping equation now that is is all the world it'll i did as i took the literature in a said leave in general the research shows pretty clearly two milligrams for kilogram byway tor fifteen men at seems to put yogin a pretty con spot most people do not think about kilograms or millers kind just run that over and the turns out it is about your body weight to bide by thirty an ounces that that is all you have to body weighing pounds divided by thirty ye exactly right you weight two hundred pounds divide aby thirty and that is number ounces you known to go every fifteen or twenty minutes ism getting that amount every fifteen to ye twenty minutes throughout the training found now in the wit room that is pretty easy to do yes there rest intervals but you people will need to do this while running your cycling i and that can cause a la bit of master distress if you are not use to it is i right you can you can learn to run with it with some water in your belly you hundred per cent the gut is very trainable in a lot of directions but in terms of fluid as well as carbohydrate which another thing that is gingko get people ism but that is the out very trainable it will be in comfortable unnaturally but you'll you will quickly get into it the better solution for those folks just calm in high traded an you do mightn't evened my water you could probably per form just fine i the ones that do not have as much of an opportunity you really have to emphasize walking in ism we have this problem with our professional golfers they've plenty of time to drink water but there is focussed on the shot an there is a lot of variables coming out once o hit their shot and moving on the next one they are thinking about i me the going over score card of a hundred eighty five yards away can i go a hundred eighty four an a half yards in go undid e six yard what is a slope without we was the wind up here was want up there was like it is just the just thinking and they just forget you've now they have four and a half hours we have to make sure that they immediately get off the course we go right into recovery it is hard as we possibly can they wake up the next morning there good spot we crush recovery and now's i a if you can remember to drink this great if not were still fine if it is not a ideal and you have time in a a a lifter because i do it that probable riders to i we can only drink much in the mil of a fight i couple sees o there but we we cannot go mix i two milter si can you get couple sips an yet i yet forgotline s no can happen we have to take more news is before and after start your re cover process immediately and then come in the next day that is your window and then whateveryou can get in during the work out that is fine to if you are a higher salt sweater set on five hundred five on hundred may be o seven fifty seven fifty if you have a longer bout of exercise especially if it is hot ism or humid then you might want to consider some salt in the work out as well and three hundred milligrams turn the work out totally fine ism it is a enough if it is a really long work out and it is really hot you are going to lose pounds during it you need a specific stratify if you don't lose less than a pound you soft new to work about it you can be is not n to be enough of a detriment for you really care ism that is a kind of a rough rule now if you are two hundred plus pounds may be that number moves from one pound e two pounds but really the number will look out is what one percent of your bodyweight if your losing more than one percent of your bodyweight we need start carrying if it is less the one percent it is not can really paid out much of a difference a for myself i because i do not get supertedncle i do not wear any devices besides a risk watch to what i watch thanks i ye do the very attached to this waters attached to me i suppose my body weighing pounds divided by two that is what ism a try and get across the entire day as a cold of base line and then my body weigh all we n pounds divided by thirty during the work out y every fifteen or twenty minutes that ism going to try and consume that amount and then i definitely do better when i increase the amount of fault that ism taking in an we have five hundred to a a five hundred pilgrims to a graham of fault am several times a day actually but i not eating that stand which leads me to another question which is i prefer to train fasted or see me fasted meaning firing in the morning a h or within an hour two of waking we ivy seizin passing where i m just sleep or having not eaten anything for three or four hours before i just feel lighter in tie mortar our energetic a if that works for me s that o car a or should i try is it better to eat something before one trains personal preference easy easy answer there it depends on of course how hard you trained well the training was was port your involved with how many till it counts to seta but in general personal preference for the average person the or handles nine present of the yet questions about that cold cold showers ice was and cold immersion up to the neck i always a prefaces by saying there are not a a lot of studies there are some but not a lot of control studies looking at cold showers cause its harder to control the variables of where people stand i would say if you have access to cold immersion of some sort ice bathricald immersion gray but if you do not cold showers would be the next best thing the lord goes that if you do an ice bath or cold water immersion after strength or hyperon training that you are short circuiting some of that the lore also goes that cold showers might be o ka and my interpretation of those data and that discussion is that all that is probably true but i have a hard time imagining that the effects are robust that it can completely prevent strength gains and hypertrophy such that my stands for myself is try and do the cold exposure training away from the strength and hypercofy training but if you cannot do it any other time right afterward probalising in a throw my whole system at a wack and prevent the improvements n my deluding myself i couple caveats sooner or one i to say have a personal tested interests and cold i been around this so for a long time i being involved and being an adviser for ex t and being a space a long time of a big believer in cold special cold water deliberate cold exposure hundred percentright that being said a i do thank getting in to an ice bath immediately after a hypertry session is getting pretty close to you just should a done the session it is detrimental good to know i would not do it i guess is the most bluntly to put it om if you ere ha i i am not superconcern with growing muscle and i want these other things a come with cold waterimersion fine it is not a hear is not zero its not taking you backwards how much does it cut you down i do not know we don't know that did be a difficult number to come up with is it one percent production now it is more than that is it a hundred not even close i do not know where it lambs though it is enough though for me to go in general best practices do not in the ice i mean i after work out how long should i wait well in theory the best once we count give you would be for hours because of what we talked about earlier to day of of going all came immediately you have got the signalling cascade that takes seconds you have got gene expression that is happening in this rough for our window after the genes of gone often now you just going to the broaching synthesis process the signals word be there in it is gone back down o baseline then reintroducing a introducing cold here is not gigot disrupt that signal that is a very i non scientifically founded because we do not know at this point at all what is very clear those if you get off your work out go right ne the ice it is probably ten per cent a tentation of growth i don't no maybe more depends the person some people if you look at the individual data it is a pretty bad it is enough to words that that is a really big deal the benefits of the ice i do not think now oft way the benefits of of typertrbe training what about cold showers i do not think cold showers arguing to do much ism if you have been in both that this is ere not plying the same game here an ice bath or cold wat or true cold water immersion up to the neck with limbs in if for one to five minutes is a completely different stimulus than in the cold shore especially also compared i similar trial it is not even the same same thing here ism in general i would say do not do those cold shower i do not really care can you work it outside do not do them same time that'uld be my hope right ism i wold actually prefer you the cold before i you really had to do it ism certainly all wait you up you attain burst no we have place without actually years ago ism doing that ism there is actually some funstuff you can do with the endurance piece with cold stuff but it it is totally not feasible for most people could get at o gearing water everywhere that can jump on your by can just get shit and insist a giant mess it is fond met yet i would say walkwayfremit if you can that is actually s where i stand based on the data ism base on my intuition and inexperience i do not it'll hike is a good thing to do now having said that that is mostly concerned with maximizing hypertrophy strength it is not as clear there are some date to show it out block strength at stations but because of we we take but earlier than mechanisms and that drivers are different and i do not think it is as big a concern ism fore strength development though i would still generally safe you can get away with staying out of the ice immediately after the work out and you can least wait a few hours that is the better approach less concerned with strength more concern with hypertrophy and terms of interference effect ism if you can do it on off days or before or any other time that is that is the place to land that is generally when i tried to do it it's jut's got it throwing out extreme case as i get as that question a lot what about the use of a ice bath or cold water immersion we are cold shower after endurance training oh get a couple of interesting things here you mentioned we do not have a tremendousmon a data on cold water emergent over all a lot is is moving ism there have been some papers to show that cold water emerge and cannactual in hands monocondrobal genesis and actually even for endurance stuff it is been showing to cause improvement endurance adaptations relative to not it is not enough for me to be truly confident and the sateen yet i would to y that repeated not not that i have a problem with the paper the methodology that that use an to optic or study but is us s i is a weird things i want see this repeated more often i have less concern with doing in immediately post in durance cause you could even argue that there may be some benefit i do not think you need to gout your way to try to make your eat an ice immediately afterwards and thinking you can to get some mass of adaptation ism we use ice a decent amount when i can get aglet to do it but this contact is different number one when we are in camp and we have got a world title fight coming out or something else ism we have just pitched in it and a man r based game i am not concern about hypertrophy i am not even concern a strength o element am now pushing tort recovery there is a paradise that i think its important with all these things understand which is are your pushing for optimization adaptation when you are pushing for adaptation you do not want a block the signal for adaptation this means less recovery you not going to feel as good and you probably should be hedging towards stress when you are pushing for optimization it is the opposite i if ism in season and i had a picture just throw a hundred and twenty fiptitthes ism not trying the cause adaptation ism trying to recover as quickly as possible because four days from now we got to do this again and i got to do this across a hundred and sixty two games i i you con a play sixty five days in a celiac off tournament and you can have to do it again every week for a bunch weeks in about i need recovery as fast as i possibly canso for blunting adaptation fine ism non ectrytine to do son am try optimize if you spend all your time in one of those two areas you are going have problems you need to be judicious about thinking is this a point mi life or training cycle that i want to cause adaptations or am i trying to optimize you spend too much time in won one the other ones again you can have problem that is in generally how i will treats ism the ice for for all those adaptations what abut heat yet when the n frame this question differently because i ism sure there are number of ways in which heat can short circuit all sorts of things i mean he can in access can kill you ye it can shut down fertility it can a in access right it can do all sorts of things but it can also increase growth common increase is a violation improve one's ability to set which can be very beneficial in a number of contacts meteor the typical for seventy five per cent of people seventy five per cent a the time when do you think heat is most useful and here ism referring to drys on or wets on a ism not specifically talking about in for rets on o because the dato there we and clear to me and i i do not even know that my cense with him for atisawnus as they do not go hot enough for my particular taste you and i have a similar taste there one a not crushing two hundred past on ism not interested right and in my cense o about i for rets on a is that maybe have not seen the data s that i but that a lot of people it cause they the way they look in the an forest on it feel school feels your doing something unusual now in for end lifetime beneficial for other reasons i can for my to conjugal health in the ratings er it the good a a but i for red sauna to me they never goes hot enough ism talking about two hundred or hot er maybe a hundred eighty two twenty obviously do what safe folks and heat all the warnings about pregnant ye people not going she et camera i soon by your lumping in hot water merchants hot water mersiana hot baths hot san a when would you when you think most people could leverage sand or hot baths to benefit their training and fitness and and health ye of i have a handful of things say about this topic one of em is you never have a hard time convincing people to get hot et don't feels good i can hot both lite can you take more hot showers sure i no problem they are right i there are a handful of studies that of look at this immediately post and it seems to even augment hypertre after hyper of to train and getting in the a enough for twenty minutes yoga whatever whatever needs to be i we do not have a good titration what is the number men its wise we soft have a temperature migration hot shower would would be a second that would be a week second best i would say to very week say a hot bath i think a hot bath its probably a lot closer to what you are looking for in actual con t goes back to our initial conversations theoretically you are just going to aid an blood flow seeing to put more neutrino in more waste erotic out meltable express all that stuff is going through that is the thought any ways we e far from talents plausible absolutely possible ism something people will do feels good ism why it is a with cold and hot i want a caution you against a couple of things this is true across all physiology but you need to be really careful about moving percentages from molecular to outcome very careful for example it is easy to see a paper i that says of kine we put you in hot bath or something and we saw growth hormone increased three hundred percent that is not going to result an three hundred percent increase and muscle size right in fact threehundre per cent mi results in absolutely no change in physical size right and reason of saying this is because it a lot of people in the space that will misapply the mechanisms and the tho grossly over estimate what these things can do in what they do do because they will find something that ism you know this you have done no sell your work to in the lab if i see am toward doubled i i think seitan work i been to see tennis increase before i notice even physiologically relevant reading that paper reading some on social meuplesier what it increase am there thirtyeight per cent ism didn't work you are what t huge that is not thirty eight per cent increase in also size stat's a very important point when i make because men a talk about the benefits here a second but ism i do we i don what people be fooled an to thinking that this is some crazy miracle ism the same thing with the son i in terms of general health healthful comes it is a clearly a beneficial thing this is a really good idea to get hot a lot it is not a substitute for exercise to it is a very important t ancient if the aunt if the options are nothing or sand get in the san really really good idea if to the exchanges though i soft need to work out because i did the sand bad this is not a winning solution you and i don't know som maniacs that actually work out in the san i we do ya no i do not necessary recommend that that actually u would probably kill a a large number of people but you canthi d can be worked up to ye it certainly yet i we every time i talk about that i i flag that because it is just too easy he that go oh i think doctor you were in said if i just get the san i ism have to work out no the is worth of never devil is i that and i fully not working out in the sand if ism in the san on either sitting or ism lying down and ism trying to make it through i tend to do three twenty minute bouts ye a cross the entire week i aim for sixty minutes per week yet of heat exposure i would be juonnton if i said have never worked out the sea us you are one of those ya he will do air squats the will bring the air dim bike in there ism i look at the san as kind of a time to get lazy in thisweat totally find ism going back to o question potential right possible a we ne just see more revs for drawn that to really get in do not i to put the some practice i think if you try it very little harm i g struggle to we it downside if you makes your hydration on quoit right now you got a factor in the fact you just kicked out to re three pounds if you're you at two in er plus pounds i soon or roughly i f you've in the son for twenty minutes i would imagine you in do two three pounds i usually i ism hover somewhere round ti two twenty five ye i drink i i drink a thirty two ounce right we s water with the electrolyte solution that is pretty high fault afterwards and sometimes during and sometimes after that if i do it late in the evening it'll go to sleep and wake in the mill night wet just feeling parched it is amazing how much will one loses in the sand like a normal sweat rate for someone two twenty five especially and twenty minutes on a sand i would absolutely expect you to do three pounds easy without i should be breathing more probably even more water yet you are probably half the water that you need to get and you mention the the possible benefits of doing it after straight hypertrophy training which are make sense for plausible merinos yet reasons and not no official at o their yet what about after endurance training assuming somebody hydrates well enough and their not over heated from their endurance work ye could also be a benefice i more and more would ism thinking the framework here is in an ideal world one would train and then do sand y or heat exposure of some kind in during training wore strength hypertrary training another u sand and then do cold exposure on off days are at least four hours away from the from any kind of training or if you had to do it close to train doing t before train ye i love the cold the morning a we fact sure on this experiment on professional to thing till we of not tracking with things gate our pea which is a globe metric of over all fatigue oke and you've your prove talked about that before a bit problems with it bit roughly idea wrote at be in general higher the score the better rid low patrol es fatigue i well if you wake up and take your ahtrof e in the morning and in you get into ice what is gong to happen is you an see that number plum et the second you get out that is going to fall off the earth with means roughly you have moved into a sympathetic a place surprising you get in thirty degree water you gun to go very sympathetic very quickly however if you continue to watch for antre of e for thirty sixteen ninety and up to two to three hours post you will generally see a in improved eight ore of you score relative to where you started it is it is back to this aromatic stress are right a really cold shocking exposure we will be a net result of you being more relaxed throughout the day in genre and we have seen that now a very consistently y cross years with what amply i i think it is a great weigh to structure day you will not need nearly as much coffee after spending three minutes and thirty degree water the degrees is pretty person n cold i was in the ocean this morning for about three minutes the dell lion bring a thermometer but it fell somewhere in the low fifties but fifty moving as really cold yell water's moving ye i that is really cold that is right the thermal lay that at that a surrounds you when you sit still in a cold water immersion ism incurring people now if they really i was the joke that you people to look real stoic and tough when they are in there there just grinding through with no pain it all but that the stillness is actually of reducing the ye the stimulus if they sift around a little but you break up that thermal lair that is where the real action we weave joked about this for years do fifty degrees with the whirlpool jet on now am in pressed tat that is hold you sit in thirty five degree for three a minutes digest but with expect have seen i cannot eve tell you how many hundreds of people from all walks a life on all age that we have been able to get in thirty some degree water for three minutes fifty degrees with a hornbill going that number gets very small yet if you do not have access to a whirlpool this is this should be reassuring to you can some people say i do not have access to ice and ice cannot she get pretty expense of you are doing a fifty dollar i a a everyday you can fill your baths up with m cool to cold water get in but just make sure that you keep sifting your limbs and it it is chilly ye and this the studies on the very well step now well establish increases and dopamine an pan efferent that a cur in cold water sporule rashly done at an hour in sixty degrees fair n ye and it you do not necessarily need at ice cold or an ice bath but immersion is really better than the cold shower the cold shower is kind of a it is the it is it is kind of the express shot the aversion yet no that is the its sort of funny use if you look out most of those natural studies and you think man how did they get people to sign up to spend forty five minutes in fifty five degree water fifty five degrees is cold on if is not moving an o gan an not spend five minutes ant a begin hour if you have ever don ice basis at that temperature i are not after a few minutes it is not that bad but man that's a protocol that's it sit it is kind of an end cold endurance protocol it is one thing to get in for one minute to three minutes a your getting out you could sing a song you can do anything to distract yourself but forty five minutes to an hour is is intense maybe the i do not i do not think they paid the subjects but anyway that the that study was yon thing of ropes i forget where it was done but am anyway they the were hardy subjects wont t talk a bit about over training engaging recovery yet a the couple methods that am have heard about and that i use am based on some data that have seen but mainly discussions with really inform people yourself prime mackenzy a kelly start at an others the to that ism aware of for gaging recovery of the nervous system and kind of systemic recovery or am grip strength especially o gripstrength on waking in the morning and a the called cormodac i tolerance was the ability to do a long controlled exile after a few a rhythmic deep breaths just t which i assuming taps into both a mat one's ability to mechanically n control the diagram but also how well one is regulating carmodaxide first question is is this stuff am fiction fact or am a commination of kind of anecdota as i call it are there any pure ref published at is your lad working on these things and am am i deluding myself using these tools or er they useful it is not fiction at all there are ism but but seel two tolerance s less published data we have run a study in our lad looking at the association between the so to tolerance and well be calls trait and state anxiety i an not are in the publication process is what it'll say drat you cannot really talk about that stiffish and an tell it tout but in general id say as reason ism still going it all does it all just leave yet assuming its not a clinical try man i think sharing am preliminary findings fine sons we high them as preliminary yet ism not a reviewer but i look forward to reading the paper habit as you no scientific at this like you see to be careful about saying telling people results before you have come through that pro life which is why ism flaming this i o these results are not yet pure pass through the pure review process your hearing about it prior to pure review yet having said that him there is enough in that feel that not the first one into that field and i i am very confident that that is that is a real thing ism in terms of actual tracking recovery the big picture is this when we run through a full analysis when we when we have an out the go through a boy a gonna likelarathic program were in a run and peril got three major categories can country one a w called visible stresses another we have hidden strangers and the we have recovery capacity any time the total stress load out paces recovery capacity you rather going backwards in your physical ability or your reducing adaptability now you have lovers to pull here you can reduce stress intake or you can increase recovery capacity right what we want in an ideal situation is to be able to implement the most stress possible cause that is the driver of adaptation recover from that now we get the most adaptation and station being simply a change whatever change you want to be that is that is our gold standard rights pine why act some people have indigenous differences they just recover better they do not there genetic factors but let us talk about the onesthat are manipulatable if we go to the stress side of it you want the throttle to be pushed as far down on the ones you want stress from and as far off of the ones you do not waitress that the adaptation comes in the exact area you want an yore not burning gas and something you do not care about because you are just you are you are taking that total stress bucket too high ism recovery capacity over there here is how you can do that you can run some analytic and measure what we do with every one to these these very comprehensive break downs to figure out what is that physiology look hidden and visible and then what is the recovery capacity once we have that blue print we can now figure out what of the two or three things we need a track that are these indicators of what we call performance anchors an anchor is something that kind of drags behind you ore below you that slows you down the analogy being let us see were going down one of these amazing canyon roads and will not say which canyon wherein you can stay hidden here i an your cars going down into certain velocity and you want to go faster most people's us first impulse is to hit the gas the accelerator we want ta push well that is fine but if you are foot is on the break and you push the accelerator you might go it a bit faster but number one you are wasting a lot literal gas to go lobe faster and too you are burning your engine you might you are gong to blow the easier solution is just take your foot off the break you are going to go faster by just stopping yourself then if that is not fast enough we can hit the accelerator everyone last to just push down right more stimulus more optimization being mind mingling m here our first analeptics are wherever the performance anchors what is dragging you back what is hand what is putting down the break i won to move those two or three things out the way and bullet see how far you get oh look at that your recovery capacity has gone away up you are adapt you are adaptations ore happening faster now or we can do more work because your recovering quicker we are trying to figure out in those buckets and we have a whole host to things we measure bile markers and surveys and everything else we go through to find out what is there after we have one that now we're just going to track a few of these recovery markers along the way to figure out what is global happening that could mean grip strange ism i have some folks who we're in a rescripts ring daily all there we are on to look at ah army or combinations we may look at performance metrics a a force plant going into a vertical jump every single day i were to see wetethat is at we have use the baptists before which is how many times you can tap your finger as fast as possible it is a rough indicator of bench a nervous system it it us they one mitigator exactly and this is as you can do on this tapis fingers fast you can it is can say you would id sixty taps to day and your your average is seventy five i that cause it taps in to a not intended am into upper motorcar on capacity is a lot of things grip strength obvious to have to send the deliberate signal to my head to grip but at some point the lower motor on seregoingto be taking over the majority the work the signal is probably one and done whereas i am tapping is going to be a repeated of set yo am sending of signals from upper motor neurons yet someone athletes i work with we track blood every day we track boring every day we track am ideally accommodation of subjective and objective matters everything from how did you feel last night to environmental censors of their bedroom a full pasties going on running actual sleep dike notice not or ring nothing agent or but like full angle an some emits is simple as how you peeled to day and most ha critical dump it we are going to put people in a position to succeed err to figure out what is the lever that they need to pull as well as what is their aptitude what sport they and what we realistically get away with and some of em will take machines with them and will do blood every day and turn and all kinds of stuffing some of em it is at lot lower for myself i ism not pleasant mention for ism not a began of devices a n where the is is watch i tend to go off feel which is not a it is not the ideal objective way to gage things but am part of my reasoning for this is my colleague from the psychology department a a doctor a lea drum it's done some studies where they have am given pep deliberately given people false feed back about their sleep told people you did not sleep very well or they have told people you slept really well and performance can be driven in the expected direction based on feet back independent of how well people slept red in sleep now that does not anyone to take some one that only slept two hours or was not of every to a thirty seconds cause of apnea and tell them they slept great and the'regingto perform great connive tasks but you can take someone who slept very well tell them that the recovery question wasn't very good and their their output is going to be worse that is my concern about a lot of devices out there not to name specific devices but it is still unclear to the general public what the specific algorithms are to generate these recovery scores right and many of the things that reportedly am track sleep don't tracking sleep not a tracking heart rate and breathing which are corsets of sleep dap but that is different and again ism not nocking those i i think the sleep trackers if nothing else have provided a form whereby people are very conscious of getting good sleep it is were knowing the total clock an take up your food you'll go how ism shall eating a lot more than i thought cobra or lassie some cases but often the cases that is more i think for the typical perse and ism wondering whether no myself a because ism not a a a compete threader sonly not a professional asleep am bested with myself i suppose but no one else morning pulsate i tend to take when a an waking m if i wake out of a really stressful dream i might relax a lobitmen just take my pul state con to get a range and see if its spiking for whatever reason i do not tend to measure grip strength although ice heard you can misuse a classic a scale yet old fashion scale with the cereal now old fashion am or some other more technical devices probably a god a there is a low cost one the other and then the carbondoxi tolerance yes we have non really talked about that in in specific ways my understanding f it is its for deep slow breaths and threw the nose out through the nose and then a big in had as maxaxale and then time duration of exhale through the nose and then stopping the stop watch at the point where long's are empty not necessarily as long as one could hold the breath did i get that righter you to okay i guess we should credit you and brine mackenzie a those gas yean and the folks a under a brings umbrella for a really establishing this as a really good metric when and how can i use the carbon i tolerance test to gage re cover upon waking am post training session yet without we goo tine a numeral one answer is whatever you do to be consistent do it under any good signs experiment do it under thexactsime conditions and you cannot that generally means somewhere in the morning s that she yore probably going to have the most controlmostability ism going ya you would take any horn or other metric wake up get in a control get stabilize take o matrix got it can be pretty good got it my em by card testing soda am rumor has it and data has it that it can a should be a pretty effective training tool very effect could you explain a little bit of about how it works and how one might explore using social by care to enhance training out put in a couple of serin contact ye there is a handful of these youviquirously effect if supplements for performance din by carbonates one of them it is a very in genius idea cause it is simple effectively most contraction happens because insimatic function occurs within a fairly specific p trench right if hoe gets extremely a civic it does not

outside his fairly special range what happens is generally fatigue this the sensations of fatigue are actually cause by some signal that he were trying to run on a p h re getting in the wrong arrange

fat which breathe only two places you can get most of your selling energy carbohydrates in fat that is also a big long block in chain of carbons whether you gettingyour energy from fat or cargo hydrate you are going to split those atoms no the words you have got six barons attach to each other and in this part o chemistry ten extragonic when you break that carbon bond break one of those carbons off from the other that is going to release energy just if you had a pencil and here and i snapped it you go bang and pop i broke the bond that were connecting that graphite the next piece of graphic and that released energy as i put energy in a system et camera look i as a result though we have now had say five or si carbons chain together we broke one off the end which its not how works but making the point and now you have one free floating carbon use that energy release do they go make eight p then go make your muscles contract but now you have got carbon floating around you can associate freeloading carbon with being at a hyerociti level it is not can happen the only way they going to go through this process as if your body says do we have an oxygen molecule available the we can bine this to immediately yes we do that carbon attachés to that onion molecule you cannot just put seal to in the blood because of what we just talked about we you to bind it through this by carbon at process it is on to go through your blood is going going to longs it an t go back into its carbon ox and molecules can a francs go through the also i in the longs and you got exile you went from carbon this by carbonic system back into carbon exile inhaled o two plants go the opposite by the way thereat breathe in the seal two there cleave off that carbon stack got carbons together and that is how they get larger i in your in your blood those six carbon chains are called glucose if we store that in our muscle we call it glikeagens we take a bunch of locos and stack it together and a plant we call that starch that is effectually what it is right's e you take a bunch of carbon from t e atmosphere stuck it'll together and that is a starch ism if you want to do in the form of fruit we take that starch from the ground you put it up through a the tree go all way up to the top put it into the floor break it up into these big huge trunks of starch in to little forms called fruits or glucose that is why fruit has fruits in it and that is why tubers and stop have stanchion basely starch in an animal is adorns look it all that to say if that is happen and we know that a by product specifically of anaerobic scoliosis meaning the break down of carbohydrates for fuel a typically in a very fast pays with low oxygen of inability the downside of that equation is acid production we know that that is a problem as i i start the conversation off there intentionally what if we could reduce the acid build up i you now p h kind of works i went and cot a double negatives there right you n want too much acid build ut then could we prolong and sustain energy i in a more effect to pace especially in this anaerobic ism interval kind of environment and again that is important because in those things failure is not a result a running out of fuel or oxygen it is a result of fatigue building up way too quickly is i also true for resistance training e may be blow of the the creation violate system that can be in issue it could simply be in issue of force production you just do not have an a force we care not out of energy you just cannot muster enough i am force you do enough reps and it is can to be an issue there i creating foster without be the big wonder demanding ism to come back a little bit to the beginning then it'll ism circling this altogether intentionally alright well the way that we produce energy is going to be in two primary categories anerobic aerobe chronic meaning with oxygen anerobic meaning without in terms of muscle contraction you arepretty much talking about carbohydrates or fat now fat is going to be exclusively a pubic meaning many use fat from the entire body roughly equally you are doing a sprint up a hill and your hand brings or your glues your squadron fire you cannot you are not discoing to use the fat that is directly in those hamstrings you going to lose it from the entire body it have to go through police's it is in ta stored form an not upon tissue got o get broken down put into blood blood's on to have to go through your body get taken up in a muscle taken up through muscle into the motor conjure there won't have to go to this process call bate oxidation remember carbohydrates an glucose especially is this six carbon molecule fat if it is in the form of a try gliseright it is it three carbon literally backbone and three you don't try one to three fatty acids three carbon backbone and those fatty aces are just big long chains of carbon that is all it is right we are gin at break that thing down put it in the blood move it up move it into our motor conjure you cannot walk those things across a mount o conjure while we're too big you have to do is cleave them off into little chunks and it turns out we break em off into two carbon chunks we call it data as in too move those in a motor conjure if that can go through this little then call recycle or track la back cycle and you kick out a bunch of energy out of that you had two carbons as result of that process you in generate too carbon to oxides but remember you can only go to that process if action is available ecus you have to be able to place those carbons on to something or acid gets up way too high too fast this is one the reasons why fat is a nice fuel force but it is very slow it is takes physical time to move from the back of your shoulder in your blood down your hand saying up take up take up take in addition it is required oxen availability if you need envy after you simply do not have the time to bring in the oxygen transport it through go through capillaries exchanged through tissue et camera car a hydrate on the other hand is can o be stored locally in the exercising muscle self and specifically in the coda possum tabs glycogen that is glue as linkage in the story there what is can happen initially you are initial demands for exerciser for fuel are going come from the glikagein store with in the muscle fiber itself it is sis con to break right there and you to be off the races you the six carbon molecule you to break it into two separate three carbon molecules i keep come that breaking provide you a tiny bit of energy very small but sum now your to take those two three carbon molecules and you want to be able to oxidize them as that is your only next step but order to do that you got to go those in a mite cornea you got a break one of those molecules off then you will be back to your two carbon molecule test you do with fat that is ongoing to math conure and then'sgoingo go to the exact same crew cycle two carbons et camera but hold on if you do not have sufficient oxygen or sufficient mite country availability and your stuck at that two three carbon place what the do you do you have problems right now we have to say o a wait a minute we have to a three carbon molecule and we have a bunch to this acid build up now acid functionally is is hydrogen that that is what ugh potential hydrogen is what peach stands for a right if hydrogen building up as a by product of muscular contraction and the your having the three carbon molecule what it can actually do is grab one of those hydrogen and those three carbmolecules by the medical pronator profit acidraght if you take a heroic acid and you grab hydrogen put on on top of it we now have a different name for it it is called hydrogen proxy lactate band gall right that is what lack a lac to acid is right we have now built that up never one reason why lactic is not cousin your forsake its actually preventing it and that does not watch o other really cool stop but the point is that system calling last long that get's overwhelmed very quickly what are you going to do with the rest of this hydrogen well if you started off in a normal strange you do not have very far to go before you have now gone into that level of too much acidity if you start off in a more basic and a basic a mean simple i mean chemistry right and more all line then that same amount of increase in p h is no longer now just put you back in your physilege carat soon by carbonate whether taken as a cream or a powder or breaking soda or anything else can simply put you in a more alkaline state even acutely this is something you can take right now before your your work out am you are going to delay what we call delay the progression of fat and would o would people start to approach this practice i by understanding y can do this with common storebout baking soda no question there is always a con urn about gastric distrableum that it is a very effective laxative ism sometimes in it and unwanted laxative effect but how would one approach this before let us say ism ism going to have doing the mile repeats ye exercise a a mile repeats a protocol that we talked about earlier ism doing that for a few months and now i want to try the social by care ye porch i well hydrate it hotly and well rested pray to go when am i get to drink this u soda by car solution what how would i make the solution i let say ism i take ten ounce as water ye how much by car do i want to sod him by carpshire put in there can we come up with it tut is it half a teaspoon is a teaspoon here is o men to tell you you will thank me by starting lower you can always go more later to little pinch you cannot go back about i start with a quarter teaspoon fine half an honesty half as fine half a least only finds is all that set will that down i read a study recently that show that people will hit there u the the pay benefits of this at different times but it is somewhere if i if memory serves me correctly somewhere between sixty and ninety minutes later i moist want to drink it on the way to the track it can it can be as low as twenty ski maybe as i get to the tracks and someone to do some warm up with some walk and jogging i i say forty five minutes of that's that ism just a very rough slandered but yet you are right it is it is individualized i and you probably want to play without a little bit if not somewhere in the neighborhood of twenty to an hour of and then the perceived and real fatigue if done correctly the perceived and real fatigue ought to be reduced yes i can do more work without feeling exhausted will i feel less of a lack hate burn yet done in air quotes for those listening i realize that is a very crude way to describe a complex physiological process mum fantastic can sodium by car be used repeatedly for longer duration training yet and if i were going to use it with wait training for whatever reason maybe ism doing circuit type training or ism doing the supersede type straight training that you talked about before pushpole pushpole where a lie bit more party of asculyrly demanding ye then maybe i see that throughout the work out make sure there is a bathroom nearby it sounds cause i do i am aware that a many people gets pretty serious gastric dos has me very quickly of gray hell sons again amazing training tool i reallyappreciate you shrink cause i think it is it is one that does not get a lot of air time these days cause it is been around but sounds it has some pretty impressive i ye use young a sort of funny about that is i may i get it pop culture is what it is but still to this day if you want to talk about for your most effective general hell slack performance implementation it is the same three to forth five in v been the it is because hey work really well without going into the chemistry of each one in the practice each one because i define want to get you back to talk about ti it nutrition and supplementation oh yum at some point but i think we would need a full couple of hours to get that right ye at least if you as a teaser would you mind just listing off the other am supplements that you have found her very effective for for many people voting by carbon baking sods one what are some of the other one yet i will go find of reverse order batter alienate as another very classically effective one i similar idea e sun my carbonic sos its it is going to bid lenses going to come mans can be converted stored as called carnesine in the muslin caressing is an interest on your buffer another words it is is going to delay the build up of skit ism feet blocker if you well very effect a very cheap very safe am well studied the top one low of all of em by far that has an incredibly strong safety profile it has it is a cheap it is a simple form to get has a important magnitude of effect and is affect of a cross multiple domains of physical health and performance and it is because of that it is my crown feel it is in my opinion without question the michael jordan of all supplementation and that is creating on drat it effects many things we typically think about it as its muscle to or you you talk find of you quickly were talking about the creating phosphate system but we have to realize i the mass majority research on creating phosphate is not ins more performance and has not been for twenty years it is in clinical and it has everything from effects on the logical system to there have ben associations to mental health and depression and to be very clear i am certainly not saying you can take creating and cure anything and ism not saying it scan a stop you from depression or anything but ism saying there's there is a lot a research in these areas and there for reason people are doing it i completely agree and if you are willing it'd love to have you back for us to do a discussion on creatine and the brain or creating in the nervous sisdonthere will be a lot of fund and maybe we can do it a kind of a journal club in advance of that ares the do not now journal club is where i scientists a read a munch a papers and then argue about them discuss them and try an extract the the kind of ism agreed upon center of mass if you will i think give long been taking five grahams of cretin on a highdrate per day for mainly for the cognate of a fact it ism i sense an effect that is otleasy anecdote but think they are a lot of date out theirs is it it t is enough at you are not yofrenot crazy there is enough there and in fact thrash enough mechanism now ism to understand the metabolic needs people thin the math a musslook i rite some gong to think about them abolish needed to fuel muscle but we forget cells i cells a blood cells and nerve cells at a sights brain all the stuff requires energy and it is all going through the cabalism superinteresting we we will do the dead dive on that soon have a final question for you you are involved in a really interesting i think really cutting edge project that i first learned about from you i do not know of anyone else doing anything ism as forward thinking and frankly as relevant to the general population because of a my interesting people getting better sleep and o how to do that of waiting stressor anyhow do that tell us a little bit about what i believe it is called absolute rest right this is something that we have been playing with behind the scenes i for a long time than this typify have high performanseff works right people wont exclusivity and and this as been built ism effectively what happened is a friend of mine codybirkart non if body but a fame d out in texts ye yenassa nasal ye i do know body wonderful just down the road thinker ism every one's interested in sleep right and for forever i up how were using with athletes but everything available tells you how you are sleeping nothing can tell you why your keeping that way and we we got together and bolder and then i met some his former colleagues computer science folks ism hazard eddy i and some really impressive neck folks and we were just thinking about idea and we came up with vestry to realize the problems or it we use first principal thinking s on my favorite approaches a if you have not for me with that go gogthat the just a recipe to solve problems this first principle thinking and we starter to think about man all the sleep techs is there it is real i do not need to convince people that they need sleep everyone's done that you need high cool to sleep but how can i from idea solutions and withe people i work with i cannot just tell them your testosterone down or your sleep down o red i need to beagle to be this is down and heres why and here is our solution that that is how our high performance world works enter absolute rest this is saying ink whatare the actual nodes that go in to high effective high quality sleep every one is psychology there has to be some sort of screening diagnostic for are you not sleeping because of simply you cannot control yourself i you have done a wonderful job of giving people tools or if you cannot quite your mind before sleep to this if you wake up and you cannot go back to sleep here about your things right we have some screens that we can do in there some that stuff we can do to analyze this is a psychologicallition it sit is not you are in a control and we have different tricks we use and stuff ism hen yo mack we talk about but it is not that of is it physiology which is no number too do we know what you are dolman levels are do we knowhow your ceratonan levels are what is megaton and look what is this what is a drank and what is quarters all quarters all being the primary driver ism what what is this relationship to e where are these things at whet it a measure all that and interact that refresh that during the day prior to sleep an ti agree that next morning and even sometimes throughout sleep and the ere to figure out as is a physiology prom if it is than we have clear corrections if not were t go on the next up which is is his possibly pathology you have some sort of sleep disorder were in around full pet what is call pest soppoisynography full the exact same stuff you would get any sleep clinic i it is ta sensor that is going go on merimeasuring e g e o g an were to have a muscle activating answer to see if your legs a re moving and everything else is going on and w cue get a full diagnosis and i if any ones or done this the amount of a sleep issues that or happening in people that the do not even realize is extraordinarily his were to figure this out on one very quick example we just to this with a professional ally an he was having two hundred eighty roughly of these episodes per night and to be categorizes and episode the have to meet these four specific right to your option saturation ventilation changes brain changes to sector in any hit that overturning times to night and what this technology allowed us to do his figure out what position did all the things current well in his particular case most of them are happening was on his back and s we have bought a a very simple tat hello basically the when on his back that kept him from sleeping on his back and we sawn eighty five per cent reduction an sleep awareness issues the very first night now we did that just strong eventually tripled after three months by just i proving sleep an all we did is move him on was left o right side huge improvements i just by understanding where the problem occurred and why it occurred there we don't have to change hardly anything else he had the basic hygiene stuff down and temperature and and all that stuff and he had his chilly pad and all that to keep the think we could not fix it years by the way this took us two years of just trying everything were man and i us like i wish wish we can get you to sleep better and we i pulled out every trick i knew and it just as soon as we built this gene all my got it is all he is not over weight by the way toast having he is not iron efficient is not have any these other clunk a classical symptoms that e associated with badly solicitation everything we have done a thousand protocols that fix it over night if it is not psychology it is not physiology and it is not pathology the last one that people do not have any idea about his environment and what you do not realize is we have a box we can sit right next year bed just plugged in you do not have to do anything and it is in run full environmental scans it scan a look out the temperature in your room scan look at the humanity in your room it is can a look at the solid organic as since see to things that are sleeping out from your mattress is can a look a particulates in the air in possibly larges and things that are floating around that are closing your nose off you cannot sleep at night and and your mouth breathing and you have talk the lot ism sure on the previous episodes about why that is back it is can look at your sea too cloud we have you've hockey we have real set this point upright your inhaling o to within your exhaling seal to well during the day and when we are conversing you have a quite a bit of force without exaltation right but at night it is just barely seeping at your mouth what happened to sea two sends to cloud up and build around your face and the you ant a breathing that so too and this can cause at a large number of sleep protect you are simply re breathing in the panic o whether you fully awake or just kick out of a sleep stage the seal two round your faces a big issue this stuff has all been known by the way with the astronauts for a very long time it just has not translated into the to the commercial spaces of course bonded art i y perform our space sill we can measure that as well and we can figure out i for the most extreme we can actually come n to a bedroom and rebuild an entire see optimization i set up and control entire thing but for most folks the manor we can do is unfold diagnosis in chaos is is environment related is a pathologies or something else sos his a commercial device that people can eventually acts us it is now a where can people learn more about absolute rest absolute rest noncom very cool am and just eventful disclosure i was not aware that you had done this prior to to day w you would mention i was to ask people scientists or otherwise i ways love to ask you chatting most excited about lately and the sounds i can amazing technology am and just to be really clear and that is not something we are working on that is that is landed that is landau we are ready to go great well an that is one of the things i appreciate about you is that your you are willing to sometimes speculate but you always say speculation but in general your you seem the tannage were that you are going to be public facing about something for gan to make a statement there is got to be quite a bit behind it you are nit an a allude to the intend years we might be able to do this or in five years you are very data driven tonnage yet well the people i work with wee being answers right we do not have that time frame we typically have may we start the season of four weeks that is is madam to well as i said i appreciate that about you but is but one of the many things i appreciate i think a the listeners and i can well appreciate on the basis of to day's discussion what a enormous wealth of information you are how clear and i and potently you communicate that information and also how you can a take a huge cloud of information and still to still it in to protocols that ought to work for seventy five per cent of people seventy five per cent of the time which is an immensely valuable am thing to do for me and from the listeners i just on to say thank you much for taking the several now hours i lose track of time of which is a good a reflects all good things several hours to take a break from teaching takabriak from research takabriak from the other important commitments of your life and really share with us all this incredible information ism grateful my pleasure man ism i i m ism glad we finally got to connect this as ben a a long time with making it has and ism going to a ism going to bring the breathing photo calls to my training ism going to start doing more of the endurance type and internal type training ism going to tart moving when i do heat ism in a start moving when i do cold i might even start throwing some am voting by carbon to a a very small amount of siding by care into o some water before i train and listen i and professor and galop thank you ever much my pleasure thank you for joining me today for my discussion

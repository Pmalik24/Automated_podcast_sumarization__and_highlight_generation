welcome to the superman latpotcas scum science science trace to s for lip's drew superman and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls et stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is inside tracker inside tracer is a personalized nutrition platform the analyzes data from your blood and liana to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals have long been a fan of getting blood work done and the simple reason for that is that most of the things that you want to know about your health such as hormones metabolic factors blood sugar levels et camera can only be analyzed from blood and nowadays there also excellent dianatests that can also give you valuable information about what is going on at the cellar molecular even the neural circuit level within your brain and body inside tracker makes getting blood avian tests easy you can go to a testing sit where they draw your blood they take your liana sample or they can come to your home if you prefer that as well they have a really amazing dashboard the dashboard lets you understand what your levels of various hormones and metabolic factors et camera mean and what you should do about them i think that is one of the main things that really separates inside tracker apart from other blood india avast most tests you get the results back but they are no directives about what to do specifically in order to bring the numbers into the ranges that you would for your goals inside track makes all of that extremely simple and extremely clear if you to try inside tracker you can go to inside tracker dot calm slash supermen and if you do that you will get twenty five per cent off any of inside tracker's plans use the cot supermen at checkout that inside tracker dot calm slash supermen to get twenty face per cent off any of inside trackers plans today's episode is also brought to us by athletic greens lentic greens as an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink i started taking athletic greens back in two thousand in twelve and have taken it ever since ism delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take it now is that athletic greens really lets me cover all my nutritional basis and terms of vitement's minerals an robotics there is much data now pointing to the fact that the gut microfilm and the gut brain axis is important for metabolism and for indican health the vitals minerals and robotics unathletic greens make me feel confident that ism covering all my basis i do take other supplements but withouthletic greens i know that have got all the foundational stuff handled it also tastes really good takes find on its own you can mix it with water which is what i do i add a little bit of lemon juice or lime juice cause i a little tartness flavor in there is wealth but most pe we just mixes it with water it mixes up supereasil my i drink at once or twice a day usually once midmorning and once again in the afternoon if you to try at lentic greens you can go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen and if you do that you can claim their special offer which is a year supply of vitamin d three k too there is now a ton of evidence that vitamin d three is involved in countless metabolic processes hormone process there important for over all health and well being it him and three you can get from the sun of course but most people are deficient invite him in d three i you go to athletic green stock cam slash supermen you will get the athletic greens you will et the year supply of vitamin d three in too and you will get five free travel packs once again it is athletic green stock cam slash supermen to get athletic greens the vitamin d three k too that is a year supply plus the five free travel packs today's episode is also brought to us by monk pack monk pack is a company that makes to friendly snacks that taste in credible but have just one gram of sugar or less and indeed they taste incredible in fact my production team here the superman ladpodcast teases me because i shall have to keep the boxes of monk pack bars in my basement cause otherwise it'll tear through all of them i remember the first time i tails i here we go a to bar ism not a big fan of bars in general most of them do not taste good to me ad i tasted the monk pack bars and they are absolutely possum they come in a lot different flavors ism partial to the cardinal desalt one but they all s have s salt are chocolate pan a butter dark chocolate they have a bunch of flavors they are all incredible have tried them all which is why i keep them in my basement as i mention previously on this podcast ism neither to nor cargo i do not really follow a particular died in that sense i eat in a way that maximizes my alertness and my levels of focus during the day when i want a work and that maximize my transition to sleep at night i easily eat lo care to is during the day and i know the qeitanistas will say that ism not in mitosis and i can manage to get into mitosis but the main idea s that keep my carbohydrates low during the day and then at night i do eat carbohydrates for me the monk pack bars are really good snack sullying the afternoon they with a cup of coffee sushi ism going o train soon after that or if i just want a snack and ism going to continue working as a mention before they are absolutely delicious they also do not have any of the stuff that is bad for you no soy transfer sugar a calls artificial colors all that stuff that we know we should avoid if you want a try monk pack bars you can go to monk pack that is m u n k monk pack dock cam and enter the cod supermen at check out and you will get twenty per cent off your first purchase of any monk pack product that is monk pack m u n k p c k dock cam and enter the cod supermen at check out to get twenty per cent off your purchase this month we are talking all about hormones hormones are in credible and they control many processes in the brain in body last episode we talked about the roll of estrogen and testosterone to day we are going to talk about how hormones in pack feeding and hunger as well as society the feeling that you do not want to eat or that you have eaten enough now it is important understand that hormones do not work alone in this context to dam going to describesome hormones that have powerful effect on whether not you want to eat more or less or stop eating altogether but they do not do that on their own they do that in to operation with the nervous system to day i would say much or perhaps even more than any other episodes we are going to hear a lot of biology but there are multiple what i am going to call entry points for tools that you can apply in order to regulate your levels of hunger your meal timing your levels of satiety of not wanting to eat more and many of this is actionable with behaviors but of course we are also going to talk about supplements and washing in a talk about a little bit of brain machine interface devices that can actually be involved in manipulating these incredible things that we think of as hunger and appetite and satiety the first thing that you need to know about the nervous systemize the curl control over feeding and hunger is that there's an area of your brain call the hypothalamus it is in the forebrain which tells you its in the fruntinger brain and it is at the base of the forebrain now the hypothalamus contains lots of different kinds of neurons doing lots of different kinds of things there are neurons in your hypothalamus controlling sexual behavior controlling body temperature controlling circadian rhythms that desire to sleep or be awake even neurons controlling rage there actually neurons that if were we were to stimulate them would send you or any one into a rage it the just powerful control centers for the brain and body there is a particular area of the hypothalamus call the ventrimedial hypothalamus and it is one that researches have been interested for a long time now in terms of its relationship to hunger and feeding and the reason is it creates these paradoxical effects what i mean by that what they found was that sometimes pensioning or disrupting the neurons in the ventrimedial hypothalamus would make animals or people hyper phasic they would want to eat crazy and other lesions in other individuals or animals would make them anorexic would make them not want to eat at all it would make food aversive that means that the ventrimedial hypothalamus is definitely an interesting control station for hunger and feeding and society but it does not really tell you what is going on at a deeper level in fact it is limit confusing or paradoxical turns out that there multiple populations of neurons and there were going to talk about those some are promoting feeding and some are promoting not feeding or not eating now the other curl component of all this that you need to know about act as to do with your mouth there's an are of your quarters that syllabic further up in your brain call the insofar quarters and it processes a lot of different kinds of information mostly information about what is going on inside you call in terraception the insofar quarters has neurons that get input from your mouth from the pouch receptors in your mouth and insofar quarter has powerful control of ere whether or not you are enjoying what you are eating whether not you want to avoid what you are eating whether or not you have had enough or whether r not you want to continue eating more and that has to do believe it or not with the touch or sensation of eating ism very familiar with this in when these people i love eating much that i just the mere act of chewing now i celery sticks enough ism not crazy about them but the yon they taste find me and i when on telesis but ashy just chewing on them i i could eat all day long except that it is not healthy to do that but the mere act of chewing forme is very pleasureful people we chi gum feel this way as well and just as a point about gum or chewing if you chew something celery or cucumber slices or chew gum provided it does not have any sugar or cold rat content it is not going to drive increased hunger that generally is not the case but if you eat something with sugar as we will find out it has a very specific action in the indoor quartan and another airs of your nervous system that promotes the desire to eat more but the keep point right now is to know you get these two brain areas the ventramedio hypothalamus that is involved in hunger and lack of hunger of an accelerator and a break on feeling and you have this indoor quarter that gets input from your mouth and cares about chewing and the consistency of foods and all sorts of interesting things that are just very tactile i think most people think about the touch receptors on excuse me the taste receptors on the tongue but we often do not think about the touch or tactile essence of food the thing that comes to mind just now as a have gone to sure several times and some people really the urchin i do not the urchin there something about at the kind of creeps me out about the consistency other people look it is highly individual and it is probably learned and there some proudly cultural background to this if you were raised eating urchin some people love the that a consistency or that touch touch has a lot to do with whether not you want to eat or not now let us get back to the ventrimedial hypothalamus sometimes it makes animals or people want et eat more sometimes less what is going on there there is a classic experiment that was done in which researchers took to rats and called aerobioses to them to each other what that meant is that they did a little surgery and they linked their blood supply that they were forever physically link to one another and could exchange factors in the blood but their brains were separate their mouths wereceparate and they essential did everything a separately except the they were link to one another they walk together and go to the same places in order to do it this aerobiosis experiment reveal something really important when they lesion the ventrimedial hypothalamus in one of the rats that was connected to the other rat that rat got very very fat is just really best huge rat super jumbo rat the other one however got very thin it actually lost weight despite consuming the same amount of food that it had prior to the other one getting the lesion what is this tell us this tells us that there's something in the blood that is being exchange between the two animals because it was their blood supply that was linked and that tells us that there is hormone or endocrine signals that are involved in the desire to eat and hunger and appetite and next ware going to talk about what those indican signals are and then ism going to immediately point to some entry points that you can use and you can use these even if you are not parables to anything and that can allow you to time our meal frequency and predict when you are going to be hungry or not as well as drive up appetite believe are not there are people out there who are trying to eat more although i think far many more people are trying to eat less because nowadays you the data just point to the fact that there is it essential an epidemic of diobedies type to diabetes and obesity and most every one agrees now that maintaining a healthy bodyweight embody weight composition is one of the best pads to longevity and to just feeling very good and actually being able to think cognitive functioning is actually linked to levels of adipose tissue and forth let us talk about the indican factors that regulate feeding hunger and sought titty one of the really exciting things to emerge in the science of feeding and appetite in the last twenty years is the discovery of another granary not just the ventrimedial hypothalamus but s an area of the brain called the arcuate nucleus and the argument nucleus has some really fascinating sets of neurons that release even more incredible molecules in chemicals into the blood and these chemicals act as accelerators on feeding an appetite or breaks and the really cool thing is that you can actually control these molecules through simple behaviors and once you understand what these molecules are you will tart to understand why that the case and the control points that you have right now in order to control your appetite in either direction increase or decrease first of all there are set of neurons in this arcuate nucleus called the p to c neurons of i don't on to get into what the acronym stands for but it'll do it anyway it is the pro olio milanicorton system of these are p m osenerons pro olio milanicorton and if you heard piano that should tell you has something to do with pigmentation in skin cells or in hair cells pigmentation of some sort because of melanin last episode i talk to lit about about the relationship between light dopamine and melanin y should already be thinking weight malady means it probably has something to do with that system and indeed it does now the pamcnurons make something called alpha m s h milanistite stimulating hormone alpha milanicite stimulating hormone if you do not wont to remember any of the other acronyms and terms have talked about this episode far do chine remember m s h of cause say hamster m s h of m s h reduces appetite and it is a powerful molecule are it just put that on the shelf emerge reduces hap appetite now there is another population of neurons in the truant nuclear called the a are generous and there ism truly nocking a read you what that stands farceuse it is related to the malstrain it was first identified in but humans make these have these cells as well but a are generous the a re generous stimulate eating and any time you are approaching food or you feel some excitement about food or anxiety because some people actually experience a kind of heightened anxiety some people actually get a little bit of arresting tremor before they eat even if they do not have any sort of eating disorder this kind of a camping up of autonomic activity that is largely due to the activity of these a are generous the activity in these ago are generous goes way up when animals are people are starved and i do not mean starved for long periods of time but i mean when they have not eaten for a while and the activity of demise the release of emit age goes up when we have eaten however there other things that will stimulate the release of things message just briefly the experimental evidence if you village are generous animals and people stop eating there are people of lesions they just stop eating they become anorexic actually i know you are familiar with annerecy as a clinical term but that isuctually a term that is used in the scientific literature about a pattern of behavior of as well as a clinical term of course if you were to stimulate the any are generous animals are people eat crazy they will eat to the point where they burst which just sounds horrible but it just tells you this is the accelerator on eating and yes as relationship to the ventromedio hypothalamus i talk about earlier but i soft want to go back there just yet we will circle back malanicite stimulating hormone such an interesting hormone the think can shut down the desire to eat the malanicite stimulating hormone is released from the medial pituitary we talked about the pituitary last time this is a a gland that is very closely position to the hypothalamus actually some of the hypothalamus neurons actually project their neral connections directly into the pituitary to release things ganatropens and utilizing hormone stuff we talk about last time in reference to testosterone an estrogen but message is released from the medial portion of the pituitary and its stimulates the desire do not eat to cease eating what is really interesting is that malanicite stimulating hormone is activated by ultra violet light and it is not activated by ultra violet light to the skin or directly to the pituitary it is activated by ultraviolet light to the eyes now if you have been watching this podcast listening this podcast for any period of time or you have heard me on other podcast or you follow my instrogram i am a big fan of this whole thing of getting morning light in order sin bronze circadian rhythms et camera avoiding light in the mill the night this is yet another reason why getting ample light i really sunlight but it could be other sources of you delight to the eyes stimulates emit h this as been shown over and over again and keeps the desire to eat or appetite in check in healthy ranges this is also why in the spring in summer months animals and people eat less now for hibernating animals its different because the bare hibernate rashly bears do not truly hibernate technically by scientific writer they do not hibernate but they go into a kind of topper the hibernating animals they do not eat much cause there in burrows or dens ore there just wrapped up in a low ball or whatever it is that hibernating animals do there of course can eat far less in the winter but that is a unique cesarean we are not hibernating animals but humans generally have greater appetite in the cold winter months it is not just because of the holidays in the abundance of food that is we are presenting ourselves with but when we get a lot of sun our appetite is reduced or at least its easier to control and that is do in part because if your getting ample sunlight to the eyes it is converted into a signal for the emit h neurons then neurons that release emit h excuses me these palm sonorous release eyes h and then emit h can bind its receptors and can keep the great on appetite in check the take away tool from this is make sure you are getting enough light not just in the morning but throughout the day and yes t has to be light to your eyes and blasting your eyes with sunlight or artificial light to the point where its damaging or painful will not accelerator improve this process it is about getting photons ultra violet light to the eyes consistently throughout the day that is best accomplished by not wearing sunglasses provided you can do that safely and if you do not have access to enough sunlight than you can do this with artificial light this also points again to our old friends the blue blockers many people know i am not a huge fan of blue blockers especially not during the daytime because they block a lot of the u v and shorter wave length light that you want and need to create alertness but also to create release of emit h from the medal pituitary now there are people out there subcultures that actually in neck emit h that are taking emit h or thing similar to it i am not suggesting people do that but there are three man consequences of doing that first of all it reduces appetite no surprise there their actually using it as a dieting drug this is kind of in the underground i do not know what the legal statuses and again i am not proving the people do it too it makes them very very tan which make sense right malanicite stimulating hormone and the third is it purportedly never tried it reportedly sends legit through the roof to the point where it is actually distracting for other activities it actually can create priapism which is a kind of chronic reaction in males to the point where actually can be physically damaging to the genitalia this is a drug of or a i do not whether notes call it a drug it is a it is a substance that one can regulate with healthy levels with sunlight and perhaps artificial up light i have not heard much about treatments for ability involve in getting ample sunlight or getting ample up light but to me the logic is just very clear and if your pursuing a those avenues you might want you certainly should talk your physician but you might want to think about how some of this logic hangs together absorb fascinating hormone think most people are not aware of it and the subcultures that are aware of it are using it to carvery particular end points and the using it at superphysiological levels a that is enough a about that cause i really do not know i have talk to a few people in research will never not for thispotges a reach out to few people and ask whether not the these aseciteffects a in quotes i have heard about are true and indeed they are true but again that superphysiological controlling eyes h it is actually alpha mesh levels through a viewing ultra violet light seems a interesting and a mechanistically logical thing to do if your goal is to keep appetite in check eyes h inhibits hunger next let us talk about a hormone peptide that activates hunger and this is a really interesting one because it relates to when you get hungry in addition to the fact that you get hungry at all and it is called green its spelled g h r e l i and green is released actually from the g i tract and its main roll is to increase your desire to eat and it does that through a variety of mechanisms part of that is to stimulates some of the brain areas the actual neurons that make you want to eat in addition it creates food anticipatory signals within your nervous systems you start thinking about the things that you happen to to eat at that particular time of day this is fascinating green is sort of a clock a hormonal clock that makes you want to eat at particular times now the signal for green is reduced glucose levels in the blood we are going to talk a lot today about glucose and insolent weighs to manage glucose and insolent but for now the simple version of this is you normally want your glucose to be in a kind of mop modest range and it'll explain what that range is in lube but if it drops too low green is is secreted from your got it activates neurons in your brain at various locations including the piano see neurons and the other neurons of the a cru it it also it activates the viamach in particular ways and it might even activate some of these neurons that are in the periphery in your mouth that actually make you kind of salivate and want to eat right at we all know about the famous pavlova experiments of prologue's dogs they start salivating to the bell after the bell is presented with food you remove the food and than just the bell constimulate the this elevation we become pavlova at times but rarely is ever discuss what the curl pathways for that are and it turns out that these hormones there secreted from the gut can stimulate the neurons to great a sensation an a desire for certain foods at certain times of day you have done this experiment if you are somebody who eats breakfast at more less the same time each day let say eight a m pluserminus twenty minutes and then you eat lunch twelve thirty pluserminus twenty minutes or let say your somebody me who typically skips breakfast and just eats lunch usually around eleven thirty or twelve or something that your gremlin secretion we will start to match when you typically eat and it does that and it is able to override the low levels of glucose in your blood stream because the gremlin system also gets in put from a clock in your liver that is linked to the clock in your hypothalamus in your brain and what this means is if you eat at regular meal times you all start to get hungry a few minutes before those meals times if you have ever wondered why your stomach kind of starts to growl because it is a particular time of day like it i must want to eat well that is gremlin and for those of you that do not know why your stomach growls it'll also tell you that to day it is actually really interesting it not at all what you expect in it is not just the gurgling of liquids in your atomic that is not what it is it is a it is actually a muscular phenomenon gremlin is secreted as the kind of food anticipatory signal to get you motivated to go eat at regular times nowadays there is a lot of interest in intermittent fasting there's also a lot of interest in just what meal plans and sceduals and what to eat in general in order to maximize one's health and well being and people have all sorts of cosmetic reasons and brain reasons and metabolic reasons for wanting to control this kind of stuff let us make it really simple by first looking at the extremes some people need to eat every two or three hours they of this i need to eat every two or three hours or else their blood sugar drops in general blood sugar does not drop low that they truly need to eat in order to alleviate a blood sugar issue although sometimes that can happens some people are truly hypo guy semi low blood sugar but most people as the bloudsheer starts to head down towards the low is ranges gremlin is secreted and for those people not eating on the clock is very destructive to them because it activates these neurons in the brain for people who eat once a day or twice a day or tend to shift their meals now they might eat a lot but during a a limited a call feeding window it is condo interesting humans now a eat and talk about foods and ways that for years i used to hereabout in classes in courses and research lectures about feeding animals in a restricted feeding windows and and we owe a a great a deal of gratitude to such and panda who is a colly of mine when my lab was in sanding at the talk institute who really is a one of the pioneers of this restricted feeding window a work and as done a beautiful work plaza a book that is excellent call the stircedian code that a highly recommend and he is done a lot of important work on neurons and the retina that control circadian timing but also the relationship between feeding windows and health and hes sort of the a major proponent out there among the major proponents i should say of circadian eating that means eating during the daytime not at night or intermit fasting restricting feeding windows to anywhere from for to six to eight hours it'll use myself in exam an example of the transition from regular feeding schedule to a more intermittent is fasting although i do not really fall into true intermitting fasting i was on of these people that just got accustomed to waking up and eating about an hour after i woke up that to go from eating every three or four hours to eating twice to day lunch and dinner may be a couple snacks in the afternoon or something at first was excruciating i rememberything it this is really brutal pushing out feeding i did not think i could exercise unless i had eaten first we now know that during most all forms of exercise unless your really focus on optimal performance you have got a hickey lifts i you have to no sprint at your maximum speed a maybe even then that you can exercise fast at just fine because you are mainly relying on sources golikagen from the liver some undigested food sometimes is grosses that my seem it is true as well as body fat if the exercise about is extremely long but what that means is that if you suddenly go from eating on a very regular schedule to skipping a meal or pushing your meal timing out or shifting at all you are going to have gremlin in your system and that gremlin is going to stimulate the desire to eat by acting at the level of your brain and it is indeed at that point just mental when we hear but just mental just physicals really kind of the same thing cause it is all chemicals brain and body but it is the stimulation of neurons that anticipate feeding you are stimulating the argument nucleus neurons that make you want to eat those a a generous gremlin stimulates the any are generous which makes you want to eat what can you do at this what this means is if you want to start shifting your feeding schedule to one where you are not eating quite as frequently and there are some advantages to that that are not just in the bile chemistry and health related a yodeller health related a things but some of them include not having to think about or by food right you actually do not have to think about food all day if you are not eating often the other is it gives you a far more social flexibility right you can go to a noon meeting if you have to or you can go out to dinner at a particular time and you i guess it makes it kind of tough if you want a meet somebody for breakfast cause they near the you are the door whose just sipping black coffee an refusing everything but anyway have been that dork it is one of those things you just kind of work with but the fact of the matter is gremlin secretion because of its relationship to the nervous system can be shifted by about forty five minutes per day now it is going to vary some of you have more called will power it but if you really wanted just start pushing that first meal out or shifting in any direction some peal might want t eat in the early part of the day and not in the evening trying to shift the meal times out the spacing by about forty five minutes is what the the the curl circuits that link the gremlin system to the curl circuits the control feeding really can handle because it is a form of curl plasticity and what this would look is if you normally you eat breakfast at eight a clock plucermin is twenty minutes and you want a start being your first meal at noon you would take may be forgive days and just t art pushing the meal out by about forty five minutes to an hour each day it is not quite as painful or you can just take the plunging just do it all at once i have a colleague who i was a euro surgeon at stamford came up through my levees now at nursing and he has a great practice he keeps his gremlin system at random what he does is he skips one meal per day and he makes his external schedule dictate that sometimes he skips breakfast sometimes he skips lunch sometimes he skips dinner he just skips one of the three major meals per day and in doing that the gremlin system is always kind of a kept off kilter and it probably also allows him to have a lot of curl flexibility what we call top down control just the knowledge oh you know the hunger ism feeling is not necessarily hypoglycemia and in his case it is almost certainly not and therefore what ism feeling here is an act activation of these g are generous and therefore i can push my meal schedule around hover i want now i should mention that top down mechanisms are powerful belief motivation these things can really shift nerd circuits for in a talk more about that will bit later but there are also people who are genuinely hypoglyseamac and that need to take really good control of their blood sugar levels an try and keep them stable and of course you want to do what is medically safe for you ism not at all recommending that people that suffer from hypohypoglyemia suddenly you now disrupt their blood sugar patterns in any direction that would not be healthy but for most people out there who have reasonable a bloodglucos levels a it is kind of interesting and con of fun to play with these parameters in order to optimize what you want to do and sometimes that might change across the year or with schedules many people find great benefit in having flexibility over when they eat regularity of eating equals regularity of gremlin secretion equals regularity of activity of these a are generous meaning you will be hungry at very regular intervals that something the you can work with its grounded in deep mechanism of hormone and curl systems and there is a lot of modern research to support what i just said if eyes h inhibits feeding makes us went eat less and gremlin makes us want to eat more there is another hormone called c c k cold cistecinan that is potent in reducing are levels of hunger now i learned about c c k back when i was an undergraduate well over twenty years ago when it was first discovered and there was a lot of excitement about c c k at that point as a diet drug any time there is a molecule or a chemical discovered in the brain or body that can suppress feeding the diet industry just goes wild an think this is can be the thing that is can allow people to move from being ones to losing all sorts of unhealthy weight et camera a similar phenomenon was observed with lept in leptin is a hormone that is made by body fat that signals to the brain when there is a lot of body fat and in animals injections of leapt in can make fat animals thin they lose a lot of adipose or fat in humans it did not work out that way it just the studies were done and leapt in was successful in treating a certain rare form of diabetes but it really was not very potent as an antiobecity drug similarly c c k has been looked at as an ability drug something to reduce obesity but it had some pretty unhappy side effects om shall cause some pretty serious side effects now that is as a drug however c c k when released at normal levels by your got has a powerful effect in suppressing appetite for a period of time and there are healthy and direct ways to activate c c k now c c k is in the distract it is release from the extract and it is release is govern by two things one is a subset of very specialized neurons that detect what is in the gut the specific contents of the got and by certain elements of the mucosa of the mucus lining of the gut and the gut microfilm what is really interesting is that c c k i stimulated by fatty acids and particular fat acids that will talk about a men acids and particular amen acids that will talk about as well as by sugar now let us put sugar on the shelf for a moment we are going to talk a lot about sugar because if c c k inhibits appetite and reduces feeding and it can be trigger by fatty acids a men acids or sugars then you might say well then in eating a lot of sugar should make us not want to eat more but we all know that eating sugar makes us want to eat far more that is the roll of lot of sugars and that has to do with a separate mechanism will talk about to day which fatty acids in the g t stimulate the release of c c k it turns out it is the megathere fat acids the ones that come from alga or chill or fish oil a talk about this in the appesode on nutrition and some of the things related to the gupmycrobiom in om a revisit that now megathere fat acids and conjugated lanolin acid c la either from food or from supplements stimulate the release of c c k which then reduces or at least blunts appetite and ism not talking about blunting appetite to anorexic levels were we do not want to eat at all untie about regulating appetite to the point where animals and people do not over consume it is keeping appetite at a healthy level the other thing that stimulate c c k the mention are a men acids when we eat we have the ability to break down different macranut macranutrean no carbohydrates fats or prolines in to sugars and glucose that the we can convert a t p an all that stuff from ancrepcycle from high school were not con to going to that to day that is for a future episode but a men acids are one of the things that we are eating for a men acids both can be used as energy through a process called gluconeogenesis of converting prolines into energy or those a men acids can be broken down and then rebuilt into things preparing excuse me repairing muscle tissue as well as other forms of cellar repair involved in all sorts of things relate to proline synthesis what dies this mean if we eat the properamenoacids at the proper levels if we ingest megatheres and calls conjugate lanolin acids at the proper levels or get them from supplements there is a blunting of appetite appetite is kept clamped and we do not become hyperphagia we do not overeat we tend to eat within healthy or normal ranges this is very important because most people do not understand that when we are eating we are basically fat foraging an a men acid foraging and there are several studies now have shown that people and animals will essentially eat until they feel they consumed enough megatheres a megacixis calls and certain a men acids in other words even if it is not conscious we are eating until we trigger the activation of c c k now there are other reasons why we shut down eating too are literally the the volume of food in our gut can be large and we can feel very distended that is the physical reason obviously there are other reasons maybe we just have top down control we we have knowledge that this is the end of the meal and we stop was behave to go back to worker to a meeting or we tell ourselvesthaf we have had enough but at a subconscious level the gut is informing the brain via c and other mechanisms when we have ingested enough of what we need and these megatheres and calls and certain a men acids are vital for sending out that signal that we have had enough now which a mind acids is actually really interesting we have essential monoacid hand we have nonessential monoacid among the essential amino acids there is one in particular that can trigger the release of c c k very potently and that is glutamine glutamine is a very interesting amino acid first of all it is been shown in a few studies to play a roll in bolstering the mine system it can increase the number of killer cells in the amine system it is can soon but supplement form people can take it yo teaspoon of glutamine or some people take glutamine throughout the day if they are really into it or for whatever reason they think they are battling oft an infection or something of that sort glutamine can also of course be derived from foods and you can just put into the internet put doing in an at search and find out what foods are rich with glutamine some of the ones that ism aware about the top of my head or cottage cheese and things of that sort but other foods have glutamine as welt once a threshold level of glutamine and other essential mind acids are reached once the threshold level of these alphithre excuse me o mama three fadiacids and cells are reached c c k is released and helps reduce the activity of those a g are generous that promote feeding as you can see feeding is an interplay between brain and body and it is some of the micro nutrients and even the break down o particular neutriance that is putting the accelerator or the break on the feeding process it is not just one thing from an actionable standpoint you we should probably all be trying to get are a negatory a magasix ratios correct anyway because they are anti decrescent i talked about the were reviewed studies on that they are healthy for the gotmicropiom and we should be seeking sufficient glutamine now whether not you decide to supplement with gludomie or not is up to you one of the reasons why one might want to do that and again you should always check with a doctor especially if you have any predisposition to dancers or you have cancer many cancers and tumors glutamine that something to note but one reason why you might want a supplement with glutamine or consider eating foods that are rich in glutamine is not just to keep your appetite in healthy ranges but as well glutamine can actually reduce sugar cravings this very interesting i have a friend he is an absolute chocolate sweets tit he is a groan adult but he eats candy and chocolate as if it was know as if he was a fourteen year old kid hanging out at the local convenient start it is really incredible and he as probably a a sugar addiction but he is very aware of this and he is managed to kick all other editions for whatever reason it stimulates his brain and body in the ways that make him want more but he hates that it is actually quite frustrating for him he somebody who cares a lot about his health he took the approach that i know many other people have who know about this roll of glutamine of taking a teaspoon or couple teaspoons of glutamine several times throughout the day t ere any time he craves sugar and indeed glutamine will refuse sugar cravings some people who are really on on the count of qitoganic front will mix it with a lo bit of half and half and down that because i guys it makes it taste better to little bit chalky glooming a say very interesting properties but i think for most people that are not suffering from adverse levels of craving making surveyor getting the right omega threes that can come from variety of sources check out the episode we did on nutrition if you want a learn more about that and sales and making sure that you are getting enough glutamine is going to be important for making sure that the c c k signal gets through the one thing i do ant o mention about glutamine it is a minor effect but it alone can have a small increase a excuse me it alone can increase blood sugar it is not of huge increase in blood glucose but because the gut takes prolines and breaks them down into these aminoacids and essentially looking for glutamine and things it other essential monoacid as well when you invest glutamine or branch chanominoacids there is a small but real increase in blood glucose and that is because they are essentially food and there ism ting by the supplemental version just know glooming can increase blood sugar slightly specially diabetic should know that it can reduce sugar cravings and just know that what your gut is doing at a cops level is it is forging it is waiting in its trying to access levels of a mega three fatiacid conjugate lanolin acid and glooming and other essential monoacid you are essentially trying to eat to get these nutrients and then a signal can be diploid up to your brain that you are not really interested in eating that much more whenever preparing an episode for this podcast ism always faced with a particular challenge which is how many tools should i offer that involve doing something new o new behavior new exercise supplement something things of that sort and how many should be related to not doing things avoiding things it is never really fun to talk about all the things that were past to avoid but some of them are powerful in light of the mechanisms of a given topic that it'd be remiss if i did not mention them now you understand how hormones and peptides c c k in gremlin impact appetite there is one particular aspect of food that can powerfully impact c c k and i think most people ism guessing ninety nine point nine percent people out there are not aware of this and as to do with highly process foods there is a lot of reasons why one would want to avoid highly process foods fact if you are interested in that topic and the history of whole foods transition into highly process foods in this country i highly recommend you listen to a ut video by doctor robot lusting he is universe of californium san francisco it is very easy to find put stamford robot lusting it was a talkhosted by stamford gives a a beautiful description of the history of this and why the food industry started packing in additional sugars and salts and turning foods into commodities is really fascinating has no conspiracy theories just all scientific facts hat's really a wonderful lectures millions of views should be very easy to find we can provide a link to that and we will there is another reason to avoid highly process foods however and the has to do with what is called a emulsifiers now many of you are familiar with taemlsiiers even though you do not know it when you put detergent in the laundry that is an it contains emulsifiers the the goal of that detergent is to bring together fatty molecules with water molecules and be able to dissociate them and break them up to get the stains out of clothes and things of that sort there are a lot of emulsifiers put into processed foods and those emulsifiers allow certain chemical reactions to occur that extends the shell fly for those food its candy bars and aureoles and all sorts of things that are in process foods the worst of which are the typical kind of pastries that you see the convenient store but this extends into chips of various kinds and even some meats of various kinds they practised off into meats they have names soy leather and other things wire emulsifiers bad of there letter reasons why they are bad but the reason why they are bad for the mechanisms that we have been talking about today is that when you ingest those foods your bringing those emulsifiers into your gut and those emulsifiers strip away then mucosa lining of the gut and they actually cause the neurons that enervate the gut that extend those little processes we call across into the gut to retract deeper into the gut and as a consequence you are ingesting a bunch of food and the signals c c k never get deployed the signals that actually shut down hunger are never actually trigger and as a consequence you want to eat far more of these highly process foods in addition if you then go from eating a highly process food to to non highly process foods you are not able to measure the amounts of monoacid sugars and fatiasids in those foods as accurately you have actually done structural damage and a micro level but structural loved damage excuse me to the memos lining of the gut now this can all be repaired if you stay away from highly process foods for some period of time but the negative effects of these emulsifiers are quite real to make it really clean and simple a emulsifiers from highly process foods are limiting your guts ability to detect what is in the foods you eat and therefore to deploy the seedy signals the signals that shut down hunger in addition to that there is a parallel mechanism at play that i talked about in a previous episode but it'll remind you again that you have neurons in your gut that are sensing sugar and are sending a subconscious signal up to the brain via the vaguest nerve and those neurons trigger the release of dopamine which makes you crave more of that food to nigh have got parallel signals making want to eat more sugar making you unaware of how much sugar you eaten and that i disrupting the inputs to the nervous system that signal to the rest or your brain anybody that you obtained enough fatyacids and to obtained enough a men access these highly process foods are really terrible and ism not out here to say never enjoy of process food of any kind it'd be a hyppocricas i do eat process foods from time to time although the ones that i tend to eat i try and make of the healthier variety but eating whole foods has tremendous value and eating highly process food o has tremendous negative impact on the gut and on the gut brain access and recently there was a paper that came out in sell sell press journal its kind of the apace of sell journals is phenomenal this paper showed that insulting highly process food leads to more intake of not just highly process foods but other types of food in general the was kind of an overeating compensation generally a press foods for people that consume these highly process food and there a lot of other reasons to avoid highly process foods again i do not to focus too much on the do not i tho army with tools to do but i think this visual of certain foods and these amplifiers actually stripping away some of the critical lining of your gut and disrupting the hormone signalling to the brain controlling feeding is important enough and critic enough meaning it has not been talked about it works at a sub conscious level and that it is important that people are aware of it they can make decisions about what they do want to eat or not want to eat for themselves before moving on i just want to say one more thing about highly process foods there was in absolutely beautiful study done by my colly cries garner at stamford exploring whether not certain diets were better than the others they looked at vixen vegetarian omnivore i soft know they looked to all meat or not but they looked at the different forms of diets interment fasting et camera and they essentially found that whichever diet people adhered to whichever one they followed was equivalent to the others provided that they followed it they lost the equivalent amount of weight there really was not a strong effect of the food type or the pattern of eating et camera however in a study that adherence is very high because people are part of a study and for many people the ability to adhere to a certain eating plan is one of the most if not most powerful determinate of whether or not i given diet meaning nutritional plan works now this thing about highly process foods however is rally diabolical because it truly says and i think the recent data in selmotabolism and other journals really proves that a carry is not a carry that is absolutely absurd because of these amplifiers and the contents of these a highly process foods in fact the data inhuman points to this what they dis they took a impatient adults they had total control over their food and take and they received either ultra process or process diets for fourteen days is short study the diets were matched for calories sugar fat fiber and makeronutriante everything else was matches process or nonprocess is the major variable and basically what they found is that the people who were eating the process food i happen to eat much more right this was after this period of of putting them on either diet and clamping for all other variables then they would eat much more and the bodyweight changes were much more and those bodyweight changes wore such that they could not be accounted for by just increased calories the bottom line is that highly process foods are just bad for you they increase weight gain they disrupt the lining of your got in a way that disrupts things ceca k and proper society signals and they contain a bunch of things in particular sugars but other things as well that disrupt not just the hormonal systems but also the curl systems that control the desire to eat after the diet is done there is just many reasons why these highly process foods are terrible and they can explain a lot of the ill health effects that we have seen in the last fifty years notjust in the united states but all over the world the enormous increase in diabetes juvenile diabetes it is just a remarkable how far down the path of bad we have gone and it is clear it is almost a smoking gun what the cause of this is if you to learn more about that release referred to the lusty lecture he also spells out why non process foods is far more economical in terms of o just that the level the household or individual as well as at the societal level really interesting stuff a highly recommend you check it out now let us move on to some other hormones that regulate hunger and society in particular insolent now you've probably heard of insolent before insolent is the thing that is lacking in type one diabetics that is why they have to inject in stolen whenever they eat the reason they have to do that is base when they eat the foods are broken down into glucose and in order to shuttle glucose to the appropriate tissues in the body and also to keep glucose levels in check you need insolent the simplest way to think about insolent and glucose is that when you eat that food is broken down into sugars that is true whether r not its fats or its sugars or eventually if its propenes they are oxidized into fuels as we say and those fuels can be used as the name fuel implies into energy there eventually made into a ten is a munch about chemical steps there were not going go into to day but that is he gently outwards you break down food into glucose now if your keetogenic will talk about that in a little bit but in general you eat food is turned into glucose your blood sugar needs to be kept in a particular range hypoglycemic means too low hyperglycemic means too high and what they call you glyceric e you glyceric is the healthy range now what those healthy ranges are in general the healthy range the uglicemic rangers about seventy to a hundred anagrams for desoleder but most of you are not walking around with a glucosmonitor some of you are but most of you are not the more important question for us to address right now is we is it important that glucose be kept at a particular level once you understand that keeping glucose in check starts to have a rational behind it and the ways to do that start to make a lot more sense the the reason is if glucose levels get too high because of the way that are sells in particular neurons interact with glucose high levels of glucose can damage neurons cannectually kill them you construct getting what are called periprperiferalscues me nuropothes one of the symptoms of some forms of diabetes is that people start losing the sensation of touch in their fingers or their hands or their feet and they can start going blind there is diabetic retinopathes it is very important that insolent manage your glucose levels now there is also type to diabetes where there is insolent secreted from the pancreas but people are insolent insensitive there is a destruction in the receptors and insolent insensitivity is not quite the same as having no insolent at all but it parallels some of the same mechanisms now type one diabetes is often picked up because some one has a sudden weight loss because there not processing blood sugar the same way they were before type two diabetes is often although not always associated with being overweight and with obesity both of them are are challenging conditions type two diabetes almost always can be managed by managing one's weight and of course there are prescription drugs and supplements that can help manage those we are going to talk about all of that but for most people that do not have diabetes the important thing is to manage glucose to keep it in that ugliycemic range and there are number of different ways to do that some of them are behavioral some of them are diabase and some of them are based on supplements are prescription drugs let us talk about those now if you eat and in particular if you eat carbohydrates blood glucose goes up if you fats blood glucose goes up to a far less degree and if you prolines depending on the proline it will eventually be broken down for fuel or assembled into menoacichains for proline synthesis and repair of other tissues in bodily functions but glucose goes up and then is kept in range when you are hungry you secrete a different hormone and that is called glucagon and glucagons main roll is to pull stores of energy out of the liver and the muscles and once those are depleted you will eventually happen to body fat and this is for people that have a typical blood glucose range that seventy to a hundred a youglicemic range the to kind of pushpin pull systems that we are going think about now to keep this simple is that you have the insolent system managing glucose and you have got the glucagon system pulling energy out of your liver and muscles for immediate fuel and eventually you will pull fuel out of body fat if you have been active for very long time and all your linkage in stores are depleted or close to depleted what is this all mean there is a lot of important bye chemistry in a and a lot of important cellar processes involved in weather not your anabolic or fatal catabolic wither not your breaking things down are building things up let us talk about feeding in a simpler way however and let us weave the tools to manage blood glucose to keep it in check as we do that let say you had a meal and that meal consisted of rice a carbohydrate some meat or fish let say a piece of salmon and some vegetable some fibrous vegetable a asparagus are cabbage or something that if you were to eat all of that at once you may take a bite of one a bite of the other you have mix it up you know one of these at all ends up in the same place can of people mix it all up then you will experience an increase in insolent increase in blood g glucose that is moderately fast irony increase pretty quickly what is remarkable is that the order that you consume each macronutrian has a pretty profound influence on the rate of insulin and glucose secretion into the blood and how quickly those levels rise if you will make it really simple if you were to eat the rice first your glucose would rise in a sharp spike especially if it does not contain any fats to slow the absorption now that might be good if your very hungry and you want to get and increase in glucose in fact this is the reason why you are often served bread before meals because it is and sometimes its bread and butter but or chips before meals or appetizer are designed to get your blood glucose going up high because big steep increases in blood glucose tend to promote the desire to consume more glucose and this also relates to the dopamean system in the way that something tasty in the mouth and sugar in the gut and fats and sugars in the mouth sugar the activation of a lot of systems in the brain body to consume more of whatever you have or whatever is available to you the basic ideas that eating carbohydrates end or fats early in a meal will give a steep rise in blood glucose however if you were to eat the fibrous thing first a lot of chewing but not a big rise in blood glucose was in general there is unless its laid with sugar something were just talking about a some some vegetable fibrous vegetable that will actually blunt the release of glucose until you eat the fish in the rice but believe are not it will actually blunt the glucose increase that the rice would cause now ism not talking not neurotically eating each macronutre and separately and sequence ism just trying to give you a picture of what is happening ordinarily what this means is if you feel a lot of food related anxiety or you feel your one of these people that a you can continence your blood sugar increasing very quickly lot of people con sens is some people cannot has a lot to do with how well they manage their blood sugar as well as some of the psycho logical factors and yes their family and historical reasons for you ow have got friends who had lot of siblings and when they sit down to eat they have to really suppress the desire to not you do not beat up every one else at the table and take all the food it sort not a it is hard for them to understand that there is plenty go around because of their bring there are psychological top down effects a lot of t e psychology round food is were towards getting people to be relaxed when they eat in these sorts of things but these blood sugar effects are real just cellar and they sic big chemistry of how the body manages sugars invested into the blood what this all mean it means that if you want a steep increase in glucose you are very very hungry than you should eat the the carbohydrate late in food first or you should eat a bunch of macronutreancs combines that would be the hamergar or the sandwich the the bread the whatever in that sandwich all together usually that is proline and and vegetables as well if you want to have a kind of more modest increasing glucose r you want of blunt that increasing locos than have the at least some of the fibrous thing first and then the proline and then the carbohydrate you will notice that your good glucose will lot rise more steadily and that you will achieve satiety earlier in the meal or at least you will not get this in huge peak at sort of the thanksgiving a meal effect some you are international if you are to not celebrate thanksgiving as ha time a year where a used to be the one time a year or two times a year where america would give themselves permission to eat enormous meals now that seems to happen a lot more often but there is this effect of your full and yet your hungry for more that is gets your good glucose has gone through the roof and its trigger t a number of other mechanisms there is also usually a lot o algal consumption am and alcohol itself because it is a sugar will increase blood glucose very very a sharply it depends on the alcohol some calls have more sugar than others but they'll what your trying to avoid are steep increases in blood sugar and the order tat you eat foods has it enormous impact on that the other thing that has an enormous impact on how long and shallow or how steep that curve of glucose is depends on whether or not you recently were moving are moving or start moving after you eat it turns out that your blood glucose levels can be modulated very very powerfully by movement if you did any kind of intense exorcise or even just walking or jogging or cycling anything before you eat your blood glucose lev let will be dampen somewhat and that has to do with the release of something called some people call glut for we sound glutton other people call it glue for these are things that are involved in smuggling glucose to particular cells and the body namely toward muscle and glakagen stores and away from body fat stores it has to do a sequestering of glucose from the blood the point is that if you're somebody who struggles with blood sugar regulation and addition to getting your body weight in a healthy range doing all the other sorts of things that you should be doing the key thing is to try and get some movement some time sick meal now very few people can actually eat and walk at the same time although i do it all the time a not because ism train to regulate my blood sugar be just as i then to be busy i eat an drive are you are busy busily if ism not giving this podgiest or sleeping ism eating but o except the early part of the day when i fast but the bottom line here is that if you for instance take a thirty minute walk after a meal your blood glucose will be blunted in ways that are beneficial if you have exercised in the recent hours before a meal that can be beneficial the order that you consume foods is beneficial and there are few things that you can consume that can also adjust blood glucose levels let us talk about those but i thought it was important to really tamp down that it is not just what you eat we talked about that before but also the order that you eat those things believe or not whether are not you combine macronuterients carbohydrate's prolines and fasts and fibrous vegetables and whether or not you have moved recently the higher intensity the movement the grater the the glue glut for increase and the more that the blood glucose will be blunted and you will shuttle more of that to glakagen and muscle stores and even just moving after a meal even just a a calm easy walk can really adjust the ways in which blood sugar regulated for the better i do not want ta perseverate on this process foods a hidden sugars thing too much but understanding now a little bit about how insulin and glucose work you can probably imagine why hidden sugars are such an attractive thing from the standpoint of process food manufacturers because if they can put sugar in that you cannot even taste that sugar is going to amplify the amount of glucose it is going to increase the rate of glucose increase in into your bloodstream and it is going to promote more feeding in that case your really being tricked it is not that you are actually reaching for the additional appetizer and your blood glucose's going up the food that you ate is actually increasing your appetite as you eat it it is a positive feed back loup do not want to demonize those any more than i already have but you should be aware that these things are happening at the level of your blood stream and brain the other thing it'd to address for a moment is this notion of stable blood sugar verses labile blood sugar or unstable blood sugar some people just have stable blood sugar they can go long periods of time without eating and feel fine other people get really shaky really jittery and w or when they do eat they feel really keyed up sometimesthyll even set sometimes their vision will go blurry and some of that can actually be of because they become hype hypergolic sumac and those effects that you experience when you are hyperglycemic are the early warning signs of the kinds of things that damage neurons and lead to the really terrible stuff they talked about before puerperal naturopathies now take some time for those things to occur those nauropothes to occur but whether not your blood sugar is all over the place or wither n to stable can be impacted by a number of things one of those things is exercise the these days there is a lot of interest in what they call zone to cardie which is that kind of steady state cardie where you can just nasal breathe even at pretty high output where you could may be have a conversation although ism such a huge proponent of nasal breathing during exercise most forms of exercise especiallyszown to cardie that a you proxy should not be talking a while your going that cardie unless it is absolutely essential but period s of zone to cardie that last anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour or sometimes more for your endurance athletes can create plosive effects on blood sugar regulation such that you people can sit down and enjoy whatever it is the hotblooded sundae or whatever the high sugar content food is and blood glucose management is good your insolent sensitivity is high which is a good thing that you can manage that blood glucose to the point where it does not really make you shaky a does not disrupt you and it a to say nothing of the the weight related issues or the adipose a youknofhatgan et camera that is a separate issue cause people vary there but basically doing zone to cardie for thirty to sixty minutes three to four times a week makes your blood sugar really stable and that is an attractive thing for a variety of reasons on the flip side high intensity interval training or resistance training a ka weight training are very good at stimulating the various molecules that promote repackaging of glikagen sprints have kuwait lifting circuit type weight lifting provided there some reasonable degree of resistance those are going to trial are all sorts of mechanisms that are going to encourage the body to shuttle glucose back into glikagen converting to glycogen into muscle tissue restock the liver et camera depending one's glikagen actually take some time if you do a couple sets of tryst extensions and some crunches you are not pleading your glikagen glikagen to pleading workouts are very high intensity am generally their less than an hour or but those are the the sort that are going to lead to big increases in the kinds of enzymes than metabolic pathways they're going to repack glikagen and shuttle most things towards storage of foods not into adipose issue not into fat but taking glucose and making it into fuels that you can access later for more of that high intensity activity and i should mention that one of the advantages of high intensity interval training or weight lifting a various kinds is that it also it causes long standing increases in bail metabolic rate and only go too far down this fact as were going to do an entire month on on human performance and athletic performance but it is not just the increases in muscle that increase metabolism because muscle burns more energy than other types of tissues except your brain which truly burns the most energy a am is the main reason why your bail metabolicrate is what it is well high intensity trainings what could be prince it could be my intends the interval training of different kinds could be weight training also has an effect of increasing thermogenesis a even long after you have completed the exercise there is a long tail there is a kind of post exercise metabolic of fact that is also beneficial is not in either or it is really that high intencsthe interval training and resistance training and things of that sort are very good for one reason and the zone too cardie is very good for other reasons and now you can see why it is just a healthy thing why most people should probably be doing exercise most days of the week a if not everyday of the week if your goal is to manage blood glucose and your goal is to manage some of the metabolic factors that control repackaging of likagin and encouraging excess glucose to not get diverted into body fat stores we have not talked a lot about lipids to day that is because most of to days discussion is about hormones and insolent is the dominant hormone in terms of mobilizing and managing glucose in the body least for most people but fats are very important and there is just a little anecdote about fats that i think will be useful in thing about why you want to manage what they call the eldeeller dell ratios this is deserving i an entire episode many that perhaps even several episodes but some of you may me familiar with eldeells in h dells some of you may not the eldiell is lode's like proline this is the one that you do not want it to be too high hostile's dreaming he is barking at he does not that he loves all forms of cholesterol a but that is just costello dreaming el dells of the ones that you want to keep low you do not want those to go excessively high h yells the hoydens like prolines are the ones that are the called healthy a liproprotines that is all fin and good but you might ask yourself what are they doing what is the actual roll of these things and why would you want healthy levels of h dell and not too much el dwell well one of the reasons is that fats do not water right they are hydrophobic and yet you need to move fats in your blood stream all tissues in your body need fats they need collestrals that last up we talk about cholesterol as a precursor to the asteroid hormones estrogen and testosterone and other hormones as well well h d l and el do actually cot fats that to allow them to be transported through the bloodstream they do a number of other things as well but h d l is a key component of the delivery system that brings those fats to the liver ovaries testis and a adrenals in other words having adequate levels of h d l is good because it allows fats to be delivered to the tissues that manufacture testosterone estrogen coatis all in healthy levels and the liver this is why when elderly are too high what is happening is your not getting fats to the correct tissues and you can get build up of fates fat liver disease an some of these things om can happen a high sugar content can even lead to to that some of these fatty liver conditions that starting to happen is is you the first time in human history perhaps that we are were of anyway that we are string to s liver conditions that normally were associated only with severe alcoholism starting to come from sugar contents what does this mean this means keep your elder and h d el ratios proper you want those h d ls in order to deliver fatty molecules to the very tissues that use collateral in order manufacture hormones how do you keep elderly and h d ls in their properties well lot of people do not realize this but the debate about dietary collateral and its relationship to ell and h deal ratios is a it is a barbed wire debate i do not wat to get into it right now there are still lot of open questions as to how much dietary collestral impacts elder n ah deal ratios i do not want to get into that now ism not taking a stance either way but what is very clear is that having highly elevated glucose consuming too much sugar or not managing glucose in your body through some of the mechanisms that were in talking out up until now can also negatively impact elder h d el ratios managing glucose goes way beyond just managing blood sugar and making sure that you do not lay down too much body fat making our you metabolism stays high making sure your not getting jittery at meals it also has to do with making sure that your creating enough of the molecules h d l and not too many of the molecules eld l that are going to disrupt the delivery of things to the organs of your body that allow you to make healthy levels of testosterone estrogen and forth if that was not clear lemme make this ultra simple you want healthy levels of h d l and you want low levels of ell because if you have ovaries it will allow the fats that need to get to the very to produce estrogen to get there and if you have testis it will allow the fats and the collateral molecules that you need in order to manufacture testosterone to get to the testis as well in order to have proper renal function and proper liver function you want h el and el die in the healthy correct levels now we have talked a lot about behavioral tools and the underlying biological mechanisms that justify those tools in particular circumstances now i to turn to supplements and prescription drugs that regulate the hormone systems controlling feeding and satiety there are huge number of these some have more powerful effects than others their two that i want o describe because they have getting a lot of attention recently first of all there is a prescription drug met foreman which who has developed as a treatment for diabetes and it works potently to reduce blood glucose it has dramatic effects in lowering blood glucose met formal involves changes to might acondrual action in the liver that is its main way of depleting or reducing blood locos and it does through the called a m p q pathway and it increases insolent sensitivity over all met foreman is a powerful drug in fact ism surprise that many people have sought it out given that most of the people that ism aware of that sought it out are not diabetic i think for diabetics at seems to be a useful drug for non diabetics it can also of course lower blood glucose it also has the potential to make people hypogli semi genuinely hypoglycemic you really need to approach met foreman with caution yellow concern when i hereabout people blasting met foreman simply because fasted states or low blood sugar states are healthy doing that pharmoclogically can have longstanding effects you really want to approach that with caution now there's a comparable drug it really should be called a drug but it is non prescription that is also in fairly prominent use out there called berberine b e r b e r i n e be terrene correct berberine is a really interesting compound it actions very much mimic met foreman let us talk about berberine for a second berberine actually comes from various plants and tree bark it is sold in supplement stores its sold on line it is as far as i know unregulated it is powerful if you are going to experiment with barbering you defy want to toctyour doctor and you not approach it with caution it also works to activate the called a m pa pathway a m you by the waystandsfor a denizens monophosphate activated proline china a m pa and it inhibits approaching tracing phosphate one bee pathway i thing that is enough nomen cloture it in activates a certain pathway that is associate with fasting and low blow blood glucose the effects of berberine r as far as i can tell when looking at the literature a very similar if not identical to met foreman now the number of studies out there on this are a many ism just con review a few of them and their major effects as always i invite you to check out examine dot come it is wonderful website were you can put in any supplement or compound or biological goal for that matter and it will list out the various effects and the human effect matrices o studies on humans if they're available and it will tell you whether not their strong effects are weak effects are modest effects and it will point to the specific subject population wonderful resource beriberi not surprisingly has very strong effects in lowering blood glucose a four studies on this in fact they say that barbering is one of the more if not most effective supplements for lowing blood glucose it talks about dosages there although it'll just mention that have tried berberine and the dosages that are typical on the bottle a of most supplements a is much higher then i needed when i took berberine two things happened a first of all a i got a pretty splitting headache it gave me pretty vicious headache for me it was a no almost immediately the other thing is i became hypo glyceric that in order to get my blood sugar back up i think i ate song ten doughnuts and i did not feel had invested all that much sugar it was really kind of weird out hyper magic for sugar outs craving sugar craving sugar and own very thirsty is well and i do not want a promote any bad behavior but i know that certain people use thus when they have over eaten sugars are they are doing their cheat days something that ism personally just not fanon and they want to keep their blood sugar and hacker they know the gin to consume a huge meal they will take barbering to keep blood glucose clamped and it does do that it has very strong effects three pure reviewed studies on h be a one sea levels h be a one s is something the can be measured in a blood test that is sort of an average read out of your blood sugar levels over the previous two or three months sometimes shorter period but that is mostly what h be a a one s is about it radically decreases your blood sugar levels it actually lowers colleestral it acts remember on the liver and the livers involved in collestral metabolism and remember it is both sugars blood glucose and dietary fat perhaps it still heavily to bested ah in terms of how your blood total colleiestral h yell new dollar regulated it seems to lower total celestial and it seems it lowers h dell an el dell in parallel that is interesting ah one study showed a miner increase in eh yell the called good collestral in some levels drop not surprising another sit show slight decrease in elder though seem to be kind of miner here is a kind of interesting one just help you remember berberine as if the fact that it comes from tree bark is not a on truer enough to remember it direct contact of berberine on cankerworm seems to eliminate cankers is very quickly which is kind of cool ism unit cankerworms in a few years but when i dig down they are extremely painful a do not those that is kind of interesting and there is a some study references there have find amazing that these compounds exist you get the prescription drug met foreman and then you have got barbering the stuff from tree bark and they have effects that or essentially equivalent to one another again ism not promoting their use a or even their ex exploration but those compounds do exist there out there and check out examined to come if you to learn more certainly do your reading do your homework before you start just popping the stuff and if you have hypoglycemia or hyperglicingia be especially careful and also do understand that dosages and dose requirements very if you do do go down this path a really approach things carefully always a start with the lowest amount that a you could get away with for me the headache thing just made it a know go i do keep a bottle of it in a full disclosure a in the odd chance that a i feel ye tunadoghnuts a it is not much about a not ingesting the calories is just that i do not the feeling of being hyper glisemac the blurry vision just feeling lousy i do love doughnuts other things that impact blood glucose in supplement form chromium has been shown in twenty nine studies to have a miner i want emphasize a minor effect on reducing blood glucose things ell carnations something we talked about here on the polkas before terms of its relationship to a power out put in a t p production for both erotic and anerobic exercise as well as sperm quality and a equality we talked about that long ago a things panache ginseng a can have positive effects on i i should say can have effects of reducing blood glucose slightly i do not want to give a valance to or judgment to wether notes positive or negative here is something that is interesting that you should know about canine has very reliably been shown to increase blood glucose just a little bit so i ways thought that cabin would drop blood glucose but it actually can increase blood glucose just slightly things magnesium talked about magnesium for as a tool for enhancing the passage into sleep a in particular magnesium three an eight and by alienate magnesium can also have a honest production on and blood glucose you shin to get the impression everything reduces blood glucose but that certainly not the case and then a couple episode o go on it when we are discussing nutrition we talk about artificial sweeteners sucres ascertain neuter sweet that some of those are generic names some of those might be brandnames and how they have negative effects on the got mycrobyum and that supported by a number of studies there is one artificial sweetener as a stein best e v i a which seems to lower blood glucose just slightly and i still cannot find data on whether or not stein impacts the got mycrobyum in either direction a many of the things that i consume do have small amounts of stein on them id love to know if anyone out there is aware of quality pure reviewed research as to whether n stein impacts the gut microfilm similarly or differently from other a artificial sweetness please let me know please send me the references that really appreciate you put in the comment section on you tumor elsewhere comemensition on you to be the best place stein seems to lower blood glucose a little bit which makes it kind of an attractive artificial sweetener if one is going to use artificial sweet nurse but remember sweet taste itself stimulates the desire to eat which will increase more blood glucose ism guessing that they proudly cancel each other out see are to think logically about these things within in bee three some of the beevidemens do indeed stimulate appetite by triggering increases in blood glucose sideman be three in particular i do not know of be six does things zinc seem to lower blood glucose and then there's been an enormous number of other things that have been tested for thee rolls in blood glucose apple side or vinegar anything acidic this is well known now that any kind of a acidity to be lemon juice or lime juice or appleside or vinegar lowers blood locos slightly some of those can also have other effects that we are not talking about to day that is kind of interesting because there is a movement now towards creating a for people talk about becoming more alkaline when hes a a hate to break it to you but you do not really want your body to be to alkaline you want to stay in the right part else you start a the conditions that make you more alkaline a you soft want be tactic or to alkaline a if you see a beverage or something that a purports that in jesting that beverages going to make you more alkaline a that absolutely false the no evidence for that is impossible by of chemically is just just marketing but none the less in jesting foods that are acidic can make some slight adjustments to the pitch of the gut in ways that can slow or alter the absorption of foods and can blunt blood g glucose you can try the sometime if you want if ever your feeling can over sugar out t you at something with too much sugar you drink a small amount of lemon juice makes with water lime choice and you will notice that it will blunt that kind of a hyperglycemic of felt just a little bit again you don't i uses as a a medical tool but a the effect is is fairly potent and then excuse me and then there are a number of other things captain and hot chilly peppers that will lower blood glucose the list goes on and on the most powerful one is absolutely berberine an met foreman but those that is really heavy caliber stuff and the other ones i mention have more minor effects i do want a mention because ism sure some of you out there a curious about the erogenic die ism going to do an entire episode about ketosis and the brain and the body but the biogenic i has been shown in twenty to studies to have a notable decrease on blood glucose and that is not surprising because you are they the essence of the of the keetogenic diet is that you are consuming very little or her of of the foods that promote big spikes in insolent glucose if you consume enough proline some of that protein can be converted in to glucose of course through glucose genesis but the qeitogenicdi has very strong support as for it is roll in regulating blood sugar which is glucose but the specific effects of the qkeitogenic diet and one particular effect that it'll address later but it'll mention now which is the ability of the the queitogenic diet to a just fibroid harmony levels in ways that make it such that if you return to eating carbohydrates after being mitosis for too long you do not manage fibroid and carbohydrates as well that has been shown as well organ a dive deep into mitosis in a future episode for uquitonice does out there do not worry i certainly have nothing against qeitogenic diet actually do not have anything for against any particular nutrition plan i know it works for me at least at this stage of my life and all update it if i need to ism simply trying to get you as much information as i possibly can that you can navigate through that landscape in a way that is in keeping with your particular rolls now you understand a lot about blood sugar and how it is managed and the ways that you can manage it better depending on your particular needs this is also a good opportunity for us to look back at some of the medical literature because it really points to just how far we have come in terms of understanding these important mechanisms and it points us in the direction of some actionable protocols diabetes which is these huge increases in blood glucose because there is no insolent was known about as early as fifteen hundred b c which is just incredible and the way physicians then understood that certain people had high blood glucose without actually knowing what blindglucos blood is that they would take the urine of particular patience and they would find that ants preferably move toward and consumed the urine of certain patients and not others and they understood that there was something in that urine that was correlated with the seen weight loss and some of the other probably very unfortunate health you symptoms that these people were experiencing they knew the there was something in blood in and urine but you might not be asking yourself weight that is urine but as i tell every kid that i meet two things i tell kid your brain is here i make them point to their head and then i tell them do what do youknow that your urine is actually filtered blood and they usually go i get parental permission to do this first but most adults do not realize that your urine is actually just filtered blood and that is why if you see blood in your urine that is a problem you want to filter the blood but urine is filtered blood now this business of measuring blood sugar from the urine h as been something that lasted way beyond these early stages of in of fifteen hundred b c turns out that as late as sixteen seventy four physicians at oxford university were figuring out who had pathologically high levels of blood glucose by analyzing their urine and again they were measuring the sweetness of their urine but and this is medical fact they would do this by taking up samples from indifferent patients and tasting them and they developed an intuitive sens of what excessively sweet urine was relative to the other cranes that they had tasted for those of you that are in the medical profession are those of you that are seeking out the medical profession do understand this is not done any more and you can also just reflect on how far we have come in terms of the medical profession itself in our ability to measure things from the blood and measure things from urine without having to ask ants which urine is sweeter or ask oneself which urine is sweeter indeed we are making progress as a species before we close out to day i want to talk about one more tool that many of you will probably find useful i certainly have i may big consumer of canine although i do not consume a ton of it i consume it very consistently ism big on consuming mate which is a strong marinated t and i generally do that early in the day although i do delay about two hours after i wake up for reasons have talked about in previous episode to maintain that nice art of alertness in focus i do drink black coffee as well mushroom coffee as well of that stuff but mate also called carbamate is an interesting compound because unlike coffee it has been shown to increase something called glucagon peptide g l p on and increase lept in levels now we did not talk a lot about glucagon today glucagon is really elevated in the fasting state i mention that it sort of the opposite of insolent in kind of rough terms that is a one way to think about it but gowan or glucagon peptide on is increase by ingesting mate and it acts as a pretty nice appetite suppress it now ism not trying to suppress my appetite i to eat as i mention before but it works really well to stimulate the brain and to give you a level of alertness and to do a lot of the things that coffee does it also contains electrolyte we meaning our neurons and our brain on on a variety of factors electric selectivity and chemical transmission et camera but they require adequate levels of sodium potasciman magnesium sh if you were to learn the biology of the physiology of the action potential the firing of a neuron something we teach every first your nursing student and i be happy to teach you if your interested you will hear about sodium rushing in to cells and potassium entering and leaving cells in order to allow neurons to communicate electrolytes are critically important for the function of the nervous system and many things that act as diabetics that promote excretion of water caffeine can also take electrolytes out along within particular sodium and sometimes the lightheadedness of the brain fog that people experience is not just because electronics are low but because there out of balance i mate because it has electrolytes it has caffeine it stimulates the release of this glucagon peptic girl pe one and it is been a big help to me in extending that early morning fasting window out to about noon or when i eat my first meal it also just taste really good i do not drink it out of the good even though i have argentine lineage the good to me is a it is just kind of an inconvenience i drink it out of a mug a there is no promotional here i have no relationship to any yerbomate a plantations or a or companies i just happen to really the stuff and the fact that glucagon peptide one is enriched or is released more when you drink mate and the fact that go pe one can regulate blood sugar in ways that keep your bloodsugar in that a we called you got policy make not too high not too low mode is one reason why ingesting mate is attractive to me if you go to south america what you will see especially among beguines but also argentines is people she carry a firms of the stuff with them around and bring it to meals in restaurants and it is just considered cultural convention it is not unusual to see that we do not see that much here in the states but i happen to really love the stuff i brew my own am cause hat's the most economical way to do it and i really enjoy it it can be a little bitter for some people am the real key there if you want to know the mate trick is to not use water that is really boiling hot you go just shy of boil and then it demand then it does not have that same a kind of a to tobacco or really acidic a flavor to it it is it is obit just a little bit sweeter although not quite sweet your rotate go pe on can manage in healthy ways lept in levels glucose levels and glucagon levels in ways that if it serves you you might want to try once again we covered an enormous amount of material focus on how hormones regulate feeding hunger and when one feels they do not need to eat called cecity that you have had enough as always we covered a lot but i could not be exhaustive about all the information related to this topic it is just vast for instance we did not talk about fibroid hormone and extremely important hormone and pathway in the body and brain we are going to do an episode related to thyroid and tools to regulate thyroid i promise having seen this episode you will be able to digest that material with far more ease we a so did not talk about the fact that testosterone and estrogen can impact blood glucose in ways that are opposite to one another that when estrogen levels are his appetite tends to be reduced when testosterone levels are high appetite tends to increase they're all sorts of interesting interplays between the various harmony but that is much too much of a deep dive for now right now we have just focus to day mainly on things green on things malanicite simulating harmony incredible powerful harmony that can suppress appetite on things colicisti linen that comes from the gut and can suppress appetite on things fudamolsifires on the fact that when your eating you are a monoacid seeking even though you might not realize it that you are also seeking out particular fatyacids and particular the conjugated lanolin acids and omega threes i try to give you a number of actionable tools many of them re behavioral behavioral some of them are based on supplements or even prescription drugs again always do what is best for your health and do that in company with a health care a professional ism not a physician i do not proscribe anything ism a professor a professor lot of things and i try and share with you what i think to be the best high quality were reviewed literature that is what have done to day really appreciate your time and attention many of you have continued to ask how you can help support the podcast and we really appreciate the question there severalways to do that the first is to a video that you have seen if you it and please subscribe to the tube channel that is perhaps the most important thing about the tub channel as well leave us ta comment if you leave us a comment in the comment section that helps us and please ask questions those questions and your comments do inform content of future episodes we read them all except the negative ones we do not read ism just getting we read them all in addition please subscribe on apple and or notify or both if you and on apple you have the opportunity to leave us up to a five star review if you feel we deserve that apple also lets you leave a comment some feed back for us as well please do check out our sponsors that we mentioned at the beginning of the podcast that the best way perhaps to support the podcast as well we have a patron account it is patron dot calm slash drew supermen and there you can support the podcast at any level you and to day as well as in previous episodes have mention various supplements if you areinterested in seeing what supplements i take and you want explore for some other supplements as well you can go to thorn t h o r n e doc calm slash you the letter you slash supermen thorn is the supplement company that we believe to have the highest stringency in terms f what they put in the various supplements that they make in the amounts the they put are very accurate they have partnered with the mayo clinic they have partner with all the major sport steams and we have partnered with them because we believe in their levels of stringency and accuracy if you go to f on doc calm slash you slash supermen you can see what i take and you will also get twenty per cent off any of those supplements or any of the other supplements that thornmakes that is where you can find out more about supplements and the ones that i take and again you get the twenty per cent discount on any supplements that thorn makes and last but not least thank you for being with us i hope you learned a lot i hope you explore some of the tools and that the mechanistic information that you learn to day will serve you well if any one that is interested in this topic or you think that some one could benefit from it pleas suggest the podcast to them as well and most of all thank you for your interest in science

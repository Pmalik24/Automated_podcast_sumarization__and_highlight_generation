jo bison spent four years pretending his seventh grandchild does not exist but now he is reversed himself the apartment of justice encourages the arrest of hunter bison's business partner two days before his congressional testimony and tom drums mentions campaign rolls on ism ensphere o this is the venshperro so the bencher show monterbaepressve pin protect your all mine privacy to day expressivepiantocom flashes were the president of the united states is wildly on popular and a lot of people have attributed that to his policies the fact that is policies are all about gigantic government spending or equity at the center of all things or weak foreign policy including the pull out from afkaniston but the reality is that the reason the jobidon has been sinking in the polsesbecause america do not him personally unlike berokabama her the poll showed they had personally that in is policies with jobidon the to are just intertwine jo bison is not liked personally and the turning point for him was actually the pull out from afghanistan in till that point there an a widespread perception that he is a kindly elderly german was not all there but lessons was a fairly o ka guy but when he pulled out from afghanistan and basically set i do not care what happens there when the a people falling off wheel wells an america soldiers getting blown up and his entire administration sitting there talking bout what a wonderful job they were doing that really sunk the perception of the america public about him but he is now under scored that in radical terms because of his association with his son hunter the public mine with regard to hunter bison has shifted to it started off with hunter bison deposit bad guy drug abuser pornography abuser prostitute abuser the i a bad person but job ouzo decent dad trying take care of his drug ad diced son thing picture that his son was o a sympathetic figure and then as all these corruption stories roll out the stories about how hunter was going rounding of jean bags of cash from foreign sources and jo was in all likelihood benefiting from that the documents on hunter bison's laptop in which hunerbiden is bragging i to his daughter about funding daddy the documents from his laptop suggesting that job was taking part in meetings either by phone or sometimes even tin persons stopping by meetings an saying hello documents suggesting that hunter bison was saying two foreign officials that hoiden was sing next to him as he attempted to essentially pro many out of them e combine that with jobidon's treatment of hunter bisons illegitimate daughter and thing starts who go bad for jobidon intercoms public perception real fast lurking in the background of the bison family story has always been this idea that the are incredibly trial that if you are a bison then you get to benefit from the sweetheart deals that are associated with the bison last name if your frank biding go round pick up cash jobidon's brother if you are hunter an go round pick up cash because of course you are member of the corrupt bison family but if they choose not to give you the name if they decide that they are not going to extend the name to you then you are basically cut off at the knees and who better to apply that logic to then a small baby as we all know at this point hunter bison had a sexual relationship with a woman in onion robots onion r beats was acting apparently as his quasi assistant and by quassias listen we mean that hunter was basically using her not just for her secretarial abilities but for apparently other purposes and reasons sexual in nature and a she bore a child by him whom she named navy one navy on was bay was born way back in twenty nineteen it is curly twenty twenty three for years jobidon has maintained that he has six grandchildren he does not yes seven he is had seven grandchildren for four years and there is no real religious objection here emit not as though he has differences with hunter and therefore his cut hunter off from the family or something that this is some lady that hunter got pregnant and a kid who obviously is jobidon's granddaughter who he is simply were refused to give the bison last me which of course is the improve store of not only legitimacy but also of money making in the bison family literally the onlythng of matters is that last name that the only thing it is not jo bisons magic political skill said he has no magic political skill said he mean for a for present one hundred times before he latched on to the rising star of berokabama and then rode that in his oxygenation years to the presidency of the united states over dona trump he the bison last name is the moneymaker and that is explicitly what was denied to navy on in fact in the paternity hearings about navy on jobidon primary hunter bison said in the in the final analysis that navy one would be denied hunters last name the only thing that hunter would be giving to navy on and an hermommi were some finger paintings that hunter bison had created then presumably there would be some sort of corrupt teal or somebody buys those paintings off of navy one's mom and to money laundering operation essentially on behalf of bison family yet again by big namedjowners who will buy hunter bison's paintings from onion robots and then that money will eventually see navy but navyjone will be denied the magical bison last name that has meant literally tends of million of dollars flowing into family coffers for decades on end jobidon cares about his granddaughter much that he literally refused to acknowledge her existence at the white house there is a christian stocking for his dawn know the one those biting all the secret servitations but there is no christian stocking for the grander he refused to acknowledge what over the we et jobidon reverse that when the poll members mutton to bad because the is nothing that changed in principal here it was not as though jo bison suddenly it dawns on him that many he should acknowledge his seventh grandchild no what happened here is pretty obvious the america people do not it when this supposed kindly old family man who is entire excuse for his really ludicrously off treatment of his son has been that he loves his son o much he is the beautiful boy he is never done anything wrong it turns out that malison hold water when you are willing to disown a four year old a it is it is easy to make the claim that you love your kid much tho you let them get away with stuff when your when when everybody in the family is treated with this level of warmth but when you say this for year old ho through no fault of her own was born of of your son is not part of the family but the son who is a crack victim derelict who runs around the world picking up bats of cash he is in good with me that appears a lot more corruption than does family loyalty because apparently o get kicked out the family all that is required it is for your mom to be somebody that jo bison does not very much or five humiliating but tore included in all family activities up to an including present day even after pleading guilty to actual federal is demeanor all you really have to do is go out and continue to pick up bags of cash if you are hunts er bison or have picked up bags of cash in the past over the we get jobidon and jobidon put out a statement finally about this missing grandchild we it is that in just one second first that a company is actually looking out for you when they up greater service and they do not charge you for it that is great news for new and current pure talk customers pure talk just agitated to every plan and includes moll hotspot with no price increase what soever if you have considered pure talk

cents off your first month and again a lot of money down the road as well puritan is wireless four america by america go check aright now pure talk dot come slashschippuro here is the statement that job and jo bison put out to people magazine to people the greatest of all new sources quote our son hunter and navy's mother onion are working together to foster or relationship that is in the best interest of their daughter preserving her privacy as much as possible going forward wultomen a great way to preserve for privacy was not to make her the center of a political scandal for union for years that in easy way but if job had just said seven grand children the whole time would that been a controversy or would we now would we know navy one's name do to any of jobidons o other grand children name ism put it that way name another jobidon grandchild go quick do no no you have never heard of them right because it is only a controversy when you refuse to name your grand child because your son piers or office o former stripper or something this is not a political issue it is a family matters said president bison jo and i only want let best for all of our grand children including navy a source familiar with the situation tells people the recently resolve child support dispute between hunter and onion has dictated how the relationship is played out far of ka that that source familiar at the situation probably be the bison family because who else exactly a the sad quote you have remember there ire some fairly contentious legal proceedings between navies parents happening until just a few weeks ago it's grand parents the bisons are following hunters lead they are and have been giving hunter in onion the space an time to figure things out what in under stand what they held does that have to do with job acknowledging that navy one is his gran ked how is that impact legal's view it it that there is no dispute whatsoever that that is in fact the case and n they literally did a pattern test and made twenty nineteen to determined that navy one is in fact hunter's kid if joke just been saying this the whole time is a gab that a not ism not comment on their legal situation that seen mommy and daddy in this particular case but of course she is our grand child and we love er i mean that such an easy answer again the reality is that there is only one thing that join cares about in life and that is the widen name he is made this absolutely clear he says this over and over in public life that the bison family i swear on the biding family name the bison family and because the bison family name again is his only valuable tool and it was only valuable really t everybody who is around him because able to parley his situation as a center into jobs and cash for his san for his brother for everybody else and presumably some that cash came back to him i say presumably because again we have documented accusations that that is the case from hunter from his laptop speaking to people the force notes the situation is a family is quote thousands of families to far similar circumstance is working it out in private verses the spotlight know they have not ne how many how many families are there where the grand parents refuse to even acknowledge that they have a grand child unless there is some sort of family dispute in which the parents of the child are strange from the grand parents truly i it is it is serious question is this happen a lot where the parents are not a strange not only is is daddy not a strange from grandpa they've basically live together in the same room in daddy is is flying around the world in staying literally in the same room in place ireland with grandpa if he has an loge in ma child is it is this a commenting at the center is a moral girl everyone wants was best for her including all f her grandparents i do not think that that is been proved by the record but say that it stop until she was four case she is four years old she is four is is not a two month matter is a four year matter why dos this matter well because it goes to character because in politics if as the democratic party suggests character matters in maters much the dona trump couldn't should never a been president he should never be president again because of his character defects well the fact is that jobidon has persuade himself in way that dontrup overdid joint's persuade himself as a generous kind hearted family man who only cares about the members of his family above all much that he is purely somepathatic to his drug addicted boozadold son but when it comes to the gran kid well then that is off limits it is off limits until we decide to say something it with point it is on limits for just a second ti to say once again what a great grandpa jo is and then back to being off limits again and of course the media are lapping this up because the media had no questions about this for very very long ton here for example is emasemisi anchor ally raphusan of they want is to preserve this little girl's privacy again if they once preserve her privacy he bin the easiest way to do that to just to have jobidon say he has seven grand children which he did alit the president has never hared his was in in her not publicly acknowledging this little girl but i thorfamiliar with the family situation molten bethink news he is a boy in doing until now to give his son and the girls other the titans fate tonavicate this the president who is always made his family a very public part of his life now ask thing to preserve the little girls private there at this point it fill in queer why there's the family dynamexchange at all a again it is all that the preservation of the privacy and then if you action mention the actual situation then members the medoshet you downs use yet an hos case he hand wat had on a sin and annalistname s cost kennings ans cotcchunnings is going pretty hard after hunter and immediately case huntumpson she we have to be respectful do we though to we hae her be respect of hunter who undoubted lose acting as a foreign agents of multiple governments and who sired a child by a person he calls ho secretary an who then ignored that child for four years an who's denied that house his last name to it do e have to street hunter with respect hunter is a terrible person you feel any necessity treetop and he is a public figure in far as he was picking up bags of cash with his daddy's name on them me come on but here is heaven going into defense mode and seen mode here it is not republicans with all were respect wo made hunter bid men to a complete scumbag on this another issues i the ignoring his own daughter the four years and the present united states hanging up a stocking for the dog man the an honor or his seventh grand shy l cannot we an also a we can falsity sympathy for people who are struggling with a diction let keep this corafision si listen i totally agree an on from a lot of fane wits deal with a diction and who ins a picking up the pieces the grand parent and in this case the grand clarence would not acknowledge this little girl it is o pensive but the bottom line is but they have now the to oh what a hero i mean the fact that she says that she jumps in and tries to scop stop scout kennings from doing all this is just demonstrative of everything that the widen family relies upon which is the acquiescence of the media in all these situations which is really what much of this is about wallet's more on this in just one second because again the hunter bidensoga is in fact going to do serious damage to jo in a way that then nothing is going to damagtertrum as have said before is beentrue for years dona trumpet it comes to this race is essentially a mud monster the more mud you throw on him the more he is made of mud you cannot you cannot sully the frock of somebody whose frock is made of mud there is no way to do it but hoiden proclaimed that he is a decent honest hard working family man and it turns out that he actually is a pretty corrupt old politician who is willing to manipulate and use his drug at old son to pick up bags of cashabroad were ignoring his grand child randan that that is not quite the same look we it is more o this unjust one second first innovation refund has been helping small business is the qualify get a business peril

eligible for that employ retention credit to day ill we meanwhile the delta put out a super bazar letter over the week en thedepartmen of justice obviously attempted to cut a sweetharteal with hunterbidon lie a real sweethartdeal much was weed hard teal the as wo explain last week when i was exposed to the light of day they immediately dissociated themselves from the the sweetheart tell the attempted to cut basically they had two sets of charges one was the tax charges one is the gun charges guns hunter bison in the tax charges they don't say anything about waving further investigations and charges with regard for for example the foreign agents registration act which hunter bid clearly violated who is acting as an and use on bereezma's word and trying to lobby politicians on behalf of breeze it brismofs you cranial energy company he was doing this also on behalf of chines companies there is no question the he violated the terms of the foreign actions registration act by any available measure and s the question is are there further in investigations that are going to bear fruit not only with regard to hunter but maybe might just touch jo and the delta was eager to basically get all of these claims off the table and there was this can bear open battle that was happening bet tween the do ja and hunter lions legally wore hunter bins legation would go on national television and then they would take things well by our understanding all charges are now off the table an the get jo big a there not really and he would say any now they they really are hell turns out that hunter bison's lawyers had reason to think because these tax charges which were publicly available those did not wave further charges but what did wat the diversionary agreement on the gun charge it said that anything related to the tax charges in clouding presumably farabiolations would be waved well the judge saw this and the judge immediately was a this seems corrupt and bad are hiding the deal and the degas we never made a deal what are you suggestion and they had to back off f it which is i the plea agreement is still in limbo between hunter bison end the do j and that is really really corrupt stuff all my will over the week en the do j also sent a letter two demon archers attorneys dozen archer is the former business partner of hunter bison who is now testifying to day behind closed or before congress talking about jobidon and how jobidont would get called into meetings and how the big guy was jobidon and all of this sort of stuff it really could be devastating stuff for hunter bison as well as jobidon because again jo proclaim that you knew nothing about hunter bison's businesses which is were when you are getting called by enter lion's business partners on the phone and he is putting you on the phone with them is line in other words when he is most to testify to that before congress to day hell literally two days before that happens a letter is send from daman willies you us a turn san quote the government respectfully request that if fun in be ordered to surrender at date and time to our ament by the sort to a facility designated by the bureau prisons to commence his term of imprisonment the government is conferred with council for the defend in about this request in ask the council proposed ate for the defend an surrender council respond with the following position mister archer believes it is premature to set up a report date in light ifs anticipated continuing appeal as well as the newly discovered sentencing error the government has now concluded council for mister archway put in response the government's request by wednesday the government disagrees of the council's position reportsdate should not be said to another words there's a dispute between the attorney for demon archer he is been convicted in other crimes and the do ja literally sent a letter over the week en saying we would to set a day for him to come in and turn himself in this was interpreted b interpreted by some including he your postmarande divine suggesting that they wanted decern archereturnself in to jail before he actuallywas able gives congressional testimony apparently that is not the case but the letter itself is still kind of weird i mean a letter that you send publicly man's now publicly available a letter these sends to the attorneys of the person who's about to testify before congress from the do run by the father of the person with whom you were business partner saying reaching herself in for jellied what is a story ready t you reader jail whet when wen ring an find out that is a little weird it raises tospecivicissues one publicly and again tries to label demon archer an entrust worth unreliable source because it reminds the entire public at the guy as play guilty to grimes and second it reminds devernarcher who is in charge namely the do and a your member jobidon archer's council again rejected the notion the is any connection between archer if wit the justice apartment is potential imminent jail time he said we are were of speculation the days week and request have archer report to prison is an agent by the bi naminstration to in intimidate him in dance of his meeting with the house over si committee to be clear mister archer is not agreed that speculation in any case mister archrall do hit h has planned to all along he will show up on money and honestly answer the questions puts him by the congressional eft what else you think he is going to say if he is actually being intimidated by jobidon's do he is in be out being ism being intimidated by jobiden's goa who has complete control over my sentencing origan a publicly ans hen say with he is expected to say thus achieving me purpose of the letter we will see what been richer has to say behind closed doors but that is definitely superweird meanwhile you have people who were very much involved in the trump impeachment representative can goodman saying the process on on the do this this all fully above board the hunter bison pleaded is fully above word n great we surprise to see the judge in delftware reject the predial not rejected would not acceptant well this is a fairly typical process that goes through this was an unusual agreement in part because it is a twenty four month agreement and there is the possibility that don't trump will be president and we know from his president e how much he caponize the department of just is to go after his enemies and to favor his associates and hunter abidance's lawyers are concerned that don't trump if he were to get the presidency would caponize the department of justice and there is tan added calculation to this but the fact of the matter is that this is a trump pointed you best the turned a trump pointed judge this is a very a in dependent and thorough investigation and i think that whatever happens in the hunter boning case we can rest is sure that it was done base solely on the facts an the evidence and that there is nothing else to it there is nothing to it it is all is all wonderful according to can dolman had of the impeachment management for out for tonal trump yes i i totally believe you can gunman in just one second ill get to the other side of the race first you need life interns to get just a simple reality of the world we are all

comslashferan check that off your to do lest policy genius tot come slash chipping o case naturally the the out come from the media when comes to hunter by is corruption an bourbons potential involvement in that corruption is that there is nothing to see here chucked over not eat on b sees as the republicans are going to go after job and hunter whether there is anything there or not o it is the first van lemme point out you gist the standard you did it is way politics works well may wish that it worked we are one side acted above board in the other side was scurrilous but here is the reality if the rules only apply to one side they are not rules and if you go after dona trump for four long years bull crap in investigations o actually who is a member of the russia uligarky and you have madam shift trotted out on places meet the press routinely is of how they have a smoking gun hidden behind clothes they cant shots you now the cant cup bet sooner or later they will emerge from behind the prices right curtain and they will explain to you exactly how donate trump was working hands in glove with lad reputing and turns out all lo be false wo guess what when the shoe is on the other foot things are going be kinin now here is the reality we current have more documented evidence that job bison was receiving benefit from hunter bison's foreign pays not donate trump was receiving foreign pays that evidence is much better for job then it is with regard to dona trump we silk y t to see what it what is the documents benefit the donate trump received from for example we rushing government where is it well we know full well hunter a i i keep come back to because it is perfectly obvious have you ever tested your tried your deal tried f eyelet us say they are forty fifty years old have you are tested your adult child that your paying grammar's bills when you are not actually paying grammar's bills hunter bison literally tested his daughter saying that he has been paying for everything in the family and for pop for years do you think to just made up even it even if hunter bid was high on crack at the time tofjust come up withthat again nowhere really a here is choked proclaiming what is it is just on fair they in go a from no matter what but here is the thing the the media will defend jo bide no matter what yah i mean that is going to be havisgose do you think it would be toot to president ram ta comfort say ay i had no business feelings by by sun issues of u sense you think he lies to say that wore directly this hit is a lot of people that believe something something elseou's be car about that point chuck there is been a five year investigation five years i a trump pointed you as attorney this in investigation started during the trump administration and they have come forward with not one true of evidence a tying president being any of this i am en courage that in sharp contrast to president trump you have just detailed his mountain of legal problems where president trump is fighting and pushing back and obstructing hunter bisons come forward taken responsibility paid his late taxes as you just discuss that chuck frozenburg i think the hiccup and the dolor district courthouse will get ironed out pretty quickly a i do not think president by needs to say anything more than he has how my o no on a means i rather there on to make fact his ationthere an a hes in all o trays to have the evidence or a here were they have the evidence to not i love the demacrateting a where they have the evens not for years of accusations that the twenty sixteen election was stolen bi up not behalf of trump with zero evidence four years bit they still maintain it by the way fairly a making suffocate meanwhile donate trump is course using this as the impetus for his campaigns this campaign he got a say dona trump is one of the luckiest also be ever to live in politics because when the dice are down they tend to break his way almost always and this is particularly true when it comes to the way this race shaping jobs right now it is shaping up o the republican side as rough friend him on jobidon's corruption and that has going to break very much in dona from savor because gan dona trump as he himself has proclaimed with the inerrant instinct that he has and and that this is the magical benefit of dona true truthfully dona trump is not a intellectual dona trump is not a person who thinks through policy positions down from is in a person with policy positions donate trump is a series of impulses but his instinct are in errant when it comes to targeting people when it comes to destroying political opposition the judge is a genius he really is an he is really good at this or i should rather take he has a genius for it because does not come from i think i cut points as much as it comes from just he as at got level understanding word with the knife he is been created this since s the twenty fifteen campaign which is why the nicknames that tony people dismissed as he o door or a waste of time including me they resinate obviously in he he he does have a capacity to speak to the seventh great side of people that is that is really in errands and it is also true when it comes to con hi capturing he political id when hent when it comes to a person who sums up the political id and is able to capture it in a way that no other politics up my lifetime can trump is that my trump understands the lament him in the republican party with with regard to jobidon is all about the corruptions now about his policy's not about what bad politician he is it is about his personal corruption and over the weaken trump really went hard at jobidon on this and in fact trump he loves campaign is an outciderates is favorite thing to do then dona trump l as the president of the united states he is an extraordinary level of loyalty inside the republican part and he still campaigning as an outsider because at elachim to be as free willing as he wants to be the minute your burden with the feeling of being an establishment figure do not the moment you actually have responsibility for your own party well then people can hold you accountable for failures ut thi'swhat stared to happen in twenty twenty too after trumping o rest to slate of candidate to all last in the senate there's just for brief moment in time republicans r wait does not he bear some responsibility for those losses maybe we should not dominate him and then he went right back to being the free feelings for a free radical actor an everyone all is not responsible for any of that he is only responsible for what he himself does not for anybody else he is is again when it comes the visage he does have genius with us don't trump over the weaken he aimed at trobidon but he simultaneously aims at all of his republican opponents again free fire is from dona trump always always always no discretion in the fired but to fire in every direction he says that not only should should jobidon be impeached which you the evidence may very well indicate that he should be i peach i said this last week but he also said that if people do not vote to impeach jobidon regardless he is on to then primary them which is a way of declaring his political virtue the republican members the bays who really really do not jobidon again i made thing this bad politics during a purple district in you vote for jobidons and peach me you may lose your sea e don trampling care about that again he bears no responsibility for the republican party he is not hat don't from does not care whether the republican party winds or lose because but whether he wins or loss the is been perfectly true since he was rung in twenty fifteen twenty sixteen when he refuse to indorse the idea that if he lost the primaries he would even vote for the other g on see here is dona trump in easy pensylvang over the weaken they play a different game the is people at corrupt the ell and the play at different game that play i much troufry game of hard all and the republicans have the play these to i an these three people actually four people that we have they have to play tough and they have to be an honestly and not willing an o we gat plastic good tough free publicans around that people are an a run a against i at people are gan a win an they an h get in in worse wen every single time at they gan a win cause we wen almost even rays on we in men put aside the fact that that is a hundreresent not true in the major top of the tick et sente rases where his record was a dismal but that does not matter betas again this is non a trump being able to run against any one and every one at the same time which is the benefit of being dona trump every other and that has to worry about attacking trump trump does not sorry about tacking anybody he gaffer whoever he wants ton from afford primary opponents inside the r publican party he will go after congressional primary opponents am m he an an again because he channels that political id for the republican party we all feel in the republican brio lot people feel the will do that to the democrats too which is true he will mean long is there on his alongside if they start to wheedle him if they tart the misochum a little bit than that may shift and that may move can then dona trump continue to aim at robin overtime welkin he said he is time out you crane and now he is making the suggestion he is trying tom again s the guy have said the word units here a few times but it is true there is a rung sentiment inside the republican party that the war in you ran is somehow in element of corruption now you can believe several things at once one the craning government is corrupt it is it has been for decades too the war in you crane against russia is in america interest in the sense that it degrades the russia military prevents them from invading further countries maintains the reliability of dato against foreign aggression sends a message to china that if they invade ti won there will be actual consequences for all of that and prevents ladmrepoodent from consolidating resources on behalf anti america lives right all those are real america interest but you can also hold that with the position that oby'sly all money that we spend over there wear to know where that money is going if to assume that some that money is going to bad places in all of the rest but true understands that there is a rising sentiment against the funding of the war in you crane and now he is going to blame that on jobidons corruption in you crane see linking tissues now for the republican base a heavy trunk of the r about an bates is you one as you crane which again for a probably plurality of republicans at this point or at least verging on a plurality the u crane war's on popular he is merging that position with the antijobidn position to create a sort of iron nexus that is very useful to him politically because he is the only one are speculating it here he was talking about how that the suggestion is that were in war in you crane specifically because join want pick up cash but the win to a to u can to theater teat cares hand over every scrap of evil my have on the bine crine families corrupt business fillings we have to know and the public deserves to know invitation come should smelly o to blow jo bins really call up a reserve for is visiting tat troop over to rope ti gat it is not the by thewy that we are sending troops to rope to fight in you crane that that is not actually true but again this is smart politics from donate trump now the problem is does dona from actually have any sort of plan to win the actual election to all this place inside the republican primary whereverybody hates jobidon every knows that job is corrupt and a lot people elect you crane war but in actual election between join an trump that is a risky strategy because the reality is that the cranewar is still a majority proposition in the united states the the realities tho gook n a stack up trump against hoiden will get to trumps florin just one second again have praise is in grant political anything because they really are quite good but by the same token a lot of the things that he is preparing for when it comes tote actual general election are not going to

the influence of won companies and or germs go to jersey's razorstock come order your green tea and citrus hands said i o cam meanwhile now again because the campaign pagans i jobidon is coming down to not his policy much as sort of personality corruption and all of the rest this really benefits trump because this the area wore true really excels in tearing people down for literally years he is seen ragging people down into the mud with him and the ideas once they are both in the mud then he is competitive and that by the way is what the poles are showing right now what pols a swings that he is very competitive with bid not because he is popular but because jobidin is unpopular with that said the thing that trump worth then need to do is run in actual consorted race with regard to expending resources to get the votes over the we get donate trump suggest step that all of his primary penis should drop outs people woad stop spending money on his primary pones to give the money to him and then he would spend it on things ballet harvesting any re complain that does it a on ma cat from should be immediately primary and get gay and then he came out and he suggested that he is plenty spend all this money that he raises from his primary parents getting out he is even spend all that on ballet harvesting now there is only one problems you would be can a foolish to believe he did not don twenty sixteen e did dung twenty twenty he had no ground game in twenty sixteen he really did not me this as well documented his campaign was run basically from thirty thousand feet and then he relied on killer cretin's under turn out to could when the election again my favorite stay from the went sixteen election is that in twenty sixteen donna from one fewer absolute votes in wisconsin than it money one in twenty twelve but dona trump one wisconsin admit romped lost wisconsin at the twenty sixteen election was just as much ti think more about lack of turn out for pillar as it was about additional turn out for donate trump in twenty twenty he did not have a ballot harvesting operation he actively told people mot vote early and the he did that again in twenty twenty one in the see a run off rase in gorge a both of them that that he ended up losing the republican ended up losing then handing con troll about the senate and the house two jobidon who proceeded spend six to seven trillion dollars do you think the donna trump is can spend tens or hundreds of millions of dollars on a ballet harvesting operation an operation i should get out devote i have doubts the reason give doubts is because we now have a story that dona trump has spend from his campaign superpacks or his campaigns superpacks of spent on his behalf tens of millings of dollars on legal fees now that is not what you are living money to he you are not act dona trump is a billionaire now i think that a lot of legal probe that trump is facing some member of his own making the classified documents nonsense down in florid that is of his own making he could just hand of those documents back to the national arrive none of the severally of happen but many of these legal troubles are not this own making that be the man hat in d a going after him for stormy angels nonsense it is of his own making in the sense that he shouldn't stop stormy angels tan aider to be quiet but his not of his making in the sense that it is a legally specious case but even assuming that there tuns of bills theatre being in cursed by trump on a personal level the are there frivolous and the should not have to be in cursed when you give money to trumps campaign do you think you paying his legal bills or do you think your pain for the ballet harvesting because his legal bills that did not help you win the election also he is a billionaire presume by he can pay his own legal bills and then he can use the money that you are giving him the small downer he is tun to smalledowners and he can use that to defeat mobile but that is not actually where the money is going according in the r times the political action committee former president trump is using to pay his legal bills fa's such staggering close this year e questoday re fun on he sixty million dollar contribution at made to another route supporting the republican front runner according to two people familiarity the matter the decision signals of sense a potential money crisis for trump who as far refuse to pay his own voluminous bills directly he is also avoided creating legal defense fun for him myself and people have become entangled in the various investigations related to is he could have created a legal defense fun and youcould have given money to legal defense fun to spend on his legalbils but no you knows your not can give money to his legal defense fun he knows thatyou are to you want get money to his campaign he will beat widen that is the reason why you care about donate trump presumably as you do not want jo bi to be president any more not thou care about how dona trump sandals paying his big ticket lawyers the refund was sought as the political action committee save america spent more than forty million dollars in legal fees in cured by trump and witness is in various legal case related to him this year alone according to another person familiar with the matter numbers will be part of the save america federal election commission filing expected o made public to day that forty million dollars was in addition to sixteen million dollars that save america spent in the previous two years on legacies since then of course trump has been invited twice in is expanded the size of his legatine his two to defendant in the case related to his retention of classified material work for him total legal spending fifty six million dollars when you do not not money to trumps you think that is going toward ballet harvesting i i have doubts i am not certain that that is the case and that is a problem because again you can trump in the primaries they is suggest that a old people do trump in the primaries the current state of the race if you look at the latest pulling it that is out today suggests that donate trump this date never time sienna college poll of likely r publican primary electoral fifty four percent for trump seventeen per cent to mantis seventeen per cent others thirteen per cent no answer the stasis the closest percent and he is not within thirty points of hem is the the primary base seems they are cruising told trump and not just that trumps base makes up more than a third of the likely republican elector we you have thirty seven per cent saying that they are the mama based will vote for trump to matter what and then you say they're thirty seven per cent or persuadable in twenty five percent where not open trump the magabaseis thirty seven according to the full the not open tor trumps are twenty five that means that the remaining thirty seven per cent would half to split in favor of one other candidate not in favor of ten other candidates in favor of one other candidate by essentially a margin of two to one in order to defeat trump in the primaries zero per cent zero per cent of the maggot category say that trump has committed any series federal crime only two per cents that he even did something long in is handling classified documents nothing is changing right there and again when you look at the remaining half morn than ere man o the the two thirds who say that they are persuadable are not open toe's trump well yew even even among those members of the re publican electric they dit is agree on the issues they are fractured it can be very difficult for anybody to consolidate this according to take come looking at the data over at the near times the mantis is supportright nowt is split between those wo are still open trump and those who are not over all the mantis hold just thirty two per cent to voters who are not considering trump right's that means that you have to som that all twenty five per can who say there not open trumpet's shifting to the cantus category right now they are split with cries crispy time got ninepence nickihalion vague roman way each attracting between five and ten percents of that vote once again it lot the field is very very split trump as an inventive in the primaries no question the prom is does that translate to an actual general electiondictory is anybody even thinking about his trump even thinking about that at this point what what is the case that trump is making for why he will do better in twenty twenty other than jobidons failures by the way that is exactly the same case the jobidons make by trump the by the case the tidings mane but trump is i can be as terrible as i want be i mess corrupts om onto i mess as foolish an and out of it is i want o be i mean there is a picture of jobidonit is floating around theinternet of him on the beach in rehublet beach delftware over the week in it is not flattering he is an ai year old man walking around in his swim trunks and no sure with the sunglass in a backwards baseball cab and it it looks just how you wouldimagine he is very very old he is very very doterdly he is not with us any more but he is entire cases i am not trump and meanwhile trumps entire cases ism not widen i mean that that is a that is a hell of id in mic going into a a presidential election which by the way is why many people of worry about no labels or are of k or colonel last or some these third party candidates now in the end we will it on a being a binary not almost certainly it will but he's there my guarantee he that goes for either side no guarantee at all now again is that the best way to run a campaign i i have serious doubts o came meanwhile there is a lot of in certainty out there about the economy and you sends the sort of groaning warmth in the press for the idea that we are going to escape recession because the inflation dato came in last week and it is coming in no kind of close to normal and were now back down toward the two are cent number that people are looking for from the federal reserve and i seems as though the economy is sort of define gravity at dis play because the g d p is still clocking in at two point four or two point six per cents which are good numbers right according toe waster journal recent god news on inflation as ignited debate over how much central banks interest rate increases are responsible the answer matters where in elation aunt interest rates are headed the federaserve in european central bank in the past week lifted their bench mark interest rates to twenty two your hives and left to open the door to additional increases if higher rates were not responsible for progress on inflation to day that suggest central banks could be able to lower them before painful recession sets in this is really the question is whether the reason in flavin came down is because of the increases in the interest rates or whether its supply chains basically healing themselves if it is because the supplycians are healing themselves theoretically if we starts going to recession then the central banks could the erotically lower those interest rates again without jacking ut the inflation if it is from the low interest rates in the first plats and that is what created the bubble then lowering the inflation rates that loin the interest rates right out would create another secondary bubble of inflation but there is a more significant problem on thehorizon and the more significant problem is economic stagnation last week there is a lot of talk about the g d p coming in and the g d p stay came in and every was very very excited about how it came in analysts had suggested it was can be a lot lower than in actually showed apparently the grow domestic erotic grew at a c o point four per cent annual rate last quarter while analisthave been expecting a reading of one point five per cent it's a lot of people were saying that while off landing might now be possible here is the problem it peas bad stab the reason g t p is bad stay is because it is about consumption it p measures the amount of consumption end user consumption in an economy you pay a price at the store to buy product thatches into g t p the government spend a carload money on things that goes into it p well the the problem with that is it does not actually answer for how business dynamics works it is a mansion model of how the economy works it is set it assumes that the more consumption there is the better the economy is doing assumes the if you bi bunch o hamburgers the economy is doing amazing ad if by fewer hamburgers it is because the economy is doing poorly it also imagines that if the government spends a railroad of money like unprecedented about of money that that means the economy's to regret because all that gets counted in the g t p the better statistic is something called gross output gross output has been statistic that is been in semi wide use since about twenty fourteen there is an econiston mark cousin roundabout it in twenty fourteen when the sure of economicanals is started using gross output as an alternative for g t p any explains it this way he says in many ways grow output is a supply side statistic a measure of the productionside of the economy it p measures the use economy that is the value of all final or finish goods and services used by consumers businesses and government the measure of an economy's gross output has been around since the nineteen thirties a pet a gross output essentially measures the amount of business investment it is the make economy the total sales from the production of raw materials through intermediate producers two final wholesale in retail trade instead of just looking at all of the product that is bought by you at the store it looks at the product that is brought all the way along the chain it is of your buying a chair it looks it who paid for the wood and then who paid for the planks of wood and then who paid for the screws and the planks of wood put them together and then who paid for the varnish makeweight it includes all of that sun's a broader measure of the output of an economy because includes actual business investment snooze says why pay attention to gross output for starters research i published in nineteen ninety shows does better do of measure in total economic activity it p istle useful measure of a country standard of living in economic growth but it is folks on final output omits intermediate production and as results cat's mum's bitch much mischief in our understanding of how the economy works in particular it is less wombs guided keentan notion that consumer and government spending drive the economy rather than saving business investment technology nouchripen worship if you look a it p data it p data always suggests that consumer spending is the number one elements withe's why you get statistics about consumer bovines or consumer confidence is lower the economy must be about to tank for people are spending less money ate the store that means the economy is about to tank and then the next bites measures the it p would be government expenditures and then business investment third hi butt in reality when you flip that and you look at gross output what you find is that suddenly it is only about forty per cent of the economy business outlays are substantially large r than consumer spending in the economy they make about fifty per cent of economic activity in other words government spending is not a giant giant chunk of gross output its a giant chunk of get p and government spending that goes to direct benefits that then is spent that is a huge part of get p but it's not as big a part of grow output and gross up put matters why because the reality is the way the econingorsons en the biggest argument in economics for at least a hundred fifty years is weather economies are driven by consumers by you buying a product or are they driven by people making the product it the the kinsman demand ciders basically suggest that because you spend money some one makes a product for you supply ciders say you generate new better innovative products and that makes people want to buy them the argument in favor of supplycide economics which is something i subscribed to because number one i think it is its truer and number two it pushes for a more liberal free market you the economy is that when people are allowed to keep their own money they produce new and better services what a consumer based economy cannot do is create new product it is the supply cider who creates new product the ontropinur who creates new product is also why you we a gap between how democrats talk about the economy and how republicans talk about the economy conservators very often when the talk about the economy they talk about the value of the ontropinor which is really you credit to josh chapiter the the veneer economist who really talks a lot about what he called creative destruction the ontropino comes along and yap breaks old product tat makes amazing new product it is always some ontropinorts in melon must or a henry ford or an homes id is that some new comes along makes a new productovillble to you that you never would have thought of but now you need it twenty years ago would you just as a consumer have thought up the to even if you had could you have made the phone the answer of courses know you see a product on the shelf and then you on aby who made that product t was not you you are buying it what is more in what is more interesting about that the the creation of the new producer rubs it get p tends to measurer economic strength by whose buying the phone as opposed to measuring economic strength by who in vested in the phone whose putting money into the phone whose creating the phone because the idea is that supply in essence we'll create demands for a new and better product at is henry forget ford suggested if i had listen to the consumer just the t come up with a better horse a faster horse that's bunsteatinghim of the car because he was the antropinor case here is why this important when you look at grow output ray now veiling a get peas awe the economy's going are guns grow output not much cording to grow output bacon thees economy is resisting recession but is flashing red business spending has drop nine per cent and real turns over the pasture quarters to day the federal government released first quarter grow output the top line an national in come county get measures spending at all stages of production real grow out put rob two point seven per cent compared to two point zero per cent in real get p consumer spending is still robust rising six per cent during the pasture quarters but business spending is floundering nominal business to business spending has ben flats in september in real terms it is down nine per cent recession is still in the near future s again iliac looking a grow out put i thing is a much better measure of where the economy is because how i spend is business person isn't a matter a lot to my employs is in a matter a lot to the consumers of this company and that that is true for everybody who has lots of employs and lots of consumers when you are being given happy talk aby ho the economy is going great because of g d p number one thing to check check the gross out pat number which has ben basically flat for the last couple to three quarters a can meanwhile why dis that matter matters because whole comes to general election ya jobitons personal corruptions can matter beguine's personality is going to matter but you not can matter even more if we are in recession jobidoneis in serious trouble if we are not in recession mobile probably sails to reelect very very difficult to lose a reelect when you are economy is good it looks the economies can be bat young be great some reliable to argue against that this is why a one the great frustrations is that many of the things that make rondosant is in excellent governor also make him a politician does not have the pozazor sizzle of down trump namely he just does the thing it j governor organs is great whin as governor of florid others befall the talk about woke and a the talk abut fighting education all that matters matters an awful lot but he is also really good t the read and butter florid is the number one in coming state for tax revenue according to the dairyman aliform in york have lost combine six hundred forty million dollars in tax revenue do do people moving out o state the be made it's consort of flora and texts see boots of twenty three billion after an influx o movers then the number one state for in coming money florid twelve point for billion dollars the net in come migration to the state florid that is because it is a well governed state is a good place to live it is a well governed state and that is a boring message but it is also one that tends to win general elections the message that is a lot more controversial is the character message especially whenyou have character flaws of your own an when on the middle of legal battles that will likely culminate in actual trials with you in the dock in may of twenty twenty four which is what is very my to happen right now rontissansis talks you actually want a politician to talk about the things but is that what people want in a primary that sort of without sure is rondissantes for temple over the weekend talking about the drags on the economy that is the kind of thing that for me is actually greats this is what i wish our politicians were talking about but they are not hereto i think the biggest drag on the economy is the admits state of state and the buracrasy and yes an i wont lower tact as all go as far as we can on that but when i talk to small business people i almost never hear about that i hereabout the growth of government and what governments doing to choke off their ability to just a run their business is the way they see fit and the autocratic state the ministry state bat gives an advantage to the big guises is the big guys can handle it they about lawyers the out nous an the comply those of a mall small business says mediumsize business is getting that off a in in addition to the energy that is going to be a huge huge thing the fed getting that rain an anas very important reducing federal spending very very important yes it is superposing and also lemme remind you it is super important is the start of stuff for if you are on the middle you've on that fence in the twenty twenty four election and it is somebody to dances for som biding and binds run the economy to the ground n have somebody else on the other sideband here the things it'll do to fix the economy that might actually matter an awful lot because it turns out number one issue for most america when it comes to presidential elections the state of the economy i a time for a quick thing i and than a couple of things that i hate things that i over the week end i was a reading a really fun novel by drew wear drew wear is the guy who wrote the martian the book is project had many and a it is it is a and wert he is delight just as it as an author it is belike because he is actually

concept promise right which is a man on mars trying to survive this on it is even a list bat more high concept because it is save all humanity by journeying to a foreign star and a and then hooking up with with alien life it is is it is really it is a it is a really enjoyable book again you can all his having fun writing it and such a lot of fun to read as well as give your looking for a summer be treed that that will teach you something about physics and about chemistry gadabout sins generally this is a really fun book and we are great fur if you have rang at your sixteen year old and in school interested in science the to be a really good book for the d ready a time for some quick things that i hate o a thing number one that i hate can we stop normalizing people what totally insane stop a normalizing insanity a you have to treat every with respect but ism not going to treat it with respect when a man spends fourteen thousand dollars to transform himself into a colly this

without further ado i will answer your questions and as always i will strive to be as thorough as possible as clear as possible and as concise as possible the first question is about i health in particular i health protocols for people that are age in but i health protocols for people in general the question is ism noticing that my vision both close and far is deteriorating what are the best i exercises i health behaviors supplements et camera for the aging eye the answer ism about to provide applies to everybody regardless of age which is you want to make sure that you view things both close up and far away across your day many many people nowadays spend a lot of time looking at their smartphone looking at the computer screen looking at books in paper in other words looking at things somewhere between nine inches away from their face and their eyes may be two and a half feet away from their face and eyes this is an unprecedented event in human history as far as we know because it was not until the advent of the smartphone that we have spent much time looking at screens at close range relative to looking at things at further distances from our face throughout the day in fact it should come as no surprise that the incidents of myopia of near sightedness is increasing dramatically around the world but is increasing particularly fast in children and in young adults and even an adults who are viewing things at very close range two and half feet or less now i am not saying that viewing things that do and a half feet or less is bad for your eyes that is simply not the case however if you want your vision to be maintained or even improve it is going to be very important for you to view things at a distance as well for i really several hours per day ow realize some people just simply will not accomplish this in fact it'd everyone at just take a moment and do a rough estimation in your head of how much time during your day time activities you are viewing things at say two and a half feet or three feet or less o smartphone computer screen paper books et camera verses viewing things that are four feet away eight feet away may be conversation across the table with another human being refer those a some of us are doing that more now that we seem to be emerging from this whole pandemic phase however many people are still mostly just viewing things within very close range and in fact if you were to ask yourself how much time do you spend looking at things at the distance of many hundreds of feet or taking a walk where you're not looking at any screen and you are simply letting visual images where the visual imagery rather pass by on your eyes i think for most of us that number is getting progressively smaller and smaller with each passing year this is an issue because the structure of the eye is such that the lens of the eye can move but also that the length of the eyeball from front to back is actually impacted by how close or how far you happen to view things during the course of your day especially during development there is a classic experiment that would to just briefly describe to you which has been performed in chickens it is been performed in mice it is also been performed on humans where a visual a cruder or a visual image include is just a in a black a s or screen or piece of cardboard or in a image may be some unblock and white checks or checkers are placed at a certain distance from the eye either up close or far away and the impact of that on the length of the eyeball and on the structure of the lens and on the quality in a city of vision is then measured and to make a long story short what these study show is that if during development you or an animal exclusively looks at things that are up close very close to the eye and does not ever get long range vision the eyeball lengthens and when that happens the lens which a courses in the front of the eyeball which focusses the light on to the back of the eyeball which is where the call curl retina is where the sells that sense light a that visual image lands in front of as oppose to directly on the light sensing portion of the eyeball we call the hurry retina it lands too close or near the lends as supposed on the back of the eyeball and that is par of the reason what we call the consequence of that near sighted myopia in farsightedness the opposite happens the visual images actually focussed behind the retina it does not land directly on their retina which is what you want its focus too far behind the retina and that is due to a shortening of the eyeball what i just described actually explains pretty well why kids who look at computer screens are books up close often need glasses yen n when i was growing up they call this nerd centrum raising my hand for those who the listening i read an awful lot a but i also spend time outside fortunately and running round on the sockerfield and looking things in the distance and playing in the neighborhood with my friends kids that spend the vast amount of their time looking at things up close and particular children who do that indoors for more of their waking time well those kids develop my open this is partner reason why we have such a am an increase of the incidents of myopia nowadays what is interesting and i think most people do not realize is that even as a young adult an adult and perhaps even as an older adult an elderly person looking at things up close too much at the expense of getting some time viewing things at a distance in particular outdoors can be very problematic because it can exacerbate myopia the short direct prescription here is to make sure that you are getting at least an hour or each day although ideally it would be more of long viewing and that can be done by walking outside and avoiding looking at yourphone while w talking does not require the you look at a particular object in the distance although if you are standing for and looking for objects in the distance the way that a you might on a highache or you precooking a out told or off a a vista you are looking for some one in the distance all of that sort of visual scanning behavior is going to be very good for your eye health and for maintaining vision at a distance if you are somebody who is far sighted and you have trouble seeing things up close well then you need ask yourself whether not your spending to much time looking at things off in the distance although i want to be very clear that near sightedness and farsightedness are not necessarily the consequence of this near far viewing there can be independent causes of near tiredness and farsideness but for many people out there who are spending progressively more and more time just looking at things up close you can get this lengthening of the eyeball or challenges in the way that the elasticity of the lends is controlled by the musculature in ways that make it hard to maintain sharp crispvision when you are looking at things at a distance are up close k i cannot because there are simply no studies to support the idea that you need exactly two hours per day of outside long vision of particular distance and or that you want a cut off or have a threshold of in four hours per day of looking at things up close but we cannot say with a hightdegree of confidence that if you want to maintain or enhance your vision at all distances that for every hour or that you spend looking at things say a distance of three feet away or less you want to get at least one hour per day total does not have to be all at once of looking at things out in the distance or looking at things beyond three feet a relative to the distance from your eye k i think for some people who are already badly my epic this is not going to remedy that myopia you're still going to need corrective lenses but if you're somebody similar to the person wo asked the question that they're not quit noticing their vision is deturiating really trying balance out the amount of viewing that you are doing at close distance and long distance and and i would not obsess about the total numbers it does not have to be three hours in three hours but the more time that you can spend at viewing things at variable distance throughout the day the better off you are going to be in maintaining and perhaps even enhancing your vision somewhat now there is an additional behavioral tool that we can glean from the recent scientific literature exploring myopia which points to the fact that children who get two hours the day or more of time outside in sunlight one of my favorite topics i know a many people are probably rolling their eyes right now a when they hear me say you really want you morning sunlight not through window or shield do not where sunglasses for that trinketmuch sunlight's you can in your eyes early in the day never stare at any light bright at painful lookout et camera done a lot of episodes on this we have a light for health episode this is an all the sleep episodes its just such a basic foundation of circadian rhythm in health that i just keep repeating it however there are also large scale clinical trials involving thousands of subjects they've shown that people children in particular who get two hours or more of outside time every day have a much lower instance of myopia now whit is really interesting about these studies is that while some of those kids are looking at things further off in the distance than they would if they were indoors on their tablets or screens or with their nose in a book it does not seem to be the case that they have to be looking at things in the distance in order to see this reduced incidents of myopia what is probably happening instead is that the particular wavelengths of light that emanate from the sun that potion energy in particular is triggering the activation of these called intrinsically sensitive melons and retinal gangling cells which we know our import for setting circadian rhythm for enhancing mood focus an alertness during the day and enhancing the quality in duration of sleep at night but those melons and intrinsically photosensitive ganglia ells are also involved in networks within the eye that relate to blood flow that relate to the a the ciliary body which is a structure within the eye that controls a the aperture and movement of some key components within the eye that also relate to the crispness of vision that is the acute vision at both short and long range there are lot of technical details there in fact i i really hope to get a the great busman elder or doctor busman elder who is the chair of opthemology at the universe washington in settle who is a world expert in this and the various aspects both molecular and structural of the ciliary body in the lens and is an expert in uveitis a very interesting topic in its own right to come on to the podcast and talk more about eye health and were will do that in the not too distant future meanwhile if the first behavior a protocol for enhancing an maintaining eye health is to make sure that you are spending at least some time balancing out the near vision in far vision during the day it also stands to reason that you want to get outside for at least two hours to day which i know sounds a lot in order to prevent my open if your young person and offset the progression of it maybe even reverse some topic we do not know yet based on the data but there are some indication that is possible by getting outside two hours to day and the cool thing is because many people including myself have a lot of work to do when we need to be on our phones quite a letter we choose to be on our phones quite a lot this effect of getting sunlight outdoors during the daytime for two hours or more does not seem to require that you stay it off your phone or tablet that your looking at things far in the distance the entire time what this means is if you can get outside on to a patio or a deck or an outdoor table if you can if weather in conditions permit and do some of your phone time and computer time and reading et camera outdoors now if you are already making an effort to get outside height place sports i take walks et camera that of course counts towards this two hour threshold and i know that sounds a lot this two hours and yet for most people certainly will vary depending on time of year but i think striving to get on average about two hours about door time as much as you can or opening or window which would not be as good as getting outside but opening a window and trying to get some natural light exposure to the at end trigger the activity these intrinsically photons of melons and rental gangling sells that is going to be a really good idea in trying to offset maybe even reverse some vision loss now the other behavioral protocols which you have shown to be useful in terms of maintaining or improving vision relate to the musculature around the eye and the control of the movement of the lens and actually the lens of the eye has its own count if flexibility its a really really interesting structure am it'll geek out on this far too long if a if i do notprevent myself from doing but the lens is just incredible the fact that it has a specific structure of prolines crystalline and things of that sort and that it can a still derived nourishment from blood flow but does not actually have musculature within it it is not if you notice them men that the lens of your eyes and filled with blood vessels in capillaries cause it needs light to pass through superinteresting structure am i think the only violation of what i just said is the vanity i an't those big or under water elephant creatures that am i think were are endangered down in florid they were getting chopped up by speed boats but i think now there some effort to preserve those this gentle giants the vanity as i recall has a vasculrarized lens which is why their eyes loocopaque it looks they have cataracts a in any case you are not a vanity you have no blood vessel supply to to the lens keeping that lens clear is vital nowadays that you can they can do lens replacement is really a a pretty incredible a progress in the in the realm of optimal g and surgical replacement of the lens or the cornea of their aspects of the eye but if you are somebody who is interest in maintaining your vision you are going to want to maintain the musculature that controls the movement an the change of shape in that lends and the movement of the eyes which allows you to transition your vision from very sharp when viewing things up close to very sharp when viewing things at a distance and this is where some of the called near far exercises can be very useful when we did a full length podcast on eye health and improving eyesight which i invite you to listen to if you talked about two different types of vision exercises that have been shown to be useful for improving vision at the level of a city that have a lot to do with improving the musculature and the movement to the eyes and the lens and that is what is call the smooth pursuit task you could go on to you to if you and put smooth pursuit i task and you this for a few minutes each day if you are trying to keep your vision strong and what that task involves is as the name suggests smoothly tracking a small dot or cross hatch or arrow on the screen which is very different than the called second type have movements that we often makes a cods are when you dart your eyes to a particular location to look at something that dart it to another location to look at something micros icons are little tiny versions of those that were doing most all of the time believe or not when you look at visual scene or image if you did not have those little micro icons your brain would adaptor would attenuate to whatever you were looking at and the visual image would factory disappear which really speaks how important it is that your perceptions change in order to maintain them this is very similar to wherein something is placed on your a hand say a finger you will notice that change but then if you leave it there for a short while you will forget that it is there because the cells there of adapted out there is no change to your nervous system is largely responding to change this also why when you walk into a room you often notice a novel smell as hope it is a good smell after a few minutes or you do not notice the smell any more because your factory system adapted that away a lot of that adaptation is prevented by those little micro seconds and the mackrosacots the bigger sounds are really for moving your eyes around to look for things in visual space smooth pursuit is a very particular kind of visual behavior that you can do in t he smooth pursuit task and ceorl cost costilelile bit of time i suppose to do this on you to and most any of them will do we can provide a link in the shown of captions of one that we or several that we by by doing that smooth pursuit task for a bit each day may be it a minute or two you are maintaining your ability through the musculature of the eye to do smooth pursuit and of course you do smooth pursuit when you move about your day but for people that are thing to offset or reverse vision lost doing some additional deliberate smooth pursuit exercises can be useful the other visual exercise that can be very useful as called near far exercise this is a best accomplished i think by you o holding out a a pen or pencil in front of u your eyes in front of your head and focussing very intensely through what is called a violence i movement wore we bring both eyes to the tip of the pen and then moving that pen closer and closer and closer to your eyes where you get close enough that you actually have to deliberately bring your eyes ism for those you listening this is what ism doing right now to the point where it is blurring you can no longer hold it in sharp crisp relief you cannot see it sharply that is then you move it out a love a distance and cannot play right around that threshold where it is hard to keep it in focus now and then move it back out again and then in doing that for even a minute or two you will find is a bit of a strain on your eyes but you can actually build up the musculature and the now muscular connections that allow you to do that more efficiently and that has been shown to improve certain aspects of vision specially when people are diligent about doing those exercises not surely every day let us a three days a week or think king be very fast actually find them kind of fun for reasons that escape me entirely a now how close you can bring that object and still maintain it in sharp focus well vary from person a person a based on a number of things first all how healthy and well performing their neural retina is whether not they have my open or hyperopia her snideness et camera whether or not u for instance a you are me and you have a fairly close interpupile every distance or whether not your more wall eyed an you have your eyes set further apart all those things will will dictate the exact performance of of that task but none the less it is a very useful task to do when trying to maintain or improve vision now of course there are a lot more behavioral tools that one could use to maintainer and fancy vision merely touching on the biggest and what i consider the most important ones that are most accessible to people without the need for any fancy equipment at all and if you want to learn more about other behavioral tools that one can use to maintainer and hands vision please see the episode that we did on eyesight run simply go to superman labor come put into the search function sit our vision we'll take your right to t in fact everything on that wevsidt is keycard index and will take you to the various episodes in time stamps that your interested in according to that a keycard now the person ask this question who by the way is page singer thank you page singer and the question got a lot about boats because apparently there is lot of interest in this understandably asked about nutrition and supplements for maintaining or improving vision i that could be a very lengthy conversation delicious summarisein with a few brief points that we know a stand based on the clinical and scientific research we have all heard that carrots are good for your eyes well it is not carrots per say that are good for your eyes it is item in a that is essential for the called phototransduction cascade the photogram suction cascade is the process by which the photeresceptors which are in the back of the retina at least if you are human there in the back of the retina take photons light energy and converted into electrical signals that then convey to the other sells and neurons within the return than passed into the brain to create visual percepts most people can get enough of this fact soluble vitamin we call vitamin eh by making sure that they e at least some dark green leafy vegetables and that they do that in there closest to raw form may be cooked a little bit but not overly cooked the other sources of did e mine out there you can look those up on line just for sources of it e mine most people will be able to get enough it e mine from their nutrition and will not require from a supplement provided that it is not present at excessively high levels in a foundational supplement or seem in mineral supplement getting in some additional did e mine from a foundational supplement or view in mineral supplement probably not can to be in issue unless you really taking far too much of that did e mine and could potently provide som insurance but again i think most people can get enough did e in from their diet if they're taking care to eat the foods that contain did o mine greenhead y vegetables being on the other food that is known to be highly enriched invite mine is liver one of my least favorite foods regardless of what animal that liver comes from liver is somewhat of a popular slash controversial organ meat in the nutrition space for reasons that are not interesting am forsake of this discussion anyway a i suppose for those we you that liver you could eat a la bit of liver every once in a while it is you rich in a number of things that are beneficial to health although for you vegans out there sure you will want to avoid liver entirely i avoid livericause i just simply do not the way it takes have maybe once or twice have tasted liver that was appetizing to me and it can be o k but its just not a release by my read it can be o k but it is not of food that i actively seek out order or prepare for myself on a regular basis am fortunately there are other sources of did mine as well and again i just invite you to all a put in to a web search yo food sources of vote e mine and figure how to get your daily dose of it mine by taking in foods that you for you and then in terms of supplementation of things that can enhance vision this is a newer area and frankly it is an area where most of the data point to some supplements that can potentially be beneficial in certain disease condition for instant in fairly progressed age related macula degeneration adrelemacular degeneration is fairly common or more common than we would we should say and it does appear that supplementing with certain things lupine which is present in eggs or evokes in particular especially evokes that are not overly cooked or that can be supplemented can potentially help with some instances of age related macula degeneration but the date on this are still emerging i consulted with our chair of opthemology at standard about routine and some of the other things they will see out there see aszanthine and astazanthines and these a saltines a come from certain fruits blueberries and their present and supplements and things of that sort the consensus i got talking to him and talking some other opthemologist are that if your really aiming to get a healthy diet you are avoiding cigarette smoking and by healthy diet mean getting sufficient amounts of idomanae and routine through food sources again you can look up where those o food sources are evokes just being one of them well then chances are your not going to need to supplement with routine or the seeasanthines are the astasanthines however i have heard anecdotal reports from a number of people that they will start taking a supplement for i health their number of them out there we are not as a podcast of chili with any of those i he supplements by the way and people are reporting enhance division an i perceive heals all the time that say you not taking this in lupine at twenty milligrams per day and there i should mention that the dosage that is been explored in a couple of studies is ten to twenty milligrams per day again you could get that from foods you could go above that if you are ore a cavalier or you could go toward the lower at end of that ten to twenty milligrams per day if you were somebody who tries to whose more conservative i should say well there are not people out there who are a looking at routine they think it is fairly safe and there taking higher dosages of libertines twenty thirty milligrams per day there also taking supplements a contains eazanthines and askeasanthines and are reporting anecdotally that their vision is enhanced i do not dispute those claims but as of now there are not many papers i could only find about four three really solid ones and then a fourth that point to the specific disease instances where supplementing with routine easanthine or asoanthin can be beneficial for slowing the progression of things advanced onset agerallymacler degeneration and the degree of offset for that macle de generation was slight it was not enormous but it was to robust off that it was it warranted reporting in the paper or things lepers which is a particular eye disease of packs a whole different set of systems in the eye easily what ism trying to say is when it comes to supplements to support i health make sure your getting enough item in e from your died if you are not consider supplementation or conceder changing your diet somewhat to make sure you can get that libertine invitees inch and if you are interested in it n it is within your budget i do not know of any evidence that supplementing with additional little eazanthine and asosanthine can be dangerous at also for those whether really interested in a maintaining your improving your vision that might be an area that you want to explore i personally am not taking routines zeasanthine or asoasanthine least not at this time i do take a foundational supplement a which is my source of sideman in addition to my a food sources but i do not suffer from vision lost a do where readers at night and i have for a long time i have a little bit of a a muscular weakness in one of my eyes ism that originate in childhood ism occasionally if i get very fatigue one of my eyes will deviate a little bit a little bit of am almost trbusimess i especial if have been awake for very long periods of time intends to recover once i good nights sleep some of you that of experiences were you have one eye that might just drift a little i could this for the camera if you want ecesis w eared i use to do this i to my sister across the table when we were at a friend's houses for diners i can actually move one of my eyes in this which actually just reflects that there is a a muscle dextrocular muscle a closer in my nose it is rather weak which allows me to do that i cannot do it well with the opposite eye i ma now any to blink to cat clear my vision but the point is that if your somebodywho has a slightly deviating eye slightly often if you go to the opthemol just or optometrist thy'regin to give you a prism lens which is going to redirect the image on to that slightly deflected eyeball one thing you will really want to discuss with that opthemologist or optometrist is whether not there re exercises that you could do to overcome that issue without the need for a prism because what i saw in what many other people see when they put on a prism lenses that indeed it can ism line up their vision when the visual perception better but indeed it can lead to progress of weakening of the muscle further and further than that eyeballs are o deviate further and further and that raises a larger question which is should we wear corrective lenses in fact if you go on line you will find or hear about these examples of people that stopped wearing their corrective lenses their glasses or contacts in order to bring their vision backer in prove their vision on their own now if your vision is quite impaired you are going to need corrective lenses or contacts however there are number of people out there who find that if there vision is somewhat impaired that forcing themselves to view things at a distance to do smith pursuit to do near far and to make sure that there getting adequate nutrition and things of that sort can all some to help offset some of the visual impairment that would occur if they were to just pop glasses on their face and i and rely on the corrective lenses in order to focus that the light on to the correct i area within the eye on to the curl retina am not telling people to throw off or or get rid of their corrective lenses and contacts but you can be overly reliant on these things a crutch in a way that perhaps you want to do a la bit of work to try and overcome and them m be work with a weaker prescription and certainly in the case of a prism lenses i what i mention before as it is a real consideration it is one ism very familiar with as a last but i think very important and exciting feature of visual improvement is red light i talked a low bit about this on the episode o the burin la pots all bout light and health there some really spectacular i think i considerate spectacular many other people considerate spectacular research out of university college onion and the work ism referring to is glen jeffreys work have no glen for a long time these are animal studies in now two human studies exploring how exposure to red light early in the day can offset some of the vision lost related to relay ejaculate degeneration or simply age related visual decline there is a whole mechanism here that is discussed in that episode but it had to do with the fact that red light and near in for red light together or maybe even separately when viewed for even just a minute to three minutes once or may be two or three times per week maximum can actually reduce the number o what are called reactive oxygen species and the photoreceptor that convert photons into electrical signals the rest of the visual system can understands that is a mouthful easily what they found was for people forty years or older if they viewed this red light the distance of a bout a foot and a half though i would not get two specific with us for a few minutes each week total they were able to offset some of the vision lost within a particular domain of vision and i do not have time to go into the details here but because i do that in the light for health episode but you have different types of photoreceptor cones and rods you have different types of cone photoreceptor that respond to different wave lands of light short medium and long ravelings light called blue green and red cones are sometimes called when these people who are forty years are older viewed red light on a consistent basis early in the day and it did have to be early in the day there was a real circadian effect there there was a offset of some of the vision lost that would normally occur in a particular wave length of light range that resulted in better visual city over all if you are very concerned about your vision or into red light therapies et camera here are a number of different red light devices out there at some future point the human labpodcasts may partner with one of these red light companies a sere nomnockin a mention any of them primula their prominent on line what your looking for is a red light unit that provides red light and may be far an near inform red souse me light as well something in the you six hundred and fifty to seven hundred and twenty is inanimate range really yon scan look red or almost invisible to you if it is really really far into the inform red and you will want to view that at a distance about a foot and a half to two feet and you do not want to be bright that it is painful to look out of kicks you do not want a damage your uses but that is essentially what they used in these studies from the jeoffrey label showed am some pretty impressive offset of some of the aspects of vision lost in these people forty and older that is an area that i you may want to explore as well especially for folks forty inner older and again this red light exposure had to be done early in the day hopefully that collection of behavioral tools near far smooth pursued some of the discussion about lupine nutrition vitmanae supplementation easanthenes asked a antheses on getting two hours of light exposure outside sunlight exposure get outside to do some of your work and perhaps even deliberate red light exposure for certain people can be used to offset your concerns and your actual potential vision lost maybe even improve your vision regardless of what age you are everything i described is supported from the pure of you literature and again if you want to get the deep dive on mechanism and further information about dosages please check out the episode on eyesight and improving your eyesight and the light for health episode again at superman lab dockcol thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the superman labpodcast standard channel and premium tools not released anywhere else please go to superman labdodcom slash premium just to remind you why we launch the superman labpodcast premium channel truly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard superman podcast channel which of course will still be continued to be released every money in full length we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard superman labpodcast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all changes superman labpodcast an other media channels the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that whose kinds of answers in the first place now in especially exciting feature of the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that they are going to amplify whatever fun come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the humeral la premium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the a m as you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get answers to all the questions that other people ask as well there will also be some premium content such as transcripts of the a m as and various transcripts and protocols of superman labpodcast episodes newfound elsewhere and again you will be supporting research for mental health physical health and performance you can s it up for the premium channel by going to superman labor calm slash premium again that superman labor calm slash premium and as always thank you for your interest in science

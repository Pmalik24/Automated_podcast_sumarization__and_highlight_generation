the first story is better recording the captures this exact thing to a spoke him is about that low hum of menace the recording was made secretly by one trying to catch a man had been harassing her as a witness the stories about sexual harassment or their sure sexual content to this won this have say that is interesting about this recording and the man's behavior in it is how understated it is it doesn't raise his voice et does not overt we threaten but he just gets his pointy cross all interesting the woman made the recording her name is christian sellers years later to day when she hears this recording she hears it very differently than she did at the time it raises a wholes of question she did not think about my spectthen recorded jessigo lesson hop me christen years ago putting together a story for the b b s here is vesica the recording just ten minutes long the man christen was trying to record was her home in specter this is back in twenty twelve at the time she did not have a self for she borrowed one from her friend can you just sort of lake explained how you made this recording in the first place n i had on on som around house clean up cloth mi a baggy clothing i had a phone and it at the phone and on i put it in my shirt put it in i think i was to pros strap for something sitting some time away i because of the phone under the shirt secured by a boss strap the recording is hard to hear hiding the phone there chitin's nervous she gives herself a task raking the yard as she waits for epic penned to pull up he is who she wants to record she is kind of afraid of him but she is fast on all the things any one making this kind of recording might be she wants to stay halm not look suspicious back natural and most accordingly she wants to get audio up epic tender harassing her she has undeniable proof epic renders red took pulls up and parks on the street the is a long driveway common like a wood aria an now how much o houses near me an that the and he was walking to but i still writing li you know down both and he was coming up towards me and out con o con o turn other way it's when he cant to got real close and he was m or y be careful you talk to ism not worried about me if there somebody you think you can trust than ism just letting you probably cannot trust him he best understand i needle the watch what i since to people and how talking son and i am whet i mu saying o people trying to put to face on of mi saying nothing o nobody but what are you talk to how far away is he from you when he is probably li can meters i know my producer robin she is about two feet away this recording is the fourth time christian had spoken to epic tender ever oo it if i y i l ism super nervous in nothing tat ism nervous at detain i was shaken and i could believe he did not we it was a tremble in me that i just was trying to hold on to a rite is hard as i couldst sold it he would not see to tremble in me you none on me were you making like contact with him i easy was down to the it down to the what i was if i was somebody as the i was rein in the same spot ho i would have ben lithic wat is she going but was six month sin pot as is scare to move was just nervous the house epic tender was coming to inspect was not christens yet it was a house she was hoping to move in to with her three kids the only thing she needed to move in was his signature on a form she needs this house just two weeks earlier christen was staying at her moms just home from a presented she served six months for approbation violation she was looking for a house for her and her kids if he needed a section eight voucher in larnburg small town in a really of north caroling one of the only places to go was a non profit called for county community serves as the problem was the only house they were willing to give her was a house no one else seemed to want christen was oke ism not picky they had a house and i said that house in particular was abandon and if i was to i clean that house out the i will go head and be able to move the house and when have to part to pas they actually called the landlord and they will pay the first my sedan i think this his if she clean a house it be hers but cleaning a house she would come to learn was a big project it was a three bedroom house with a dining room and den and all the rooms were filled with junk tit smelled awful there were roaches lots of poop the favors had tell me does it was many feelers an stuff in the house because they had left the do and in finally i guess the do o the date left an they'd got it o i do not know but by time i got the i just was there wit the left o yo not the house being full of clothing and a food in the cabinet sit was test as o is is harl she cleaned and cleaned she had a list of cause that she would been given from the no profit its to we maybe two weeks or three weeks may be more tan e i can he e really remember remember i just remember going a lot of times don it well i call down tan hi sent and set out i i thought i had everything done it was my duty to do epic tender showed up he was the housing inspector for for county he is a tall man older lightship black man with a taste for cowboy boots and belts backs tender was there to review christens work if she passed his inspection she would get approved to move in anyway he was you need have a om a man to help you we youon't have a for florin an ones an an i an i do not have one because ism just come on prison tine to get on my fee for my is ism dry explain t him and he was but you have if you had a man here a man could get ti stuff do and i we i did i what are you asking me to do this talk of men quickly turned explicit chrisom said he asked her about her sex life if she performed oral sex before not we we was totally throng and he was li cause you have have mean to take you out to dinners tho and i ha tell him ye i have he was li way you to having people take you out to dinner that is what e we paying you for it will pay you won says he said i say you in six hundred thous times twelve months her rent was six hundred dollars a month to be clear he was laying out her exact situation he proposed sex with him as a kind of home insurance policy the tender valued over a years worth of rent he was best way over six thousand scholars my signature is i si s the lot you be have i stakes was s beastly test he said e met it out just did he even acknowledged that you had clean the whole house e then he did not want to he wanted to let me know t ask the has stuff to do ism dot cause i no in here with this man and i li he got he can sign his paper and he can not sound is fire cut say whatever and my word against him is what at is time on mi yo know who what do i do ah i just do not know i just knew to try to keep a distance between him as much as i could it tender toward the house with christen following behind him he starts pointing to stuff that was not chitin's responsibility to clan out that was not on the list that the non profit gave her broken mirrors a broken toilet that is what have send me to told it need e axon and he cannot pull me bout a hip in a and bathroom and he pulled his self out in front of me what ye he pulled his self out and i look down and i good up in account of i i see to get out i fin away out i count o got out i the men he is blocking you he is bout room door and your in the bathroom and cannot get out and he exposes himself to you definitely he was yo know t do you knows tat if you want tissue you in what you got to do that is what he was sanding in that point she says the only thing she was sure of was that there was no way she was going to do what he wanted ever she managed to push past him gets him to leave he does not sign the form get was overwhelming i wrote dow i cause i felt when you in situations i was an om you feel colon you got loseffstin already and on dentin what his situation is is colon lie ye dis fell this way he looked too this is that out man lot to and i is is i say whatever o maracas he is who she is prison did not go to the police she thought it was her word against his and that because of her record she would not be believed she thought she needed to buster her claim in some way collect some evidence or something she called a private investigator wondering if they could survey him but they were too expensive the private investigator she talked to gave her this tip north caroling is e one party consent state meaning it was legal for christen to record him tried to get proof without his permission which yo be o o o her er she we es which brings us back to the recording christen made on that sundae in aril back in twenty twelve wanders coming back ostensibly to inspect the house he still has not sign the form she needs to move and remember christen is trying to record tender propositioning her but when he walks up he is not doing that he stirs talking about his job at the housing office how he is in charge of handling complaint e o a e w pot tit to be a he says any time i deal with e complaint he is talking you about a complete you know what he causing him he was sand at som it o told his bouse that i say it that he was making advance is in bothering me but she had not she d only told a few people in that private investigator about tender confused crisis tries to play it off his o pass we w thin i was we sited out si to to sit o just to e meat the sum of all this for chis ton she is realizing that telling her housing office about tender filing an actual complaint is out of the question instead a colon me a to him and tell him everything instead o to o me saying it did is dis happening you at that point you that nobody on your side ne the people as case to you o o yo a a these a i of we it is a weird recording because arc tender says things that son simultaneously a thread i an they could be the advice of some one who is protected and carrying pends had wat christian considered a supreme confidence where he could fewness words make insult sound flowery and innocent sike to me he was just trying to make me his fun and i was tana keep myself afloat in the conversation while i was felling i was drowning at the same time for example as she is reading pendersor's lecturing her about her kids yo as s kiss o i yer ta she but a her her a a a a nothing a e we i e we a o e a i i o you get i of to be o may it i was l call a a o best a war to by yo yes pot get on a pass i e e we its in his but you got to get hi as to i o ti was la wo mas lo into you be ma a ta o me to know ho the an to tell you can lied el how to li gree a we o to git i or o all christian can think is this is not which he was hoping to get recorded i did not think none o this was no for cause i ism you him woman sand yours you on have sax you and do this been very plant on what he wanting why he want and when ism do it and what i get for doing it when ism going to some is i i lo e to place i ism i this is not on work i that thus i felt at it but also all that advice about how she should raise her kids hes arrogant he are i belief an in his my he to say what he want to say to me no matter who lives n involve you believe me i know how to raise your children ow you believe me i know how to get you in this house and you believe me i can help you everything was talking down i making me feel i not enow or ism not a good enough mam or everything was to try to belittle belittle me and sod nothing and keeps talking but nod about home inspection he still does not explicitly proposition christen the first time that they mot he suggested thou he mentions for know apparent reason how women you stop loco lily do not know how they o i ye yet o a i ma y ow to o e e a e me a a me all be made of he of further he re mines christian how he came by her house in to asked her for son e is you lo tan a mes we i a us pul ta ma be o o me o obtain u we lies the be becks li we i the li e re o w w o a a o a i a a ta like o a or si o lose yours it what if i was a you knows an li would likely lie who would you use that against me you knot i say but he would do that anything that he felt could be a target to hit you in a way to make you feel i o to prove him ism not this then he would use it did you feel he was trying to make you angry ye i no yer i did i fell lie he was trying to make me give in to say no no li did o it'll do it approve to is own he hints at making deal with her to help her with her housing but does not spell out which she would have to do in that deal christian keeps recording he reminds her that he has a lot of authority and can help her i to had all iscolpeaaal to e to to e of la i o o this he ala e a forty a a of o of of e a a a of the o pistol we the e of that a of so l all at to what i know the previous conversations when he do ex for sakes and not i that is how he gets it it is ism helping you let me tell you what the got to do the good their that tone is what i was use to when he got that calm place on my he go you enough in a child to make me fell i hes help in me because if i have sex i have somewhere to say for haven says for ever and he is getting red o going to day i want you to do such i sic i did that point have really knew lit oka is come but it does not come tender instead brings up the most on topic how is i inspection related subject of his visit the barn there is this little barn typed shad in chitin's back yard it is filled with garbage and crisis had put snake repellent around the outside of it to keep snakes if there were any trapped inside tender says i get that barn cleaned out o i i a for a i he said that he as at e o e to a ta was his pain all this pndersards listening all the thing she could use the barn for hard gas an escape from the kids he suddenly singly folkgessed on the potential greatness run down barn soon e keeps the i tat a oi we o tax a a we we o yet is gone t barn he see had o woman barn and we been gone barn you cut have this he you n i was dislike the more he was describe the close he was trying to get to the barn y he was trinal fine a way to get me there and my do we ask i i guess him trying on do anything that wild probably the best place for tender keeps insisting she go in the born with him christian keeps sporting it she will not go she finally says if i see a snake in there i may pass out an die far a mater agersyo e had yo her a e a t e new e can may a in a pass a i out life if i would a would not have mar he definitely i it would have been ora for him in his mind at she sain oka and i i was not wonton answer it seems to work tender backs off slowly they e one lust back and forth he starts to walk away says all right then we straight i o w c i finally he says the most damning thing he said in the whole reporting i a we for the see well we almost straight he will take care of me later on crisis stopped recording she world immediately that which she recorded was not enough and if it was not that she was stock right where she started her house hanging in the lurch she felt desperate how is this going to be over when is going to be over him san i say i take care i it as just this want o beyond ti i do it an he say it is does what it is i have sex in this is not her this not open and in my mind i knew that he had o come spit every year every year him haven expect every year that means had to have some c ana sexual thing i him for him to approve it ever year it just just praying it that cording was enough proof that he is been don't young that just did not i had enough proof this recording kicked off a pretty remarkable series of events crisis used it defile a criminal charge against epic tender he was convicted of simple assault but appealed and got the case dropped she also played the recording for a young lawyer who did not even have an office yet porno for sure if what prison was describing was illegal but he listened to the tape believed her and took the case son's lawyer filed a civil suit and a local paper ran a story about it mornmore women started coming forward with stories about epic tender and renders boss john medley who was also asking for sex in exchange for vouchers the case grew from three women to eight and then to sixteen six of the women went along with the men sexual demands one of them lost her housing anyway the lawsuit ran on for years which h became its own form of punishment for prison because epic tender was still her home inspector he continued working for them at one point he tried to cancel prison voucher her lawyers blocked it the case was moved from state to federal court department of justice lawyers got involved prison got called all the names layer fell in opportunist once in a gentry store a women prison barely knew approachedtor she holy fell admadont telling me your piston is o you mess how we get at losers and that she was saying we y not just me has a much of on a understood when she said is to me it just con a hat me o how they were able to do it for som on haw he was why you now coffin because loo i have this worse for you there are any good numbers on how common sexual basement is in housing situations no one seems to be tracking it in jury one twenty fifteen three years after prison made the recording the federal lost suit ended for county settled with the department of justice pended wisely were band from working in section ate or renting or managing any property permanently neither admitted to any wrong doing both denied all the allegations against them i reach out to tender and wisely for this story wisely did not call me back i called sender's lawyer tried previous addresses called old numbers and is ex wife no one knew where he was four county did not respond either they have changed their name sens the women were awarded a two point seven million dollars settlement the largest sexual harassment and housing settlement in us history at the time ultimately the number of victims in the suit with eighty settee prison's recording was evidence of renders behavior but now years later when she listens to it she hears it very differently than she did at the time which she hears is herself who she is in that recording she hears how small she becomes around him and she thought about the recording a lot when i first called her in nonmember to see if she might be willing to take o me for this story almost immediately she said ism glad you brought this up she told me shed never talked through with anyone the way she is always wanted to i visited prison in the house she moved to right after the case settled a three bed room in greensburo where she lives with her two youngest kids i played the recording for her she had not heard it in years even listen to it o like i you could a my is she could a say at you could i is i beat myself up for someday yes because isle i could i around more a something and and i know it it did have a god outcome but i is fell if i would it told him more sometimes i wish i would just told him off i do beat myself up for some some little things the way she dealt with epic tender she says is something lots of women do with men particularly men who have power over them she laughs reflects pretends tells half truth demurs changes the subject wives her tongue smiles too much agrees too much hides her anger hides all her motions series her personality it is familiar i asked every woman i talk to in this law suit about it and then nearly every woman in my life about it as we talked christen and nice her to calling it the tactic the ad the common place one is some made who has control o somebody who i have to see on a regular bases in the affect in my lively be cause you li my dream as on t other side of that person you know sand my my livelihood is on the other side of this person if i id a terrain person down than they can stop me from reaching i you note san would you when do you think you learned it when do you think you whit is the first memory you have of of trying to use this as a strategy to get through a difficult situation i had in a certain than re member a home they would do things to he me but i i did not want in the hart me i knew i got to be in the same house war him for certain pier of time this family member abused christian both physically and sexually until she was about twelve years old was a kid she never told anybody been a o income families a low of people shelter these things because it would cause more pain to the family we a readystroan we already going through this we already going to day low would i put more on the family i me then you also have the get that this and is embarrassing oh and would have not a low to believe o ta to us things sos is is sangs better to sheets er she did not start using these tactics with epic tender and she did not stop using them after him in the year since the last suit christian said she found herself in a job were again some one in a higher position than her star to making sexually explicit comments to her she was afraid to offend him she used the tactic made up an excuse read erect him she told him ism not for you ism too crazy and you should steer clear of me not long after crisis says that i walked right up behind her and rapper breast crisis quit that day walked out never went back she told me i cannot file of fetters low suit every time something this happens to me i said christens thought about the recording with epic under and how she handled him in the recording a lot over the years i asked her after all this if he could go back to when you first met epic tender would you wish you love said oh ye now o get know on that ow yet just i wish i could a just loot to him o say mister fence ism not interesting you i do not want you and not have away form or frisson i do not want to have no dines which you for a vaster her now of ever more i do not want no i was with and i wish you ad just tot asking cause to me a fella he did not think i complete a sin is lady and if i will a said it to him li they maybe he would ben li a we o she she talk a lethe bit better than the thou ye now that would have been the best thing for me to be able to say it to him an away where as li i her not believe me a mom not beneath you i o where ad i here just the other day christian told me she has a new acting she used it with a guy at her work who kept trying to tell her these actual jokes christen was not having it in a room full of people with her boss watching she tried her new move and it worked he backed off she said to the guy guilty because i will report him testa colors and coming out i i ha chat about the dog with an epic agent

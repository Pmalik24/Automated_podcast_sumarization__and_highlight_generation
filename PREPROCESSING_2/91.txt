in tell you two stories the first story is from my days used lay when inspan undergrad students you are going back twenty years now the muslin student association in organization that it has routinely supported commas and hasbela ideologically and otherwise put out a student newspaper at the time called all to leave that student newspaper joked in the run up to nine eleven about renaming the newspaper all tarlatan and making soma ben laden editor in chief they also again in rhetoric supported mamas cause what that hadn't many bones about any of this when i sought to wright about this stuff scan undergrad for the usual ideally bruin which was the campus newspaper i was told such columns would not be run those were the only columns i ever wrote for the usual daily bruin and this back and two thousand two thousand one that the daily bruin ever refused outright to run story number to is about a debate togo to weren't give visited onion it happened be boxing day an nowingthing about boxing they but y turns out that everything in onion was basically closed everything except for madam toss wax museum why we had nothing better to do my wife and i went there and inside the wax museum there were the usual bathe of famous figures in the final room there was a wax of alberdinsten took some funny photos and then we turned around and what we saw was three young museums to women and a man there were also taking pictures with the instead wax there were strangling the instead wax well it occurred to me that perhaps that might have something to do with the fact that instead was pretty obviously jewfish but i brushed it off because ism a good westerner now maybe these guys just hated the general theory of relativity or something well at the time the museum also concluded with a wax of at off hitter now this was not a wax at my wife nit particularly wanted a photoed but it turns out that these young museums did this time they got reallybodybody with the wax they put their arms around hitter they post smilingly with hitter mufti culturalism is a failure it has always been a failure mufti culturalism the suggestion that all cultures are at root the same and quality and beauty and truth it is a lie that lie is dangerous that lie leads to moral blindness as we have ben discussing the last few days it leads to a atrocities murdered babies raped women kidnappings beheading it leads to death it leads to carnage but mufti culturalism does not just excuse evil abroad it brings it home mufti culturalism suggest that we in the west in the united states thou can france germany in the rest of the western world weave to open are borders after all if we do not were racist if you believe that all cultures are morally equivalent tat all cultures are equally meritorious the only reason then to deny some my entry is races and that make you a races there is a reason tat mufti cultural advocates ore open borders advocates it is because they're logic demands it what difference would it make to you if migrants are driving from the gossip trip or from ti on underneath all cultures are the same well that is ridiculous and we will know it is ridiculous we have all been afraid to saved for decades even in countries where the leadership has recognize the failures of mufti culturalism broadly speaking that same leadership has been totally unable to speak the truth about migration and when they do they are chastised by the media this is why the media has pretended a wait is proportionate criminal activity from middle eastern and african migrant to euros to recognize the truth would be awkward it might seem races because were not allowed to point out that is not about race it is about culture and not all cultures are the same we are seeing this shyness to day across the world and the effects of it as fundamentsless muscles rally in favor of comas a terrogroup there's slaughtered thirteen hundred news in western countries they are joined by useful idiots on the radical west who believe in a coalition of the dispossessed they can help turndown the institutions of the west hens all the talk recently by left wingers about mass murder of news as just decolonization question are these people we actually want in our country it is a serious question these are not people who are protesting for a palistinian state or even protesting israel policies these are people who are protesting in favor of a terrorist government that just committed the worst atrocities against just since the holiest and there are thousands of such protestors in the west because mufti culturalism is a failure we can pretend its not but it is and what we are watching right now breaking out from onion to new york from our compasses to the streets of parish is a break down in the social fabric of the west it is a break down brought about by a failure of confidence in our own values an unwillingness to declare the superiority of those values now were feeling that in my community directly to day that is because comas has now called for a global day of rage in the middle of a war that they initiated because they decided to slaughter civilians in their best instead of directing all of their resources toward helping rosin civilians which is what a normal government might do they have decide that does matter at all instead what they are doing is they are calling for a world wide day of good that is for today there referring to the day as the aloha flood according to brightbart the middle east media research institute memory which has been amazing work for years largely ignordyouve seen them on this show but a lot of other shows have not played their stuff all they do literally all they do all they long as they watch comose v and they watch palstinian are v and they watch all genera in arabia and then they translate that stuff in they put in on line memory reported comasasand quod we declare next fridge the fridge of the aloha flood as a day of general mobilization in our arab aniconic world and among the free people of the world it is a day to rally support offer ate and participate actively it is a day to expose the crimes of the occupation isolated and foil all hit aggressive schemes it is a day for sacrifice heroism dedication and to earn the honor of defending the first feeble of museums the third holiest mosque and the assertion of the trusted messenger we call upon the free people of the world to mobilize and solidarity with our palistonian people and in support of their just cause and legitimate rates to freedom dependents return and self determination they have called more specifically for protest they have suggested that palistinians rise up within idea and maria in the called wetback they have call on arab citizens israel to attack the state they have called on grabs in these surrounding countries to attack the work of israel and these protests that they are calling for across the globe they are not just protests they have called for action i part of a global day of good well this is resulted in law enforcement having to step up patrols on newish houses of worship and business es according to envy my news local an federal lawn foremen t agencies a cross the united states are stepping up their patrols of jewfish houses of worship jewfish on businesses is rally diplomatic buildings i can tell you the amount of worry in the jewfish community in the united states is extremely high hid people keeping their kits home from school to day because there worried about the global day of good and those worries are not empty we seen mass protest in a huge number of cities it your re i love in south lord them a bunch of protests lout of these protests have devolved into some level of chaos if any counter protesters show up the the attempt t go international with the sort of stuff is a new thing usually when they call for a day of rage its usually something that happened specifically the madeleast now they are tempting to broaden all this out how seriously is and why pity taking this apparently the unwisely cancelled all training officer all training for officers on thursday order the entire force to be in uniform and on patrol the officials at the police apartment said that they will have additional secured at large gatherings cultural sites and houses of worship all personnel haft report in lasantualists in uniform as well things are are getting very ugly in a lot of these major cities apparently none of the online threats are specific incredible at this point but out of an abundance of caution again their schools in new york that are actively shutting down there saying there no credible threats but i i do not know what what you would expect news to believe at this point about a credible threat considering it was the greatest slaughter of news since again the hollicoss a lot of news are are very very worried to day some jewfish schools i mention in new york have closed the worries are not empty the words are not empty ad the reason that that the words are not empty is because of what his happening here in the united states as well as abroad suggest tick of quick example apparently according to audio doctor and tented winds a nineteen year old woman attack to twenty four yearly mail is rely student with a stick outside of colombia universities main library amid division on compass regarding the israel commas war the police responded two report of the assault in morning sidelights outside butler library at sixteen piano wednesday the attack occurred when the victim confronted the woman after watching her tear down flies displaying the names and pictures of his rally didn't by harass last weekend the victim who has to be referred two anonymously for fair safety included say sufferedtom miner bruises but apparently what happened is that a group was hanging up posters of the people whore currently being held hostage and the suspect ripped the posters down and when they said why a you doing that the suspect than attack the people were putting the posters up ay might think that is an isolated incident you may they all the sort of tuff happen time campus all the time except for the fact that what we see in broadskellon and universities are the very center of it is a green red millions and by green red a lions here on talking bout compass green and am talking about far left red and that alliance has been on going for a very l on time on compasses is now bled over into our regular politics and into sort of daily life for an my orbits he went down to the east village of new york remember this is not the gossiscript is not h he least this is the east village of new york and he asked some thirty people whether compass was justified in murdering thirteen hundred ties in their beds and i hears out went the attack on this roll was justify i e i of e e es compass the moral highground i can a come a is tethinaaes insane

that is the east village of new york again the the green red axes rides and it is very active in the united states at alive in onion its active in france a fairway county schoolbremember named abroad mace an elected official in fairway counting his virgin actively opposed a moment of silence for the victims of the humans massacre just is just a couple of nights ago it might seem simple a aggressors attacking families in he state seeking sentience we often sympathizes with and human sizes the side that we relate to and the side that looks more us we that are big side swords what doing obscures the rout of the silence centuries of human his toys teach us that escalations happen when problems are ignored we cities are denied and forces are sensed when one narrative dominates from the world state all the ways were classmons we do or sudden no favors by calling for peace and been unwilling to tack what peace re quires as the old soli stage at got no justice you see no just as no peace according to in elected official in fairway virgin abroad make requires that judge babies be slaughter in the reds this is is what honestly is just at t you need context you need new ants or perhaps the have a lot of very very evil people who believe o very lot of evil things living here in the wast because the west is open itself up wide with mufti cultural nonsense your ma chain democrats just the other day refusing a vote on a moment of silents for is ray the victims why this is this is because a huge percentage of michigan democrat support comes from the michigan museum community thou be the same community in fry ample overborne those holding a mass rally in favor of commons over the pat course the past couple of days think recognize the represented city thank matter

seventy that one thirty not dawns i word the hostel purity as ride the michigan house dominated by democrats this point refusing a moment of silence for usually victims for jewfish victims of again the worst massacre in the pass eighty years against news in one second i won t get to what is happening on campus first obviously all of this it is creating an enormous amount of of uncertainty in the economic sphere in the uncertainty the economic sphere is going to dominate for the next couple of years if not longer than that one way for you to actually hederbats on that sort of stuff is to take a look at birch gold birchgold will help you at least diversify into assets precious metals in calberchgold to day preserve your sayings in attack shelter retirement account have bee a customer of birch gold group for years their the experts and precious tells a they make it incredibly easy to become a customer if you have an great or for one cape from a previous employed that shut gathering

have something physical to fall back on if the economic stagnation that we expect becomes a reality your no wants physical gold teen to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight claim your free in coquette on gold to day case america campuses are of course the sort of chief rallying point for not only radical muscle activity in the united states but also for generalize left wing activity in the united states farlesif the green red access the comose communist in the comassfar left acts is going to form an li an toyusly's going down carpet's precisely overseeing we have much footage pouring in of protestors at at various universities demonstrating the moral evil i it is possible go through all that bet will tart with the colombia i cure som protestors at colombia i in shouting from the over to the sea palestine will be free that slogan of course as a genicidlslogan men to destroy literally everyjew in the region and as wee seen from comes we know exactly the means that menu's the fullskalls laughter of news and those are america presumably who are shouting that in the middle of the colombia university campus now member es are compasses there deeply word about microgressions if you say that a boys boy in girl is girl then you may have mite progress to the point where you will be disciplined by the campus offices but if you shout from the river to the sea palestine will be free that directly the same week that thirteen hundred dues were murdered in their bad well then that is that just you not complex mural melons because mufti culturalism gang into different culture it istle different type of thinking and we have to explain we have weest understand that really things are very nuns and cycle of violence very very complex now you can feel people reverting back their priors i set a couple of days ago that people have revelations about politics in hot moments in moments of clarity and then the immediately reverts the prices to can feel it happening in real time and already the shock of fact of peoplewho are protesting in favor of the people who just murdered and burn babies already the shock affect that is wearing away because we are going already can feel it happening we are already going back to ore western priors which is everyone is reasonable ever have a conversation eve all cultures are basically equivalent everyone wants to be free and it is not true it is not true the people are shouting from the river to the a palestine will be free those people are not friends of the west those are enemies of the west those are people who hate the west just as much as they hate israel those are people are fully willing to give their full backing to a curious genocide anti jewfish group and then we all kind of rushedoff because we do not want t see we do not wan to see the blinders are right back on can feel it happening in real time yon feel it happening people want their priors to be true and those priors are comforting the prior that antisemitism optic vestige of the past will never have a holicostican does not matter we just saw holiness lo violence against thus an israel news killed for being news it does not matter where in a recontexturalize it and pretend away the reason that hat happen organ manufacture reasons why it happen ore going to say that the news are just as bad as the notes that they face that is a are going to say an can feel it happening in real time because it otherwise to look at the specter of thousands tongue thousands people across the united states rallying favor of a group that is as bad or worse than all did up might be somewhat disquieting and might call insequestion some of our priors about who we should let into the country or about which cultures are equivalent to other cultures and which cultures are abjectly manifestly inferior there is no such thing as an inferior race races well ism in it is not clear exactly where the boundaries are between races race is genetic aspect that that has to do with facial structure maybe has to do with point of order it has to with your since none of that is relevant when it comes to human interpersonal relations the only thing that really matters is culture culture of course is how you act it is the way that you think and all of that is environmentally imbibed that does not come from your race that distinction is crucial that distinction es really important saying that certain cultures are worse than other cultures is simply saying that some ways of thought and ways of acting are worse than other ways of thought and ways acting which is obviously true unless you are an idiot and you see a light mass protest people scrimping into soda into fid into fidameans uprising an this is a call for more pallistinians to murderous obviously i and this a pretty mass valley at my almamater again folks if you have a kid who is getting ready for college yes should think very seriously about whether you wish to send them it one these garbage and doctrnation centers and instead maybe you don't get them job here is at what it looked it you sell yesterday but the what you can see how many the hollering masks either bring cassocks es air fruit coded there is the roaring masks is because they do not wish to be identified why don't they wish to be i identified with their cause because they know t that caused people that is particularly true four the a for the members of radical muslin communities who are are not saying this stuck just for showed their lot of can a fellow traveller liberals ore trying to demonstrate their tonicities an the same with these top bunch a more on got in the street rallying with the perverse organization black lives matter in order to demonstrate their bonifieties their fellow liberal friend thing a lot of that at these campuses that would be the red part of the green red a lions her but the people are truly committed those title ones are covering their faces they'd a more of these protest on college camps is in just one second to ti got tell you my phone coverage it matters a lot to me these days have been spending literally every moment on the phone the phone covered that i trust pure talk as pure talk happens to be ray company they speak to they they have quart values that are a line with the values of the daily wire our veterans gave everything to protect the nation and puretock understands the sacrifices that they have made they sent ambitious golds wo eliminate ten million dollars in military's at by veterans day they cannot do it alone they need your help when you switch to pure folks lightning fast fives you network he'll do not it a portion of every new order to this noble caws you can make a real difference just by choosing superior self one service pure talks plans start to twentybucks month offering a limited talk tacked more day to and noble hotspot just go to puretolk dock comslash a pure make that switch today let us told together show are unwavering support for america veterans there's at puretolk took come slash afpuro switch to pure talk today again they open to have amazing coverage which is the reason i love pure talk ism not surely urban a week in my life i ben on phone as much of this week pure rocks been making it happen can or pure took took come slash a euros which to pure took today's the right move also again they are share your values it is the america way i a america college campuses they have not just been dominated by a by fools they're dominated by incredibly dangerous people these are not these are not people who share your values or america values the here is a protest at gorget mason university here is what they look in case again here what they a re a chancing who their chancing is they have got tans we have got hangliders rosy to the resistance fighter i tout your reference to temosmembers and cantina in on resisted on on handlers in tin e a music festival and more down nearly three hundred people that is them it gorge making university openly cheering that against pretend pretend as much as you want this is what these people believe this is what these people believe you do not believe they what one o the amazing things about the arrogance of the west is that they say it right out loud to your face and your now do not believe you do not bel it must be something else must be ulterior motives come missis one murder all the news and read is but what is they really want eat these people shouting that they there in fact glory to the resistance fighters who just mow down dance festival attendees and ever is it not but what are they really one is really bout the complexities of the medalist risen and chit lot chin stroking these days lot people thing at all mygostrel youknow this doesn't this conflict does have long history nelson we'd go through the history you are mi you to page have an entire forty five minute explanation of the history in we are put on an ups o this weekend that explains from them myths about all of this but that is lit t is about is that murdering news and they are in favor of it up or down on the murder news n yes and relic we soft believe you ism sorry you say you want a murder useful what i think you really want what youreally want is a better economic way of life they well if they wanted a better economic way of life may be they would have pursued that or put their focus there but i notice that's not where there putting any of their focus but by that have over noticed a the the dramatic lack of passing advocates rushing to the microphones to cinemas an you noticed that just a little bit it all now it is a making in the united states whenever there is any sort of terrific shooting that is committed by somebody who is even vaguely associate with the political clause everybody vaguely associate wit that political clause comes down condemns it of course because they want make clear they are dissociated from that evil have you seen any one coming out in being man that that camps grape they are truly evil and you we are not associated with them they are truly evil and the answer is no the answer is no because again the cause is not a territorial dispute bistro could not give way land enough absent it is own destruction that would please these people they could not and by the way that entails that men death of every join the area for all the talk about one what is really a partied lemme point out just a quick fact twenty percent of trail's population is arab you not i noticed zero per cent of gazes population is jewfish zero per cut of any of the passing an ruled areas in the wetback are jewfish zero presents of jordan is jewfish zero presents of egypt is jewfish zero per cent of apron effectively speaking is jewfish the tiny jewel population zero presents a ferias jewfish hero present of lebanon is jewfish zero presents as at y arabia is jewfish m weird weird that it just strange how that worked strange but do not worry it is it is its israel that is the problem and again they say it right to your face they say it right they are not hiding the ball is the part that is it that is just astonishing to me an will never cease to be astonishing they do it right in front of you they say it right to your face and everybody in the media got now no wed now now could not now the protest continued across the country arista ears on a tat university had a big protest yesterday again in favor of compass i gan we in size this protest have a question are these people who a who are marching in favor of compass that you would want working for your company serious question you get to choose yet to chose seems to me that supporting comose a pretty good barrier to entry for out for people you will earning a solid living at chairman can an bank or should be university of washington had a mass procomas protest as as well here is it what that looked we as is do anti joined together with i howstinian advocates of course in map house naming from advocates and remember all the talk about how commons separable from the movement a the moment is not trying to supper comas from it i notice just the thing i notice it have you heard a single call for compass turn over the hostages for many these people any call any ruler of course not the do not care there perfectly happy for guise hostages to be murdered in tunnels do not care think if i sh they do not the do not care whether are come o whether open civilians has there been any call for because you it israel set they turn out the water and power and israel said by thewy well turn it back on if you give us our hostages and everegos how could they turn off the water and power while i notice that the conditional statement if you turn the hostages over we will turn back on the water and power and it seems not and unreasonable man since you are holding babies and women and holocoss survivors that see by the way you are holding a dosing america i it seems not the most in but has one protestor said that come ass might want to turn the people over not not one has one protest or knowledge that of commons would would stop all of this if they if they would turn into lemur government which is what israel wanted them to do for twenty years after handing over the entire gosistript to them that none of this would have happen that civilian deaths are on the hands who of course not are there any demands on the governing body in the gossip which is commons to protect civilians no of course not because the goal is the destruction of israel and if they cannot do it by running into israel murdering every civilian then thy will attempt to do it by relieving the international legitimacy of israel by planting babies directly in front of military targets that is precisely what they are doing right now again these canvasses which are suppose s place is of safety and and openness and diversity when when it comes to jewfish students feeling soon just t a well threaten by people warn out to fending mass murder of news then of course there there is nothing to be done here lewis students a university of washington witnessing is prohomas rally and being told by the authority's wellyonow that is just t way that goes out listen freespeech is indeed free speech also freesbeech has never obtain at these compasses have in band from half these compasses for for trying to just speak about things economics the these are places were again if you use the wrong pronoun they will put you in t in the geology but if you say news should be murdered on mass and it is justified then if a new gets upset that is obviously that frees that is when that is one the freespeech bone kicks back in interesting interesting how they are standard kicks back in the minute the news are the victims ho h i gain it says it remember it say i it is a michrowhy would news living were after thirteen hundred of them were slaughtered and then all of their advocates come out on campus rallying for the slaughterers why would they be afraid in in the world of microgressions i i notice that there corn microgressions because do not seems to kept macro egressions rather they do not seem to care very much about at all now get back to this question of how much support the compass have in these called moghterate palistinian community are propalsinian commuting the answers ism still looking for the people what wildly attempting to dos dissociate from colossi is point where are they i really where are they of giving an example there is a passing numerical activist and human rights attorney names to aura ricotta who is on with kat our them i the media by thewy are desperately scorching for a palistinian advocate who will dissociate aromas and say the compass is utterly in justified a garbage organization and tear organization they cannot find anybody they cannot find anybody why cause it turns out that these folks do not think you they do not think you they do not think it is bad they do not think its inarguable bad to kill babies they do not i i do not want else to tell you they are saying it to your face ism not saying it they are saying it how mantises you they have to say before he believe it is i din meat characterizing what they are saying it is them saying it here is i a moderate palsinan america activist and human rights attorney the is what human rights attorneys do as they worry deeply about the legitimacy o i of compass they worry deeply about how much a comes was provoked to this i this nor apricot saying that israel is responsible for all of it or the image is that we have been seen for the passim days both inside of gas and the images of what happened to thesis citizens both have been got says difficult to watch it hit makes it feel there is that and intractability to this fight as they've been studying this what what can happen next i times are are nothing got what chain got penchant in i c is but they are also prevent able in it is an preventible nasichocities the condition that the largest crime e condition that sustains the violence is the prime of a petit in the li that i we that israel over see and that the united states has been the primary supporter of an military pivotal and diplomatic support ill get by the way nor ascot again a human right to tourney she is very much in favor of human right she says the commodity political moment here she's explaining it is a political oman kids is not terrogrup the murders civilians and names rockets at babies and murders children in their bad and races women there political movement do not you see these are the moderates these the moderates wherever the moderates got where are they i only where are you is rats en searching for the moderates for forty years is real does not want to govern two million palisinians in the gossistript they do not they wanted not to govern it strongly they handed it over to a long terrorist group is real wants strongly not to govern they is gene they hand it over to was or adapt in actual terrorist who actively shot news that is how much they do not want o govern it by the way not just israel have mention this before is real tried to turn over the gossistript to egypt you don't into a your say the i no we do not want them are you out of your mind they tried to turn over places guns who jordanian control the yours our you kitting me no way is it but don more commossel are git political group where the moderates where are they where are they she turns out that all your crap about the piece process it requires a piece partner but if there is no piece party you are can a wish castor way into a piece partner it are not on to work again these are the moderates the moderates say the commons is a political movement and a until govern ant comose can say whether or not they cannot or cannot stay is not the mission because the alternative what your sain is that we estimate mama and a have to remind was mas is a political movement comprise of palmitins who believe in a freedom struggle for it they are not marly the sensational images that you a the members the o mamas that you saw recently ray a just want to make clear people that these are not monsters to ride from underground just wanting to terrorizes is rallies these are young men who have only grow upon up under sates for the seventeen years who have been subjects to four large skill offensive that have on them in their home that have targeted metics and hospitals and water supplies that have refer whose they remember there not monsters the people who raped women and kin not babies and kill them they are not monster she says she says it by the way what press it the the contact free insanity of what she sang here they have been the victims have grounded what way pray tell what might have proceeded those ground in curious that israel had to fight who men what were the aerial bombardment that israel had to use in the gossip what may have proceeded that oh was it thousands of rockets falling on his daily cities might it have been that the gall of these people in the media by it because they do not want t believe it they cannot believe it the refuse to believe that it unwinds their entire world if there are people who have cultures that are inferior it under mines the entire ism sorry any culture that calls common freedom fighters and talks about the victimization of people murder babies in their cribs that is an inferior culture and if you cannot say that there is something wrong with you but there's something long it the media the thing that is wrong i the media is they hate their own culture much that they cannot even deal with the idea that there are superior and infer cultures and they've surrendered and when you surrender you lose by the way again not chest a problem for fraud media it is also problem internationally the number of mass protest that we are seeing all around the world in favorocoms should be truly terrifying to westerners who actually care about western values will get to that in a moment according to a recent report plan parent hod continues to rake an billions in tax par funding and

rest of this again is in the aftermath of attacks hunters that is of the says a a all of this is parting parcel of this group of people on i say thescrup billion cousin it supporters our playing a sucker's game with you and the sucker's game is that you are fool and you will never backup priers that is the sucker's game and you probably well the west probably well because the west does not have any sort of colonies abortion values at all none they are immediately shifting the focus to what is going on in gossip that is fine we should be focusing and what is going on in gossip tremendous human suffering in gossip every bit of it is comma's fault every single part of it its compass's fault it'll say it again for those two slow to understand it'll say real slow in small words israel abandoned the fossas strip in two thousand five it is now two thousand and twenty three compass has ruled the fossas strip since two thousand and six it is now two thousand and twenty three compass is in control of the bosses strip commas is holding hostages compass is in control of its own civilians those civilians live under the rule of the compass governments in the fossas strip those civilians are compasses responsibility it is a war crime to put your civilian in front of military targets it is a war crime to shield your rockets with children it is a war crime to hold hostages it is a war crime to put hostages in a war's own to prettied to prevent amie all of these are war crimes every ounce of blood that is build every building that is taken down every ugly photo u see from gas is on compass it is that simple there is no duality about this what have i been unclear please explain the flaw in this particular thinking ism waiting naturally the a the comas advocates they if they eve now decided that they have the green an international which is exciting i oleander o case crates one of a most brilliant expositors of international law being bartender and all ashes she says this is collected shes talking about the cut off of water and power r she the gossistrep is really energy minister cats he said no electrical which will returned on no water hydra will be open no field truckle enter until the we real thy object he is are returned home well again seems a conditional statement at this point else he could say what they are holding a bunch of america in abject care probably some of them at partisan raped if not all some of them in tortured many of them are probably dead already but is she calling for the return the hostages of course not of course not instead she saying that america has to draw line what the is relies what the is rallies the real war crime is israel fight and come ass yet she is a genius folks this is this is your rising start than democratic party slow clap for e genius sis who decided to make her the face your party armor responsibility is to the stability and the security of the region that means being able to suhorrc not support yet is real in its defensive compass right in it nap not to port is real not know conte in buddy want maybe leafentyo that the not have responsibility to sure a countability to human right to prevent the etniclansing o colistinion and to insure that horrors do not happen in the means o victims who do not want the treaty use to justify further violence and injustice she is going to speak on behalf of the dead news in car aka she on speak on behalf of the dead news in stherote she s going t speak on behalf of the grand parents who watch their grand children be murdered in cold blood she speak on their behalf i want i want every democrat who is defended this i i want them explaining what she went by that i want them explain i not herreplain what she meant what d show mean when she just said that in the name of that they don't want their vice they'd want their victim hood to be used to justify this you are speaking on behalf of the dead bodies in far betray that is way in we boots very that is that is for your speaking on behalf of let me explain something that is not how international law works geneva conventions article twenty nine the party to the conflict in whose hands protected persons may be is responsible for the treatment accorded to them by its agents irrespective of any individual responsibility which may be incurred when come to in other words for those who cannot read and do not speak legal what that means is that if you are the governing party and you have civilians and you put them in front of military targets that is your fault article twenty eight the presence of a protected person that be a civilian may not be used to render certain points or areas in mine from military operations which is precisely what left wing more on or claiming today that basically murder news play i hide behind children means immunity that what they're claiming today that is the formula i murder news plus hide behind a open civilian i am now immune that is what they are tempting to claim geneva convention three no prisoner of war may at any time be sent to or detain in areas where he may be exposed to the fire of the combats on nor may his presence be used to render certain points or areas immune from military operations that town familiar do not put constitutes and linifire which is exactluiththy be doing or how about this icy my statue utilizing the presence of a civilian are other protective person to render certain points areas or military forces immune from military operations constitutes a war crime an international armed conflicts about the nineteen seventy seven additional critical one article fifty one seven says quote the parties to the conflict shall not direct t movement of the civilian population a individual civilians in order to attempt to shield military objectives from attar or to shield military operations you may have noticed the that is precisely what commons is doing israel is currently telling people to leave and commences costly telling them to stay to use them as human shields according to the geneva conventions article fifty three any destruction by the occupying power of real or personal property belonging individual or collectively to private persons is prohibited except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations which is what is happening right now i mean i it is clear under an international law that a country has the ability to defend itself and t is also clearinder international loath humoral violator is the person who stations babies in front of its rockets but i can i cannot get over to we saying that i cannot i cannot get over her saying that done she speaks in the me the victims to leave commaselone the there are no words there are there are no words by the way her her garbage rout ethnic cleansing is a talking point that i justlact give bunk e let elect to clean the super fast this talking point the palcinian a the placing an population in nineteen forty eight which is the earthy establishment the state o israel in that region in the in the region of great israel today day and maria all of it one point they seven million here are the populations to day in these particular areas in the gazistrip two million in day and maria t the call us bank three million inside israel one point six million another words there are in this area one pointhree seven million palistinians living in nineteen forty eight to day there are almost seven million living in these areas that is a really bad job of ethnic clinging have notice however you noughtelse i notes the number of news who are living in arch they are tens of thousands of just living rock in nineteen forty eight many live there now zero how many news we are living in iron in nineteen forty eight hundreds of thousands anomaly to living there now zero how many news were living in jordan in egypt in any of these places before nineteen forty eight the answers a lot how manacling the you zero but whit happen historically speaking the state of israel the tiny seat of israel with barely a military took in all of them some eight hundred thousand news were kicked out of arab countries mole countries in nineteen forty seven nineteen forty eight and israel took in all of them meanwhile you not the grabs did with the these with these refuge populations they put them in ref leapt and they left them there for seventy years for seventy years and this is why take tapper yesterday whose pointing out i i notice that tot muslin countries are not doing anything t help grand civilians all that is a shock that is a shock except unless you have read a book here is take tapper yesterday what about the innocent a palistonians can they get out right the women the children the elderly how can they get out thatthat still has not been figured out now egypt does not want to open the of crossing they refusing t they thedoldt right egypt german i mean cutter theta salty ray be all these countries that prepare thtthat the talk about how much they care about the palistonians they could help right now they could help the palistonians escape they could help me they can say o they stop boy and we will go in there and we will we will we will help gaze that the come of thriving society they they could do all sorts of things they have money by the way have heard that ye ye but ere are then where they is where they usually are which is you know generally on the side lines an and pretty on my opiclay thinking about themselves plus they wat all lay close to go away of there not takin any again egypt you like that map again egypt right there on the them wit that sofa crossing right there unite egypt said no way noway he in fact not only that item sure some pictures of the egypt gotaborder this what the egypt gotabord lookalike you think a that that that terrible that tear separation wall the one that was breached by camps that is that is terrible ism going to show you now what the wall looks between gosh in egypt oh look it is a two layer giant wall that is amazing who could have foreseen such a thing look at that it is a giant two layer wall backed by military also along that there are am there are tunnels massive tunnels had been built and massive underground barriers that are twenty meters deep to stop those tunnels from entering into these sign i desert which is controlled by egypt the barrier is made of bomb proof superstrength steel which cannot be cut or melted a yah that that said that is a thing that that is ha thing that i notice as far as where the seen countries are the answers where they always are using the palistonians as a tool for their own revenge while simultaneously denying thementry to their countries again in nineteen forty eight seven hundred thousand palistinians were either leaving or expelled ism clear how many left preemptively because all fire police you broken down and forty haven forty eight and how many were kicked out but seven hundred thousand palistinians leave or are expelled zero are taken in by the a countries zero and it then happened it turns out the palistonias to ended up another areas there are subsequently kicked out by our countries in nineteen seventy down expelled twenty thousand palistinians and killed three thousand of them by the way in nineteen eighty two during the lebanon war the piano was completely expelled and ends up in tunes in nineteen ninety one is the this one that nobody remembers but it did happen during the gulf war and the beginning oft gulfwar there are four hundred thousand pallicinians were living in tote four hundred thousand during the course of the gulf war and after they number went to zero thy were kicked out they want to jordan nobody cares because how arab street other grabs to muslemstred other seems do not care about that don't hereabout that what we care about is tit if news are victimize my muslintarror then jaws have tobasedly let themselves be victimize and the only good new is a submissive new seems to be the the world's perspective on these particular issues all too often this of course is out why the world has decided immediately that the civilian casual teasing goal brought about entirely back camossit could be ended to marry by comes all of that i is on the news not tolly ben at the former prime minister of the state of israel he was on an sky news and the was confronted with this dumb argument and here is his answer and what about those potestinians in hospital who a or life supporting babies and incubator was et life supporting incubi to have be turned off because these ladies have cut the power togas are you seriously keep on asking me about calestinian civilians what is what is wrong with you have you not see what happened were sighting notes we do not target them no the world can come and bring them anything they want if it you want to bring them electricity i recon feet electricity or water ta my enemies if anyone else wants that is fine were not responsible this is the point a to the in you want to o men o i a o a in a not i for are yogin not not i o i other on load you ere this en is a lower rover e an myth and i am asking the questions your raising your racialize to ask and we have already people we already stop place let me finish won already to thing i t you to o i want to to you showing one you welcome to become were not shame on you is nothing a got an wit in con t conversation tat veryserious situation here and you are preciously used soul for immediately and again an again absolute em always in there i o in are responsible because i can tell you that when the you ka absolving forestay was fighting the notes through world word to no one ass what is going interest them that happens to be a fact no we a lot of i do not we a lot of the bankers on sky news shedding great tears over over all that is it happened along time ago but ill just point out at this one an for forget out world for i and if you look look a world or two in the amount of civilian death that was incurred by the allies in the defeat of not germany and an factious japan you are talking well in access of a million people who are kill the fire bombing of deaden killed tens of thousands people the firebombing of too killed hundreds of thousands of people in that that that why there were military target their military target and now we have the luxury of looking back and going all wall that was bad maybe should have done that may be shouldn't gone to harder when b oms were falling on onion that are not the mentality but put that aside that was this eighty years ago let us let us go more modern during the afghanistan war that the united states fought nafganistand at least fifty thousand civilians were killed at least fifty thousand fifty not one not to fifty and the was not an accistential threats to the united states a terrorism was a threats to the people of the united states compass is an existential threat to israel especially because if commas were to emerge from this in skated casually would come in from the north an everyone knows that if casually comes in by the wafture looking i nuclear war that is the real git is the international of this just one second because what we are attempting to avoid here by allowing israel and i say we is the united states when we are attempting to avoid here is a very small regional conflict developing into a goal war including nuclear weapons i'llexplain that in one second but just to get back to the civilian point the number of dead civilians in a ran due to the array invasion of the united states approxinally two hundred thousand that is not a country very far away that is not next store to the united states but put that aside how many dead civilians are there in tibia thanks to the lesbian bombing campaign undertaken by the about ad ministration at least one thousand three hundred how many dead civilians we are there in the iris war at least one thousand four hundred ay those are just wards involving the united states when you look t dead civilians in the middle east there only lest five hundred thousand in syria in the last few years alone no one seems to care we are why i wonder why where's all the human rights outpoint where is where is all the woe the had the human cry by the anchors at sky news where are they where are they they are gone they do not care i notice they only care about one time one time there is only one time they care and that is what the defend themselves when news defend themselves that is that is hen they get very up tight that when it is i and does not matter those news are taking more precautions to save civilians in gaze then the ruling power of gaze it does not matter it is the news fault the news have to go back to status quote they have do they've delict their wounds absorbed their loss in wait for the next time the news get slaughter in their beds because that is that is what chose ought to do that is what those ought to do an order to justify that eve to come up with them some sort of of moral self justification the way lot of people have done it is by a involving themselves in propagantistic efforts to deceive themselves as i said before everyone wants to go back to their priors and going back tour priors the moral equivalence prior the was always stupid it has been stupid for forty years the best way to do that is o just a my though it is happenings actually happening and best way to do that is to pretend they yer being lie to in take a quick example yesterday i treated out a photo and i shut an on the show it was a photo put out by the prime minister of israel yesterday by the first responders in car aka it was a picture of a baby burned to death twas hideous horrible picture i did not want shot but we have to know the nature of our enemies in the same way that we made a huge mistake as a country in the united states by not showing on loop what happened on on eleven when we barred that from our levis we blinded ourselves to what our enemies are and then were reminded of it every often when you know they take over a country have grandstand and murder tends of thousands of people and blow up a munch america soldiers then we are minded of it but we put ourselves to sleep people want aback to sleep to what a they do yesterday the community noted my treat and claimed that the photo was a i generated the photo is obviously not a i generated if clearly not a i generated and wanton a community notes anyway and people who are gullible and who wish to both sides this thing es that is always the easiest position in any given conflict it is very very easy to say both sides both sides the problem is that this particular case it is pretty obvious at aim both sides but if you want to both sides this thing what you have to say is the atrocities were not bad theatrocities do not really matter should we really be concerned about the atrocities and the community noted n obviously this is why again the propaganda to work commons is fighting them right now and there a lot of gullible dupes out there who ant a believe if you want to believe i can only attribute your your desperation to believe in moral equivalents to one of two things one lack of understanding stupidity or too e actually hate just y just one and and you are perfectly fine withe mingslauhter for virtually everyone ism no say one but there a lot of thus out there there lot of dudes out there many more than i would have thought that is for dam sure and meanwhile what is going on here with the united states stationing battle carriers in the in the mediterranean my i have been avouch isolationists who re why is the united states o en getting involved okay let me explain this once again for those ho are slow what the united states wishes to prevent its being involved in a worth wall you avoid being involved in war is by demonstrating that if somebody does get involved an ware you're going to destroy them you're going to send them forward in the case of the randan mullahs to the to the stone age that is how you get them to not to the war you don't invites war in themidliash weakness it the prevents war knowing that there will be a boy to depends on your roof in five minutes if you start the thing the real risk for israel in not finishing off commons right now is that this is taken as a sign of weakness as it certainly would be by cusbela cusbela is a far more dangerous terrors group than commons commossisa dangerous terrascrupt that is prove it by killing thirteen hundred news cusbela currently has over a hundred thousand highly sophisticated rockets aimed directly at the north of israel estimates suggest that were husblout to fire all of those rockets would not be talking about thirteen hundred dedjuws you'll be talking about somewhere between twenty and thirty thousand dead news day on if cabala gets in israel will have no choice but to unleash the air forts if they unleash the air force they are not going to be worried that what about civilian casualty's at all they are simply going to have to eviscerates the entire south of lebanon and topple the regime in lebanon that supports cabala if that happens they arson undoubtedly gets in and to syria if that happens and israel now face with a with a full war in the north combined with a war in the south base they will not if defeated commas that is the predicate if israel is force to the wall the possibility of nuclear exchange is extremely high that is why it is very important that the united states provide the material aid to israel and that they also dissuade husbellaw from getting in it is why provide has been warning cusbela not to get in that is what is happening right now the united states gain jobidon made a fool he is a fool for having retard to the to the cranial regime for long it is what led to this in many ways it turns out that once gain showing your neck to the agrarians ends with you being dad were your friends mostly thug the united tits gets you friends killed but it certainly got a lot of america killed in rock when we shut our neutron in any case the united states and cottar which is a which is an eonian cut out have now reached an agreement to prevent iron from accessing six million dollars recently on frozen as part of a prisoner swap now the real question here is why the united states not pain presser on cottar to turn over comas is leadership to an international court what why the united states has that con leverage over costar perhaps they should be encouraging cops to commons leadership to be arrested but they are not hey'renot doing that at the very least that is a tacit admission that what is going on in cottar the again the entireomos leadership they not care what happens in the gosestrip the work millions of dollars in the living in costar in posh five say sweets as the very typical of terror group in the great lie of these terragroups is that the leadership deeply cares about the cause very often leadership does not care about the cause they just getting rich and living in posh states nasal our fat by the time he was done was with hundreds of millions of dollars that he had stolen from his own people machmubasis a very rich man that is of compass again living it up poshstyle in cottar far away from the human privation that they have caused in the gosestrip to the bottoming here is that the interest the united states has no one wants o war this straw man that that every one is itching for a worth comic name name the person name the people a no line grahams has dumb words at sometimes but lie side from line y gram can you name people are years gotoworth is reallicent one worth on no one that's this bizarre isolationist notion this straw man that it is you verses all the war mongers no it really really is not it really is not that it really is is people understanding the mildest an understanding that if you do not throw people off the ball right now it is got get way worse really quickly he is gain on if on gets involved iron has sponsorship from both china and russia and things get really ugly really quickly ere well this week has been just devastating absolutely detaining on every level it is been devastating for westerners generally or should be if they had a a shred of of class or an ounce of dignity have they are many millions people wo do ism not not discounting any of those people obviously tithe outpouring of support from america for his rallies and for news generally has been amazing to watch have gotten calls from tons of of christian friends calls from from tons people who are a religious out people car seeking to help and god bless every one of you seriously god bless you and and god bless people who are who are willing to stands up for the lives of news it is rarer than you would think it is been obtusely an unbelievably difficult time i do not know a single person in my in my no inner circle jeer notion who has not been devil stated by this obviously in the jewfish community it is it is a singular it is a singular tragedy its reminder of our venerability it is reminder how many people simply want ted jaws and are fine with the news and cheered news it is reminder of all of those things but ism wanted to end the week on it with with ana on a a note of of heroism every time there is human people that that exposes its fangs there are many people who rushed toward the fire who lustra

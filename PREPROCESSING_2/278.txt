we be knowing lot of stories likely on the radio show about police and they have been pretty heavy we know this is not a story that in fact canna opposite when miles an baby's apartment was robed they knew this was not con to be a big case and v you abri down to it they did not have a problem with that new york city cops arrived after the burglary the your probe just come from som sort of situation where someone y cgonstaed in the neck new now the were in these cone r of yup's apartment in were running don this laundry list of things that had been stolen and no lis dis w it is embarrassing it is er and i pad an i pard an ex box they have get bet at rob yet they got vigor fish to fry leveling tody from the building showed that the culprits were three than ages ho took the elevated to the top for property jumped down on to a balcony and then walked into baby's an miles apartment through a sliding glass door then there is midi of them leaving the building three teen age guise with three of our back packs stuffed for while that using your back our own back that an't even have pa on having in a carry this gest not you did not see a very well called out paper this was more a let us breaking the building and one's done not to leave the like last door of if all the things they lost the only things they actually carried about was the video camera and they only care but back cause it had the wedding for you on it the only copycat him the wedding to show a brother but and yet my brother ism really close to can come to the wedding and really sentimental and i really wanted at back and i was really up tat was filler really sat about it wanting after the burglary now the police were not going to be much help on this one kat besides to jump in to action herself she goes on crags list to see if the thieves have put her camera for sail there and boom she finds it immediately same camera in the same bag with all the accessories that she had specially bought for the camera had to be hers and she calls a detectives on the case tells him the good news i can get my camera and i can probably put these guys on jail and he just immediately shoots me down and says there is no way of really knowing if that is your camera we cannot help you with anything the only way we would be able to help you as if you got the guide to give you a serial number off the camera and if you happened i still have the serial number from the camera and they mat and i think he was just thinking the know that will never happened kat however saves all her warrants e special folder she does have the serial number and to confirmed that it is the same as the advertised camera she calls the guy on crates list and she can cox this story that she is a girl who needs to buy the camera for project she puts on the supposedly tough sounding broken sent that i would describe as find of the brookonak and yo would hear performed by a redactor on the dinner channel i matter do this for me you do not one o hear it and that mi ha told him that my boy friend was going to kick my ass if i spent our last three hundred dollars buying a camera that broke the next day and do you have the warrant for the camera and he said no yous i got this camera from my friend there was no warrant with that now hell do is there are waiting find out if it is still under warrantee and he said well i think you can find out if the cameras under warranty if you go on line and i was oh well what do i need to do and he was well i think you been to have the serial number you did not act we just ask him for the serial number you wanted him to suggest the serial number we a cause i thought if i asked him for the serial number then he would now right away wat i was trying to do my house i was train to get him to say it she has him can you read me the serial number and he says he does not have the camera with them left to call her back and she figures o that is it thesis of he knows she is lying he would never call back as miles points out this story that she has made up e really makes no sense at all lie o case she is got a social path boy friend o old beat up his girl friend over the very nutty err of buying o idiot camera that was not under warrant was lucky wit the drunk and he founder cheating one i an you's he he is valid of to beat somebody up but only if ti bi a ado came that we do not have a warranty because l you are got for that ids som the you happened o in the camber breaks down we can get o money but we cant get we bay you always get at an the guy calls back get so the serial number of course it matches kat cause the detective to let him know he says oh really what shall we do an is you tell me what we should do you are the detective says of course would do a sting call the guy and arrange to buy the came from him settle location we will be there too will sweep in will nab him fifteen minutes later the place arrive to take data mots to the string kat runs downstairs to meet the detective on the street he tells me that there is been a change of plans he does not need my husband to come any more he only needs me ism not in a meat the burglar face to face any more because it is not safe and he is got a different plan of power can day this at the point miles arrives down stairs i turn around to him and i just say am change o plans they do not need us both any more they just need me it is not safe for you to go it'll call you and he is tan es that then on our may at all miles watchers er get into the car and drive off inside the car kat says the detectives tell her the new plan she is going to stay in the car and talk to the guy in the selfone keep him talking as the cop's go and grab him though they are very skeptical basically saying the chance of this working out is small this is never get a happen do not get your penny is in a bunch she in the gragsleskuy agree to meet a devious drug store cop's gone side then on the sulphone kayaked some of an would wearing she can recognize him she tells him okay ism in the make up isle ism all ism by the a cover girl make up he starts walking on the aisle i ass and he he says i still do not see you and that that point i hear hands up you are under a rest then the same detectives who are brushing me off the entire right out there then our walking over to the car that the video camera hand hie living each other and i hear them say that with some real police who are great detective for the police could not be more surprise to be making this arrest and to be fair as miles points out it is crazy that it work there is many different stages were the criminal should have bailed out the fact that she comes up the story bout i need the warrant he calls er back he makes the effort to caller back and said did not you need a serial number for the warranty it is it a cannot believe that he is playing along with it honestly you do not get the love of service from real stor the do see but that is the whole thing i said is that she is an amateur south but he is also an amateur criminal r and this is the moment where they meet up there be no way the detective would ever spending on the time that would take to concoct this ruse to go after this camera the only way that could ever be solved pul be if two amateurs got up but navy thesychcago is this america life om our glass to day on our program amateurs the fact that they are not professionals that they do not play by the book that they have you or time on their hands to try whatever makes it possible for them to a accomplish things to crows simply never will we have three stories nonclotting amateurs stepping into one of this powerful jobs in the world and when i most commonplace stay with aline theater of war a lies a big professional outfit that is great at one thing takes on a task at which it has no experience at all i really no special aptitude for an anyway it is a rank amateur exit as this example back when the first president bush was in office random who sang invaded coat and for the first time since venom really america returned to the battlefield derrick brown felt called and he wound up at fort bragnorth caroling one of the largest military basis in the world back then about forty thous and soldiers most famously the eighty second air born another ready units h t can be employed in eighteen hours fort brag is america waiting room for war when derrick first arrived he was trained as a para trooper you would wake up at five in the morning then you would deploy out to the field you do would jump from eight hundred feet i was an artillery man they throw the tanks out of the plans then they would throw us out of the plans you do these mock war exercises were people would trying to tack you and kill you and you would be out the cold and you would be digging were fox holes and just seeing how pow ground down you could possibly be that when the time comes for war your body in mind have been pushed as far as possible every once in a while there would be something else a volunteer duty i remember the captain of our unit he said he had the strange detail which was we had to mandatorily send one soldier from our battery to be a part of this musical and it would last several weeks i you would not have to do any field duty much you would have to sing and dance and everyone thought has joking and i raised my hand and he said great re port to the for prep theater to day re the only person who volunteered i was the only person who volunteered and they had me sit in this room and this director first had everyone edition and you asked me if i knew of any songs that i could sing in from any musicals and i said not at all i never sang or danced in my life except while running and singing cadences and body calls in the military and he so will tot sing me something and i remember singing even flow by pearl jam can you give me coupon his venseven throw thought o eve but i think i was as a person viand somehow they thought it was good enough and turns out that no one was turned away in rehearsals ceric quickly got a sense that something different was going on here this was not just your average musical review what what con a dancing any day ut it is march dancing i do not know if you have seen it but it is of the director's idea to combine the a honor and discipline of military movements with the bravado and pants of roadway movements but the thing ceric remembers most more than twenty years later was not the song in dance members it was the stuff in between they were short films projected on a screen above the performers and they were the opposite of light hearted entertainment grim testimonials about soldiers who died not in combat but drunk driving and another accidents near the base all done in a dark bluntness one rarely sees outside driver's end movies we go from show ton to a video on the screen of a fellow soldier that the interview talking about how one of their fellow soldiers their friend died and then ut o surprise we would sing shown and it was this progression of dance sad do sing a bit sad video and then some guides come telling out of the ceiling for the closing number at the end of the hour for the final chance to cheer ever one up as o they leave feeling inspired it was insane you would have discussions back strange which is what are we doing why are we doing this how did this how did this thing even come to be excellent question hooded one of the most straight lack no nonsense institutions in the entire country the u s army and that producing this piece of dodo musical theater i wanted answers i went straight up the chain of command yes a general caretaker you a hardly retired an i was a commander late secondary ordination your not want eight o she at went eighty eight general sterner was at fort brag and he confirmed that yes for a while in the seventies eighties and early nineties there was this annual show which the entire base was required to a tend here were three or four performances a day for a week or during the christian season which is when accidental death spike we realized that we were having more casualties from o o duty activities many motor shack that to thous a par you aha have yo cup ma drop wether we just reedit to do shouted about it stinger told me that some years for every death of a soldier during training exercises there were almost ten killed getting drunk and driving crazy wartime death we all know about and afterward p t s d but this was a whole other kind of statistic are combat deaths which come when tens of thousands of than ages anxiously awaiting war get pumped up jumping out of plans and firing heavy artillery how could see beer and say a motosacle possibly effect them originally the base had ordered mandatory safety lectures but the soldiers to sleep through them the united states defense department the greatest fighting force ever to march on the planet decided they would try shooting and that is the origin of what came to be called the soldier safety show i interviewed a dozen veterans from this era and they all remember the weird smashup of got wrenching testimonials and cheery i hi leg kids they all said you had to see it to believe it and i wanted to believe it when i called stinger he told me that he had a videotape of one of the shows you'd i had a is a of it tut age casa tag to she strip you could not even tail what it was a picture shoon so we struck out i will not bore you with the details but finding a videotape literally took months the public school library had a set of soldier safety shows but not long before i called they went full on digital and jumped all their old school audiovisual stuff a freedom of information request came up completely die finally i happened upon hundred blacken still working at brag who called back to state she had an old b s at home and in it a tape the label had nineteen eighty nine soldier safety show life is worth living is o la gave gay way early on we see a for guitar seated on stage plucking out a sad malady yo a it us be yo above him on a screen as a general it is actually general sterner himself entering a cemetery and he starts talking about accidental deaths on base but a soldier is cell i feel terrible i get a sharpening feeling a feeling of far we last twenty sax is were and is terrible charges a age general stinger occasionally rails down and at one point removes his bray and talks directly to a tombstone we tried with you tartar and we fare you perhaps we could have done a little better if your prayers had been both forth coming to us with your problem you were a great soldier and we all rubier have an you grave next were what do i have to do to stop these our rechesary and english ash the lights come up on a stage pack with thirty of forty men and women in fancy dress doing some japan smokes with lots of spirit fingers in jaws hands it is attribute to everyone who fought in wall or two and these absurd smashships just keep happening for the rest o the show just all the soldiers told me who came up with this idea who was the master mine of operation shlockand a his name was we yap and his journey to theatre was not one any one might predict he had he had no personal taste he at overdone me and he wore polyester suits i mean he did not care what he wore that is to thorp a local north caroling actress who was frequently cast in these shows you dined back in two thousand six i talk another actors too and they all reacted geese brown apparent trooper from the minutes the everyone laughs when i ask a no because it is as funny because i have not thought about him in years persist to think about it is some of the things that he said every word he used every enunciation he used every colorful description he used was filled with ten words that did not need to be there he did not say ism going to this tore an ism traversing down to you knows one of those things but he had no room at all for shyness one states he made it a point of saying that if you were going to fail please fail loudly es fail loudly and saying it as though your life depended on it it is odd because id never met anyone him prior to this point awaited this guy come from he was a his school football coach that is to thorp again is was an on tent new jersey and the director of the class place died suddenly and we inherited the glass play in and also happen that he had just broken his lag he really could not go out on the football we yodel that is how he got into the tear and he took his a personality football coach approach to life a into the theater this ten stove curry who long worked his yap stage manager and the within a very short period of time turned this little high school theatreprogramme into a a major competitive a organization that one the national headrail ward if for high schools across the nation and the and they went on a tour of a germany in japan with this production put together and it just lis he was bit and all is we could not get enough of it we each went up as the chief director of the buxconty playhouse outside treat new jersey which is one of the farm teams for lots of roadway shows yacht gave buck county his all spending lavishly even putting his own money into the shows we had just taken the second mortgage on his house and into jersey to uses in investment in a show called the smile smile smile the reviews came out was a smile smile smile it was supposed to be funny it was not it was not it was not period one the shortest theater previous in the history of musical theater curry told me that yap bankrupted the bucxcounty playhouse and himself his personal finances rest he could not get a phone in his own name but then fate stepped in when yacht bumped into an old army body had an airport who was looking for some one who could direct theater at fort brag that they went thrill to death with with this man who brought the actricality to the army the last place in the world that ye would think the one financial backer that that right that could afford him exactly the defense department it was exactly right stove curry the stage manager told me that with that money they built waterfalls and a sat for a roller scaring number another time they planted the entire stage in real grass for a park scene with cops on horseback and we had people repelling from rafters with people e parish rigging flying in o the stage cannons and machine guns and muskets and forces wearing up to the cannon fire thoron some machine guns fire and and the are all going off inside as a theatre oh yet we would also trigger explosions at wed set into the stage floor and a wind look up the flash pots i got a a got the guy from special forces that he would get me all these with the go squibs which these like iron excuses and we would create these great explosions you could never do it to ta far marshal to shut to down but we were the army ell what was impressive about it is how i realize that there was no end the yap he had a special in unique way of making the simple more complicated than you could ever imagine it let me just take a moment to say how rare this is i wrote a book about amateurs a few years ago those dreamers in their garages fiddling creating struggling what keeps most of them stuck in the garbage his lack of founders we each had hundreds of millions of founders the tax payers of the united states everybody i talk to especially the cast and crew that went many these shows the regulars all mention this one time one moment that stood out for them it was nineteen eighty two the been a terrible car accident this time involving one of the cassmembers kids here is actress bothorpe my son was early killed man he was coming home from his first loot ballgame he was fourteen years old and was other the big and i the young girl who is driving her father's car decided to see how fast hard daddy's car when come down scrap which is where we live he remembers her saying eighty and when she went to put on the brakes i the car went into skid and then hit a tree and he was in a body cast for six months she says every one in the show was heart broken of course including yap but yap being yap saw an opportunity is it t what we can do you think would you less go up to the hospital and it'll bring a him crew we will go up to the hospital and we will film life and then he can and and he can make testimony on the on the tape and i sidle i do not do not know that that is the right thing to do oh yo absolutely bailed the soldiers love it that the will tell tell understand it it'll mean a lot to them i i i i was really reluctant about and i thought cause i thought that is just not very tasteful a few weeks later there was bow on stage my fourteen year old sin was in a very serious car accident it happens that here's no waiting it just comestible that we went up to class hospital room when he was very sick and here a great to make this film ill you will pay attention then on the big screen thank claythorpe fourteen years old lying in a hospital bad flat on thus back in a full body cast an played jumps right en looking into the camera as best he cans reliving the accident calling out the miles per hour as if he were once again flying down that hill ten forty forty forty sit ta u o you sixty see since try s candy to hero ten slice no i we a can get o o a a get to to m the a o to m at o that to man toll be and then beneath the idea screen a young girl comes out on stage and and you think us had om how how effective was this with the soldiers amazing absolutely amazing because the a eighteen year old boys and when you are eighteen years old and you're o butch con a man you you your life is is going to go on forever and you are you are you are especial you are going to last for ever and you can do whatever you want to do and and if you die wood and we had a way of under standing that he would do everything he could to prove to them or to show them the value of life and how short it is and how quickly it goes down at this lave it is the lecture i gave my teen age daughter a few nights ago when i handed to the career drive carefully buckle up please do not be an idiot every parent dress to come it with some way to say this to their kid the yap had to crack that coat for forty thousand of them and what at work after the soldier safety show started the average number of deaths at the base drop by a third at the end of every show one of the opsactors ala s came out on the stage to give the final safety lecture we make your help and we at that each and every one up you joy with bus to make this pledge two always always were you sages the speaker asked every one who believes in safe to stand and take the pledge these are soldiers and they follow orders we naturally up jumps every one in the audience and then the cast floods the stage for the final number and ops last brilliant contribution to musical theatre a guaranteed standing ovation at the end of every show as the other several books including the one that he mention in this story is called punch of amateurs awaken came out on paper back coming up babies having babies robot babies specifically as in a minute much cocabubl radio went our programmed continues timer from my from mire a glass seat we can vagrom of course whichuse a theme bring you different kinds of stories on that theme today show amateur hour stories of how amateurs can accomplish things that the prose cannot that is when they are not crashing and burning completely we arrived at at two of our programmed act two what to expect when you expecting a robot this is thing in allot kids have to do in health class maybe you did this when you were in high school the ideas to give students a taste of what it is to be responsible for an infant and and gonna foot a pain in the acid is actually and they do the spite making the kids carry out an edge or sometimes its a sick of flour for couple days supposedly this jot of reality helps prevent teen pregnancies which nuns ought to ass of an ago to these days some schools using the robotic babies these are plastic dolls with electronics inside which make them cry randomly all day and night their sleeping eating and pooping patterns are based wogs kept by real parents about real babies the babies cost over six hundred bucks age holy frank went out to find out if amateur parenthood is more intense and realistic with these high neck cry babies the first time i saw a robotic bad was at my local pharmacy is one of those old time places with a candy counter and surgical supplies and a large selection of scented candles one day i was in the store and i heard the tea name girl behind me say my god this baby is heavy she had a car seat slung over her shoulder a purse for a second i thought the plastic baby inside it was real the real ones are heavier i told her she groaned and with the car seat over to her other shoulder at the time i had a three year old and i was dying to know if this girls experience with the plastic baby was anything remotely my experience with my flesh and blood baby the girl told me she went to glenrach high glenrich's the town next to mind in new jerry i called the school and asked if they let me hang out the next time the girls got the babies undo and en a out of the harsh ell i miss hogan the health teacher is setting up two girls with their babies the robot babies are expensive that the school only has

identifies her as the mother next she would have to figure out why the baby is crying it could need one of four things burping rocking diapering or feeding to feed it you hold a fake bottle by the baby's lips and if she is hungry she goes this when she is full she goes this you have only two minutes to get it right if you do not you lose points if she do not support the baby's neck more points

she forgot to thank a boy who held the door for her plus she admits to me that she is cheated a second time she forgot to bring her costume for dress for herself she slipped the bracelet off again and left the baby with a friend while she ran home next morning comes the moment of truth the girls hands in their babies and get their grades wether robot baby keeps a minute by minute record of how you

have never put money on rather doing better than page specially not this much better for all her baby clothes and maternal instinct not to mention wanting to be a young mam page turns out to be a below average mother at least when it comes to plastic children has this changed the way you feel about i becoming a mother and about babies i i not look i could have a baby f twenty one ill go to man's try schoolmate a man of got a man a my arms not get mere have a baby i but i think maybe make i think i i maybe a little do not thin i tot li i am i cannot even imagine but i a baby a life in to my world an i i think it be horrible page is not sure how old she wants to be when she starts a family now she just knows she cannot even picture it her whole life plan has been thrown out of wack by her robot baby mi response to the baby was almost the opposite of pages and that if i have a baby really young i feel i would keep the baby i also never would a guest that page and rather would flick their positions cause i cannot the feeling of having a bit for some reason i guess the idea that some one or something needs you and only you can't makes you feel important it was all over the same time i was i canna liked it id never really thought that i would want to have a kid younger but many i would rather called it early on set baby fever in said her mam was freaked out by it i asked one of race's teachers and the president of the company that makes the babies about this ironic and unintended outcome that the robot baby made a teenage girl want to have her real one they both said this was rare they shrugged it off the teacher that she was sure race's the kind of girl who will make a thoughtful decision about when to have her own child over all the girls had a way more authentic mothering experience what the robot babies than it'd expected but the moments when rather and page could not be available to the babies when rather gave blood when page fell the girls lost points in those moments when you are real parent those things happen all the time dig nosing whether your kid needs to be fed or died or rocked that is not what makes you a pro at parenting it is coping with the stress of getting it wrong a feeling an amateur which is on to happen no matter how much practice you have had o i fang shes those of the parenting podcast the longest shortest time which had to say is great because unlike must parented notes not actually designs basically fore parent wast nerves for anybody this distributed by your wolf ere commando in belief now a the stay of an amateur who for one night it is thrown into a very very big job one of the biggest jobs the busy we get thrown in as the substitute teacher for a class they have never taught or never taken specifically the see to for the president have the united states stephany fly explains if somebody needs to sub for the president the chain is clear if the vice president cannot do it it goes to the speaker of the house then the president pro tempera of the senate the the secretary state secretary of the treasury secretary of defense all the way down the cabinet to energy education batter an affairs it is been this way since the presidential succession act of nineteen forty seven but what happens if all of those people are in one room twister speaker the survive posies mat was a cores my fellowman the state of the union address what if someone below up the building and kills every one on that list all at once well then the presidency goes to the designated survivor that is a person chosen every year before the state of the union speech to survive that is their whole job to survive run the united states government as an amateur president tala beginner he's first day in the job may include reading vengeance upon slash surrendering to whoever killed all our top leaders each year the designated survivor is assigned a security detail and moved to a safe secret location away from the capital this all began no surprise during the cold war homes reed was an assistant to president rain for national security policy and it was his job to figure out what to do if a nuclear weapon d c he is the one who came up with the idea of the designated survivor washinton was targeted with over three hundred phobia newly weapons they had a hundreds lad that wuullay down on every possible step root and to think you could escape that brave was nonsense well i i was nakfa sin that a irrember thank i not be s no can i happen what som dos cape that is bill richardson former secretary of energy designated survivor for the two thousand state of the union richardson was not sent into a bunker somewhere he was in a small town in mainland having dinner at his friend's house which was surrounded by a security detail and emergency vehicles inside they ad stake we d a i sh me all but can we that to of the donation in i was to an a our gar i had a arc of wine at er wat om all over i take to a couple of designated survivors from the cold war are who said they were put on plains and flown to undisclosed the locations one of them got training where he got to play war games and the secret doctor strange least setting and they asked him questions coquet do you swear in immediately after the president's death do you launch missile at the soviets do you hold your visor he said the training was helpful enlightening that he thought nobody should become a designated survivor without undergoing at first but by the end of the cold war post gorbechav pin on eleven things got a little more lax can you say it vet any kind of training sort about what i you be paper now that is can linkman secretary of agriculture designated survivor during the nineteen ninety seven state of the union i think i did not get with my i cat i can handle it a something terribly happen it well good a donna cholera who was secretary of health in human services designated survivor nineteen eighty six did not get any special training either and the did even leave the neighborhood she was just two and half miles away from the capital of the white house li et my finer a at the tell about tell at the i have an we had pe in wat e hated the younger and i cad a wondered into the follow lot and tried out en day what did it feel big yo take for ma that pent ten the very large man one designated survivor told me that actually attending the stated union is a pain you have to look attentive and interested and improving for really long time in case the cameras pan to yield being designated survivor much hes er tongue who asked i not use his name when on a vacation to the carabin when he got the gag not a government expense he was quick to tell me he happened have plans to go anyway another designated survivor took the opportunity to move to a new house the caravan of secret service guarded him as he loaded up his moving ban one thing you might have noticed from the designated survivors i spoke to none of them had jobs that had anything to do with national security usually it is the non marquis cabinet members secretary of t interior energy commerce agriculture people whose names you probably do not know ever heard of anchovy fox he is our secretary of transportation and this years designated survivor and when i heard about that i kind of thought well seriously the decision to launch nuclear retaliation kill millions of people could possibly rest in the hands of the secretary of transportation homes read the guy who design this program says why not the secretary of transportation is as good a person as any the question in politic shall i things life is compared do the question is not is and alsorised to qualified to be president or governor or successor the question is compared to who a compared to just ass colon of course compared way is now probably not and that the cabinet they are all brilliant people and certainly have the wherewithal to at least to make the initial decisions steepen either not all brilliant people any more than you ere i are in the all have problems in some smoke to much somewhere over weight and for and on they're all human beings and read said the president's been chosen by the america people and the president chooses the designated survivor therefore by proxy that person is chosen by the america people sometimes the choose well sometimes they do not that is what politics is all to that is a very ominous statement ahahahahaayes yes it is here is danglichman again designated survivor or nineteen ninety seven secretary of agriculture you know i may i but not really greet on what to do at tomb ting ward happen a present but i i have not a happen my self something word a happen i would not boy certain basic run an would have ban a good solder in that in that cate when glichman was a designated survivor they flew him to loo guardian air port and a g three plain along with some stern looking guides and suits one of whom mayor me not have been carrying the nuclear football in a fancy brief case then they got glichman in a three car caravan drove him to his daughter's modest apartment in manhattans west village and stood guard outside while he watched the speech on levy glioma admitted he did imagine what it would be i did think bat at way would not be what a very intuiting thing that here the secretary agriculture could be present at taken i been telling the world all e yer at agriculto a mot in portent part of our government i could reimport that that in our mig all of a sudden that would be our number one national ha agenda is just agriculture agriculti poured agriculture glichman even said that in his regular job he was unimportant that immediately after the speech was over he lost the security detail they bailed on him and went back to washington in factor fact words were mister gunman the mission is terminated and i decided stay an and new york and have dinner with my daughter in was cold and raining and pleading an what the dinner was over we went out side of the restaurant and a we could not find a cab o we walked back about twelve black back to my daughters department in in a pleat train i hided struck me to three or four hours before i would the most powerful man on the face of the hurt for about an hour and now i could not even get a cab the fact of the matter is no first on president goes

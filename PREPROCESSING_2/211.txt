a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in to day's pie some of the so if you prefer a beapversion you can find that at our web sit this america life data work i case o it is begin to day spoken with the story by a twenty five year old reporter namely me at twenty five this cud that about what you was on an empire program called wet's hear it though ha say i think that twenty five your owed me would find this in true that ism doing right now to the story to be kind of a mumbly and understated here is how twenty five year old made kicked off his story and now true to li id ventures stories ye i had fire that is how i take about then on the radio to day's adventures story began this way i was sitting outside the office of petty bird she is one of the producers of this radio program and she is blind i g undine sup the taper there i have much to say about this but of disco to let this play for a minatory first stay with me here o a am outside petty bird's office and i over heard her tell this story she was walking down the street she was with a friend and some woman a complete stranger walks up to the to wit am catches up to the two of them and the stranger says to bet well how did you use your sight an a it the i do not usually share that with anybody except fries and she said we i just want to know i just i just want an u when you lis your side and how did to happen an i we i a really care to discuss thatch strangers and e she is a well i don't know why you certainly do not have a very christian attitude you should be grateful have given money to the blind you should be grateful i did e you have never given any money to me body and cross the street to get away from her now when i heard this story i got really excited and that is because the woman who have been involved with for the past three years her name is carry a scene has these sorts of experiences with strangers on the street sorry i i just cannot hell myself i have trusts again could there be a more awkward way to say my girl friend then the woman have been involved with for the past three years anyway my griffin carry the is not blind by the way she is only got one full arm her left arm stops at the elbow and complete strangers have approached her on the street to ask her what happened to her arm i did not say anything about carry to petty at the time i was just eavesdropping but i did go home and tell carry about petty story and her response was shock and excitement of recognition i been pretty isolated from other people who are the sable fer a number of complicated reasons but i just had never been in a position to really trade those stories with anybody or to hear that other people had the same experience that i did i decided to try to capture stories this true to life ad ventures with strangers approaching disable people on the street for other to say would people and for able body people to hear i talked to five people including carryon petty here is don vino then this fin is to series of personal stories all a i had say pretty good til by great funny talkers me a jumping in now and the with narration to point out some bigger lessons that was spun to draw from the stories playing this for my girl grin the sweet excuse me playing this for the woman have ben involved with for the last year and a half she had this reaction which was it is queer were you trying to make and know you want to be but you not doing it right and i think is going a good way to put it i was vaguely stumbling on my way to making the radio that your listen to write a second where people you do not come on and tell personal stories but that twenty five all the moves i make are really turkey ism trying hard near the end of the story when i try to point out some bigger i dead from the story it could not be more didactic now if you are an able bodied person listening to this i do not want to leave you now with fear somehow or if you scared that you will say the wrong thing to some disabled person here are three general rules that you can follow number one you should not offer help to some one unless they actually look they need help and in that case you should go up to them and you should ask them first if they want your help it is really crazy that i thought it would be necessary to say this after at that point eleven minutes of stories were non dis able d people walk up to people with this abilities and make complete jackasses of themselves tho i had to day i was surprised o listening back to this reporting how good the interviews are that part of it i had down and also by my sheer desire to entertain this a story was to kick off to a series of stories about awkward encounters between people with disabilities and non i sample people and in my see tough to the story you can hear a ludibit of how i sound to day yes but also a little bit of the than aged magician that i had been not that long before this this is our glass it'll be back next week with more true to life adventure stories music my stroll next week we hear true to life adventure stories from dinner parties people can you octane is a clip for next week story a and then tales it embarrassment and in appropriate behavior by able body people next wee on this public radio program this version of the story run a month before my twenty fifth birthday and then another version mines the organ music ran on all things considered a month after that birthday at that point i was not a beginner in radio i bee doing readier for six years and at the time i really wondered if i ever was going to get it i was a freelancer and i was slow at making radio stories than to earn money i also work is attempt secretary and i would hear the empire reporters that i admired the most ranking out these perfect little gems of stories in a day or two and it was they had some how some superpower that was somehow unavailable to me no matter how hard i tried i twenty five i was still figuring a lot of things out and i bring us up to day because this fall marks the twenty fifth anniversary of for program this many life and rather spend an hour looking back it seem more interesting to do a show about what it means to be twenty five i not what mean for a radio should be twenty five was who cares what means for a person to be twenty five it is such a particular age you in a don't but you knew enough to it that it is still can feel hit you have a long way to go to turn yourself into the person you want to be to day n o show we have collected a bunch of stores about all kinds of twenty five your old some of them struggling some of them focused and accomplished and not struggling at all and then a couple who are in o somewhere in between from do you be easy chico is this america life on your glass stay with us at one twenty nine for is nineteen our first story n to days a program is reported by one of the youngest people in our staff nor gale who was twenty five when she applied for her job here she is now twenty six hi nor hire nor before you get to the person here during your story about i just take as icon ever mind order people what it is to be the young least experienced person in some work place i think it is it is scary because you are trying to prove to people that you are not at ideate but then you think you are in idiot was see trust is just it is hard you worry about the smallest things stupid things how i would send it e mom or how i sitting in my chair i think you worry about how your to workers are gain to see you and then you start o realize that no one even cares have dephanly shown ut blue and it made no difference nobody was paying attention at all every one else is busy no one pays attention but that is a good thing once i realize that i did not feel stressed about every little thing a is on the story to put together the people turn out is about somebody whose twenty five and the same composition that you are in except in a job were the stakes are harder right ye wait hire i we think of him here i came across a profile the your times this summer about a twenty five year old who had a job that seemed very consequential anymore consequential than any have had she was a scientist working at the biota company were general part of the team racing to find a treatment for covet were actual people's lives are on the line and i remember thinking she is only twenty five how the even get that job her name is stepdame hear dang i was not the only person who saw the article and reached out i was secure from high school sects from collage everything one of my expicrends males talon why do you think er the boy friends males not to grab in no i one best to bring how to come ad nigh school say category that was is imparelative an my your but it a man's love mi but li o ism like stephani's nice to talk to she laughs a lot and she is funny she has some pink in her hair working on her project this was not some huge got she would set out for herself she love science but she loves a lot of other stuff to back in canary she was living in new york city with her room mate an communing to the suburbs for work at generous head quarters and it was then that loved first became a part of her life much earlier than for most of us in the ewes and long before there ware many con form cases or anything clothes down she first heard about it at work and did not think too much of it i guess in his early man canary when li a became a topic a conversation linking the lab not really in like me she pears leak with any one out a the blood it was tie honestly the beginning of i i certelik sharing it was a tat just keep in on on it and see how its breads it was i really a just like a sin i e at the time and then got really in ends were generous has thousands of employes working on all sorts of things stephany happened to sit ripe between the two people in her department who ere spare heading the bovid project christen the lead sat next to her and i right behind me was bin ends of who is also on the rate reseats to you the rapid response teem was not working on a back scene they were making a drug to treat people who got covet and help them recover the idea was to make a cocktail of different any bodies to neutralized the virus christen and vinchenzo were talking about the planned constantly across stephany's desk and stepdame could not help but over her but she was busy with her own assignments an till one night this was still back in canary early in the outbreak when she was getting ready to take tho five thirty shuttle bus to her train back to the city she saw christian in vinchenza were in for another late night and offered to stay back in help i saw like if another set of hands were there and then that thinking o home a ti i gain a li nine thirty a at that wad li at one day couple be a lot longer one day of taking the later settle raising her hand to be the one who see late this is something we know how to do at twenty five ism very familiar with this move within a few days stephany had dropped all her other projects and was working full time on the covet treatment her team's project was to come over the way to quickly screen which any bodies actually worked against the virus as part of that project stephnie's assignment was to make which she calls a virus particle a fake version of the crone of iris that could infect cells that came down to testing hundreds of different recipes getting the conditions exactly like she was working long hours lots of weekends as the team rush to get the project in place her job was slowly becoming her entire life at some point in february months before any one was wearing mass before bovid was even officially a pandemic she started get nervous writing the pack train every day to work on march she moved from our apartment in machine to temporary place nearer generous head quarters id threw herself fully into the project i was excited a was it it was just i a pretty you to undertaking it was a me was used oh i felt really were laving the city i felt were i i could not see any one i did not see my book i for almost too month it felt really to i felt really hard prayer i ties what at the time u just my job a just i putting my job before a lot of things tat i normally parties but i just knew that in my heart that this was going to be something much more important after that every day she would wake up in her empty air bean be drive the seven minutes it took to get to the lab spend hours each day alone in that lab that had to be kept dark staring into a microscope she stay there until around ten or later only to drive back and do it all over again its just really lonely give never i a never lived alone without any ream wore that was real we is really quiet was there a day or a week that it was just lonely that you thought maybe you could not do do this any more i just remember being up at one thirty in the morning and the the been the bed room i did not really know how his her o they never really watched it and i just turned it on and it was on eyes and it was else these sounds ti stones live recordininlie from twenty tell when it us me me incredibly sad and then they played this song all my friends which is just this song about no matter what a like at the endow the day whatever happens you have people in your like always can p with you i was in this apartment alone do god knows wat have not see any one i love er care about not know the next time that i will i justly watching and i stride hi star we i which is i really in dramatic but i think that as roble the loves woman meanwhile outside of stephanie's rein been the lab things were turning for the worst hospitals in new york worried about having enough p p the schools restaurants and bars started shutting down there was one moment during those first few intents months of work that stood out to stephany it was when she finally got one of the first key steps in the experiment to work she was testing to see if her virus particle s the fake viruses were infecting cells in acting the real thing to dodo this she designed in experiment that would cause sells to glow green if they were infected she spent days trying to get the conditions right and then one day o my god i was on that unlike the ti since one four microscopes here and you can scan the whole plate it is three thousand images and it is remember like it hit fifteen hundred ice a green idolist o and i just ran a aryl jo my ball s motive thing you for how dies your boss re act i i you i think every one else was again where i worse i hun for me of li i but it when your new and not used the things going right even getting the smallest thing to work out can feel he giving those sells slight of green was just a tiny step in a thousand other steps that ultimately worked out we general star testing their aunty body cocktilling tune it was one of the treatments trusting in shrimp got back in other and it was just ta proved to be used in emergencies by the f ta last month it is not a coral but the treatment has been shown to help some highrise patience again do you ever feel this is gin to be a sports analogy but your a rooky who played a couple innings on a teem that one the world series do you ever feel that ye ye at ever we could hate pit it i us the stick wit the parts analogy a lot of the time i can like this meetings itself i would be all the side ones like listening in a and even in o is get i i helped

by the age of twenty six not factoring in the difficult mouth of that or how ten pregnancies might affect her box and career she laughs about that now but the spirit of that dream has stayed with her surrounding herself the family being a protector and slowly the details became more realistic she thought waning the gold metals would lead to a bunch of endorsement deals and that she could buy a house not just for herself but for her mam preferably somewhere other than flint which can be pretty rough but the endorsements did not materialize she made the transition from the amateurs to the prose started earning a steady living as a boxer and she thought she could at least convinces her family to move away with her which is why was surprising to me that she wound up on the house in flint i remember the go all that you had was to get out of flint that was while the reasons why you want to get the gold metal that you and your family could get out of flint is you would have to live there

expected me to give up my career and follow theirs but this guy i could keep my job and he coudtag along what if we have nothing else in common but then his momstarted talking to me i was telling her

welcome to the superman japonicas science science face to for ism indruhubermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast threaten i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice o day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called gopmicrobiom and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fire travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar one talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element t do am slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you wan a try element you can go to element element t dot calm slash superman we are now beginning a new topic for the next four to five episodes of the superman labpotcast before we move in to that i want to just briefly touch on a couple questions that i got from the last episode which was related to the science of endurance training i describe the four kinds of endurance training we posted protocols of the specific four kinds of endurance training at superman labor calm just go to that episode you can see the download it is a zerocost ad f i got a lot of questions about what is called concurrent training which is how to program in durance training if you are also interested in strength and hypertrophy training or how to incorporate straight and hypertrophy training which was in the previous episode with endurance training this can all be made very simple ask yourself what are you trying to emphasize and then emphasize that for a tend to twelve week cycle if your mostly interested in endurance i would say house a three too ratio maybe get three endurance training workouts per week maybe for and two strength an hypertrophy workouts if you are mainly focussing on strength an hypertrophy get three or four work outs for strength and hypertrophy end do to endurance workouts start with the minimum number of sets that is required to get the result that you want if you're not accustomed to doing in durance work you would start with the minimum number that is listed on that protocol if it says three to five sets you would start with three maven just two and then work your way up by adding sets each week i do suggest that people get at least one complete restart per week on although i know a lot people do not that i benefit from that actually benefit from having two complete stays each week i just continue to make progress that way whether not for straight and hypertrophy or for endurance i am a big believer in rests other people or not and those con be active stays hiking relaxing et camera after a tend to twelve week cycle then i also suggest taking anywhere from five to seven days completely off you can still enjoy life in do things i know for you addicted exercisers that you are gin a loath to do that but that is one way to stay injury free keep your joints an tissues healthy over time and continue to make progress if you do not want to do that week off do not do it none of this is wholly none of it is a strict prescriptive just ask yourself what are you going to emphasize and emphasize that in terms of the totalvolume of workouts that you do and work up in incrementally and then move into another cycle that is what i suggest go to human labor calm you can get the protocol there we are now going to move into a new topic unrelated to physical performance starting with this episode and for the next four to five episodes we are going to talk all about the senses that is site site hearing touch taste smell and we are also going to talk about this critical sens that we call in terroception or our sense of our internal real estate now the reason that we are talking about the senses is because if you understand how the senses are perceived what there about what the underlying cells and connections are about you will be in a terrific position to understand the months topic that follows which is all about mental health now i want o emphasize that if your somebody who does not have any trouble seeing hearing tasting smelling and has an excellent sense of interception i do believe that these episodes will still be very relevant to you because they have everything to do with how you move through the world how you make sense of information and how you organize your thoughts in your emotions i also one to emphasize that were going to cover a lot of practical tools to day's episode is going to be all about vision and eyesight a topic that is very near and dear to my heart because it is the one that have been focussing on for well over twenty five years of my career but we are not just going to get into the mechanistic details about how light is unconverted into electrical potentials and things that we are going to talk about practical tools that you can and should use to help maintain the health of your visual system and your eyesight very often young people will say what should i do you are always talking about nerd plasticity and how it tapers off over time but ism a young person what should i do you should absolutely train and support your eyesight in fact if you're a young person and you see perfectly or you feel as if you see the world perfectly you are in the best position to bolster to reenforce that visual system that you do not lose your vision as you age in addition you can leverage your visual system for better mental and physical performance and organ to talk about that if your somebody who suffers from a clinical disorder of vision you have trouble seeing or if you need corrective lenses in order to see this episode is definitely for you and while of course i cannot make clinical diagnoses cannot have a one one conversation with any of you in this format nor am i a cognition on a scientist not of physician i did consult with our chair about theology doctor jeffrey golfer at stamford universe school of medicine as well several other people to really vet the information and make sure that the protocols that ism describing are consistent with the clinical literature if you have a severe eye problem you should be working with a really good opthemologist and or optometrist but certainly an an opthemologist who is a medical doctor but i do believe that the information that we are going to discuss today as going to be relevant to everybody and will set the stage for the month on mental health and mental performance let us get started when we hear the word vision we most often think about eyesight or our ability to perceive shapes and objects and faces and colors and indeed vision involves eyesight our ability to see shapes and objects and faces and colors and forth however our eyes are responsible for much more than that including our mood are level of alertness and all of that is included in what we call vision i just wane to take about three maybe four minutes and talk about how the visual system works how it is built and how you are able to called see things around you i also want to describe the ways in which your eyes and your visual system impact your mood and your level of alertness and then we are going to get right into some protocol some specific things that each in all of you should do if you want to enhance your vision and maintain your vision as you get older and again if you are a fifteen year old or a twelve year old this episode is especially for you because your nervous system is far more plastic than mine is it is much more amenable to change you can really build a very strong visual system and in doing that and if you adopt specific behaviors at any age of light viewing at particular times in particular ways then you can build and emotional system that is also reinforced by your visual system let us talk about vision what is vision well vision starts with the eyes we have know what is called extra ocular light perception while it feels good delight on our skin while feels good to be outside in the sunlight for most people the only way that light information can get to the cells of your body is through these two little goodies on the front of your face and for those of you listening om just pointing to my eyes as many of you have heard me say before on this another podcast your eyes in particular your curl retinas are part of your central nervous system they are part of your brain there are the only part of your brain that sits outside the cranial vault another words you have two pieces of your brain that deliberately got squeezed out of the skull during development and placed in these things we call eyesockets there is a genetic program for the specific purpose of making sure that three little layers of neuron's nerve cells got squeezed out and form what are call your nerd retinas now the eyes have a lot of other goodies in them that are very important and those other goodies that were going to focus on a a lot to day there is a lends to focus light precisely to the retina if you are somebody who requires eyeglasses or contacts chances are you do not do that correctly and that is why you use other lenses eyeglasses or contacts there re also other pieces of the eye that are designed to keep the eye lubricated you also have these things that we call eyelashes most people know this but eyelashes are there to trigger the blink reflects if a piece of dust or something gets in front of your eye it is a beautiful adaptation of nature there are not just aesthetically nice costello happens to have very long eyelashes he gets complements about this all the time maybe you have long eyelashes i do not have particularly long eyelashes but the eyelashes are there that if a piece of dust or something starts to head towards the corny o the eye blinks very very fast its the fastest reflects you own is your e blink reflex we also have these things called eye lids now eyelids might seem the most boring topic of all but they are incredibly fascinating to day whereon to talk about how you can actually use your visual system to increase your levels of alertness based on the curl circuits that link your brain stem with your eyelids and now we are not on to have a blinking contests because i would win and you would loose and that when be fun for you let us talk about what the eyes do for vision basically the entire job of the eyes is to collect light information and send it off to the rest of the brain in a form that the brain can understand remember no light actually gets in pass those nurlretnas it gets to the nurlretna and we have specific cells in the eye called photoreceptor they come in two different types rods and cones cones are mainly responsible for daytime vision and the rods are mainly responsible for vision at night or under lowliest conditions generally speaking basically what happens is if your eyelids are open light comes into the eye the lends focuses that light light is also just called photons light energy on to the retina these photoreceptor the rods and cones have chemical reactions inside them that involve things item in ay and that chemical reaction converts the light into electricity now that might seem incredibly abstract but the way to think about this is very similar to for instance you have touch receptors on your skin and when you press on those touch receptors they convert pressure physical pressure into electrical information an those neurons send it up to your spinal courting brain can register the somebody or you are touching your the top your hand as ism doing now with the eyes and the retina is just that light gets converted into electrical information within the eye within the retina there then a a series of stages of processing and that information ofventin gets send into the brain by a very specific class of neurons i would likeyou to know the names of these neurons they are called retinal gangland cells the only thing you need to know about the our science of the eye at this point are that their rods and cones the cones are involved in bright daytime vision and rods are involved i wore dusk or night time vision and you got the sells called rental ganglia cells that send the information off to the rest of the brain now here is what is incredible and seen you to ponder this for a second the still blows my mind everything you see around you you're not actually seeing those objects directly what your doing is your making a best guess about what is there based on the pattern of electricity that derives in your green now that might just seem totally wild and hard to rap your head around but think about it this way because this is the way it actually works let us take it in example of a color green or blue you have cones in your eye that respond best to the wave length of light that is reflected off say a green apple you do not actually see the green apple what you see is the light bouncing off that green apple and it goes into your eye and you see it and perceive it as round and green but not because you see anything green no green light arrives in your brain what a happens is your brain actually compares the amount of green reflection coming off that apple to the amount of red and blue around it well you might say while the green apples sitting on a brown table or a white surface well then it will appear very green because the amount of wave length of light for green is very hide and the amount for red is very low and it looks very green one we do not actually see anything directly what the brain is receiving is a series of signals electrical signals and it is comparing electrical signals in order to come up with what we call these perceptions i see something green a green apple or i see red let me give you a slightly different example if you were to play a key on the piano let say you play not a musician but eminent o hopefully i will not get this too a to incorrectly but let say you you have e sharp maybe it is untintintintinting if the brain gets that signal it does not actually now e that is what it does not recognize it until you were to play i another key next it dndundundundun and what it does is does the math it does the subtraction and it compares those two when we see something green or we see something red or we see something blue we are not actually seeing it directly the grain is making a guess about how green or red or blue that thing is by comparing what is around it o and if that seems hard to wrap your head around do not worry because we will explain it in more depth going forward but i really want people to understand this that vision my sight is not looking at things directly and that information getting directly into your brain it is translated light information is transformed into electrical signals that your visual system exquisitely understands now what does this been why should you care about this well if you have a dog i do or a cat they are not color blind but they lack the the cones that respond to red meaning long wave length light what does that been that means that when they see green it is different than the green you see not because that apple is not visible to them but because they are not able to compare it to red and you are as a consequence when they look at a green lawn it looks more brownish or orange to them when you are a red shirt in front of your dog or cat if you see a stopping and they see a stopping they see oranges brown and you see red presuming that you are a trichromat meaning you have three color vision this is all to say that every animal sees the world differently depending on whether or not they have one or two or three of these different cones the red blue or green cones if you are a mantis shrimp of all things you see hundreds of colors that human beings cannot see many animals see into visual ranges that you and i cannot see and for instance a pit viper senses heat missions it literally sees that heat coming off of you or of an animal that they want to eat if you are a ground squirrel you can see ultra violet light the gin sound kind a weird but ground squirrels as fly signal one another by standing up outside and shining sunlight off each others stomachs to each other signalling at a distance just you could signal somebody with a mirror in sunlight at distance there are species of primates this is not very pleasant a thing about that urinate on their hands and then wipe it all over their stomach and then use that sunlight to reflect different signals to each other on wat their saying we always assume at something cute and nice but may be their insulting each other this actually gets right down to the heart of these bigger questions consciousness what we see what is out there how much of life is really accessible to us and i count go on and on this used to be and a an obsession of mine when i was coming up in the field of visual narrowscience to understand how different animal see the world compared to us now give one more example a diving bird a bird that flies over the ocean it has an incredible task it has to both view the horizon and has to view schools of fish and then has to make a trajectory down into the water and grab one of those fish to eat and the water has what is called a refractory ideas it actually shifts a prism the impression or the perception of where that fish is right if the bird sees the fish right below it it has to know it has to adjust its divintrajectory just right because it knows that that fish actually is not where it sees it its probably a few inches ahead or to the side of that because of the way that water diverts the image you have ever dropped a coin to the bottom of a pool if you go straight down looking at that location if you were look from the top of the pool and you dive straight down with your eyes close you will miss because the water refracts it shifts the visual image well diving birds have an arrangement of these retinal cells that common nictate to the brain that is both a streak to view the horizon cause they need to know where they are relative to the horizon and they have a pupil we do on the bottom of their eye that they can make very accurate dive and attacks on these schools of fish and catch fish and eat those fish we just have pupils in the middle of our eyes there is a ton about the optics of the eye in the way that it communicates with the brain that allows us to see we could spend hours talking about this but what it'd to bed in your mind is that what you experience in the outside world is bottle necked it is limited by which wave lengths which colors if you will of light that you can see that your brain is coming up with the best guess about what is there it does not actually know what is there and that your vision is distinctly different from say the vision of a dog or from the vision of somebody whose a dycromat meaning they do not have a red cone a lot of people in particular about one in eighty mails lacks a red cone and therefore sees the world much the same way that costello does although he sees it from just much lower toward the ground that is what it'd you to understand about the way the eye communicates with the brain i would also you to understand that the brain itself is making these guesses and that those guesses are largely right how do i know that well the right because when you reach out to grab a glass most of the time you grab the glass and you do not miss right most of the time when you make judgments about the world around you based on your visual impression of them it allows you to move functionally through the world but let me give you some examples of where this guessing is happening right now and its incredible that to this day that still blows my mind cover one eye with one hand as if your driving maybe do not do this if your viewing the world around you presumably you can see everything that is out there i could do this with one eye or the other eye you probably see better out of one or the motherland will talk about that you have a giant blind spot in the middle of your visual field it is called your blind spot it is the spot in which the connections the wires from all those retinal gangling tells legs at the back of the eye and head off toward the brain in other words you are blind for a huge spot of your central vision the part of your vision that is highest acuity highest detail and yet you do not see that ever you cover one eye you see perfectly fine and it is not just because your eye is moving round really quickly your brain is guessing what is in that spot which is absolute incredible and you do not see that blind spot this is happening all the time now when you have two eyes open the way that your eyes are positioned in your head and the way they you the world is such that they fill in each others blind spot says pretty convenient but if you cover one e that is impossible and yet you still see the world as complete the brain is doing these incredible things it is also creating depth e sense of depth even though what arrives from the retina is essentially a read out of a two dimensional flat image condense depth how do depth well this is very simple things that are closer t you tend to be larger than things that are far away things that are closer to you tend to look their moving faster if you ever been in train and you look to your side this the rungs on offense or the train tracts going by you look liketheyir going very fast if you look off in the distance they look their moving very slowly and there are differences between what is close to you and what is further away a little house on the horizon you do not look at an say oh that must be a tiny little house you have some prior knowledge that things further away are smaller that is the main way that you do that and you compare the location at which information about light lands on the two eyes your eyes are slightly offset from one another that for instance if i look at you if you are standing right in front of me right now and i were to look at you the image of your face the light bouncing off your face to be morse precise lands on one eye and a slightly different location than it does in the other eye and then the brain does math it basically does the equivalent of geometry and trigonometry and essentially figures out how far away you are from me which is just incredible the brain does all this very very fast and the brain uses about forty to fifty per cent of its total real estate for vision that is how important vision is now for those of you that are blind or low vision or no vision that met real estate in the brain will be taken over by anurans that control sense of touch and the sense of hearing and your indeed hearing and touch are much better higher acuity and faster in blind people but for most of you who i presume our sighted this is how it works that is kind of vision from eye to brain in a nutshell there a bunch of different stations in the brain that you different things that is eyesight now i want a talk about the other aspect of vision which is the stuff that you do not perceive the subconscious stuff and then will transition directly into how you can use light and eyesight to control this other stuff because it is very important in that other stuff is mood sleep and appetite and there are ways in which you can use the same protocols that i will describe in order to preserve and even enhance your vision your ability to see things and consciously perceive them the protocols we will describe how a lot of carry over to both conscious eye sight and to these subconscious aspects of vision and i just want you understand a little bit more about the science of seen of eyesight and vision and then all the protocols will make perfect sense as amazing as eyesight is it actually did not evolve for us to see shapes and colors and motion and form the most ancient cells in our eyes and the reason we have eyes is to communicate information about time of day to the rest of the brain and body remember there is no extrocularphotoreception there is no way for light information to get to all the cells of your body but every cell in your body needs to know if its night or day i take to little about this on the in the episodes on sleep and this episode is not about sleep but i want to emphasize that there is a particular category of retinal ganglia cell remember the neurons that connect the retina to the brain that is involved in a special kind of vision that has nothing to do with conscious perception of what is around you and it is happening right now it is happening all the time these are called melonopsen retinal ganglia ells named after the open that they contain within them they are essentially photoreceptor remember before i said their photoreceptor and then these gangling cells while these melonopsen cells as the name suggests melon open have their own photoreceptor built inside them the open that they contain is actually very similar to the melonopsen that is present in the skin of some amphibians and that causes those amphibians to change their skin color in different light conditions you have believe it or not a little bit of frog skin in your eye to speak not exactly but you essentially have the equivalent of what frogs have in their skin in your ye if you are low vision or no vision as long as you have retinas it is very likely you still have these cells even though you cannot see or you do not see well these cells retinal ganglia cells communicate to areas of the brain when particular qualities of light are present in your environment and signal to the brain therefore that it is early day or late in the day these melons and ganglia sells are sometimes also called intrinsically photosensitive cells because they behave photoreceptor what do these cells respond to and why should you care about them well you should care about them because they regulate when you will get sleepy when you will feel awake how fast your metabolic metabolism is souse me your blood sugar levels your dopamine levels and your pain threshold there are other factors that impact those things but they are one of the if not the most powerful determinant of those other things mood and pain threshold sleepiness wakefulness et camera these melonopsand gangling cells have been shown eye the nights group and e eye easy up the universe washington and by simmertars labia it buster's lab an a number of other people's lave such in panda you prevents you et camera number of excellent labs in your science to set the circadian clock and a respond best to the contrast between blue and yellow light of the sort that lands on these cells when you view the sun when it is at call low solar angle when it is low in the sky either in the morning or in the evening what is all this mean it means and hears the first protocol and you've probably heard me say this before but is appropriate to this episode to say it again if you are not viewing the sun sunlight even through cloud cover for two to ten minutes in the early part of the day when the sun is still low in the sky and doing the same thing again in the evening you are severely disrupting your sleep rhythms your mood your hormones your metabolism your pan threshold and many other factors including your ability to learn and remember information the most central and important aspect of our biology and perhaps our psychology as well is to anchor our cells in time to know when we exist wait sounds all bit abstract and philosophical but it is not and we do not know time as the real thing because a watches in clocks we know time at a biological level based on where the sun is and where which of course is where we are relative to the sun because the earth is spinning around now what does this mean for a protocol it means see get that light in your eyes early in the day and any time you want to be awake try and get as much sunlight in your eyes during the day as you safely can will talk about my safety this episode in depth and the blue light and the contrast of that blue yellow remember we do not see blue this is all subconscious this is blue reflections coming off o sunlight blue light we have been told of terrible for us it is absolutely essential and wonderful for waking up the brain for triggering all sorts of positive biological reactions but it needs to be viewed early in the day if you cannot see sunlight because it is the thick cloud cover of a in lab you are in the tuque an its winter then artificial lights in especially blue lights would be very beneficial to you hear a lot of this light and its contrast with yellow in order to trigger these melons and cells which e then trigger your circadian clock which sits above the roof your mouth which will signal every cell in your body including temperature rhythms et camera first things first your visual system was not for seeing faces motion et camera the most ancient cells in your eye which are there right now as we speak are there to inform your body and brain about time of day you want to get that bright light early in the day absolute essential two to ten minutes you can download t he light meter a if you want a measure lucks when we when i explain the do that in earlier episodes a got a little convoluted get that two to ten minutes i deal with out sunglasses now here is another reason to do this and have never spoken about this before on any podcast which is that there have been several studies now in thousands of subjects exploring what can be done to prevent myopia near tiredness and other visual defects and it turns out in a series of large clinical trials the conclusion is emerged they getting two hours a day of outdoor time without sunglasses blue light this blue light that everyone is demonized getting that sunlight during the day for two hours even if your reading other things and doing other things outside has a significant effect on reducing the probability that you will get myopia near tiredness now whether not that is also due to the fact that myopia can be caused by viewing things up close to too much you indoors we tend to be looking at things more closely right unless you have a very large house with walls that are very far away from you but the effect does seem to be directly related to getting sunlight and not just to the distance that your viewing i men to describe the study just briefly but this is a second protocols we have one protocol about getting unlike to set your creating clocks benin wake you up establish your sleep will occur about twelve to sixteen hours later that is all the sleep episode but also to enhance your mood to enhance your metabolism to optimize your hormone levels and to optimize learning and doom levels this feel good noromodulator that is essential to not getting depressed for et camera but now's a second protocol which is ideally and this includes children as long as they are not very small infants ideally we are all getting two hours of outdoor time even if there is cloudcover remember we evolved mostly under outdoor conditions not indoor conditions and no artificial blue like will not replace this aspect of your visual system and offsetting myopia such one o briefly described the study because it a very important one and i do not think it is discussed often enough there are many studies exploring this but one of the ones i the most looked at six hundred and ninety three students and a subset of them were encouraged to spend eleven hours a week outdoors most kids are in school five days a week or there spend eleven hours a week outdoors they are sometimes reading outdoors and not always just playing outdoors they might be reading books et camera they used eight different schools and the reason they do the study i probably should ho mention is that myopia near snideness is a global epidemic at least that is how it was referred to in the study i soft know who decides what is an epidemic or not i think there thresholds for that this paper publish in the journal opthemology in two thousand eighteen described the fact that being outdoors for two hours a day could could significantly reduce the probability that these children would develop near sightedness and it turns out based on other studies that adults who spend two hours a day outside that would be reading outside talking outside no it does not include light coming through the windshield of your car it'll explain whin a few moments offset the the formation of myopia now myopiaare near sightedness has to do with the way that the lens focuses light on to the retina i do not want to get into a long description of this now but basically the lens has to bring light to the retina not in front of it not behind it if it brings light to a position in front of the retina then you will not see clearly you will need corrective lenses if it brings light directly to the retina than you will see clearly that should be intuitive why that makes make sense s you might say it why would being outside getting this blue light or this but blue yellow contrast from sunlight actually offset myopia well it probably and i want emphasize probably has to do with the fact that these melons and gangling cells these intrinsically photons of angle cells are not just responsible for sleep and talking your circadian clock and that sort of thing they also make connections within the retina they connect to things this is for the effycionatos the ciliary body the iris the muscles and the structures within the eye that actually move the lens and allow you to adjust your vision to things up close or far away and in doing they increase or improve the health of the little tiny muscles within the eye that move the lens and they probably again this needs a little bit more work in order to really tamp down the mechanism the probably also involved in in bringing growth factors and blood supply to the muscles and to the neurons that are responsible for this focusing mechanism within the eye remember your eye is an optical device you are born with lenses you do not have to use glasses or may be you do because you have lenses in your eyes and those lenses need to move it is not it is not a rigid lens a glass lens is a dynamic lens has little muscles that pull on it and squeeze it and make it thicker or thinner as you look at things close and far away and it'll describe how that works in a moment these melonopsan sells and their activation by sunlight completely subconsciously unaware you are unaware of this promote the health of this system within the eye and allow you to offset the myopia near sightedness in other words getting outside for two hours a day each day on average even if there is cloud d cover without sun glasses on will allow you to offset the formation of myopia now you might still form myopia if you have certain structural features or genetic basis for that we will talk about things that you can do as well but for everybody we should be doing this d that might seem a lot but this is the way the your visual system works staying indoors just getting artificial light and looking at things up close leads to visual defect ache it is a form of kind of visual obesity right the the posture of your visual system if you will is going to be unhealthy if you are just indoors in your not getting sunlight early in the day and for at least two hours per day i want to talk a little bit more about how our eyes adjust to things that are close to us or far away sis an absolutely brilliant consequence of our nature and our design and whenever i say nature and design people always ask me what you really trying to say or you trying to talk about creators or you talking about intelligent does not look i want be very frank with you i was not consulted that the the design face in neither were you and that is all very interesting but it is not the topic of this discussion what is clear and what is the topic of this discussion is that the eye can dynamically adjust were light lands by moving the lens and changing the shape of the lends in your eye through a process called accommodation and if you understand this process of accommodation you not only can enhance the health of your eyes in the immediate and long term but you also can work better you will be able to focus better on physical and mental work you will be able to concentrate for longer and i want to emphasize that much of our mental focus whether not it is for cognitive endeavors or physical endeavors is grounded in where we place our visual focus and what we look at and our ability to hold our concentration there is critically determining how we think in other words if you can hold visual focus you can hold mental focus cognac focus but holding visual focus is challenging it is tiring because it requires movement of the lens and that movement of the lens requires activation of muscles and the activation of muscles as from the physical performance episodes you saw them and even if you do not is dictated by neurons what is a commotion well it is actually very simple and very elegant and ever again this is another case where whenever i i look at the stuff even hoax ben looking at for years learning about it for years it still boggles my mind that we have these apparatus built into our eyes to we have lenses in our eyes and we have these things called the irises t you are all familiar with the iris because you will see pupil's pupils get bicolor smaller and we we intuitively think of eyes as having the pupils if you actually draw to u circles on on a a a she of paper and you just they look two circles but if you put little dots in the middle of them they look eyes your brain recognizes those as eyes because one of the first things you see when you come into this world or eyes and actually if you put the little dots close together it willow kind of wrong its cross eyed and if you put them at different locations within those two dots of opposing locations i to look googol eye and see your brain is actually filling in all the face and other information even emotional information just based on this recognition of eyes and there is clearly we know this there is real estate deep up no a further up in the brain that is responsible for analyzing and recognizing faces and the eyes in the position of these little things we call irises in pupils et camera is really important for how we interpret the status of others and that is why it is such a powerful thing just to put two circles and move the pupils around on on now on paper in fact i want to get into a commotion what if you think about it if one of my pupils was up there and the other one was down there one was really big and one was really small that would actually be a sign of pretty severe damage if some one get hit hard on the side of the head you know that they shine a light in one eye you know there doing that there actually looking at the other eye when you shine light of the ye that pupil constricts to limit the amount of light that comes in does not damage the eye also happens when you walk outside in its bright it constricts but we have what is call the consensual pupil reflects there is a connection deep in the brainstorm deep back here in the brain near my neck the connects the pupil mechanism for the two eyes and there looking t the other eye and if you shine light in one eye and that pupil constricts but the other one does there's a good chance there is brainstorm damage this is what they do on the side of a football field a in boxing match or some one unfortunate hits their head two pupils and do not freak out if one pupils a little bit smaller than the others that other that does not necessarily mean brain damage but if you suddenly have one pupil bigger than the other you absolutely want to go see a neurologist right away these the eyes in the pupils are indicative of things that are happening deep in the brain now accommodation is our ability to accommodate to things that are close here or further away and the way this works is that the iris and a and a the musculature in at structure call the biliary body move the let when you look far away or can when you see things far away your lends actually relaxes it can flatten out when you think about this when you look far away when it may be anywhere from twenty feed away from you out to a horizon that miles are kilometers away from you the lends can just relaxing can flatten out and you will notice that it actually is relaxing to look at a horizon it is relaxing to look far away whereas if i look at something up close to me this pen or my phone or a computer screen or this microphone it takes effort you will sense the effort now some of that effort is actually eye movements be as you have muscles that can move your eyes within their sockets but a lot of the work quit in quotes curl work of the muscles having to conto move and contract such that the lens actually gets thicker in order to bring the light to the retina and not to a location in front of it or behind it called accommodation there is also changes in the sizes of the pupil as things are closer and further away from you in fact there is a simple way to thing about this healthy pupils are going to dilate when you look at something far away from you now when you see something that excites you or stresses you out your pupils also get big your eyes get wide but if you look at something far away you pupils arguing to dilate and when you look at things are closer to you when you move him up close that pupils are going to shrink that is all part of this accommodation mechanism now you might s ay why you telling me about accommodation this is crazy where you telling about this well these days were spending a lot of time looking at things mainly are phones up close and computers up close and we are indoors if you are a young person and even if you are twenty five or older and you are spending a lot of time looking at things up close and you are not allowing your vision to relax in other which you are not giving your lends the opportunity of flatten out and for these muscles to relieve themselves of this work you mayor may not have my gran headaches you mayor may not have headaches you might and that could be the cause of those but you are also training your eyes too be good at looking at things up close and not far away and as a consequence you are reshaping the are circuitry in your brain and it is not good it is not healthy to only look at things up close now there are lot of recommendations out there right now especially with all the lock downs of the last twelve eighteen months that people should look up from fume every once while a may be now on hearing that people would take calls instead of doing fume or should look up from your computer screen it is actually not going to solve the problem just to look up from your computer screen you need to go to a window you need to look out at a distance ideally you would even open the window because those windows actually filter out a lot of the blue light that you want during the daytime a lot of the sunlight it is actually fifty times less gets through you want to get out on to a balcony you want to relax your eyes and look out at the horizon you want to going to what is call panoramic vision let your vision expand you want this lens mechanism to be very elastic you do not want it to get stuck in that configuration of looking at things up close accommodation as a wonderful feature of your visual system but you do not want to push that too hard too often or for too long you want to view the horizon you want to get outside not just to light in the load on your mind or to think about other things but to maintain the health of your visual system in other words you want to exercise these muscles and that involves both the lens moving and getting kind of thicker and relaxing that lens and the relaxation of the lens is actually one of the best things you can do for the musculature of the inner eye what is the protocol how often should you do this you might be surprised but for every thirty minutes of focused work you probably want to look up every once a while and just trying relax your face and i muscles including your jaw muscles because all these things are closely linked in the brainstorm and allow your eyes to go into call panoramic vision where you just not really focussing on anything and then refocus on your work at least every ninety minutes of looking at things up close or even if you are looking at a screen i a television screen or or you are watching a move or you are indoors for every ninety minutes of that you ideally would have at least twenty probably more thirty minutes of being outside ideally but if you cannot be outside of gnawn up close vision you might say that is impossible how my pose to do that i you know in an office or ism in building get to a window get outside if you can do it safely get on to a balcony and just let your eyes relax many people are experiencing severe vision problems because they are not getting enough sunlight during the day they're have sleep problem because they are not viewing sunlight early in the day and as have mention previous episodes there getting a lot of artificial stimulation artificial stimulation of the eye in the middle of the night all of this is through the visual system my grains fatigue challenge is with your eyesight getting worse as you age or even in young people there is at at least according to the articles they described as this epidemic of myopia can largely be dealt with by getting outside going into panoramic vision experiencing some distance division look at things off in the horizon if your walking your hiking your biking not looking at your phone the whole time that you are doing that i you are at the stop or your a commuting certainly not looking at your phone the entire time you are doing that this is vital and i want emphasis anotherprotocal though i do not want to get into in too much depth cause i want to make sure that i also talk about a number of other important aspects of the visual system that are more related to sight but getting into optic flow is very important for distressing your system when you move through space whether not through walking biking even swimming if it self generated optic flows probably not driving our motor cycling but yes bicycling or a unacyclionam y thought by unacycling the use to be graduates unite stamphord who is really impressive unicycle or those are pretty rare as long as it self generated optic flow meaning your generating motion of your body and the visual images around you are passing by on your eyes that is very good for the visual system and it is very good for the mood systems and the neromodulator systems of the brain and body that regulate mood this is well established ism not telling people to get away from their phone in their computers i spend a lot of time staring at a page drawing writing testing et camera just you do but we are really talking about some very simple protocols that archest design to improve your sleep but are really design to bolster and enhance your vision and of course because it is this podcast we will also talk about things that you can take to improve your vision but if your visual behavior is not right and i do believe we should always start with behaviors and then think about nutrition supplementation et camera if your behaviors around vision are not right you cannot expect to have good healthy eyesight for a long time meaning throughout your life span and i your vision is already poor many of these things that ism talking about to day perhaps all of them will improve your vision to some degree and if your vision is starting to go then doing these behaviors is likely to really enhance the quality of the vision that you will build and maintain over time and all of these are essentially zero cost o if you live in a very dark environment a cave or out or space it is can be hard to do some of this stuff but if your on planned earth even if there is cloud covered chances are you can do some or most or even all of these sum most or all days what ism about to describe next as going to seem silly on the face of it but has deep mechanism to support it put simply when you get tired your eyelids close and when your alert your eyelids a open that is because you have neurons in your brain that depending on your level of alertness we will make it easy or hard to keep your eyes open now that is a complete do except that we do not often think about the relationship between alertness and were we are looking and our eyelids now i lean this from a colleague of mine in psychiatry who happens work on hypnosis acme not con hypnotize you right now that is is u for a future episode but what happens when we get tired our eyelids close and our chin moves down we tend to not out this way if you it have ever been in a classroom certainly not one of mind but if you have been in a classroom and the lecturer is kind of drawing on or the afternoon w y'all notice is that number of stones their heads are just kind their eyelids are closing and their chin is dropping and then they you will see i monchheads balancing back up i i was deafly one of those people in class feels post lunch en the afternoon it is warm the hum of the air condition or whatever it is and i just out ki when we are wide awake the oppose it happens our eyelids are open all the way and our chin happens to be up and know this is not me telling you to have good posture however what i learn from my collie at stammered is that these circuits actually act in loops when we look up maybe it is because these melons and cells are in the bottom of our retina they are and maybe it is because there there in order to view sunlight which is overhead which it is but that system of alertness is linked to the position of our eyes when we look up and our eyelids are up it actually has a purpose it actually creates a wakefulness signal for the brain and h this might seem the silliest and simple tool that i might ever describe on this podcast if you are feeling tired it actually can be beneficial to the wakefulness systems of the brain including the locust sedulous and these areas that release nor up in efferent to actually look up to actually look up toward the ceiling you do not want your chin all away back but to look up and to raise your eyes toward the ceiling and to look up and try and hold that for ten to fifteen seconds this is not looking up and closing your eyes i anon a nice sunny day that is relaxing this is looking up and actually looking up at the ceiling it actually triggers some of the areas of the brain that are involved in wakefulness your somebody who is falling a sleep at your work this can be very beneficial likewise many people are looking at their phone all day and their chin is down and then there sitting at a computer that is position below them in their having trouble staying awake or focussing it can be very been i tell costly this all the time case these always falling a sleep will is train to do his work positioning your computer screen up at eyelevel or sometimes having it actually above eye level can actually create wakefulness and alertness for the work that you are going to do this is simply because of this connection between the brainstorm circuits and the other nail circuits that control wakefulness and eyelids opening and looking up of it is again it is remarkably simple almost laughably simple but it is grounded in some of the most horrid wired meaning present from birth aspects of our nor circuitry and nor up an efferent release from lock sedulous is not just a mouthful it is a really interesting and powerful mechanism for how the rest of the brain wakes up locus rules hoses the rest of your brain with nor up interferon in order to wake up those circuits for work and attention and eyes up is actually a way a route into increased alertness eyes down is a route into sleepiness into reduced alertness and i o have only one friend that tests up here on the street holds his phone up here it looks ridiculous and yet if we were trying to create more sense of alertness if that is your goal position in computerscreens up high chin up looking up if you need to kind of create an alertness signal not always being chin down and testing or or working into typewriters a reading below us is actually going send a recurring wakefulness signaled if when things are up we tend to be alert when everything folks down in cling your eyes it tends to have a more suppressive or set it give type signaling to the deeper centers of the brain now before we move on to the science and tools and protocols related to pattern vision i want a mention another study that was done by the universe a pennsylvania that have a terrific group that were there that works on sleep the mad an important discovery that i think everybody should know about which is that children that sleep in rooms that have a night light or dim lights are much more likely to develop myopia near sightedness conversely children that sleep in very dark rooms either very dim night lights or complete black they have a much lower statistically speaking a significantly lower probability a developing myopia near sightedness now why is that it is because the wave lengths of light that matter for these melanous an cells often times can get through the eyelids and that is particularly true for children and people that have thin eyelids some people me have very thin eyelids have been told this before not many people touch my eyelids but among those that have that very thin eyelids i notice i very thin eyelids compared to say costello now costellofs eyes drop you cant even closes eyes all the way their drop but many people have thin eyelids and those people are going to be even more prone to light coming in through the eyelid for parents for kids and for adults you really want to try to get to a place where you can sleep in a completely black or dark environment one little exposure to light no big deal but this ties back to the other protocalled i have described before in the mood and sleep episodes which is that viewing light even of very low intensity between the hours of ten p m and fore a m is extremely detrimental to the dopamine another mood producing systems of the brain it can negatively impact learning and immunity and even blood sugar and make people tight to diabetes prone by way of communication from these melons and sells to a structure in the rain call the hobanula why ami throwing out all this verbiage while because people of ask for more mechanism if you really want to know when you look at blue light or if blue light is getting in through your eyelids in the mill the night it is likely distorting these lends accommodation mechanism in the eye and leading to myopia in some cases that is one reason to avoid light exposure and bright light exposure even night light exposure mill the night viewing any light of bright intensity between the hours of ten p m and for a m on a consistent basis is going to suppress dopamine because of the way that that light activates these bellhops and sells and the habenula and the dopamine system it is all very simple get as much bright light as you can can safely right you never want to look at any light bright that it is painful look at during the daytime try and go without sunglasses unless you need them now i wear sunglasses for sake of sport and sake when it is really bright out but i try to get two hours a day of working out side or been outside even if there is cloud cover that is on offset myopia it is going to help you get better sleep it is going to support mood and metabolism et camera and at night if you're sleeping with a lot of lights in the room and especially if the are kids that need a night light you should try and ween them off that night light because it is going to be beneficial for their vision to ween them off that night light and put them into a darker environment i us you want to get them emotionally comfortable it that first now let us talk about pattern vision actual seeing things like faces and colors et camera ism presuming that some of you out there are color blind we can all help the red green color blind folks out there by not using red and slides and diagrams and on menus and things of that sort crinose magenta instead they can see the contrast between magenta and green better then if there is red and green be kind to the color blind folks out there atseshy of affair percentage and their plotted different kinds of color blind ishjust mention some people are true monochromat they see the world and black and weight that is exceedingly rare most color blind people color blind and quotes a red green color blind meaning they lack red cone photopigmen meaning they cannot see long ravelings of light they see the world much as a canine or a cat does where they do not get the green red contrast as where we call it red green color blind they have the green cones but they cannot do the contrast comparison that i described it the beginning of the episode use magenta and they will be able to see things you wonder why stop finds and stop lights and things are not i magenta well because the world is unkind to the red green color blind individuals and they have to learn the position of those lights in the in the street lights and they have to learn the shapes of signs which they can do readily and it usually says stop on it as well but if you care about color blind folks which i do then a we could all do them a service side i think by law actually in the us a menus are required to be color blind excessive how can you improve your vision how can you get better at seeing things well one way is to make sure that you spend at least ten minutes a day total at least viewing things off in the distance that would be well over half a mile or more try and see a horizon try and get your vision out to a location that is beyond the four walls of your house are apartment ah or the doors of your car in the windshield of your car i know that can be hard to do but it is very valuable if you live in a city new york and its skyscrapers everywhere you probably experience the incredible sense of relaxation and it is aesthetically beautiful when you are walking down one of these long avenues and you turn and i think they've a name for this in new york ah where the sunset is suddenly visible along the long avenue between some sky scrapers and it is just very relaxing to be able suddenly to see at a distance and that is actually because this eye mechanism relax relaxing the lends and relaxing some of the musculature round the eyes send signals deep into the brainstorm that release some of the centers that involved in alertness act stress and it is very pleasant for reason it is not a a it is not a placebo effect if you will there are bunch of narrow chemicals and things there associate with that try and see at a distance because it is good for your eyesight it will keep this lends nice and elastic and the muscles nice and strong that move the lens and it has this relaxing component to it now or visual system is exquisitely tuned to motion not just our self generate motion bit the motion of things around us and one of the things that it does is something called smooth pursuit smooth pursuit is our ability to track individual objects moving as the name suggest smoothly through space various trajectories you can actually train or improve your vision by looking at smooth pursuit stimuli that sounds really boring what you can do is and it'll provide a link to some that i think are pretty good that are used in various clinic apthemology and optometry clinic you can actually take a few minutes each day or may be if you do not do to each day you could every third day or and actually just visually track of all sometimes it is moving in in kind of an infinity symbol sometimes it is more of a saw tooth some times its changing speed sometimes the awe the cue that you are following the little target is a dilating and contracting this is going to keep the muscles i want to be clear that is going to keep the extra ocular muscles conditioned and strong and allow you to have a healthy smooth pursuit system remember the brain follows the eye it follows the movements of the eye it has to deal with that and the nerve circuits within the brain have to cope with changes in smooth pursuits of you are doing a lot of reading up closes you are not viewing horizons you are not getting a lot of smooth pursuit type stimulation from your life or you are just getting it within the confines of a little box on your phone your your smooth pursuit is over millimeters are what we were always talking from of visual angle but the amount of degrees of visulangle but if you are just looking at smooth pursuit in this little tiny box on your phone a on near comps er screen and you are not looking at objects in your environment swooping birds and things that which ism guessing many of you are not spending your time doing while these mechanisms for smooth pursuit will get worse over time your vision will get worse and while i prefer that people get out into the real world an experience smooth pursuit tracking of visual objects for makes a good reason to go to a hockey gamer wat trying keep your eye on the pock which i can never seem to do move fast or the basis a good reason to watch live sports if that is your thing or watch a tennis match a cat again watching the ball go back and forth whatever watching kids play it does not really matter the the idea is that you want to use the visual system regularly for what it was designed for in smooth pursuit is a great way to keep the visual and motion tracking systems of the brain an the eye in the dextrocular muscles working in really nice coordinate fashion i would say five to ten minutes three times a week will be great if you care about your vision you can train your vision in this way the other one is to train accommodation there are lot of videos out there i won to be clear on the internet some of which a are from cognition of which are not some of which are from scientist some of which are from other sources talking about things you can do to make your vision better to improve your vision most of those are gear toward improving the dextrocular my muscles but i did consult with our chair of opthemology at stamford school of medicine eff gilbert who's an empty enipihty a phenomenal scientists an a phenomenal cognition and intently a phenomenal chairman as well about what sorts of things tools are actually beneficial for pattern vision in sight because there is just much out there on the internet a not all of which is accurate or good frankly and he agreed that a smooth pursuit stimulus that kind of training as well as or exercise as well as near far spending a few minutes you might even just do this for two minutes of looking at something up close that is gong to activate these accommodation mechanisms and then moving it at arms length and focussing on it for five tend seconds may be more may be a fifteen or twenty seconds then slowly moving it in to a location and then out this is actually a lot the visual training that is done post concussion to train repair actually repair some of the balance and motor and visual and cognitive aspects of the brain and we are going to have a guest on and of future time of that to deal with concussion and some post concussion training a lot of post concussion recovery in training centers around the visual system not just because people are trying to recover their vision and their sense of balance but because as i mention earlier the brains ability to make sense of its environment and the brains ability to parts time not just on the day night schedule but also shorter time intervals follows the visual system something will turn to a little bit more at the end what does this mean the tool is spend two to three minutes doing smooth pursuit there some programs on you to u you can just look up smooth pursuit stimulus and all providing to to a couple i as well you could do this with a pen if you wanted you could do this ah some one else could hold a wand and you count o that if you gets me they can do that for you practise accommodation for a few minutes may be every other day just bringing something in close you will feel the strain of your eyes doing that i can feel right now move it out you will feel a relaxation point move it pass that relaxation point where you will have to do what is call the vengeance give movement to maintain focus on that location as it moves out bring it back in at the point where you actually have to go crossed this will differ for different people depending on how far apart your eyes are called interpupilaery distance for me i have been teased before i eve a very short interpupilary distance ism not a cyclops but ism headed there some people are more allied a flounder well depending on your interpupilary distance the point at which things get blurry and crossed will very but for me as i get about hash yes is about six incurs from my nose it is really hard i cannot accommodate any longer i move it out another inch in everything in nice focus try and see whether not you can get things closer now you do not want to get crossed remember what your parents told you or my parents told me that if you cross your eyes when your young that they can stay that way ashy they will not near stay that way but your brain can start losing information and the ability to see binocular depth something will talk about in a moment but for now the protocol would be youtotwo to three may be five minutes just practise that practise accommodation and then be sure to give your eyes some rest get outside look at a horizon or do nothing just cone to let your eyes go soft this what the bogies would call soft gas just cone relax your eyelids not this not eyes close just relax panoramic vision try and see the walls around you without moving your head exercise your eye muscles exercise the accommodation mechanisms of your eyes practise ill bit of smooth pursuit you do not have to be faradic about this but you if you do this often enough meaning every other day every third day or you can be the strange person on the plain or in the class from doing this that people might chuckle or look at you funny or or tease you but that is soave because a you will be able to see when they are unloving their vision as you will get the last laugh please do not laugh at them but maybe you can help them at that point you can hold the pen for them it is worth doing it is really worth preserving your vision and again if you are a young person this is great because then you can actually build an extra strong visual system using all the tools that were describing i do want to talk about a new set of findings that are related to red light and offsetting age related macula degeneration their lot of ways in which our visual system gets worse over time but one is called age related macula degeneration lend geffrey at the university college onion somebody have known for decades as a because he is a scientist a is done beautiful work on development and function the visual system has publish a number of papers recently a one that got a particularly a high amount of attention in the press was one that showed that flashing red light into the eyes early in the day not late in the day early in the day a can help offset some age related macula regeneration presumably by enhancing the mite conceal function in the photoreceptor there does seem to be some evidence for that although it still early days i want emphasize you do not want to shine really bright lights into your eyes you never want a look at any light that bright that it is painful and you never want o force your eyelids to stay open if you need to close your eyes in order to be comfortable within chances are that light is too bright but doing just a coupleminutes to day two minutes a day of flashing this red light into one eye and then the other as long as it was early in the day before noontime and as long as it was in individuals that were forty years or older did seem to have a significant effect in offsetting some of the age related macula degeneration that would otherwise occur again these are early findings if you want to do this please be careful please talk your optometrist an and or opthemologist your eyesight is precious you soft want to damage it but it is interesting and it does seem red light can improve the function of the mitochondria these photoreceptor hawalitomotic mitochondria the energy producing a organelle within the cells because they are some of the most metabolically active cells in your entire body your photoreceptor your active all the time as yore looking round and even when your eyes are closed their active in fact through a weir twist of the biology and please look this up if your really interest in this your photoreceptor a actually most active in the dark is a weird it is a twist of a biology the way the system a arranged that when light comes on they shut off their activity actually weather not you see something in front of you this pen or my face is because the ways your photoreceptor are turning off not turning on it is a really cool twist and i no onto too far down that rabbit hole a but check it out a if your interest in howphotoreceptors work its an absolutely incredible literature a just mogul excuse me look up on the web we are not partial just to goal i happen use fugal but a use your webbrowser to look up a photoreceptor hyperopolarization sight and you can learn a lot about that if you're real nerve for the stuff i am oke red light to the eye can perhaps it seems a help maintain vision doing smooth pursued exercises an accommodation near far exercises some people suffer from poor eyesight simply because their eyes get dry there are incredible believe it or not lubricating mechanisms for the eye not just tears but thin sheet of oil it is just amazing unless you have some sort of cornealabrasion the corneas the clear stuff on the outside your my cordial b abrasion when you blink it is smooth you do not feel it it is just really really smooth and yet if you ever had a corneal scratch have had this its really rough it is painful you have a ton of pain receptors in the cornea the lubrication of the cornea is supported eye blinking and while it seems a little silly some people actually benefit from doing you noisome you don't five or ten or fifteen seconds of blinking and then doing their focus work some people their eyes are drying out because as we focus if we are trying to do something our eyelids stay open the eyes can dry out but it also can make it such that when we blink the next time there is a kind of a need to focus because there is some distortions in the in these oils and liquids a across the cordial surface if your somebody who suffers from dry i do hope they will find a a treatment ore a cure for dry eye soon there is not one at present some one stands to make a lot of money out there if you can find a cure for dry my let the companies know or start a company rag now it is still a mystery as to how to do that but blinking for five fifteen seconds probably slowly not as quickly as ism doing here on video but jusseena may be a bank every a second or two fifteen seconds can lubricate the eyes and that is ism not directly relate to anything curl is just going allow the optics of your eye to be clear just when the screen of your phone gets dirty when costal is testing on my phone and i pick it up is covered with much to clean it off an order to see things clearly the same thing is happening for these optical devices on the front of your brain remember these are brain ski lot of protocols to day almost all of them behavioral protocols i do want to talk a little bit more about vision and how it works internally and then i also want to talk about some of the foods and supplements that have been shown to support vision and offset visual loss and maybeven reverse some visual loss let us talk about binocular vision and lazy eye ism very familiar with lazy eye because when i was a kid i went swimming one day one day and i did not at my goggles and something must have been happening as i recall with the eye moving down through the water have always had this problem that i can only do the free style stroke off to one side the people i women are always laughing somehow i i cot a move toward drowning when i try and breathe on the right side i think there some a symmetry in the way o organized anyway i was off to my left and my eye kept going in and out the water and there's cloreene in the water and was making in comfortable i just close my eye i desideto yo new more or less had to swim straight is ah might a e bounced off the landlines a few times but i just use the other iced o consider for that mark on the wall got out of pool o shower dry it off and then completely lost by ocular vision for three days completely the young brain up until about age seven but maybe even extending out until about age twelve is extremely vulnerable to difference is in ocular input between the two eyes my scientific great grandparents won the nobody prize for discovering call critical periods periods of time in which the brain is more plastic more able to change those two guides avid hail turns an was thank you avid and torsion forever change the face of visual i since and forever change the way we think about treatment of the young brain it used to be thought the you would not want to do a surgery on a young kid because of risk of vanisesiand young individuals but we now know that you need to repair these imbalances that even a few hours i don't want scare anybody it'll talk about reversal but a few hours of a clouding one eye early in like can lead to permanent unless something is done permanent changes in the way that the brain perceives the outside world such that when that eye is opened up again the brain actually cannot make sense of anything that is coming through it it shuts down that visual pathway somehow what happen to me was actually was my eye was fine i got out of pool i open my eye but i could not see through that eye everything was blurry double vision unless i covered this eye and then i could see perfectly fine fortunately went you an upthemalgust who under stood the literature thank you doctor marked leery who understood the literature and made it clear that what i needed to do was to a clue the other eye the eye that was working very well clearly he understood the work of feu bone weasel now again you do not want to start playing games with this kinofstuff when you are a kid if you wear let say you have a hallowed costume and you wear and my patch our a pirate or something for hallowed and you cover end up on one side probably for the night of hallowing its oke i do not recommend doing that recreational if you do not need that if you're a young child or for your child to do that because indeed you creating balances in the brain machinery the compares information coming in through the two eyes and it can shut down the neral information for the excluded the closed eye now i was able to reverse this issue but my binocular vision has never been terrific i much better at the dartboard and still not very good if i close one eye i much better at the pool table if i closes one eye and i still in terrible i was the kid an i know in in the outfield you the balls coming towards me the balls coming toward dow to catch the balling a hip me square in the in the with i my binocular vision is not great as a consequence of this early event and i have a hard time with those a binocular stereo grams those images that are kind of useless to look at them and then the binocular depth image pops out all the other kids are going there is the whatever the statue liberty there's the aerial i see i see dots is i have binocular vision but i use other cues i use the near far cues that i talked about before motion parallax the fact that things are closer n we are moving faster than things further away in order to judge depth and years later when i got involved in and i do not suggestive for most people m i got invaldan boxing a marshal archon was younger you u sometimes will see riders this is a slip to avoid getting punch it is also generating motion parallax many aim old judge depth by moving their head not by using other mechanisms of accommodation i a a lot of birds and monkeys and animals will judge depth by moving their head this or they will move from side to side animals that will undulate sometimes are actually doing a depth measurement because as you move from side to side the brain is able to do the math of depth what is this all mean in terms of protocols if you're a young person do your best to get really good binocular vision not just at level of your phone ore your tablet but also at distance you will build strong binocular visual machinery in the brain and at the level of the eyes in the eye musculature now if your somebody who did have an exclusion what needed is to cover up the other eye to create in balance that the weak eye the called lazy eye the sometimes refer to his amblyopia that i has to work harder for me they patched this other eye and made this we a venshi got vision through that give act than they open them both up now you might ask what happens if you cover both eyes early in life and this where it gets interesting you might think while covering one eye leads to poor vision for that i after that eye is open covering both eyes probably make you blind right actually that is not what happens what doubloon veal discovered in what is been affirmed many many more times over in subsequent studies is that it is compete give that the two eyes are competing for real estate up in the brain if you actually cover both eyes you actually extend the period of the critical of critical plasticity this is a really interesting aspect that other people are starting to leverage snowman termsthat had a reopen plasticity later in life but please do not you now go round with your eyes covered for two long there are some retreats and stuff wore people going to caves with absolute no vision i creates hallucinations will talk about why that is in just a moment but here is my suggestion trying get balanced visual in put through the two eyes almost everybody has a dominant eye it usually does not relate to your dominant hand although it can and for me if i cover up my right eye i see much less well much more poorly it is a little bit fuzzy and have to work harder in order to see the camera for instance than if i cover up my left eye it is shall really easy for me to relax i have a dominant eye yet you can balance that out by covering up the dominant eyelid obit each day but i would warn any young people meaning ah you twelve or younger against creating these in balances if there is is not a clinical need to do that and if you do have strong in balances between the to eyes which can be caused bye cataract and lends issues can be i cause by nor muscular issues et camera to try and get those dealt with as early as possible by contacting a really good opthemologis an ideally a our opthemologis it is very normal i should say it is very common for young children babies to have an eye that a with strabismus that either deviates out or that deviates in it is important to correct that if you would to have balanced vision between the two eyes and for the brain to respond i equally to the two eyes in to have a i would say high fidelity quality vision although some people who have a a eye that drifts can function normally in life you have an opportunity early in life to rescue that i will not well maybe i will do this but i can actually relax this we it weak in some cases that it actually can start to deviate how just do this here it is not crossing eye actually can move m i can messaline my eyes because i have to fight very hard to have the musculature for this eye a keep that eye alined with the other we and that is because have been doing my exercises since i was in my twenties cause i notice when i would study a lot this i would start to drift in id start to see double and i wand then next no as just covering the eye up it was getting weaker and weaker just the atrophy of a muscle i went to the doctor what ad they do they did the exact wrong thing the optometrist i went to gave me a prism which adjusted it that i could see things normally was just made the eye weaker and weaker is putting a weak arm in to a sling i had to spend at least three years of ten minutes a day is what i recommend doing near far covering up my good eye doing near far with my bad eye and now it is been about ten twelve years that i have pretty decent by ocular vision now many of you are not dealing with this a or have these early childhood issues some of you might be experiencing challenges with fatigued eyes or what differences in focus with the two eyes these i exercises of near far smooth pursuit and checking for for dominant and nondominant eye can be very beneficial ism again ism not a inclination i do not want to give you protocols are in forced protocols on anybody you need to figure out what is right and safe for you giving your vision history i do recommend talking to a really good opthemologist if you have severe vision problems of any kind or if you want o offset vision problems of any kind and optometrist as well but ideal would be a hurry othemologist o get i did mention hallucinations and a their fun to talk about and think about for years people one asked why do people get visual hallucinations hostels in sleep right now you probably her him snoring snoring lad ispreatly having hallucinations about rabbits pies a and a those are mainly his favor the and sleep he is dreaming about sleep in sleep hallucinations are a property of the visual system and it was always thought that hallucinations arise because of overactivation or activation of certain aspects of the visual system i just briefly want a mention a paper that was published by my good friend and phenomenal a scientist and physicists for that matter chriscineal who up at the university of dragon in urine they studied plenty compounds and discovered that hallucinations actually occur because portions of your brain become underactive the visual portions of your brain are under stimulated this is probably why when people go into these cave retreats something have never done a and nothing i ever will do ore it is completely black pretty soon they start hallucinating they start seen things even though there is nothing there the visual system is desperate to make guesses about what is out in the world it is the eager beaver of your brain is what is out there what is out there what is out there even in low to no vision people blind people they are their brain is con be making guesses about what is out there in the auditory world what sounds are there what what a touch sensations are there for sighted folks it is going to be what is out there in terms of light light is the dominant way vision is the dominant way that we evaluate the world around us it turns out that hallucinations are an underactivation of the visual system and then a compensatory a compensation by which the visual system creates activity and hallucinations sphere in the dark long enough you start to hallucinate and see things that is a little note about hallucinations one of the things that you can do to improve your vision and it is also kind of fun is to put a sell in chart in your home a sell in chart is that list of letters or if you go to the dreaded department of motor vehicles i show up for renewal soon love the department of motor vehicles the department of mote or vehicles i have you cover up an eye read the the letters on the chart letters of course get smaller and smaller they turn a figure out roughly what your vision is cover up the other eye you will do that some people including nutty vision scientists me have had sell in charts in their office or in their home up for many years now and you can just practice and you can see how your doing sitting at a particular distance your this is something that is not often mention but your performance on the sell and chart will very depending on time of day because your level of fatigue and your ability to control that accommodation and other mechanisms of the eyemuscles will very you can take it as an average it is also a good thing if your gin to get your vision tested for corrective lenses or or maybe are going to later surge or our something that sort you thinking about any of that to really get it measured by professional the ones that you get in those supermarkets are on or in many eyeglass stores apologies to the eyeglass does are often wrong by an order of magnetic and then when you start putting corrective lenses on that are overcorrecting or under correcting but more often are overcorrecting then you are essentially weakening the system it is putting a prosthetic on a limb that you did not necessarily need or pot or a robot arm when you did not need the use of the robot arm although on now there much excitement about robots i thinkpeople are go me doing that anyway none the less get your vision tested by somebody who really understands vision an opthemologist or really good optometrist if you put a sell in chart in your home you can do that as part of your visual training now this might seem excessively nutty but what is more important than your eyesight right eyesight is vital it is right up there i the movement and our ability to move to generate to get up out of chairs an to walk into run into to take care of ourselves eyesight and movement are the main ways that we are able to take care of ourselves and take care of others when you start having compromise eyesight or compromise movement people need to take care of us and we become much more challenge in moving through our daily life while it might seem nutty to have a sell in chart in your home or to do a smooth pursuit exercise a couple times a week or to get outside for a few hours a day and do your reading your lap top work there preserving your eyesight and preserving your vision is one of the most life enhancing or quality of life enhancing things that you can do and if you are young person and you can build some of this into your framework of exercise or brain training if you want to call at that that can be immensely beneficial will really set you up to have really good vision over a long period of time now of course there genetic factors and there are injury related factors that can compromise eyesight in our ability to see and of course this is the things ism talking about today are not can absolve all those issues but they can have a tremendous positive impact if you are willing to do just a little bit of work and none of this is involving any cost rises just time cost i want i do want to talk about a few other things that can a perhaps improve vision i want o dispel a few myths about stuff to take to improve vision and then i want to just clothes by talking about how we perceive time using are vision because that will nicely set the stage for what we are going to talk about next episode now you understand a lot about the biology of vision you understand that light has to arrive at the return and get converted into electrical signals that process requires things vidomanee a fat soluble violent it requires things the corratinoids that metabolic cascade that bout chemical cascade is essential for vision and this is why you have been told that carrots help you see better does the high invitomanee there are few simple things you can do to support your vision first of all it is true that eating vegetables the dark leafy vegetables and things carrots that have vidomanee in abundance and eating them in close to their raw form naturally occurring foods that contain a lot of videmanee in there raw form can help support vision now does that mean that if you invest superphysiological amounts of that stuff that its can make your vision that much better no but you do need a threshold level of videmanee in order to see and into order to see well now there is a lot of excitement nowadays about supplementation to help support the health of the visual system and i am somebody whose pretty open to novel forms of supplementation you portly gather that if you have been losing this podcast for a while have to determine what safe and economical and ripe for you what your risk tolerances et camera but i want to talk about a molecule that in a lot of supplements to support vision and there are some really god data on and that is lupine now the study i want describe is actually published in twenty sixteen it is from the journal of opthemology its its a good journal and the title of this paper is a might catch your attention it is increased macula pigment optical density that us means that the macula is an an airy of the i for central vision for highacuity vision a pitman density there is good you want pigment there increased macula pigment optical density and visualacuity visualcuity is durability o see things in fin detail fallowing consumption of a buttermilk drink containing routine enriched beg yokes remember raw foots routine enrich beg yokes something rock move or he would drink the real raw yokes a randomized double blind placebo controlled trial now ism not suggesting go out and eat raw beg yous there is the risk of salmanila although i did hear this some one crept me from on that the salmanila is actually on the outside of the egg not actually in the egg itself it is on the shell for a reasons that relate to how that egg got into the world am that is where the salmanila lives but a i could be wrong about that but ran yokes are not something that most people want a consume what is this routine stuff what routine is in the pathway that relates to vitamin a and the formation of the open the photopigment that captures light in the back my literally absorbs light pigment in your eye and converts that into electrical signals and allows you to see and there is some evidence i spoke to our chair of opthemology there is some evidence through quality served studies that supplementing with routine can help offset some of the detrimental effects of age related macula degeneration but i want emphasize but realize however only for individuals with moderate to severe macula degeneration for people that have normal vision or with a just a low degree of macula degeneration these studies did not see a significant improvement of vision from supplementing with routine ism not on to tell you to supplement with routine or not i do not think any study is wholly but it does seem that if you have moderate to severe macula degeneration talk your physician of course top toyouropthemologists it'll always say that and it'll say at three times supplementing with lupine could perhaps support vision and offset some is loss in that case probably also talk to your opthemologist or consider the red light therapy that is talk ked about earlier whereas if you have normal vision or a lo amount of maculate degeneration it does not seem at least from these studies that lupine how much of an effect now i know an i confess ism sort of of the mind that if i personally had a relay immaculate degeneration or propensity for it in my family which fortunate i do not but in that case i would think that supplementing with lupine provided it safe could perhaps be of benefiting my one o consider a low dose of that again ism not pushing any of this on anybody a by any means but you should know that under certain conditions of severe macula degeneration or moderate macula degeneration it does seem lupine can be beneficial it does not have to be consumed through raw beg yokes although that is the highest density source cooking the egg cooking your eggs if you your scramble legs dry or you your eggs a not a was over whatever not runny then you are not going to get the benefits of the lupine there are other sources of lupine non animal sources of lupine as well you can look those up on the internet now there are other compounds that have been shown to perhaps be important for offsetting or helping different forms of vision lost one is man a spell his out i d b n on in depone in de pennon in de xenon i can never pronounce these compounds forgive me am unless have worked with them a there is evidence that it can be beneficial for lepers congenital i disease a i would defiantly go on to examined to come put in i d b n ani and for things lepers optical a optic neropathies which is a deserter of condition of the eye whether or not people should just be taking the stuff anyway is still an open question there are not a lot of studies about it a lot of people that are interested in taking things to support their vision are taking lupine as a preventative measure i do not pass any judgement one we or the other typically those supplements also include the z axithins and the waste axons oka the pronunciation this is is terrible ism sure but that is not too far off but basically z e a x a n t h i n n see wides are pronounce z a x a n t h i n and the other one is a s t a x a n t h i n both of these have been shown excuse me both of these have been shown to offset some of the disruption in vision that occurs with avion what is stay axon s really interesting compound it is the red pink pigment found in various sea foods some shrimp ism not a big seafood fan but but certain fish the you will see the fish market will have that red pink pigment and its also in the feathers of flamingos please do not eat the feathers of flamingos and please also do not eat flamingoes it structure similar to bate a serotine it is very prprovidemane but it has some chemical differences which may make it safer than videmone remember videmone is a lipid soluble sidemen it can be stored in our body for long periods of time what is the deal with this ashcan end what are its drawbacks well we can go to our ever favor examined to come what is it do well it has a number of different effects a huge number in fact but it does seem to notably increase it is now been shown in three studies the antioxidant endrin profile it has a number different effects but the most notable for sake of this episode is the one on ocular blood flow it does seem to increase the amount of ocular blood flows tat the blood supply to the eyes that makes an interesting compound as number of other effects for whatever reason it also has a notable effect several studies have showiness on fertility in males it seems to at least double the pregnancy rate a when men take astaxantan am and works is in particular it seems here in men that were previously in fertile it i do not now if that has something do with the blood flow to the eyes probably not probably have something and with something unrelated to the eyes none the less that is an effect of this molecule it is also been shown to have plosive effects on things skin elasticities skin moisture skinquality et camera probably due to its effects on blood flow lupine beacon it has t e axe and t e gin and for people who have concerns about lepers of optineropties which is the on t be small percentage of people out there but that is a pretty severe condition there are supplements that are available out there i do encourage you as always to tablature opthomologist and physician about them and i will say that there are number of people that take lupine and some of these other things as a precautionary measure at in order to bolster their health in the same way that some people take vitamins and minerals to bolster their help and some people are very health souse me and some people are very of verse to take incitements and minerals was they feel they can get all that from healthy whole foods and of course you can get these things from from whole foods the question is whether not you can get them in concentrations that are sufficient i do think that in the years to come we are going to see more about routine i am i think we are going to see more about some of these other compounds astaxacxan and hopefully by then it'll behalf to pronounce it but at present these things are more or less in the kind of experimental or self experimental phase there are some good double blind possible control studies the ego buttermilk study of of all things published and really good journals journal of opthemology journal a investigative entomology and vision sciences the see are these are good journals these are journals there pure reviewed by experts am the study that i mention earlier about keeping rooms dark ah that was also publish in excellent journal i think it was mama it'll go back and look as it is not my screen any longer but am very easy to finding there been some follow up studies as well from the universe pennsylvania and other a universities everything i have talked about to day relates to studies that were done and published in quality pure review journals that does not nessarely mean you ane run out and are taking the stuff that have described or even doing the protocols have described have given you an array a plait a buffet if you will of things that you could you to try and enhance or support your vision depending on how good your vision is your a family history a vision and vision loss your occupational hazards people that work with a metal filings that are flying out of machines are going to have a higher a degree of of vision am rest to their visual system then will people who just do office work although if you are doing a lot of office work chances are you are not getting a lot of long view vision your commotion mechanisms are going to start to suffer over time i think we can reliably predict that some tried to give you an array of behavioral tools and we did touch upon some supplementation tools i be emissive i did not say that because blood flow is critical for the neurons of the eye remember the o the most metabolically active sells in your entire body the sells within your retina because blood flow is required to get them the energy in neutrons they need having a healthy cartoon vascular system right doing endurance work doing straight training work regularly is going to support your eyes in your brain in your vision it is indirect but it is essential right it is necessary but it is not can to be sufficient you are on to have to do other things to support your eyesight as well but having a healthy party of vascular system because it is going to deliver blood and oxygen and restraints to this incredible apart on the front of your face two pieces of brain is going to support your over all brain health and vision over time early in the pod cast i talked about how the optimal window for learning is ninety minutes that is the called all trade in cycle for learning that is why we held our episodes to about ninety minutes there now starting to extend into the hour in fifty minute into hour mark that simply reflects my enthusiasm and excitement about these topics and my desire to give you as much information as i possibly can in each episode please remember you do not have to listen to the whole episode all at once everything is time stamped everything is caption in english and punish the captions take a few days on you to we apologized for that but in order to have them done correctly it takes a few days after it is posted ah if you need those captions please check back maybe twenty four or forty eight hours after the episodes are released if you are enjoying this pod cast and the information you are finding a beneficial there couple things ha you can do that are totally zero costs that really help us and help you get this information going forward one is if you do not already subscribed on you to please do subscribe we really s episodes every money and hopefully soon more often than that shorter episodes as well but every money we release an episode please do subscribe if you do not already subscribe on apple and notify that is very beneficial please do that that helps us as well if you can give us the five star review on apple if you feel that that's what we deserve and apply also gives you the opportunity to give us comments feed back about the episodes if you have suggestions about episodes feed back of any kind please put it in the comment section on future routinely throughout the week after the release of each episode i cover content in shorter form and in more depth on histogram at superman lap every episode is also indexed and reachable in the search function on our website superman labor calm that is also where we post lynx to various studies and down laudable protocols allegro cost and as i mention you can search for different topics and will bring you to the particular episodes that contain the information on those topics as well if you to support us please check out our sponsors the sponsors that we discuss at the beginning of the podcast are vital way to keep the information being distributed at zero cost to everybody we only work with sponsors that we really love their products and that we really respect the people that were working with there and of course heres no obligation to purchase or to even check out the sponsors but if yourein a position to do that really does help us and as mentioned the beginning of to day's episode we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they make single ingredient formulations that are the absolute highest quality and ship international if you go to live momentous took calm slash supermen you will find many of the supplements that have been discussed on various episodes of the superman lab podcast and you will find various protocols related to those supplements and last but not least i want to thank you for your time and attention to day your willingness to learn about vision and the visual system and the various things that you can do to help support the health and functioning of your visual system and of course i want to thank you for your reticence

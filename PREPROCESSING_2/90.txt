suicide is immoral it seems strange you have to say that but there seem to be a lot of people in the west these days who believe that suicide is somehow morally obligatory according to these moral geniuses when a man comes into your house rapes your wife urn some of your children and obduce t others you have some are of moral obligation to leave him be long as he hides behind his own family members after all you are morally superior to that man and that what matters your feeling that you are not him never mind the you are not him you did not invade his house or kill him or rappen murder his wife and some of his kids and kidnap others never mind that you are trying to stop him from doing the same thing again and trying to prevent others from following in his footsteps if you hurt any one he puts in harm's way while you are attempting to stop him you are him never mind that he will repeat his actions if he is glad to escape never mind he is vowed to repeat his actions until you pandour family are exterminated never mind that kindness to the cruel is cruelty to the kind that if you let this guy go others will follow his example and more innocent people will die you must insure that he has access to electricity an water you must protect his life in order to prevent harm to the family he uses is human child you must give him every advantage because he is evil in fact work he less evil were he not to hide behind his own family members for example then you would have free ran to kill him but since he is evil well then the only thing to do is throw up your hands and walk away insentivizing those him to pursue his insanely evil tactics now if the sound idiotic that is because it is it is moral idiocy of the highest order it incentivize his evil it creates evil it means that the most evil evil will pursue the most evil tactics all in order to prevent you from protecting yourself and yet there are those who proclaim it from our nations most sophisticated ivory towers they would never live by such rules they live ingate communities far from the consequences of their own foolishness they never feel the consequences of the perverse morality they promote these are the same people who promote defending the police and open borders while living in gated communities but of course they are calling for their own suicide they are calling for yours you are supposed to let in millions of refugees most of whom are likely to hate america values you are supposed to leave them in power to pursue this next atrocities where they rule after all those people are members of their coalition of the supposedly de colonized dispossessed they are evil is merely a symptom of your evil what they believe and what they do that is your fault the only solution is for you to commit suicide if you refuse you are just as bad as they are and if you do not you are dead you are choice or at least that is the choice they would you to make but there is in fact another choice to reject that disgusting construct wholesale to point out that genocidal murderers do not get a free hand just because they hide behind members of their own family to stand strong in the face of calls to honey comb our own society with pro genocide members or there untended compatriots yes of course those of moral bent ought to work toxin my civilian casualties yes of course those of moral bent ought to work to find a place for civilians to escape from the line of fire but neither of those rules can be prioritized above the first rule of war winning war is ugly by nature nearly the ugliest thing as it turns out there is only one thing uglier loosing to those who do not care about morality or decency at all those who use morality and decency against those who are actually moral and decent an who care about things civilian casualties anybody who advocates four such defeat those who encourage suicide in the faces evil is complicit in that evil we know who does understand this america america by nature understand this because they understand what it s to face down evil done up before here in the united states and what we understand is that the group that murdered thirteen hundred people and the is now taken two hundred hostages their a hundred ninety nine families they been notified that they have om hostages remembers their family who've ben kidnapped in gossip the america people overwhelmingly across all political parties believe that israel military response is justified seventy one per cents of america believe that it is justified only eight per ends say it is not justified twenty one per cent say not sure and that holds true across virtually every demographic it is it is least true among people eighteen to thirty four a of course overwhelmingly on the left an who have some set to have serious promise of moral relativism fifty seven per cents of those eighteen to thirty four in the united states believe that israel is justified in its actions fourteen per cent believe not at all justified some twenty nine per cent say they are not sure and the older you get effectively speaking the more people actually have some moral clarity on this particular issue but as far as political break down sixty nine percent of democrats say that israel action is fully justified seventy seven per cents of republican say that it is fully justified in fact the the group that is least likely to think that that things are justified are independence and even they by a two thirds majority believe that it is justified only ten per cent say it is not at all justified a lot people are saying they are not sure because the easiest way to get off easy in any moral conversation is to pretend that you do not know the answer to the question when everybody knows the answer to the question which of course is that you have to try to minimize civilian casualties if you are israel beef to try to make sure that as few innocent people die as possible and also that every ounce of blood that is being building goa right now is not on israel hands it is on compasses hands every one understands that is except for the elite except for the clean our society they listen our society media elite professors on compasses our intellectual luminaries some of our congress people they refuse to understand this sort of thing they are the advocates for cultural suicide they're the advocates for the west to simply shoot itself in the head in order to avoid the natural consequences of ugly war again remember the entire rules of war were written in order to disincentives the kind of activity the compasses currently engaging in the entire purpose of having laws of war is to prevent commons from hiding behind millions and yet the same people hare now claiming tat israel violating international law by jargon and commons are actually incentives and commons to put kids in front of their guns that is the that is the actual effect if you say to people that murdered jaws in south israel plus hide behind your own kids means you get offs got free what are you incentivizing people to do hide behind their kids if anything the world should be incentivizing the hunting down of compass specifically because they hide behind their own kids because otherwise every ones on to hide behind their own kids that told cents of structure's work and just one second we will get to the elect who seem completely unable they are paralyzed by their own moral relatives we will gets that momentarily first last week pure talk announce they are going to alleviate ten million dollars in veterans at by veteran's day and they will get there by giving a portion of every new order to this cause because of your support they are already twenty seven per cent to their gold with three weeks to go our veterans gave everything to protect the nation pure take understands the sacrifices that they have made whenyou switch to pure rocks lightening fast fie

offering a limited talk text more data andimoble hope just go to pure paletot am slash paper and make the switch over what is nice is the can also be helping veterans while you get better phone coverage very i use pure talk for all of my phone calls you should do the same and when you do you are hoping out veterans let us rally together an share on wavering support for our veterans is it pure talk dot come slash appuro switch to pure talk to day it is the right move it is the america way again had on over to pure talk dot come slash appuro switch on over to pure talk today they're lanstart just twenty bucks month offering an limited talk ten more data plus that mobile hotspot n i to their network is great go check out right now pure talk dot come slash thiourea case as i say our moral exemplars our moral let they are completely disconnected from the america people and from reality and they break down into basically to categories one are the stupid and to are the are the cynical procomas and they are not the same category me not going to suggest for example that pet davidson on spinal is trachomas he is not he is just ta typical hollywit idiot and he is somebody who's reverted to all situations are the same all morality is the same i cannot take sides your i cant i cannot now let us be real bothers every one should be morning right now civilians murdered in israel for the crime of being hues and members of the killing population and gosh we are murdered biomass o say it is a compass murder when you hide a child in front of your guns while you shoot other people and the child times in the cross fire that is your problem when i say your problem men your moral profits everybody's proper it is your fault commit the the goal among our let again for for those who are who consider themselves morally sophisticated what is amazing is how unable they are to make actual moral distinctions basic moral distinctions between the murdered and the people wore attempting to defend themselves lhat'swhat you got on spinal and you saw many many people in the in the twittervers the moral relatives immediately hall is not this nice is not the sins cause every one is it'll get what let us be real about this your moral apathy and that what an amounts to sympathy that is equally distributed between comas in israel amounts to a moral apathy is effective for comas at compass would is for you o be morally apathetic about he situation and for you too for you to basely thru your hands they too complicated do not know gave tits is not particularly complicated the side that murders babies in their bad for the crime of being babies that is the bad guys the fact that i canal has to do this sort of hands off it while comedy will sit again bookable if if your looking the people for any sort of moral guidance you to are fool here was pet davidson on assail both siding this thing this week we saw the horrible image is i try for israel and open and i know we taking who better common omit than pe baits well in a cutaways i am a good person to talk about it because when i sevens o i my a was killed it a derris i a i know something about what that is i saw many terrible pictures is we o o suffering has rally satin hows tit some when pet davidsons statement on this thing is basically suffering is bad yet we were we are in agreement we are in agreement but suffering is bad has not a moral message and unfortunately that is the side that is taken up by many of our moral sophisticates we're seeing that from again pe graviton is not is not a bad person for saying what he is saying ism not suggesting he is pro compass or anything for somewhat my saying he is not whet ism saying is that when the the folks of what obviously is a moral conflict becomes not the actual moral conflict between one side the it is evil and once had that wishes to preserve its own citizenry and instead becomes all suffering is is from the same source and thus if we could just make the suffering stop to for by snapping our fingers leaving commission place to murder babies that be fine that is where this is going and we can all see that it is going in that direction from it from our moral elevates and the your times is doing the same thing their tempts as a long editorial that really struggles to explain why israel should basically leave commas place they have an entire article tiled israel can defend itself and uphold it is values it is amazing how that they never suggest that the palsinians ought to uphold basic human values in this particular conflict no it is about it it is about israel obviously and they admit that israel is is working to men my smiling casualties will get to that in a second but instead of just recognizing the reality instead they say the united states his offered firm support for israel in its our of agony but friendship also requires speaking hard truths to israel to israel on t you're times if to speak our truths to israel ism what israel the country that just got head wit the worst terror attack in the west since nine eleven and proportionately something the happen much worse the nitaleven but it but you are now saying that america each you pressure israel why because in counseling restraint united states can point to lessons of it is own reason pastry i love i love the counseling for restraint after am after babies are murdered and then taken and and survivors i are then bust away to posit to be held in the abject terror before the murdered bahamas that is the your times again the moral sophisticates the moralsphistics you say that you now for your own morality you have to basically you've to ease off yet to ease off obviously that is not moral sophistication its it is moral foolishness and then of course you've the most obviously stupid people sonny host writes a sunny sunny host of course did the israel is doing war cross routine which is just pathetic an she she is she is a pathetic specimen of o immorality on virtually every scale here she is but i do think that what we nan to remember is that there is an international human rights body of law and when you look at that law part of it is really and against in a sent civilians collectively is also terror and is also a war crime and again those are not my words those are the words of the law and the president of the iropain commission are's not our of lonely and tat just last were when we were all talking about you crane she sat rushes attacks against civilian infrastructure especially electricity are war crimes cutting off men women children of water electricity and meeting with winter coming these are acts of our terror and we have to call it at such and what ism saying is gas i think those that are round the the alar countries is real actually bound the only exit out of palatine to egypt that is not true israel do not become the prof crossing egypt has closed the off a crossing but sunny poison is and idiots o she is immediately shifting into israel is the real problem in the region mode and again ism n i soft know which category put sonnyhosstonn but the attempt to draw moral parity between the people who kill children and t people who a attempting to avoid killing children but cannot avoid killing children if the bag gets are hiding behind children that that is absurd a means on poison wisdom put her in the idiot category mainly because she also says things compass is just the proud boys which listen ism not a fan of the proudboys but i notice that the proud boys ire not going around slaughtering babies in their cribs i notice that the sunny cousin is up again ta the fact that that there is this class of people hare considered i part of the political conversation i it is amazing to me remains to making to me to ay not say some no i just i i look at this familial prospective and i think that we all know that hamate designated a reorganization just many other perorations have this designation the proud boys here in the united states amazing amazing a mean she is she is yes the these these political geniuses o gave armet that is that is the stupid that is the morally idiot and the moraladiat idiotic and the second one going it's he morally central the people who full well know the moral calculus here but who are going to use decency and morality in order to preserve commons that would involve members of the squad gets that momentarily first as a daily where listener you are not just informed you are obviously engaged as wheel due value freedom in personal responsibility

a comes to those who are advocating for western to hits idea because the same people by the way who are arguing that israel should basically go hands off with compass because yours to preserve your on false o the same people would argue the something about america i'llgive hem that credit those break down in two groups the people who are just morally and bevelings ah or who seek to obscure the moral calculus and then there people who actively side with the terrace and that of course would be people to c and than oar they spent the we and distributing actual is in formation ow one o teething that been amazing to watch on sitter is the creation of false narrative in real time it is been amazing to each i know because it is happen to me i put out an actual picture of a burn baby from lar aka and it was immediately by advocates forcomass an their idiot allies it was immediately labeled false information and was sun tested that it was ai generated which it was not and a community note was attached to that tweet which they then promptly grab and then blasted around the internet to suggest that i was falsifying atrocities meanwhile to see and illhan oar for actively promoting false information for example early of this week as he said the level of is information in all directions in this conflict is incredibly high especially on this platform if you see a claim photo or v idyl that triggers are strong and emotional reaction take a moment to pause and check for veracity or conformation from multiple sources as the first o all that that is that is fine except for the fact that on the rest of the squad then started posting pictures of rooms propaganda than oar reported a picture from another blue checked account the blue checks do not mean anything any more and tat that that account claim that there are six hundred fourteen parson an children murdered by the isralia idea forces and it posted pictures of dead kids the problem is that the image was not from gaze the image was from twenty thirteen of chemical weapons used in sera shows blasting out false information which of course she does not care about that of course of course meanwhile to s continues to blast out the idea that if israel does not immediately give in to mamas and simply stop all operations then that means that israel is to blame for all of this she says humans can only survive with that water for about three days gaze has run dry the blockhead on waterfront electricity's an indiscriminate collective punishment and a crime but can first of all that is not true turning off hate an electricity in military areas is normal state of events that is how things go in a war come ass honeycomb to self in the civilian population as will talk about in a second they are desperately seeking to keep civilians in these areas the reason israel turned off the water in power is to press people down of the south in fact over the week and israel turned on the water and the power down south in gaze why would they do that why the answer is the r trying to draw civilian to the areas where there is water in power by turning off the water and power where they do not want the civilians but according to to s obviously this is quote cruel and in just to save millions of people in azan early halve children it must end it now i noticed o that you are very quick on the trigger lose about ending all of this a the minute that is a the minute that mamas seem they were in serious trouble meanwhile ihanomar says president by an pressuring israel to turn the water back on as a start now we been him to push for electricity and food access to be restored and when the rest of otherworld an calling for an ends the bombardment of gaze i that is om there is that again that that is cynical she knows exactly what she is doing right there and the reason to draw the moral equivalent is because you wish to protect comas if you are ilhanomar ohanamars an actual protairer activist i there there is no bones fat i get going all the way back to en choose writing sympathetic letters to iris to to judges on to half vices recruits a thing she actually did and meanwhile can being you the latest from on the ground and again for all those people electric hereabout millions arms only one side in this conflict tot cares aboutsvillians only one it is not comas and by the way it is not in mater anybody else is pretending to care about civilians while proving u comas begets that in h second first let us talk about window replacement for a second can break ti not window replacement o we for

cam meanwhile right now israel is ovicsly preparing a ground invasion of the gossips trip what they've been doing up till now is knocking down all the buildings that are on top of the tunnels right now they're literally hundreds of bolometers of of tunnels the common is spent twenty years building under the ground all the terrace are living in let with electricity with water with a see they stole all that stuff by the way even the chocolalout the water that israel is not providing to the gocistrip we should rest we should recognize this point that statistically pegging israel was responsible until this latest war for summertime six and ten per cent of all the water and gaze the water shortages and goa are dull software do solely to the governing powering gaze again that oud be commons israel right now is flattening a lot of the buildings they're telling civilians to get out meanwhile commons is literally holding children hostage in these circumstances to over the week en commossrelleast tovidio the sappureis to have been from the day of the actual attack of them carding around jewfish babies nay this is what they are doing es the people israel fighting they don't care about villains in fact they took hostages to prevent their own deaths that is the goal the goal is if you do not back off we are going to till your babies literal babies this is video the commossrellies t get most of the tuff that ism releasing on the shut most of the images thawed been showing for pass couple of lease these a images that are coming from compass they are not usually coming from the idea this is images from commas of them literally carrying around other people's children in the this what they do then their goal is to get civilians killed they want dead civilians it is their thing here is commons again is video they released is us commons picking up a chile they is murder parents got another child on on their lap they have just murdered the the kits parents and the all babies examen to terrastay carolmaher hearing other people sorry s yare secured a my bet obviously that theft forget about the jewfish babies to they are keeping in in hostage situation they are preventing the evacuation of their own people here is a tape of a goa resident can they say palistinean telling an idea office sir how class is literally stopping people from leaving the most militarily relevant areas an the is a phone call begun the idea in intelligence officer from unit five o for and cabala resident in northern goa and ism n a read you what they are saying moon gotten says they're preventing people from leaving the ideafoficers as tell me exactly where it is that they stoppering gowan says those who are here near the ancient somehow they are taking the idea card and the carries we mean the movement comas he says who stopping gadid hosts as compass and he god says yes yes mean comes literally stopping people from not only as comas stopping people from leaving they are literal aerial photos of commons stacking trucks on the highway out of these the areas to brim people from leaving they they actually actively put up a road block to stop this from happening this is an aerial photo that we are showing on the shoright now of commas putting a road blocking place and a line of cars going back hundreds of of leaders of of cars just stacked up on the highway behind that trying the held to get out cause tell told them to a comas blocking it look at look at this they created a traffic sis right on the coast of gozegan assume see the mediterranean right there and there there preventing people from get out and getting out they are actively stopping people from leaving in fact i they are not just doing that they literally apparently struck a convoy of civilians they're own convoy to tempt to stop people from leaving a goring to idea spokes person johnthan corneas is from the times of israel a strike on a convoy of godson's flying to the southern part of the stripe fridge appears to have been a false flag operation carried out by compass he say when your ply lochia think would benefit from those very horrible images of children and civilians who evacuating south and then they're apparently clearly dead who stands the ain from that only one organization chassis media office claim cars carrying flying villains were struck in three places but they then release vision you cannot see any sort of projectile that is sitting the cartage blow up compass apparently is now blowing up their own cars again the idea sending out notices right now on lines to people telling them to get out the is a graphic from the idea showing them telling them to get people out residents of fossa city and northern goa in the pasta's we have urged you to relocate to the southern area f your safety we want to inform you the idea will not carry out any operations along this route from ten as one him our no this window please takgethe opportunity move southward from it northern goa your safety in that of your family's matter please follow our instructions an had southward be assured commossleators of alredyansured their safety and that of their families that of course is absolutely true meanwhile again the s being widely reported this is not a a giant mystery every knows racquets going on here is owner's reporter try links saying that palsinians are actively being prevented from leaving homes the group in control of gaze it is preventing civilians from leaving their homes after the realizes warned them of an i pending strike i also spoke with a civilian in got e city who con fired the an formation the i cignifian ice the source indicated comma is threateninpeople and prevent them from leaving if they try to we to safer location was trade than all of the palistinian people will i why would that be harass gal the ten man fin pee this vans moss calmly brock last weasand we love down they love the lie o and that is why and when we all know the answer o the inion moss on people denied specifically because they're praying on stupid western belief that if civilians die it must be the west fault somehow not the people hiding behind the civilians n or pro test themselves am you you can see then cent of structure here the inscensif structure here is to maxim civilian casualty much that in a a darkly hilarious moments in the middle of this conflict the commas propaganda the arm released a video of a supposed dead person and it was a all it is ha thing that actually happen in that the first time this happened there is video pretty famous video online the can see of palcinians in pass conflicts carrying around structures with suppose dead bodies on them and then there is an airy turn that goes off in the deadbolt gets up in search walking again of course they're tons of peoplewho are being killing gaslight ow of course of course of course this not to deny their suffering or to night of that is happening but it is also to show that is absolutely commands interest to to maximize the depiction of civilian casualties in order to gain world sympathies they can continue to pursue their evil it is there put in the civilians in harm'sway the cividio ya that the shall took this down because they realized too late there was perfectly obvious that one of the figures in the video is actual magical this one the thing that they released is my running into a hospital and you see the cameras following him and ti that is at all you can see that that is not a insist not and thet'th actually cut it and they hae removed it later they cut it removed it later because i it was too obviously not real as again that is onto big that the are not dead kids an got their tons dead kissing gossip that is to point out that it is in the invent of structure for compass to maximize that of course and and of course they want they do not care money cviliansti then building tunnels down there for years in fact here is a flashback twenty twenty one am member of compass speaking to vice and telling them yow we built all the tunnels directly under the civilian in for structure now why would you do that because you want the civilians to die you're hoping that the west in is one benighted version of a morality w we'll not strike it you if you hide behind civilians the fact that your down her in tunnels thrave been built undesivilan arms longing rockets fromsivilian arias as well does not not mean that you will endangering passing it the came to be finding for we are purifying ourselves than her times and and everything we do and od as to in so a better fou sumo children but you also not sacrificing the teiansta diretibati course we do want then to get killed or to get cedar but this is the old noise we have this about we can do and they are supporting us you cannot go to the see you can go to the ear an o t anywhere that is why we are building tunes this is the only mean which is bugle for for osempiges i cane now i you to knot his statement there they are supporting us they are supporting us this villain population is an ugly truth a huge percentage of the population of gosh supports comas a huge percentage of the palistinian population in judansmaria supports comes that is just a reality i know it is ugly and i know that we again we love to tell ourselves these pretty stories in the west about how whenever there is a in evil resume anna on earth that has no popular support from the population sometimes that is true and a lot of time it really is not true a lot the time at there is widespread support fort tears i get again that does not mean they deserve to die civilians it does mean that if you are talking about things should a maria take in refugees you might want a consider who it is the your taking in again the gat between the elites on this particular issue and the people is stunning the vasmajority people in less not interested in taking in vast populations that actively support comas or are sympathetic to humans or or antiseptic in the extreme which by every pole the palisingian population patictling the gosistrip is as it again doesn't mean that we should get tat the west or israel or never should not bename feeling casualties does mean that before you decide who you want living next story you might one to know we it is living extort you merely of rumal bowmen again tires what progressives do eve gumball bowmen who is now suggesting that perhaps the united states should take in gossip refuge es he said quote fifty per cent the population in goa our children the international community is wells the united states should be prepared to welcome refuge es from palestine while being very careful to that and not allow members of comas good luck with that good luck with that rondisantus was asked about this over the weekend and and he was to no which is be correct answer how can you paint with such a broad dosh to say two point three million people a antistatic for first of all a myths is very clear a those gas refuges clean a should go to arab countries the you es should not be absorbing of any of those i think the culture vet lek the compass let just be clear about that not every one's a member comas most probably art but they did a we tomb there is a lot of celebrating of those attacks ism in the gods of strip a by by but of those folks who were a o was but if you look at their education says the this has been an issue for a long time they teach kids to hate news the ten folks do not have israel even on the man i they prepare very young kids a to commit terror the tacks i think its the comic culture and i think if we were to import large numbers of those to the edited state i think it would increase anti sanitize in this country and i think old increase anthem america as a man's country by the way that is obviously true but every word of what he has signers obviously trough in fact i can show you exactly the educational materials that tend to be shown to palisonian kids this for example these are cartons from palistonian television and a you may notice the presents of a figure who looks an all police thinking mouses so be far full mouse who is encouraging small palisonian children to murder news a here's your some clips from palisonian testy again directed at small children say you wonder how it is that you have a bunch of very young men who are seeking to kill jewfish babies no cribs the answerers there en indoctrinated from the time that they are babies in this idea because this is a commas is sick the placing authority is a sick organization is loach hot is sick a here again this is out education goes in the palistonian areas an these a mouse or its actualize meaning roan i want you to u pastonean when the news come to take it and throw it there is a cartoon a a a small palisonian child shooting at the a shooting at the news and a dropping jewfish stars on the these are carton characters an dropping jewfish stars on these really soldiers this is another children carton o it'll support our brothers an gosh and destroy the news these are all animated shows for obviously small

not import lots of these refugees maybe it is cause of back maybe it is because of that and again it is it is not as though the s in substantiated stuff the the go pros and the phones that were on the terrorists contain footage in from the last attack they contain footage that actually exists from before the actual attack and some of that footicthurs nob in released that foodie clues videos of kids who are training for terror mean see these are kids wearing comas operatives uniforms they yon we the background these some of the kids are what thirteen forteenyers old maybe wearing full on military year carrying act forty sevens any ere getting ready to murder some news an this kid is maybe nine and he is carrying a gonna pointing in o the hammer lowering military fatigues it went when ronisantis and the america people by the way most people let ere ought know we are not interested in porting a lot of these sorts of folks that is not races that is why would you want people who abjectly identify as people who hate news an want to kill them in your societies by thewaymn there is there is video that is emerged now from again that is put out by commons of curing palisinians that at chief hospitals rockets are fired on tell eve n the shifahasaa come ass famously his plan is head quarters underneathshipa hospital that if israel wants to strike at and they has in bloop a hospital is there entire than they are shouting a thoawire is the missiles as the rocket's fa lion fly on jaws i then there is also video that is now merged they have not sennet of front from these attacks the the the herrificterrattack of october seventh from those territax who was not all commosterris there are civilians because these boys are extremely close the civilians who are literally rushing in to the rest and and charmall house murder houses of these various kubuzem and communities along the border and stealing things looking it you would see in the it in the united states they people taking away ties people taking away bicycles n is video of again these are these are not all commosterris some of these people are just people from gaze who a riving to steal things from the news now the jaws are dead you see them walking in not all the people are armed was you are unarmed they are walking in and there at seeing if they can pick themselves up some on nice some nice stuff obviously deep deep care from the civilians about to the jewfish cavilling surgeries murdered in these places man if i lessen if you are near a jewfish village that just got completely ransacks and babes got murdered why would not you steal some some kidsbikes you see them riding the kidsbikes over there and why why would not you do that why not after all ism in here is n opportunity get some stuff sure the kid was just murdered it is tine to let us pick up some let us pick up t let us louts gear here we need some gear a when a comes to whether the west ought to open itself up wide two ism to refuge see from gaze at the very least you have to con side may be there might be some culture clash thou might be a little bit o culture clash in the culture clash otic the already exists in the west the mass importation of radical muslin populations has not ben good for euros an gan the reason ism showing you all this stuff is because when you have westerners small bowman saying things we shut just import refuge see from gaze wench just why not meant again two things mom me are once one try to in i my civilian casualties as best you can an if face of compass literally hiding behind s villains but to the notion that it is the west job that is america job to import palistonian refuge eyes it is absurd it is absurd is not been going well for the west over the week there's a massive protest in onion which has nowt fifteen per cent muslin not all those museums are radical but there is a big radical blossom population in onion without it out this protest ye you did not see this protest against come ass after the murder bunch of news i noticed you only saw this protest in favor of compass after israel retaliated his fifty thousand people in the center of onion that is a lot of commas reporters in the center of onion and just in case you're wondering ow what they think one of the o one of the calls in responses was kibe micro all good which for those who do not speak airbed or no about the koan is a reference two the the city of hear there's a massacre of news in the corn it is explicitly discussed the idea that hammed created treaty with the news and then the news refused to convert and he murdered all of them and the the air cabralyahood is a is a call for masstuextermination that was some of the stuff that as being chanted at this particular protest well is in onion these are moderates probably it she n than is pong t people its glad that here in onion are not you i ma mad handing this probably its just a just cultural diverse at again it is all long amazing that this seems a this seems is probably rat for the west i by the way a man to show up within his early flagon was promptly a beaten down by a by some the protestors i an't see there's a person within is really flag trying to escape and i they a the attack him and a there are the cobs act o trying to wrestle him away presume we to protect him by the palisinian rallies jumping on him attempting to get at him to physically be come up hes that is the way that were now again this is not a major surprise onion has been plagued with radical slam free for a long town hammed hero is a prominent commentator over in written i somehow for answered the the main stream to the extent that that he has conversations with main stream people and this is the kind of person the hammed hobbies is major following in in onion there was not two thousand twenty one screaming antisemitism i will ai a wit egg t es o as his as dimness those o e the dogs o that t an act provocation we were saying now hes hung to cogs i man get very clear to eve on understands it those dogs come close t us again we will see it is an act of egression and we will kill those dogs well put them down his him a shouting long from his friends we want the lioness the is a this is some of the rallies were following him is the nighty ansegucionition the someofthe rallies that is not he job is some of his followers is the different for them as they think begins the sis he sot he think life begins for us we believe the death begins we believe that life begins o death we do not care about death gamma this the center of onion again and these supporters of commons our honey combe to all thou our western societies because we have imported many of them into western societies and candida for example yours one supporter over the week and explaining commas is not a terragroup now one the things that truly is amazing is that all the procomoseralities that have taken place or wiving palistonian flags this it be a very easy one it is seriously a superheavy one for example you can easily say i believe the it aught to be a palisinian state and compass is an evil terror script that must be extricated an order for piece process to take place that is a superheavy thing to say but nobody saying that literally nobody saying that have not seen one these protestors suggesting the commoshig f the hostages of you where are they where is the mass palistonian it outcry and unrest overcommasstaking a hundred and ninepin hostages including many babies where is it it does not exist that raises some pretty serious questions about the cause and again it is not hard condemn evil it really is not for example horrible story over the week an illinois man according to writers was charged with hat crimes for stabbing a six year old muslin boy to death an wooden his mother in attack that targeted them for their religion and is response to the warbitin israel and commossacorting to officials and muslin right to activist the boy was have some twenty six tines a horrifying story the thirty two year old woman had mothball stallions she is expected to survive the tap an about forty miles southwest of chico pressing an biding said the d the museums quote came to america seeking what we all seek a refuge to live lorn and plan piece the terrific act of it act if hate has no place in america totally a go of course every one agrees that everyone should agree with that this person is evil this person should be given the deaf penalty you murder child should even the dead penalty now is that hard does not seen that hard seems a poverty's onset page you murder of palistnian for being a palistinian you should get a deaf penalty a tries makes you evil also i noticed zero palisinian activist saying the compost evil none literally zero you cannot find them if they exist the a very hard to find their down excellent chop offering it is not a hard to condemn evil it is very easy to condemn evil actually and yet people have such a tough time doing it here is a canada supporter explaining ofcomss explain commons is not a terragroup not is not a terrace it iseiboa mat e non material row what is the a made psycho clobber gan it is e seething that have ben ten they forteventy five years o colonial them apoccupecen o murder o ha o little chugged o women that is what they are there re within covin caviar ho colonies country can r everything that they do is justified thatcluding what havoc mass waverythingl thing they have got i just i harder children murderer babies beheaded baby be had it really please educate yourself ably is the new e a that news reporter you got a tack the coin youth becks be that the tat wit a lotipoti oh it is all fag it is fag that is it these are the people that t west is decided to i port really really good decisions chis a the had of the area yesterday he said that come ostylotasku come to the uasyalian i wonder why from how who perse would conduct such attar after all every one that we have imported over the past forty years has been a peceloving person obviously lo doing a making job betting our people when i lie who why would e be worried about this give tout everyone here loves piece in this heightened environment there is no question were sing in increase in reported threats and we have got a be on the lookout especially felon actors who may ta inspiration from reason events to commit violence of thrown it'd encourage u to save insolent because as the first line of defense protecting our communities were often the first to see the since that some one may be mobilizing to violence get wall why would you be worried about that probably should take in you know a few hundred thousand you million of palsinian refuge hes because they are because they are all problynatant after years in years fan doctrnation an in hating news and hating the west probably that those wild be a great imports by the why this does raise a serious question you not i noticed i noticed a map in the map is a map of the world and in particular the part of the map tan i noticed is this part called that least and on that map there's this tiny little jewfish country its the tiny little country it locos halpasizin new jersey supersmart and then i noticed a lot a lot of muscle countries in fact ism going to just read you some of the muscle countries there are many many many of them of just just a few off the top of our our head here moretanas small afkannistn around western camera algeria moron malteds comrosnagertak tajikistan to media as r by john jordan sent gall yemantuboody tibia maya pakistan gambia sad yourabia sudan cost rah mali her genista bangladashegi guinea turkey the is beckastanin on nest monsyria brunt or curgastan cooks zero down costar cold baherane you united or demerit's casikstan lebanon bricking a fast lash albania chad basinahrsgavena that is a list of countries that have over fifty per cent muslin population as he percentage of their total population and what is one of the things that i notice zero of them zero our talking about taking in palsinian refuge hes right now zero how heard how odd almost as though they liked the palsinian refuge eyes being refuge es as they have since the creation of the state of israel is worth noting at this point that historically speaking when israel is crafted in nineteen forty seven forty eight menisrael declared its into penance some seven hundred thalsan palsinan grabs either left preemptively because there wars on thy one to get out or left because they were expelled none of them were taken in by any of the arab states any of them by thewy they're billion muscles on plan earth meanwhile the tiny country of israel which again was tiny tiny minyan remains tiny tiny tiny today anybody who does not understand a conflictoreally should travel over there and you should see the proximity they're talking bout zero space the tiny state f israel mason state of israel took in seven to eight hundred thousand news who left or were expelled from muslin country is israel took in all of them they have nosed asked for repatriation an any of the r countries their resources were we are stolen by the muslin governments of those countries they all were taken i by israel the airborne has a particularly ugly history basically shuttling the palistonians around and using them for whatever political purpose they will an the expelling them whenthin like them as have mention before in nineteen ninety to nineteen ninety two during the gulf for in the postpone gulf for era gate expelled some four hundred thousand palistonians no one seems to care meanwhile as you recall during the last syria crisis which is on going and again very few people seem to care turkey took in millions of seeing refuges literally millions of them rope took in hundreds of thousands and one comes to the palistinian population oddly no one wants to take them in how strange how shat in fact egypt will not even let the palistnian population out of gaze he's again if you'll it the border of the gasistrip it borders israel in the north and and in the east and to the south there is a border and is with egypt egypt es h mom country thsigna is largely empty e i do not take them egypt has no interest in opening the border to palistonian refugees because effectively the palistonian population to stabilizes what ever regime takes them in which is why cordon which his seventy per cent palistinian expelled twenty thalisin palistoinians in nineteen seventy and killed three thousand of them when expelled them toe leaponon of at just just can a point that out right now and when nick valley says where are the herb countries helping their brothers helping their compatriots the answers they have been used as tools by lot of these countries they have been used as a weapon against the state of israel for a very very long time and they continued used his weapon the cavilling are constantly used his weapon there that that is an awful horrible truth and yet the expectation seems to be that the west is supposed to in danger itself rather then acknowledging reality here as nickel valley properly pointing out that the aerborlds has gone completely absent on this question you are getting here all of those grab countries vilify israel for what is thereabout tho happen you're getting here all of them they how there you not do ware for the palithinian people and what we should care about the palithinian fedithinsespectally anethatlence because they didn't at for the but where are the arab countries where are they where is cotter where is lebanon where is cordon where is t egypt do we give egypt over a million dollars the year why are not they opening the gates why are not they taking the palithinans why because they know they cannot get them and they do not want health and their neighborhood why would israel want them and their neighborhood my one comes to u no cultural ploclit proclivity presumably muscle country egypt shedmiral cultural polity for muslin citizens living in the got a strip but apparently not apparently absolutely not an meanwhile what happens next well the bin administration is considering the possibility the biding actually visit israel directly tony blinking has visited israel as well he is already starting to put pressure on israel because as youould imagine this is what they do they keep pressuring for one quit red strain israel on to do it at has to do it has no other choice this an next its is an existential fight for thesteade of israel tor the not going to topic is toxin blinking says says words about it as far as weather this conflict expand to outward it seems very unlikely that despite all of the cranial talk it is going to expend outward the reason for that is because the united states put two air craft carriers and mediterranean they have threatened bidendit again over the we and correctly they threatened that was ball should not get in night ecus blood does try to get in he'll be consequences that smart if you want this conflict to maintain it is isolated character then you do need to push people off to ball and being a lot of bazar isolationist to count testing that no war for israel no war against iron for israel israel not calling for that no one's calling for that who are the people where calling for that right now the realities there s on a taste for that america and israel does not have them the wherewith all right now ti t to take on iron or i a three front war and right now what everyone hasn't interested including in including by the way many cranial allies is in containing this thing it'll selyouwhat asherthink happened here r i actually think happened here is that comas was told by the eonian government that they should do something ad that something was supposed to be a terroristand carrion across the gossoborder and they figured that israel response timewould be a lot faster an the coast be a lot less effective and shat they actually figured is that this terrattack would kill fifty people and cannapfive and the israel would then have to launch a serious assault in order to try to get back its on people and then study would pull out of the deal that is probably what they wanted and instead comas succeeded beyond its wildestreams than it is now the dog that caught the car because they got that they were successful that ow israel has no choice but to wipe them off the planet and that something that that i do not think that either iron or other terresponsors in the region saw coming and their basic trice right now is either let this thing expand outward which puts at is cessballah it is rule of lebanon which s natural country or it puts it risk iron itself or they just orhomaskget's taken off the the board at to chess in fact the are reports out now from the israel government that the government of costar chichis which is largely cranial a lined in anyways that the government of costar is pushing a compass to release all the hostages and i fact there seems to be widespread sentiment that all the hostages should be release by compass as an attempt to then create world pressure for israel to stop that striction omasa i do not think that is going to be successful israel have to ecstrapate compass because the thirteen hundred head dues still exist it is none a they disappear even if the hostages are unilaterally released not right now everybody sort of understands that no one has an interest in this thing going broader iron is making noises and their threatening because the sore to have to make noises and threaten that deployed weapons in serial presumably in order to try in push israel from from not going into gassy but i i would be surprised it not saying could not happen but it'd be surprised if it would this is the reason why you us in tell apparently is suggesting that a mass have attack bakasballah would be unlikely because if that happened that husband would get taken off the map as well israel does have the capacity to take mas n cuba law off the map and arondoesnot on lose all its proxies in the region i gain just one second ism to get to news closer to home the republicans continue to struggle over actually neglecting a speaker of the

quicksotic quass to get rid of key my earthy no one can tell explain why or what he hope to gain by this there is a a backs a back room speakers election held by the republicans just a couple of days ago in which they were selecting between steeve scores the hose majority whip and him jordan who is the head of the over slight committee and score's one screes ones on one thirteen to ninety nine among the republican members of the of the house and then he could not put together the two hundred seventeen votes to go forward an actually be elected speaker of the house all of that was for nought the the sort of back room gamesmanship that suggested kit will hae an election back here and then even if you lose right even even if your person voted for the losing candidate you vote for the for the winning candidate going forward nope bat did not happens scores took his name out of contention that is left i jordan but am jordan is struggling with the exacts thing according tote walzerjornal some re publicans a strong support from grassret's conservatives will help new speaker nominal him jordan win over dozens of get pe critics and take the naval this wee but opponents are standing firm presser's mounting on re publican lawmakers to resolve their internal fighting nearly two weeks after comic earthy as ousted in a historic vote we got get past this stage said represented frank lucks fvoklohama it's not an of political oxygen in this place to think about other stuff join of course is very conservative a lot of moderates not huge manage i know him thing's great but there look moderates in the causes where not huge fans and think that he is too grumpy for example jordan said began to get to two hundred seventeen he told or porter on fridge but hold thou s within is on party are sink he cannot get the without his support represent o maria teas ballast of flora plants vote againsjordan on the floor can french baktrants as nothing's impossible but can be really really difficult based on what ism heroin he has lot of grassrete support does gum jordan but they're a lot of people we are in swing districts purple districts who are afraid that because jump jordan is conservative that yes on to blow them out that they lose their house seats if jump jordan is the speaker the going to bring up a bunch of legislation that actually damages them in their purple districts e t is a thing about being speaker o the house it is not about being an inspirational leaderbing speaker the house being speaker of the house is very much about putting a favor there and getting a favor r from here its about wheeling and dealing it is about what kind of coalition you can put together your coalition leader if you are the speaker of the house you are not a hard charging senate candidate or presidential candidate and people who are looking to the speaker to be the latter a can have a lot of trouble because the republican cakes is very fractions not just on the right see a lot of folks on packages and the freedom clanks but also on left side of the party where they're thinking themselves okay the only reason republicans control the house right now is because he republicans one o bunch up state new york seats in not particularly con servitor areas ad those seats just go away if the republican party makes a hard turn to its right in is leadership my earthy for his part has thrown is spot behind jordan he says we cannot have the sgatesdoctrine continue any further he says i think jordan can get there ism one who understand had difficult is democrats who now are are trying to game this thing they want concessions from republicans in order to vote for re publican candidate for the speakership here is hike jeffreys sayingwhore not can hep out the republicans ones we get something in return have you identified a candidate whom you could potentially get behind would you alow your members to that for republican speaker a we have not identify any can on the other side of the ow ecus a folks is not on the individual it is on the institution of congress and the best interest of the america people it is why what we suggested is that we real tin way the rules that a currently emplace to facility by partisan cooperation and a liming the visit get again the concessions to the democrats at only any republican wants to make those but unless the republicans get their heads out their asses and a certain going here actually pick a speaker an come thegother round some one this is they are going to have to because there will have to be a speaker at some points whit just restless f the onset of what you wants you started with my party's making too many concessions o democrats then gates on company voted entirely with democrats e republicans voted with all the democrats get remocarthy and now this thing could end with somebody cutting a deal with the democrats that gives them benefits just to get a speaker back in places just genius level stuff here genius this as have see before if you are going to lead a who against the speaker of the house you better have some sort of plan you better have some sort of lists of concessions that you think you aregoingto get out of everybody but far that list of concessions is not forth coming nobody is actually nobody's actually putting forward that list of concessions nobody thinks that list of concessions is going to materialize or or be effectuated it is it is o what exactly is the point of love sit nobody nobody knows at this point is the answer the this it is it is amazing as have been trying for a while first party to baseline competent winds republicans have an opening jobiton is not incompetent president he has been an incompetent president the world is on fire nearly every place from little to big little fires in places across the world to big fires one to middle master one you crane big economic smoke signals that are not particularly good including the on market and republicans meanwhile are busily kicking themselves directly in the crotch and it is what are you goes doing just why why and i understand the people are upset but being upset is not a strategy it is a mood i get a certain on you might wont a you might in to actually try to get something done on behalf of conservatism if you actually care about that sort of thing already in just a second we are gong to be talking about the election in poland which is kind of fascinating is we are told that poland is a right winged dictatorship and i yet the right seems to have been elected if you are not a

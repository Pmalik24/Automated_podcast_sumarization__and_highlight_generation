a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in today episode of the show if you prefer a beep version you can find that at our website this america life dot a work one of things is happening right now around the world is that you have all these couples happy ones struggling couples couples in that kind of you nothing see oke but i do not know haze tens of millions of couples confined for weeks now the relationships being remolded by the lock down it is an accelerator it is a relationship accelerator it it it rearranges the priority and chose the superfluous overboard in a very clarifying way for many of the one din what is happening with couples i reached act to ester para this couples therapist if you have heard of her she is bobby best known for this idea from her book making in captivity the takes it hall on couples and kills passion when there not enough distance between the partners they turned to each other for everything for friendship and the sense of identity and comfort and everything a whole village is to provide a person it is very ware that under lock down people are literally turning to the partners for everything these days she sing a full schedule of couples more than she usually does interestingly she says is is an unusually good moment for therapy ut t lock down lots of clients r opening up pinging out things in ways that do not mommy it some of the men in the couples it is for the first and they actually doing the it is exciting pro basing because they stop they slow down their home and in thertheyr they this blossoming o opening thing well three door three men and a it is just exit i dofonly get off the for because it is very moving from most or the couples that your seeing what is your sense has the lock down been good for them prepared for them so it is as such an interesting ting to say an really both really to that don't say one or the other couples struggling the monster pretty much exactly the one should expat people who even before all this were quick to pick at their partners and criticize them and argue over whose sacrificing most for whom but also then this minding one our lives a been profoundly disrupted another group doing badly people who they have lost some one or they have some one who sick or they are they are anxious they are worried and basically their partner is unable to have an emphatic response what are you worry about it is nite that there is nothing and people tell you you know my partner is the last person ism turning to for anything ism feeling wit now it is i have nowhere to go wit this to just and of be able to be upset or scared or this constant sense of lost just of the low the world they have known they own identity the work all of that the extreme circumstances are also driving people to repriour tie the stare seen couples split up another move in together and but if i most fascinating to reversals she is causing one couple where one of the partners was always seen as the insecure one she would struggled through a dramatic childhood its agreed between the two with them that she was the troubled one who wend in her stronger for together partner but now it the deal virus everywhere she found that her difficult childhood gave her all kinds of coping he managing skills she is billy i have known cares you would mean this crisis i know what to do i knew what we will be for anybody around me i was in the supermarket i even we to go to self for the ponds of my girl friend who one who is not even here because i knew that they would meed is and i just said now the world is clear to me i nobody needs for me and in this particular relationship it is the women and it was ha very interesting thing represent taco i do not think that side of her had ever been known it had always been described as you the one with the issues because you come from this very aromatic background she became the functional one in the relation ship it was a whole different way of being that it was also a revelation to herself this turned everything around suddenly she was not seeking her partners approval all the time she did not needed which of course is healthy and great except for the partner who was used to being the strong one i it is one thing the wish of the person you with is more septic unless needy out you yo when you get that is he made her uncomfortable and wet is quite out did not surprise to stare oh when when i when am not comfortable with some one who is emancipating with next to me i basically tried to make them doubt themselves again because if they down themselves into they not sure than they come to me that is what she was doing yes in thin all kinds of very such a ways of course i this is not flagrant she would say things to encourage her formerly dependent partner the second ass herself tho out herself things i it is interesting that you wanted do that i do not you did not really that that was not what you wanted to do or you you mean yo want mention to me that at that you do not want to bring you mom you do not wanted for your father little day sets a bit of mind which just gentle mind i you do not mean do you door it looks it is a very rational conversation with other couples is their process being on mock down as forcing thin to confront things that they'd been avoiding met whenever actually stop to figure out the couple

manner in chines most weaker a muscle and for a long time the weaker face discrimination and arbitrary detention in china we fallow the newscuprot we know this escalated being in twenty fourteen when the government started accusing hundreds of thousands of weaker of supporting terrorism and wanting to separate from china and send them to called reeducation centers the better described is in german camps former detainees report being beaten women have testified that they were forcibly sterilized state department is estimated that up to two million people were held in these camps but in formation about what is really going on in thing john is hard to come by or weavers outside of thing john wen a checked on the families back home or some time we are effectively blocked from all communication

they named him bode lives after his grandfather and bode lies becomes sis dads misname everything able roman did bode lives would follow from the way he stood to his table manners i must age was peso he at e a en n that draw n ho as e to sat round to me and the grip twas me this was in a parking lap bode roman was teaching paid had a drive and eighteen month old a de lives would sit on his dad's lap and grabbed the stickshift he throw most if he could not at to belittle laser the cur e o oo o onion one is e try to copy o i so but bode roman's relationship with pandas family was rocky right from the start abode roman his religious but her family a secular and pretty wealthy but the hart of the problem was that pride's parents felt she was wasting her education in turkey she had a degree but she was not using it she wanted to stay home with their son when able lives was born pride's parents started asking her to come back to thing young for a long visit may be even to leave of de lives with them for a while in weaker families it is rely common for grandparents to take care of the grantkits for their first five years of life while the parents work the plaster from back home got really in tents but bode roman and paid were hesitant to leave turkey for starters able roman could not go with her tossing john because he was sure he would be arrested if he returned to china and by this point it was twenty fifteen they would been hearing whispers about at its surveillance that weavers being detained in thing john the do not know exactly was happening but they know wit is not good yous a to i as on my wive what you sayslonte is in a be can try but i do not see to gothalod it than the i have are do not be but to come back again because of e stritotratnthat heron so sat that no i prism ready the want of trouble pride's parents kept hen sitting that it was safe at least for them they were loyal to the party and they had high level government contacts they are not religious if bode lives was with them they sat it would be pay they were pushing but bode roman and paid kept saying no won fee months later able roman was walking by a pretzel shop in his neighborhood when the police stopped him and asked for his residence he papers his permit had lapsed he would applied for a new one but it had not arrived yet they arrested him took him to a detention sinner this happens to a fair number of weaker in turkey tell be detained for a paper work issue and they gat stock for a while in bode roman's case he was locked up for three months allowed just one phone call home every week paid meanwhile was home alone with their toddler and pregnant close to her due date when bode roman finally got out his whole world had changed his wife had given birth to their second child a girl and his son able lives was gone he was in china pride's mother had come for a visit and arranged for the trip back doctor roman felt trick he did not even get to say good by it is his inlays waited until he could not interfere and then sent his kit away he says he never would have let idolizes go to china avers ovation y i we a a e of that was to look it is o the foes look i only wayside lot be the than he door f a si as she was also on the pesos to so on o i should tat me and on there over fan fin o i was went to make it easy for her pride said she wanted to go back with the baby just for a short trip make her parents happy then she would come back without duties poor roman was not crazy about the idea but he agreed drove them to the airport it was hard rooting but the i fou that could not dancing us and they flew away to go to a place for only fragments of information never make it out the plan was that peed would contact at do roman on we chat once they would arrived and felt it was safe but he did not here from them he called her parents again and again they never picked that he is started to panic but this is not entirely abnormal because of how difficult it is for seekers to communicate with their families in thing don he is hoping that that was all it was after two months at this he says a distant relative who is visiting his temple on business contacted him and said let us hat lunch they met he had news it was not good police arrested pride as soon as she and the baby arrived in china she was interrogated and beating the cousin sat she was in prison serving a ten years sentence he thought it was because she lived in turkey human writes observers say they have seen several cases where weaker and thing john have been punished for communicating with people in turkey or other predominantly moon countries it is not a legal person but it can get open trouble with the government just the e epicenter just the en the at you burn inside in something as thin did it is eating i from the inside the an because eatable n ain but began to as is common sosopokin to go on their children are with their grand parents his unless at least their safe but he cannot get his wife out of prison he cannot even call home or try to get more information without endangering his family be cause he is living in turkey any one in chin john who gets a call from him could immediately get flagged by the government they could be interrogated or even sent to a reeducation camp and his family knows this by this point most of them have defeated him from their contacts he waits there is nothing he can do he tarts putting on wait he sleeps late hes stock b for everything he is gone through oboe roman still ready young he is thirty have known him for about six months now and he does things all the time that remind me that he is a dad he never got to be dad he always springs food when we meet an cheers his snake steeve to buns with lam in a spicy fin across us once after an interview we ran in to his friend with her kid at a weaker run carat it'll never forget the look on his face while he tossed the toddler up and down in front of the belly cases this pure uncomplicated joy but when i ask him how he feels about all this he is told me men do not have feelings which obvious lay is not true back in remember of twenty eighteen when bode roman was living in a sample hearing nothing from his family things in thing john were getting worse mornmore weaker for sent to re education enters and later required to do cowage factory work human writes observers say this campaign imprisoned about ten per sent if we get adults in thing on but over roman had no idea what was happening to his family that is when tiptoe came into his life a friend showed it to him he was you have got to see this yawed to beat the eyes an the hes sat i just ta for i ready i a a man i know from my home ton i ask ye how howdy that fin people ho that i wo he ton me a you can write the name of your ton order roman cannot write in mandarin his friend types out the name of his home town for him it is called ox to it is an agricultural enter in the west hogging the mountains that form the border between china kirgistan and cossackston suddenly hundreds of users ore popping up on his screw he goes through video after video he sees all of these places that he recognizes the woods and the rivers and the family hanging out in front of their houses and he can tell things have definitely changed the cotton fields look this same the houses are familiar but to order roman two looks a city under occupation wat i s an at the u can gan on is one since what the diss a chines i on that an in her revs er e looks like a hear women is en bat at teen show is to an the chines i in thawed house er only woman's a house and that i the lady ain my monster i which is a lines man for try to dance as ha that on most forcing hat o dance and the trite the hack her and that the chines give a looks hay and was e at a e outing but bat theta for in over to nation is a a take i i can see the lady shes he can that anything against it bath on for o dance as ago in another video something else seems of it is a group of people clearing icesoff of an irrigation fetch with picks and shovels it is winter you can tell by the trees in the coats their wearing yes a on be let sons order roman knows this dirge it is just a few minutes from his family's house and to him it is clear there being forced to work we never clear ice from the ditch until spring time he tells me there is no need it just frees over again this watching does not seems to be good or out to roman but he cannot stop to talk his this tiny flashlight into the big black box that thing john has peak om for a week he stayed in his apartment just searching would he was really hoping for was to see some one he recognized and he traces of his kids his wife's parents his parents he had not been able to speak to them for several years at this point he watched at the kitchen table watched on the couch at night he would lie awake squirreling on canary forest twenty nineteen he was in bed and usual squirting through tiptop is a run to a yam an order roman sees this fitdio is a little boy with big cheeks expressive eyes he is in a school answer in questions and manner and chines from a teacher off camera behind him hid surmising about in winter cons d h e have is er ajar it win the her the teacher asks the kit a bunch of questions what is the name of the father land the peoples re public of china what is on the father land's flag five stars on a red flag where is er water bottle water bottle is here where do we put the food we cannot finish in the trash order roman does not speak wandered but there is one word that stands out to him obdulizese what is your name the teacher asks and called out do fizzes he says how old are you and for that is how old order roman son should be now the video is just fifteen seconds long one of a hundred that his watched that dak and he cannot be sure it is his son out duties but order roman simultaneously gets this rush of love believing that it is his son and this intense fear that treaty ham because his kids are supposed to be living with their grand parents while he figures out away to get them home and it looks they art let tat the the the on the a is that canceled that camp fortune getting this clown it looks obdelizeas is in a boring school one of the ones set up by the chines government to take care of about five hundred thousand kids than if his parents have been detained in reeducation camps the except for short visits home the kids are generally kept away from their family tot mandarin not weaker an belong we canegega e that r w yes i feel that my son is becomes more chines every day o ben en de ween the of this toy was even i began sorry about o future ta hoserasham e tats i and the make him and enemy of wagering the future specially and make him enemy of people me that seems to be exactly the point of these schools they place these kids in a setting where the removed from their families their language their religion their weaker ness as one internal government document claims the goal of this crackdown is to quit break their lineage brick their ruts break their connections and break their pigeons the government is their family now tan who b bare from this moment when order roman saw his son in this video all he noted was to getting back he was consumed by it i should say there are lots of parents around the world in the same situation in the past year r have personally spoken to nine of them in three different countries only one was able to get her in out of china thanks to an influential family member and a furnish passport still order roman was convinced that he ta guy who does not speak commander and does not have political connections cannot even call home he was going to get a son back reported very buscaran coming out and roman uses everything he has to get his family back that is in a minute ciao pup a radio when our programmed continues this mark an my from our glass today's programmed black box sure is of people who do not have the information they need and want trying to regret what is going on and what they should do next we now continue with act one of our she and for the break may be heard obderomantoty thought that he spotted his four year old son on a tiptoe video decided set out on a mission to retrieve him and the rest of his family theportederybu scarab picks up with de coming story the first thing he did was he went to the press made a public this was risky because his family was still in china his interviews were published all over the world in furnish english portuguese he was on the by c and in the new york times we to tin tin get we inmediatention la satin tens gan is for was that make me that makes me have for hell and trust or the the sit cat to something maybe happen but then i find that the si will not happen toceanke longish a con iron on this with each of these interviews it felt he was screaming into the void trying to get china in the world to look at him and the response silence he was no closer to getting his family back than he was when they left he tried more official routs he went to the chines embassy nothing asked the churlish government for help wrote to the united nations he once told me about this plan to move to candida as a refuge because he thought the government there would half more leverage mind you that would take years to come to perdition but he truly believes that one day his family will be together again he has these pictures on his four because there is no portrait of his family he is made some using passport photos of him in paid a baby picture he has of his daughter and his greenshot of that video of adults ease there photo shopped on to backgrounds the cathedral of no tram in parts cherry blossoms in japan why do you do that can you tell me about that me the you the in ha on the we through the it is because we are a family he tells me last summer bode roman had some lot he was scrolling through we chat and he found a child hood friend he says they hatched a plan to buy a plain ticket for her to go back to their home town get eyes on the ground but of course even when she made it all the way there and was sending him videos of their old neighborhood she still could not speak directly to what she was actually seen the significance of it everything's find she told him everything's new and better as she panned the camera around the empty streets bode dromond was kicked off we chat we do not have the actual victims and we were not able to reach his friend without risking her safety but he says the way she spoke was supercasual to avoid drawing attention the biting is a not any more ton us uprise a they had been new test onset if you come here i by found for you an the ti is i the doing a ans tan that's i as not list be aphis a key may be to they have chance on me there she drove to the street his parents left on they were a lot of check points eventually she got there and found an empty at his family's house in the city had been demolished they have another halm a farm they could have moved there but this is the point when bode roman started to worry that his parents had been taken to he had not been able to speak to them in four years every time he gets more information it is this the more he learns the worst things seen bode rooms toll watch his ticktock it is a nervous habit when he is bored and hes tired an interviews when it takes too long for interpreter to translate a question he will sort of lean back and polyphone out from under the table eventually in canary of this were the a shook loose another piece of information an old acquaintance wrote to him through victor direct message and function the messages start off non clamantly enough his how are you other bode dromond asked him if he is seen his parents lightly how are they doing the friend did not have any information about his son or his wife but e could tell bode roman that his family in ox is gone there not staying at their farm he had hoped his elderly father his mother who is cancer he gives them name after name there gone there gone too and bode roman cannot even be sure what this means they could have been forced off their land but living elsewhere my could be detained into re education enter they could be in prison from thousands of miles away it is almost impossible to find out as he telling me this it is the day after he got these messages and bode roman is getting really worked out he is talking super superbest a can has first and all these emotions from the past three years or spilling over thin tat ta an you an as ta on e e up o e e omenslit on up i do nit that a o tin in the the chest at spoon to i its that e that do not hat

live for any more we later called the local police station in his home town and confirmed that no one is at his families address even though thirteen people used to live there they knew that of de dromond was looking for his family and put a weaker speaker on the line to talk to him maybe they have left maybe they did something wrong the speaker said but she refused to say if they were accused of a crime two days after he gets the news about his family he found something new to fix it on the mayor of this stable he thought that if he could convince this sky to help him he might be able to put in a word to furnish diplomats who help people the trained oversees the mayor was schedule to speak at in afternoon event i dinner in honor of the different cultures of the turkey world the turns that ooh backs in the weaker i met up with him to go there he is brought backs if weaker breads and fried noodles for the event because an back tie is told him it might help him get a chance to meet with the mayor face to face the chances of this resulting in anything are him honestly it is a hale many but as down as of de roman was the day before he is of now buzzing with excitement in the car on the way dollars a nisi a longs a a meet ones p is o onset ism going there is a human being and asking them to do their duty as he humans gang he tells me the event is happening outside and using under a big tent i do roman pulls his bags of flood out of the car and we wait for the mayor a few minutes turns into a few hours he falls back into his phone flipping through tiptoe that he as usual

more than a year before bode roman finally saw a small glimmer of success weirdly it was the pandemic that did it this winter news of the corn of iris outbreak in woman started to filter out of china the videos bode roman started to see on ticktock were of empty streets people stuck at home without much to eat some would set their videos to music pulled from some movies bode roman began to worry

information an improvable bit of news that he desperately wants to hear it could be a live designed to placate keep him quiet he knows this but doctor roman insists that even if it is not trim it still good news wit this one call means to him is that now some one in the government has finally acknowledged his jumping and screaming and waving his hands some one somewhere might actually be responding oman belong uses is good good news bout ants i see them directly a fat further their case until he see a video or instill you see them hear in turkey he i gas until i get i e our o to mean

their families but they have moved out of re education enters and into low wage factory work or formal prison sentences they regretting answers but doctor roman still knows nothing for years he is

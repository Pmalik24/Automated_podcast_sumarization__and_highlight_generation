without further ado let us get to answering your questions the first question is about fluoride and the specific question is why is fluoride in our water and how much is it harming us okay well that might seem a short question but there is actually a lot to that question and i want to be very clear by posing the question how much is it harming us it implies that fluoride is harming us and on be very clear the degree to which fluoride can harm you or not harm you depends on how much of it happens to be in the water or toothy store some other thing that you are consuming of this is very important i do not want the question to seem a leading question to imply that fluoride is necessarily harming us because as of bout to tell you there are clear benefits of fluoride for tooth strength and for warding off cavities but if you get too much fluoride into your system it is dangerous it is a poison at certain levels as you probably heard before t the dose makes the poison let us take this seemingly simple question and dissect it into the first part of the question was why is fluoride in our water and believe it or not even that is hard to answer directly because here is what is happening right now in twenty twenty four there is a major lawsuit in the state of californium to try and get fluoride removed from the drinking hate the outcome of that case is still yet to be determined but the case was filed by a group of individuals whose strongly believe that fluoride at any concentration in the drinking water is bad why would they say that and what is their evidence and how strong is that evidence well there is some evidence that if levels of fluoride in drinking water exceed a certain threshold it can cause problems with fibroid hormone function and perhaps even certain aspects of brain function again if the levels exceed a certain threshold in the state of californium there is a major lawsuit to try and get fluoride removed from the drinking water now at the same time meaning right now there is also a major lawsuit in the united states this one taking place in buffalo new york whereby citizens are suing the city because they insist that there is not enough fluoride in the water and they are suing for damages based on the dental health needs of their children that did not in their opinion get enough fluoride in the drinking water me telling you about all this because the question again was wise fluoride in our drinking water and believe it or not there certain states in the united states certain areas of the united states where the fluoride levels in the drinking water are lo art zero perhaps that is what the lawsuit in buffalo is about and by the way the city of buffalo may have now corrected the amount of fluoride in the water taking it from zero to something whether not it was actually zero is still debatable but i think you are trying to get the point that there is a wide wide divergence in terms of how safe people feel about having fluoride in drinking water some people want it and are suing cities because they feel there was not enough of it in their drinking water and others do not want any fluoride in their drinking water and there suing cities because of that no was this is a really barbed wire topic as i to say it is one that no matter how close you get to it whatever angle you look at it you are likely to get stuck a little bit it is on to be a little bit painful oke why is fluoride in some drinking water at all call it set aside the levels in just answer that question well in an upcoming episode of the hubrmlapodcast about oral health it'll get into this in a lot more detail but fluoride is a really interesting compound with respect to oral health and heres we your teeth believe it or not are always in a state of either demineralization or demineralization s er tricky words to say gohedan try and sad demineralization demineralization ism going to refer to them as demon for demineralization and semen for demineralization o kat your teeth are always in one state or the other or one state predominates verses the other now a cavity in your mouth o curs when bacteria in particular streptococcus mutant sometimes called strep mutant feeds on sugars in your mouth and then as a by product of that feeding creates acids that then erode the enamel and deeper layers of your teeth in other words it demineralize the tooth now i just told you that your teeth can be in a state of demon or semen at any moment the way that your teeth semen the way they demineralize and can potentially fill in little cavities that have not yet made it to the deeper layers of your teeth is through a process that involves the construction of crystals from minerals oh say that is why it is called demineralization and get this this is really wile these minerals actually stack together in very organize little sequences colic legs blocks and the critical element within those blocks is something called hydroxy appetite i love that it has the word appetites were talking about moral health that is the normal process fluoride was discovered not because it is sidemen not because its an essential neutral in fact at huh concentrations it is actually a poison i'lltell you story about that in a moment rise actually poison by fluoride at the dentist when i was a kid in large part do to my own error fluoride it was discovered can actually get inside of those legochain crystals the building of those and form bonds between them that are actually stronger then the hydroxy appetite bonds that would normally form in other words if you consume floriated water or use toothpaste with fluoride especially you do this when you're a kid what ends up happening is that the crystals and the mineralization structure of the teeth becomes ultrastrong meaning superphysiologically strong which then limits the ability for that strep mutant and the acid strep mutant produces when it eats sugar to erode the enamel of your teeth causing what we refer to as cavities cha i went and asked several dentist and a periodontics about wise fluoride in drinking water wise fluoride in toothpaste and they of course give me the explanation that i just gave you which is a chemical mechanical explanation or rational however most of the things for our health such as the foods we eat the amount of exercise that we do are not naturally put into our environment right but tap water which goes out to everyone who you do not consumes it from the tap is basically a government or local government supplied resource and basically the rational was and i believe this took place first in the nineteen fifties was ora given the potential for fluoride to make superphysiologically strong teeth what can we do to reduce that cavities and tooth decay that would occur in children and adult populations let us put fluoride in the drinking water that is what they did they did not do this i was told because it was necessarily the best way to take care of teeth and avoid cavities that turns out they are bunch of other things that you can do even if you consume no fluoridate water or toothpaste there are things that you can do to enhance the mineralization state of your teeth even filling cavities provided those cavities have not made it into the deeper called dentin layers of the teeth it'll get into all this in that future episode but what the guess and other governments decided this of course varies across the world to extent to which the fluoride in the drinking water or not was that by putting fluoride in the drinking water they could percent a large amount of tooth decay and cavities that would otherwise occur of it was a and remains a fairly low cost approach for these cities to introduce fluoride to the drinking water and that is why fluoride is in drinking water it is to try and create superphysiologically strong teeth and indeed every single dentist i spoke to including functional dentist i spoke to part daunts i spoke to several dentist ranging from let's call them more traditionally train dentist to more that is call them alternative dentist all of them agree that at a chemical mechanical level fluoride creates stronger teeth however every single one of them also acknowledged that the bonds that are created in those mineralization chains as ism referring to i realize that is not that the technical term is not the normal hydroxy appetite bonds that would form they are stronger than the bonds that would normally form they are structure different if you look at them down what is called an electron microscope you'll we that they're structurally different and som not all of the dentist i spoke to said yea it would be best to demineralize the teeth to fill in any cavities that initially have formed again not down to the deep layers but that could still be filled in naturally through the building up of those hydroxy appetite natural bonds but they acknowledge that many people perhaps most people do not take adequate care of their mouths and their teeth they understood the rational putting fluoride into drinking water and of course that is also y fluoride is in many not all toothpaste o ks ism hoping that clearly answers for you the question of why there is fluoride in our drinking water at all at least in most america cities there is fluoride in the drinking water although this lawsuit in buffalo am i guess soon to be a determined am will probably tell us whether not indeed there was a total lac or a partially of fluoride in the drinking water there ism presuming that the accusation is true but i do not actually know that to be truss know that there is a lot suit that exists if you gouglbide you can see some you to videos about it there is information about this am happening i their bunch of angry parents and ism sure they are angry parents on the other side and m on a the kids are saying but a ho flee of matter what they are hanging them through healthy teeth okay now the second half of the question was how much is the fluoride in drinking water harming us cam an answer this question very specifically the person ask how much is the fluoride in our drinking water harming us well i already told you ways in which it is helping the strength of your teeth that is not debated ay again there might be some dentists that say oh the bonds that are formed by fluoride are different than the once that are naturally created with no fluoride and there might be some debate about that but all of them act knowledge that those bonds and the mineral isatin of the teeth is stronger with fluoride they understand and agree with the rational even if they do not necessarily agree with the practice as the best practice how much is fluoride in drinking water harming you well there two things you need to ask one is how much fluoride are you actually drinking because it turns out there is a tremendous range a fluoride concentrations in tap water depending on what city you live in now i did not entire episode to the human ladpodcast about water we talked about distilled water for to spring water we talk about hydrogen water we talk ago alkaline water we talked about all of those things and we did talk about fluoride and one of the key take always when you're thinking about fluoride in drinking water is to know that if fluoride concentrations in drinking water are too high or and this is a very important or or your consuming a lot of a particular water that contains even low levels of fluoride well there is the potential and again i want a highline the word potential here i do not want o cauls alarm that the fluoride is causing disruptions to theroid hormone output or on the receptor and in other words destruction to thyroid hormone metabolism and usage in the body ora want of be really clear here i do not want people to think oh fluoride destroys your thyroid harmony it is the dose that makes the poison it depends on how much now the center for disease control have set a recommended level of zero point seven milligrams per leader zero points have in milligrams per leader of fluoride in drinking water as the level and here in paraphrasing that can help prevent tooth decay and promote good oral health that they have deemed safe but if you want to know how much fluoride is in your drinking water whether not it is above at or below that value you need to get your tap water tested now fortunately there are websites that can tell you how much fluoride is in your drinking water and if you trust the date on those websites you can simply put the city you live in into one of those websites and you will get the information back it'll provide a few links to those different websites in the show no captions for this episode we also provided those links in the shoot captions for the episode on water and then you can see are you adjusting the level of fluoride in your drinking water that is deemed safe less than that value or more than that value but keep in mind that if you drink a little bit a moderate amount or a lot of floriated drink in water you are going to be consuming either water or less fluoride just because there is the concentration that is been deem safe by the center for disease control does not actually tell you whether i not if you are drink half a gallon of tapwaterday overseas a gallon verses just a couple cops whether or not you are in that safe disown and of course as is going to very by body weight right of your small child those lower levels of fluoride are country eight to a larger total amount of fluoride as seen by the volume of the body if you think about this ride everything by body weight volume this is why drug dosages are most typically calculated as a function of pounds or kilograms of body weight it not everybody gets the same dose of every of every drug and if you are very large person maybe you can tolerate more fluoride as i mention before high levels of fluoride have been shown to destruct theroid metabolism it has also been hypothesized again this is still highly debated hypothesis to be nurotoxic under certain conditions that is toxic to neurons that can kill neurons at certain concentrations not necessarily the concentrations present in your drinking water a lot of the evidence that fluoride is neurotic is from called in nitro studies studies done effectively in a dish although there is some invite evidence that it can cause neurotoxisity a euro degeneration i think when it comes to the topic of fluoride people tend to bin out into not concern and simply want fluoride to strengthen their teeth mildly concern you on con keeping an eye on this stuff o we fluoride does not sound great for me but you knows long the concentrations are not too high you knows people say have been drinking tap water my whole life and i feel great you know my teeth or strong and my brain works and my theroid seems fine ski and then people who are very very concern about fluoride at any concentration in their drinking water hence the the law suit in californium and other law suits around the country i believe that when we are talking about fluoride you really need to think about the dosages and you need to ask yourself which one of those three categories you fall into now if you are concerned about fluoride it does not necessarily mean that you cannot drink tapster the suggestion simply would be to filter that tapster and during the episode i did on water i toked about a number of different filtration approaches a many of those filters will filter out fluoride and you can simply look up you a water filters that eliminate or reduce fluoride and then some people have enough disposable income and or or concerned enough about fluoride an their drinking water that they will purchase or create very extensive very thorough filtration systems completely eliminate fluoride from their drinking water i a you will find different ranges of concern again a side from the data of high fluoride levels being destructive to theroid homo pathways and possibly neurotic i personally am somebody who filters the drinking water i consume out of the tap unless that is i am going to boil water with it for making things loosely your hamate which is one of my favorite i drink that lately i drink this a cold brew mating your hamate which by the as made with purified water a no fluoride ah and on and forth but if ism making rice sir i making poster a making oatmeal and i need to use a tap water i do not worry about removing the fluoride from that water however if ism going to drink water if ism n to mix in on element electrlike packing or just drinks a glass of water or go out on a hide and take some water with me i do use a water filter either o a filter that fills from the top and then seeps down and the once you put in the refuge radar or and i recently purchased a whole house filter for the drinking water taps in my house that it does remove all the fluoride and remove some other contaminants as well it is going depend on your level of concern and it is going to depend on you are disposable in come and any number of other things and i must say that every once in a while it'll drink a lit abut a tap water out of the tap without any concerned about filtering the fluoride ism not somebody who gets hyper concerned about these things but i do understand who some people do get hyper concerned about these things especially people red up on fluoride and some of the earth concerns of consuming too much fluoride because i also find it very logical and understandable that as people learn more about how a particular substance might be harming their brain or bodily health that they would become more concerned about consuming that substance at just stands to reason what am i suggesting i suggest that you figure out how much fluoride is in your tap water i suggests that you then make a decision as to weather not to filter that water or not before drinking it and then of course you have to make a decision about what sort of financial investment you are willing to make to filter that water you can find a list of different price ranges of water filters in the show note captions in the water episode may also on a watch that episode and go to that time stamp and there is an enormous range there i want to be very clear i do not have a financial relationship to any of those filtration mechanisms again some people have zero dollars to devote to that process of taking the fluoride out of the water and other contaminants some people have many many tens of thousands of dollar rely just depends on your disposable in come in your level of concern but if you were to ask me i would say i think given that the cost of most of the filters that can remove most of the fluoride is low and given that there is some health concern of consuming too much fluoride and why not just remove fluoride from the drinking water and then if you say well will not that we in my teeth then i would say well watch the episode that some to come out on a oral health because it is going to explain a lot of approaches including fluoride containing toothpaste but some other non fluoride containing toothpaste and other things that one can do that the community of professionally train dentist all agree can really help improve the mineralization state of your teeth and indeed can fill in cavities that begun to form but have not yet made it to the deeper layers of your teeth and on and on now i do have a brief story about fluoride that it'd be remiss if i did not tell you which essentially shows that fluoride is designed to strength and teeth but is also indeed a poison when i was a kid i had a lot of dental issues i did not consume much sugar my mother fortunately was good about not i letting us consume to much sugar but for whatever reason my mouth was kind of a mass it'd brush it'd floss i would do all these things but actually had my adult teeth coming behind my baby teeth did not push out my baby teeth not only did i not collect from the toothfairy which i only recently discovered is not real but how would i know cause the tothforry never showed up because all of my adult teeth came in behind my baby teeth it'd have all of my baby teeth pulled on the top i did not have a god relationship to the dentist as a location or a person in fact they had to tell me not to bite the dentist a by the way i have not beaten a dentist in a long time a fully my dentist if watching this is not ism too concerned i do get twice your cleanings every dentist agrees that is a good thing to do some people may need lass some people may need more but how do you need to go to a dentist to find out back to the story about fluoride i start going to the dentist quite a bit because of all these dental issues that i had as a kid and what they used to do i do not knot they do this any more but wat they use to do as they give you these one trays which are unlike a mouth guards that you would use for boxing your homies we your teeth do not get knocked out and they'd fill those trays with this jelly stuff that contain fluoride and they but on a top and on the bottom and the stuff just ah little bits of it would seep unto your tong in your throat and was sours awful and they see me and this little a wicker chair in front of a television and turn on cartoons as if that was suppose to make me forget how awful a the whole experience was if anything it proxy just created a pavolovian condition response a to hate cartoons which suppose a did not work as i liked cartoons then i do not watch them now truly i do not watch them now sit down this wicker chair have got the fluoride in my teeth with these two trays and ism just hating this whole process and you must have runabout five or six years old i decide in my infinite wisdom to just just swallow all the fluoride pace i start sucking down through these mouth guards can feel t going back into my throat in its and it is souring it stinging its awful ut something ism just an elect don't do that omen an sit there i mislyganin on a beat the test and i drink all this fluoride pace and then of course i got immensely sick within about three minutes i stood up a turned around and puked all over the wicker chair i think that was deliberate as hall looking back it was deliberate a and puke all over the wicker chair my mom comes of running in what happened what you do do i shins very protective of me thanks mom a what you do to him and then i i said you'd i just swallowed the stuff they want to do it again and i stop doing the fluoride treatment at that point why did i vomit well have nominated because fluoride is indeed a poison at high concentrations now do i tell you that story to make you afraid of giving your kids flooded toothpays tor florid water now by all means do what you think it is best for you and for your children for me however have made some effort to avoid fluoride toothpaste i do go the dentist as i mention about once a year i confess during the pandemic it probably less as they were busy and was hard it casual et camera have had very very few cavities in my adult life hardly any and my gum health is very strong et camera et camera largely through taking on protocols that i am going to describe in the oral health episode and that were recommended to me by friends who are both dentist and other friends who are pariadontis because again there lot of things that we can do to strengthen our teeth in natural ways by building up those hydroxy appetite bonds which are the natural bonds that teeth form and yes believe here not being able to reverse some early formed cavities as long as they have not made it deep into the tooth aldose things using a soft toothbrush because if you brush too hard and if you take that approach at your brushed teethrough are get them really really clean yes scrape off all the big film you'll void tartar build up but you can really cause some tenting of the gum tissue above the teeth and those the recesses back and there are where bacteria get in and there's now a lot of really strong evidence showing that some of that bacteria can translate into cardiac disease can translate into metabolic disease and maybe even into some neural logic disease it is serious stuff oral health is one of the most important areas of health and it is one of the most overlooked areas of oral health and i think people generally fall into two categories and it'll use these too categories to frame up the episode on oral health that is coming one category of person seems really bullish on their oral health i keep my teeth white and clean and they floss and brush twice a day every day and they use tooth whiteners and mouth wash and all those things and the other category is kind of blaze about it ye do not brush wen teeth in the morning that my breath does not kill every person i get into an interaction with and on and forth but in reality both the group of people that are doing an immense number of things to try and keep their teeth white and their breath fresh are yes doing things that are good for their oral health but also no doubt damaging their a health in particular the oral microfilm which is absolutely critical and then of course the other category of people that are neglecting their oral hygiene and are not taking mouth washes an things that are also damaging their oral health but in different ways during the episode on oral health it'll spell out all the things that you can do most of which by the way are completely zero cost many of them actually will save you money both in the short and long term and can really help you improve your oral microfilm the strength of your teeth and reduce the number of cavities may been reverse cavities that have begun to form and are not too deep into the tooth yet and in a really nice way all of that independent of your stance on fluoride thank you for joining for the beginning of this ask me anything episode to hear the full episode and to hear future episodes of these ask me anything sessions plus to receive transcripts of them and transcripts of the superman labpodcast standard channel and premium tools n to released anywhere else please go to humeral lady calm slash premium just to remind you why we launch the superman labpodcast premium channel truly twofold first of all it is to raise support for the standard superman labpodcast channel which of course will still be continued to be released every money in full length we are not going to change the format or anything about the standard suberin labpodcast and to fund research in particular research done on human being not animal models but on human beings which we all agrees a species that we are most interested in and we are going to specifically fund research that is aimed toward developing further protocols for mental health physical health and performance and those protocols will be distributed through all channels not just the premium channel but through all channels superman labpocast and other medium channels the idea here is to give you information to your burning questions in depth and allow you the opportunity to support the kind of research that provides that we kinds of answers in the first place now in especially exciting feature the premium channel is that the tiny foundation has generously offered to do a dollar for dollar match on all funds raised for research through the premium channel this is a terrific way that they are going to amplify whatever funds come in through the premium channel to further support research for science and science related tools for mental health physical health and performance if you to sign up for the auburn lab premium channel again there is a cost of ten dollars per month or you can pay one hundred dollars up front for the entire year that will give you access to all the a m as you can ask questions and get answers to your questions and you will of course get answers to all the

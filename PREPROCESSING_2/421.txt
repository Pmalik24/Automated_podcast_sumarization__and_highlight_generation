welcome to the superman o science science tace to e i am injury superman and on up professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor charges super doctor sucker is a professor biochemistry and molecular bill physics and of negro science a colombia university school of medicine doctor sucker is one of the world's leading experts in perception that is how the nervous system converts physical stimuli in the world into a vents within the nervous system that we come to understand as our sense of smell our sense of taste our sense of vision our sense of touch and our sense of during doctor fucker's lab is responsible for a tremendous amount of pioneering and ground breaking work in the area of perception for a long time his laboratory worked on vision defining the very receptors that allow for the conversion of light into signals that the rest of the eye in the brain can understand in recent years his laboratory is focused mainly on the perception of taste and indeed his laboratory is responsible for discovering many of the taste receptors leading to our perception of things sweetness sourness bitterness saltiness and mama that is savoriness in food doctor fucker's laboratory is also responsible for doing ground breaking work on the sense of thirst that is how the nervous system determines whether not we should invest more fluid or reject fluids that are offered to us a key feature of the work from doctor joker's laboratory is that it bridges the brain and body as you will soon learn from to day's discussion is laboratory has discovered a unique set of sugar sensing neurons that exist not just within the brain but a separate set of neurons that sent sweetness and sugar within the body and that much of the communication between the brain and body leading to our seeking of sugar is below our conscious detection doctor sucker has received a large number of prestigious awards and appointments as a consequence of his discoveries in nerve science he is a member of the national academy of sciences the national academy of medicine and the america association for the advancement of science is also an investigator with the toward high's medical institute for those of youthen are not familiar with the called h h m i hoard bug's medical institute how us medical institute investigators are selected on an extremely competitive basis and indeed they have to comeback every five years and prove themselves worthy of being reappointed as toward high's investigators doctor sucker has been at toward high's investigator since nineteen eighty nine what all that means for you as a viewer and or listener of to day's podcast is that you are about to learn about the nervous system and its ability to create perceptions in particular the perception of taste and sugar sensing from the world's expert on perception and taste dab certain that by the end of to day's podcast you are not just going to come away with a deeper understanding of our perceptions and our perception of taste and particular but indeed you will come away with an understanding of how we create internal representations of the entire world around just and in doing how we come to understand a life experience before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in restart rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and sine related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast and now for my discussion with doctor charges hooker charges thank you much for join me today liter i want to ask you about many things related to taste our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an treason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need end the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will gie you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still decision in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they're all delicious again if you want to try element you can go to element elements that calm slash humoral and gustatory perception but in to start off and because you have worked on a number of different topics anneal science not jobs taste how do you think about perception or rather i should say how should the world and people think about perception how it is different from sensation and what leads to our experience of life in terms of vision hearing tastes et camera in the brain is and extraordinary organ that waits maybe to present of your body mass yet it consumes any were between twenty five to thirty percent of all or sure energy an oxygen and it gets transform into a mind and this in changes the human condition t make changes transforms in a fear into courage conformity into creativity sadness into happiness how how how the hell does that happen now the challenge that the brain faces is that the world is made of real things in o this here is a glass and this is a cord and this is a microphone but the brain is only made of anurans that only understand electrical signals how did you transform that reality into nothing that electrical signals that now need to represent the world and that process is pecan is what we can operationally define as perception in the senses that say o factory other taste vision not we can very straightforwardly separate detection from perception detection is what happens when you take a sugar molecule you put it in your thou and in a set of specific cells now sense that sugar molecule that is detection you have not perceive anything yet that is yes yourselves in your tongue interacting with this chemical but now that gets activated and sends a signal to the brain and now detection gets transform into perception and is train to understand how that happens that is been the the manayacod drive of my entire careering neural science how that's the brain ultimately transform detection into percept ion that it can guide actions and behaviors the i makes absolutely and is a very clear and beautiful description a sort of highline question related to that and then i think we can get into some of the intermediate steps n thing many people would to know whether r not my perception of the color of your shirt is the same as your perception anilincrestion am i looking to interrupt you as your as ism guessing what you're going or my your interruption is melon a cast the audience will always penalize me for interrupting you and well never penalize you for into i the one way finalize now even what i told you before that the brain is trying to represent the world pase in nothing but the transformation of these signals into e entry to languages that how neurons have to not and the cod it follows that your brain is different tat my brain and before it fellows that the way that your receiving the work must be different than mine even when receiving the same sensory use i and it'll tell you about an experiment is a simple experiment it brilliant the demonstrates why we perceive the for how we perceive the world different in the work of vision as well well now we have three classes of vote receptorine rooms that sends three baby colors it red blue and green it o blue green and red if we go from sure to long wavering and the three are sufficient to accommodate the for vehicle spectra an when i take three light projectors and ism when i projected on into a white scream it red light and the thy one green light and when i overlive the two beams and on the screen to to be yellow o git is the superposition when you have two beams of of red and green and then ism when i take a third projector and ism when i too that foster that projects right next to that next beam a spectrally pure yellow and ism when i ask you to come to the red and green projectors and three with intensity nous that you can match that yellow that your projecting to the spectrally pure next to it is this makings's perfect ans and am going to ride down the numbers in this two volume intensity nous and then ism when i ask the next person to do the same and then that when asked every person around these area battery part in new york to do the same and guess what we are glen in that with thousands of different number combinations amazement for all of us is yellow enough that we can use achoo language but for every one of us that yellow is wen to be ever slightly differently and i think that simple psychological experiment beautifully illustrates how we truly perceive the world differently aloe that example and yet in that example we know the basic elements from which color is created if we migrate into a slightly different sense we took a hard one sound sound or faction ye very hard into o an experiment that wed allow us to get that degree of granularity and beautiful morality were we can show that e frobeauses and leads to be if i give you the smell of a rose you can describe it to me if i smell the same rose i can describe it also but i have no way whether the two of us our experience in the same but it is close enough that we can both pretty much say that it has the fathering enough features e or other the terminal but no question that your experience is different the mint the fact that it is good enough for us to both survive that your perception of yellow in my perception of yellow we stop until now is good enough for us both the survive at raises a thought about a statement made by a colleague of ours makes master at calpac it is never been on this podcast but in the review that i read a by markets at one open he said that the basic function of perception is to divide our behavioral responses in to that out comes downstream of three basic emotional responses yum i it yuck i hate it or me whatever ani think about ism not looking to establish in debate between remarks without i understand buthutwhat i about that is that it seems the we know the brain is a very economical organ in some sense despite its high metabolic demands and this variation and perception from one individual to the next at once seems a problem because we are all literally seen different things and yet we function we function well enough for most of us to ahoy is death and cliffs and a eating poisons and forth and to enjoy some aspects of life one hopes is there a general statement that we can make about the brain not just as a a organ to generate perception not just as an organ to keep us alive but also an organ that is is trying to batch our behaviors into general categories of i think i think but but and again i think the world of marches to and i think he is right that e now broadly speaking you could categories a lotion behaviors fulling into the three categories and that is one hundred per cent likely to be the case for animation the while were yo now the choices or not necessarily bakery but there very unique and distinct e do i want a et these do i want a kill that do i went i go there or do i when i go here we humans deviated from that world long ago and you now learn to experience live were we do things that we should not be doing some of us more than others exactly you now i i i in my own world of taste e the like wo that an animal in the while will enjoy eating something be her it is inconceivable it we you no love tons water we into we leaving on the age i we in love enjoying experiences that makes us human and that goes beyond that simple sit of categories which is came yak a who cares and i think is not a bat pilot but i thing is it it is overly reductions for certainly what we humans do agreeing them since we hear in new york i consider the many options the extensive variety of food flora and fauna in new york explains a lot of the more new ones behaviors that we observe let us talk about taste because all you have done extensive work in the feel of vision and it is a topic that i love it spend all day on taste is fascinating first all it'd to know why you migrated from studying vision to studying taste and perhaps in that description you can how li us why we should think about and how we should think about the sense of taste my gall is always been to understand as i ha led before how the brain does its magic what part you my wonder i really to hell contribute to understand all of its you know how how do you in code and the code emotions how do you code and decode memories and actions how do you make decisions how do you transform detection into perception and the least goes on and on but one of the cheating in science as is insuring that you always ask the right question that you have an for civility of answering because if the question can not be tractable or reduced to an experimental path that helps you resolve it then we in that doing some really fine science but not necessarily answering the important problem that we want to study makeense from a first person perfect yes that the hardest question the most important question is what are you go what question are you going to try y yean and for example i would have to understand the neural basis of empty the big mixed for that one hundred per cent but but i would not even know i mean at the molecular level it that is what we do how do the circuits in your brain create that sens i have no clue how to do it i can come up with ways to think about it but i to understand what in your brain makes some one a great philanthropies what is the neural basis of love i would not even know where to begin if i one no begin to study these questions about brained function that can cover many aspects of the brain i need to choose a problem that affords me that window but in a way that i can ask questions a give me answers and among the senses that have the capacity of transforming detection into perception of being stories memories of creating emotions of giving you differing different actions and perceptions as a function of the internal state when your hangerythings takes very differently that when you're satin how why when you taste something remember these amazing me of you had with your first date how does that happen or i if i one no begin to explorer all these things that the brain was i fell i have to choose a sensory system that affords some degree of simplicity in the way that the mud out put relationships are put together and in a way that still can be used to ask every one of these problems that the brain has to ultimately compute in cod and the cod and what was remarkable about the tastsystem at the time that i began working on that is that nothing was known about the molecular basis of taste in a we new that we could taste what has been usually define as the bat the five basic taste qualities sweet sour better salty and mama mama s a japan's word that means the yam delicious and that is and nearly every animal species the taste of a mitosis and in humans is mostly associated with the taste of emisgi monosodium glutamate one aminoasithing particular what just by way of example some fruits that are richiniuumam evoking a stimulation see weed to mat of cheese and it is a great great flavor in hanger it in riches our sensory experience and the beautiful thing of the system is that the lions of mud are limited to five in sweets our bitisotianmami and each of them has a great determine meaning you are born liking sugar and disliking bitter you have no choice is a hard wire systems but of course you can learn to dislike sugar and to bitters but in the wild this this humans out of the question get this are and represent predetermine your born i that specific veins value for is taste of sweet mama and low salt are attractive taste qualities the vogue a petite responses i want o consume them and beater and sour are innately predetermine to be aversive could i interrupt you just ruefully and ask a question about that exact point for something to be appetitive to than some mother taste to be aversive and for those to be hard wired can we assume that the sensation of very bitter or activation of bitter receptors in the mouth active signora circuit that causes closing of the mouth retraction of the tongue and retraction of the body and that the caste of something sweet might actually induce more within a hundred percent you got it it the activation of the receptors in the tongue that recognize sweet verses that ones that recognize bitter activate an entire behavioral program and that program that we can refer ass a positiveness or aversion it is compose of many different subroutines in the case of bitter is very easy to actually look at see them happening in animals because the first thing you duce you stop leaking then you put a unhappy fast then your queen your eyes e and then you start going and that entire thing happened by the activation of a bitter molecule in a bittersensin see in your tongue ingest ex it is it is again the magic of the brain how how it it is able to income and the cod this extraordinary actions an behaviors in response of nothing by the simple very tin o my unique century stimuli now let me say that this pilot of five basic tastes a comodates all the dietary needs of the organism sweet an sure that we get the right amount of energy wo mama t ensure that we get proteins and that the central outran salt the three aperitif ones wen sure that we maintain our elictralibalance bitter to prevent the ingestion of toxic noxious chemicals nearly all militating in o things out in the while a bad for you and sower most likely to prevent ingestion of spoil said fermented foods and that is it that is the pale that we deal with now of course is a difference between basic taste and flavor flavor is the whole experience flavor is the combination of multiple tastes coming get it to get et wit smell with texture with temperature with the look of it that gives you what you and i would call the full sensor experience but by we scientist me to reduce the the problem into s basic elements we can begin to break it apart before we put it back to git when we think about the sense of taste and we try to figure a how this lines of information go from your tongue to your brain and how they signal and how they i integrated and how they figure all this different behaviors we look at them as individual qualities we give the animal sweet or we give them a bitter we give them sour we avoid meets because the first state o discovery is to have that clarity as to what you are trying to extract that you can hopefully meaningfully make a difference but e being able to figure out how easy that my goes to be to see in to the this his makes me out n almost the primary colors to create the full array of the garospactor exactly before i ask you but the the first and second and third stages of taste and flavor perception is there any idea that there may be more than five the theories for example e what about fat i love the i left fat to and i love the texture of fat especially if it is slightly burnt the the in south america when i visit bonosiris i found that at the end of a meal they would take a stake the trimming off the edge of the stake burn it slightly and then serve it back to me and i thought that is disgusting and then i tasted it and it is delightful it is there is nothing quite it thesis goes back to this notion before that we to live on the edge the and we to do things that we should not be doing drew but on the other hand look at those muscles the teeth by banjo suggestanyon er a i listers a fa as on an let am sure the be a butibidiosen that i eating pure fat ism not in onachidogenic diet et camera but om but fat is taste e the evidence by yo cecity problem that existing an wo wan talk about that you knowing a littlvin about the the got brain axes i i think we will important to cover it because it is the ate side of the take system and and messing taste in a ones fat o tho you clearly high like it a lot of fat taste quotation mars it is really the feeling it of fat rolling on do tongue and the said a compelling argument that a lot of what we call taste it is really makeano sensory is much o sensorycells sells there no responding to taste but the responding to mechanical stimulation of fat polices rolling on the tongue that gives you that perception of fat i love the idea that there is a perception of fat regardless of whether not there is a dedicated receptor evaded most because it is make devoting sensations and imagery o of the taste slightly burnt fat for for example ye and another one you could argues metallic taste i i know exactly what it taste you ask me to explain it i will have a her time what whether the polite of that color that can allow me to define it i i a i would not be easy but i know precisely what it taste i ouzo tike a take a penny put in your mouth and what i taste i or blood blood that another very good example and is there really in a receptor for metallic taste or its nothing but this magic of combination of the activation of the existing lines think of i the lines of information ye siderolite by the keys of a piano ye sweet tour bitesoltomama you play the key and you acuate at one cord and that when cord in the case of a piano leads to a note at tune and in the case of basely to an action and a behavior but you play many of them together and something emerges that its different than any one of the pieces and it impossible the metallic for example represents the combination of the activity was in the right ration make of the airlines in makesents and a why poise of perfect the your temple of the piano profits a perfect sway for what i to touch on next which is if you would describe the sequence o neural events leading to a perceptible event of taste and ism certain that somewhere and there a you will in bed and answer to the question of whether not we indeed have different taste receptors distributed in different locations on our tongue you ere elsewhere in the mouth is lit litter by by by thinking that that old talk and meat who came over that i the there many use but the the most frivoling i that there was an original drawing describing the sensitivity of the tongue to different tastes imagine i can take a cutie this is a thought experiment it and and when i did that cutivening sold and in quinine a something bitter and gluteus a something sweet and and when i tag that cutibasio to sting your tongue out and star moving around your tongue and ask you what do you feel and then am going to change the concentration of the manor sold or the mount of bitter and ask canna git some sort of a map of sensitivity to the different taste and and the argument that has emerge i said there is a good likelihood that the did tat was simply mistrals lated as he was being drawn and of course that late ton entire industry this is the way you maximize error wine experience because now we are going to form the vessel that you are con a ring from that it as maximally on the receptors which have life now there is no tongue map no li we have taste bats distributed in serious parts of the tongue there is a map on the distribution of tastepats but is taskbar has a run a hand red taste receptrselvs and this taste recept selves can be of five times it sweet sour bitisolty or mammy and for the most part all tastebat have the representation of all five taste qualities now there is no question that there is a slide by us for some says bitter is particularly en rich at the very back of your tongue and there is that physiological basis for that actually a biological passed for that that is the last line of the fence before you swallow something bad and let us make sure that the very back of your tongue has plenty of these bad one receptors that if they it activated you can trigger a gagging reflex and give rid of this that otherwise may kill you i codes but but the notion that in all sweeties in the frond and solids on the si it it is not real and the my oh i us can ask are the the first will thank you for the swelling tat with and we will propagate that information as far and wide as we can lixeithing that is the number one met related to he taste the other one is are their taste receptors anywhere else in the mouth a fer instance on teanibasat the palate note lips its its in the fringe at the very back of the oral cavity the tongue and the palate and the palatine very rig and sweet receptors i ye pay attention of this the next time i eat some very whether whether pul you pull it a yet now in they the the important thing is that you know after the receptors for these five the the detectors the molecule that sins sweets our betesoltomami these are receptors proteins found on the surface of taste receptrcelves that interact with these chemicals and once the interact in the trigger the cascade of events by a chemicalevents inside itself that now sends an electrical signal that says there is sweet here or there is sole here now having these receptors and my laboratory identify the receptors for all five basic taste glasses sweet bitters to many and most recently sour no completing the pilot you can now use the receptors to really map where are they found in the tongue in a very rigorous way this is no longer about use in ta cut and trying to figure out what your feeling but rather what you have in your tongue i this is not a gest this is now a feast gamma that is is de sweet receptors are found here the bitter are found here and when you do that you find that in fact every taste bat throw out your trial cavity has receptors for all of the basic taste glasses amazing and mas it turns out an unsure you will tell us important in terms of thinking about how the brain computes and codes is codes this thing we call taste is ism going to inject a quick question that ism sure is on many people's minds before we get back into the biological circuit which is many people including myself for familiar with the experience of drinking a see of tea or coffee that is too hot and burning my tongue is the way i wore land horrible and then disrupting my sense of taste for some period of time afterward yes when i experience that phenomenon that unfortunate phenomenon have i destroyed taste receptors that regenerate or have i somehow use temperature the distort the function of the circuit that i no longer taste the way i did before excellent question and the answers both it turns out that your taste receptors only leave for around two weeks and thespyte the way make sense because here you have an organ the tongue it that is continuously exposed to everything you could range from the nicest wo the most horrible possible things is your imaginationand it you need to make sure that these sells are always coming back in a way that i can a reexperience the world in the right way and this the ate organs that have the same and her lying logic of you are got your intestines are the same way amazing again there receiving everything that you invest got forbid what is there it from thespisies i know to the most horrible tastings or the most delicious and again this intestinal selves was all is to ultimately take all the neutrinos and bring them into the body also renewal in a very very fast cycle it o factory nuance in your nose is they y example then e yes your burning a lot of yourselves and is over for those the good now is that there on no come back but we know that when you burn yourself wit the did come back within then the mean its the remain as an hour and the shelter not renewing that in that time frank they're not listening to your needs they have their own internal cook stand s you are really affecting your damaging them in a way that they can recover and then they come back and you also them as your tomato sensory selves this are the cells that feel things not test things and then you wait half an hour or an then my goodness thin god it is back to normal and most the time i do not even notice the transition realizing as you tell me and out later all ask you about the relationship between over and taste but am as the next step along the circuit but subsume y invest some let us keep it simple a a sweet taste let us make it even it simpler but that the same time perhaps more infirmity let us copper and contrast sweet and bitter as we follow their lines from the tongue to the brain the first thing is that the two vogue diametrically opposed behaviors if we have to come up with two century experience that represent dollar opposites it would be sweet and bite they're no two collars that represemplear opposites because it is a black and white appear opposite to one that takes only one thing that when tit takes everything but they do not vogue thifferen behaviors even the medical parties have some over sweet and bitter are the two opposite ends of the sensory specter now a taste can be the fine by two features and again a my reduction i som reducing it in a way that i things easier to follow the signal and the two features are its quality and its vegans and vegans with a little v that is what we say inspans with a v i means the value of that experience i or in this case of that stimuli and you take sweet sweet as a quality and identity and that is what you and i would refer to us the taste o sweet we know exactly what it taste but sweet also has a positive valine which makes it incredibly attractive and appetite but is attractive an petty as it'll tell you a second independent of its identity and quality in fact we havebeen able to engineer animals were we completely remove the valine from the stimuli this animals can taste sweet and recognize it as sweet but it is no longer attractive it see us one more chemical stimuli and that is because the identity and the valine are encoded in two separate parts of the brain in the case of bitter again it has on the one hand its identity its quality and exactly what be taste i can taste now even as you described but it also has a valine and that is a negative valines because i the bogus averse behaviors are we on absolutely lie and it comes to my i remember telling some kids reason when the wren e got ice cream in it was interesting they looked up and they started smacking the we out actually to anticipatory responds absolutely the won we to about the gad brain en you will get there i then the signals if we followed now his two lines the really two separate keys at the two ends of the schmo and you firs one key and you activate sword you activate sweet cells throughout your oral cavity and they all converse into a group of sweet anurans in the next station which is sill outside the brain is one of the taste ganglia this are the anurans that interval your tongue and the royal cavity were the is i approximately an h son the we here but length notes more lasdugavit and and and their two main angina that intervale the vasmajority of old taste buds in the roll cavity and then from there that sweet signal goes on to the brains stem the bring them is the entry of the body into the brain and there different tries of the brains them and their different groups of anurans in the brains them and is as unique area in a unique a a a topographically the fine i location in the rostra side of the brains them that receives all of the taste input very dense area bran a very rich area of the brain exactly and from there the sweet signal goes to this other area higher a on the brain stem and then it goes to a number of stations where that sweet signal goes from sweet anuran to sweetenuron to sweet anuran to eventually get to your cortices and once it gets to your taste cortices that is were meaning is impose into that signal it is then and only then this is what the day the suggests that now you can identify these as a sweet stimuli and how quickly does that all happen i in a the time scale of the nervous system its fast and was non a second ye absolutely i rarely mistake better for sweet ye maybe with respect to people and my own poor judgment but but now you o lady respect ye it is and and in fact we can demonstrate this because we can stick electrons at each of the stations conceptionallyeh and we can stimulate e tons and then we can record the signals pretty much tiny log to stimulus delivery you deliver the stimuli and within a fraction of a second you see now the response in this following stations now it gets to the cortices e and now in there you impose meaning to that taste there is an area your brain that represents the taste of sweet in taste cortices and a different area the represents the taste of bitter in is not there is a topographic map of this take qualities inside your brain not we are going to do a thought experiment lie if this group of anurans in your cortices really represents the sense of sweet and is added different group of anurans in your brain represents the taste the reception of bitter then we should be able to do two things first i should able to go into your brain somehow silence this anurans find a way to prevent them from be inactivated and i can give you all the sweet you on and you will never know that your tasting sweet and conversely i should be able to go into your brain come up the way to activate of anurans well and giving you absolutely einathing and you are going a think that you're getting that full present and that is precisely what we have done and that is precisely what you get this of course is in the brain of my we be are usably in humans it would work absolutely the same the zero i have not no question this a taste to two important things the first to the prate terming nature of the sens of taste because it means i can go to these ports of your brain in the absence of any stimuli and have you to the fool behavior an experience in fact when we active in your cortices the bitter francs the animal can start gain but is drinking only water but the animal things thesgitting abirestimla is amazing and an de sequent jest to finish defines that the does not sound like delicious two things and then they only give you one listen is that i no i substantiates this this capacity of the brain segregate to separate in in this notes of action the representation of these two diametrically oppose perhaps which is sweet for example verses be threat i say amazing and that is also amazing is the following you told us earlier in your absolutely correct of course that the end of the day whether not its one group of groans over here in another group of earns over there so it turns out to be electrical activity is the generic common language of both sets of anurans that raises the question for me of whether or not those separate sets of anurans are connected to areas of the brain that create this sense of valance or whether no the simply created connect excuse me to sets of anurans that e woke distinct behaviors of moving towards and inhaling more and licking or aversive are we essentially interpreting our behavior and our micro responses or or mocha responses in our behaviors the consequence of the person excellent excellent question first the answer is the going a area of the brain were valance is impose and that are is known as the amigdema and the sweet nuransco to a different area than the birinurans now i went ne do athoghtic sperm because i think your ordains my appreciates let say i activate this group of anurans and the animatincreasi sleeking and m activating the swetnurans and that is expected because now is in o tasting the this this water as was sugar in a the is moves transforming water into wine in these case we en and to the pass over satin these an appropriating o example it were transforming it into in in intersect it but but how do i know how do i now that activating them is evoking a positive feeling inside a goodness a satisfaction oi love it verses am get increasing liking which is the ate often because all we seeing is that the animal is sleeking more and we are trying to unfairer that that means that is feeling something really good verses what that piano line is going back straight into the tongue and all is doing is forcing it to move faster well we can actually separate is by doing experiments that allows to fundamentally distinguish them and imagine the following experiment and when i take the animal and when a putting inside a box that has two sides and the two sides have features at making different one has yellow little toys the thy one has green toys one has little in a black strives the toy one has blue stripes the animal can tell tit to haves i take the mouse putting inside this arena this play arena and it will explorer and puts around both sides with equal frequency and now what ism going to do is and when i active this anurans the sweet rooms every time the animal is on the side with the yellow stripes and if that is creating a positive internal state what would the animal now want to do i will wane to stay on the side with the yellow stripes there is no licking here the animal is not extending its strong every time ism activating the number this is known as a place preference last and it is generally us is just one form of any different ten to them on straight that thy activation of a group of needs in the brain is imposing for example positive verses and negative valiant where if the do the same thing by activating the bitter hurts the animal will actively one now to stay a way from the side were these anurans are being active and that is precisely what you say and that is precisely men i say many people including myself or familiar with the experience of going to a restaurant eating a variety of foods and then fortunately does not happen not often but then feeling very sick i learn coming up in narrow science that this is one strong example of one trial learning that from that point on it is not the restaurant or the wars or the weight her or the date but it is my notion of it had to have been the shrimp that leads me to then want to avoid shrink in every contact may be even shrink powder you got it for a very long time i can imagine all the adapt evolutionarily adaptive reasons why this such a phenomenon would exist do we have any concept of wear in this path we a do exist we we we know actually a significant around a at a general level if in fact more than shrink oysters are even at more dramatic exampled done bad oyster of it is old you need to be driving that way for the next six months i think because texture alone is some that on is t a can a jo oysters i despise tossers despise shrimp not the animal but the taste and and yet oysters for some reason ta in yet to have a bad i sign hes any by the way you not texture is hared to get over but wens you get over it is delicious that is what they tell me we were not in salute at one fine and i it'll give a cluck to she o of a and o a a myosotis and they have amazing any and have have tried it twice an i it is a am over to it it is somehow the texture out waits any kind of the deliciousness es people ti at a very acquired taste slay beer if you t i grew up in chili that is where the excellent comes from in case any one wonder a by time what the time i came here to gradiscoolli was nineteen too old to the o overtime my heavy chilly accent soon here i am for the years fifty years late equine we were the lass we are had i steal sound a yes came off bebop in chilly you do not drink beer when you are young you drink wine ye not chilly a hurts wine producer when they came to the yours all of my in a classmates yo know were drinking beer because they et no they have finished college were they were old in of your drinking and e a radio school your working eighteen hours a day every day the a they not relax let go and have some beers and brass cheaper avers chap and we were being clearly underpay me i a e i could not do it it is an acquire taste e was too lad by then and here i am ye now sixty pass and if you take all the beer have drunken my entire life i would say they add to let than a eight sounds glass of water in pressed well your health is probably after aware ism not our your physical he at e no e goes back to e o a acquire taste the the connection to any and to oysters now going back to to the one trial learning ye knot the sees the great thing of our brains certain thing s we need to repeat a hundred times to learn them a lo operator can i have the full number for such otaplice and then you will give it to you over the for at least in the old days and then you need to repeat it to yourselves over never never her the next minute you can die out such gotta and five minutes later it is gone that is what we call working memory then there is the shorter memory if we part our for and i were lucky by the and of the day we remember wore it's and then there is the long term memory we remember the birthdays of ever en of our children for the rest of our lives for the evens that a single went stomatic the end active wads the circuits in a way that it is a ontroyal learning and the taste system is literally at the top of that foot chain and there is ha phenomena known as condition taste aversion you can pair an attractive stimulate with a really bad one and you can make an animal begin to vehemently dislike for example sugar and that is because you have condition the animals to now be averse to the otherwise nice says because he is being associated with my lades and when you do that now you to begin to ask why ten change in the signal as e travels from the tons to the brain in a normal animal versus an animal where you have now transform sweet from being attractive to being aversive and this is the way now you begin to explore how the brain changes the nature the quality the meaning of a stimuli as a function of its state i have ut number of questions related to that o all of which relate to the idea of contact because you mention before that flavor is distinct from taste because you favor involve smell texture temperature and i some other features only we urchin being a ad example i can i can sense the texture it ashes it now i will not describe what it what it reminds me of for various reasons the ability to place content on into to insert context into a perception or rather to insert a perception into context is is powerful and there's an element of and a mystery about it but if we start to think about some of the more new ones that we to live at the edge as you as you say how how many different tastes on e taste dial go back to your analogy early of the color die do you think that there could be for something as unfixed as bitter forinsence i i do not think i bitter taste but i some fermented foods that seem to have a little bit of sour and have a little bit of broth that briny the flavor how much plasticity do you think there is there and in particular across the life seen because i think one of the most salient examples of this is that kids do not seem to certain vegetables but they all are hard wire to sweet taste and yet you could also imagine that one of the reasons why they may eventually grow to incorporate vegetables is because of some knowledge that vegetables might be good for you better for them is there a change in the receptors the distribution the number of sensitively et camera they can explain the transition from wanting to avoid vegetables to being willing to vegetables simply in childhood to to rivals the a when i take the question slightly differently by that thing it would illustrate the point and and an when i is illusion i use they difference between the factory system and the taste system to make the point the sister five baby palates sweet is our bits to of money each of them has a predetermine identity we know exactly what an failings this are attracted this reverse in the factory system it is claim that we can smell millions of different others yet for the most part none of them haven in made predetermine meaning in the factory system meaning is imposed by learning and experience even the smell of smoke ism wen i give you ism won a make it different the are a handful of the millions of others that were claim that that you could immediately tell me the are aversion and this are attracted women only it is not correct because i can assure you that there cultures and societies were things which are far the appealing than come do not evoke an aversive reaction really really for would be maybe as universal ism not looking filaments or fir months are in the different category that trigger invade responses but nearly every other is afforded meaning by learning and experience and that is why you brokenly and i despise properly because i remember my father forcing me to eat broke same sensory experience it alright the the are come wo the two important things in the case of taste you have nuwruncs at every station that there for sweet for sour for bitter for salty ane money it is only five classes it is not anna take a lot of you brain if we can infant smell a million others and every one us a others had to have predetermine meaning there is no on a be enough brain yes to a accommodate that one sense and evolution in its infinite wisdom it i evolve a system where you put together a pathway and a cortex of after aortic were you have the capacity to associate every over in a specific contacts that now gives it the meaning now it is go back to the original question them other than clearly plastic make a plastic because it is it is fundamental basis and neural organization but taste we has told you that see o predetermine hard wire but predetermine hard wore it as a means not modulated by learning or experience it only means that you are born in sweet and disliking bitter and we have many examples of plasticity beer being one example what why do we learn to laugh beer is in a coffee is because it has an associated gain to the system and that gain to the system that positive veilings that emerges out of that negative signal is sufficient to create positive association and in the case of beer of course is but gall the feeling good that we get after is more than sufficient to say i would not have more of this and in the case of coffee of course is casa in activating a whole group of nourterasmited systems that give you that that that high associated with coffee yes this ta sister is changeable it is valuable and is subjected to learning and experience but i the factory system is restricted e in what you could do with it because it is go is to allow you to get neutrinos ans revive the go of the factory sister is very different is being used not in our case but in every animal species to in a identify friend versos f to identify made to identify ecological niches the wen a being it place a very broad roll that then requires that it be set a organ ice and function in a very different type of conic taste is bowed can we get e neuterance we need to revive and can we insure that we attracted to the ones we meet and we averse wit the ones the are going to keel us have been overusing plecely con reductions but i thinker illustrates push difference between these tool keep sentries i i do nothing of been a rely simplicity i think it it illustrates the the key intractable nature of this system in the way you have approached it and i think it is important for people to hear that because everybody as we are mystified with empathy in love et camera in a fairness to that ism going to ask o a sort of a hi level questioner abstract question this was based on a conversation i had with a former girl friend were we talking about chemistry between individuals i very complicated topic on the one and but on the other hand quite simple in that certain people for whatever reason evoke a tremendous sense of arousal for lack of a better word between two people one would hope at least for some period of time died you did not now it these was that kind of a pother no wo the reason i ho but this as to do with taste because she said something i think in part to a maybe irritate me a bit but but we were commenting not about our own experience of each other but of some one that she was now very excited about were on good terms ah and she said what do you think it is this thing of chemistry suede she was trying to warned you to o t coming warn me out's come and she said i have a feeling something about it is in smell and something about it is actually in taste literally the taste of somebody is breath that is the way she described it and i thought that it was a very interesting example number of reasons but in particular because it gets to the merging of odor and taste but also to the idea that of course the context of a new relationship of assuming and in fact there both attractive people et camera there whole contact there but have had the experience of the odor of somebody is breath being aversive not because i could identify it as aversive because we isn't because it just didn't it bet bet that but that is because you associated we would at others that treader that nay ate you no aversive reaction by the way absolutely there are certain organs to me that a reverse you got it and there there are other sense in a a can recall sense of of skin of foods et camera that are immensely appetitive i have experienced both sides of this actuation myself and she was describing this and to me more than tasting wine which is the typical example were people inhale it and then they drink it to make seems something that more people might be able to relate to that certain things and people smell delicious even mothers describing the smell of their babies he we a father o as a a me an a the at our own babies of welkin their next that is the magic o place sat the back of their neck eye on my goodness i have a grandchild now i know exactly what real that his name smells o cat more beautiful examples always more funnily at the beautiful possibly a aleditof examples the smell of the back of your grandson's neck yes and you could not you could get more postal an o most what is going on in terms of the commination of over and taste given that these two systems are different yes and and they come together ultimately there is a place in the brain were they come together to the grate the two into what we would call ye know that century experience and it'll tell yo an experiment than you could do that them on trace the within in in a thing is good for the in a forts or for the audience here to get a sense of how we approach is problems that we can get in a meaning full scientific answers we know were the up factory cortices is in the brain we know where the taste aortic is in the brain there into different places we can go to each of the to cortices pull color traces we put green in one we put red in the adit and we see were the colors go to that a reflection a word of anurans a projection a projecting to into their next targets once they get the signal word to they send the signal to and then we reach on that the over and taste come to get a somewhere in the brain we should find an area that now it is getting red and green color and we found such an area and next we anticipated we poetize that maybe this is the area in the brain of the mouse corresponding are in the brain of humans that the grates other and taste it is known this determine normally uses molly sensory into erasion and if this is true we could do the following experiment we can train a mouse to lit sweet and if they guess correctly that that is supposed to be sweet they should go now to the right port to the right side to get a water reward if they go to the lift when the was sweet then there incorrect and they get no reward and they actually get a time out now the miss are thirties of their very cultivated to perform and if you repeat this task a hundred times a hundred trials incredibly now this animal learn to recognize the sweet and execute the right action and by their action we now are being told what that animal is tasting we can make it more interesting a we can give sweet and bitter and say e sweetmeat to the right and is bitter go to the lift and after you train i this miss with ninety percent accuracy will tell you when you rundonise now the stimuli what was sweet and what was bitter high we can now do the same experiment but now weeks taste with order and say if you gat other alone go to the right or push this liver in mice if you get taste alone go to this other part or push this ate liver and if you get it two together do the something else and if you train the miss the miss are able now to report back to you when is sensing taste alone other alone or the weeks expense exceed now we can go to the brain of these mice and go to the triad that we now and cover discover as being the side of mouth century integration between taste and order and silence it prevent it from being activated experimentally and if that ere we really represent it the integration of this too the animals should still be able to recognize the taste alone the still should be able to recognize the order alone but show be incapable now to recognize the weeks and exactly as predicted that is exactly what you get alright the brain is basically a series of engineer circuits complex you gat and our task i see not to figure out how can we scrape this amazing arch texture of these circuits in a way that we can begin to uncover the mysteries i know of the brain and why certain people's breath tastes good another pe exactly not good i never answer that but i told you how we can figure a wherein the brain is happening as we have been having this discussion i thought a few times about similarities to the visual system or differences to the visual system visual system their couple of phenomenon that i wonder if they also exist in the taste system the visual system we know for instance that if you look at something long enough and activate the given receptors long enough that object will actually disappear we offset this with little michoive moments et camera but the principle is a fundamental ones habituation or dessensensation everyone seems to call it something different but you get the idea of course in the taste system ism certainly familiar with eating something very very sweet for the first time in a long time and t feel taste very sweet but a few more licks a few more bites and now it taste not as sweet with all faction and familiar with a odor in a room i do not or i in than it disappearing similar phenomenon where does that occur and can you imagine a sort of a system by which people could average that because i do think that most people are interested in eating not more sugar but less sugar i think we had better ways to approach that and we can transition from taste into the ale circuits that makes sugar extraordinarily impossible not to consume impossible exactly more it were it that the the the sincytie seen happens that is he term that we used and it is i think it happening tat multiple stations it is happening at the recapture level i e the selling your tongue that air sensing ta sugar as you activate these receptor and the trigurin activity afteractivelity of interactivity eventually ouexsauce to receptragin and using terms which are extraordinarily loose i but for sinuous discoveries sake of ten the discuss of the recapture its to a point were ye undergoes a sate of changes chemical changes were it now signal far less efficiently or e even gets removed from the surface of the cell and now what will happen is that the same amount of sugar will trigon far less of our response and that is a huge side of the modulation and then the next i believe es the integrated again loss of signaling that happens by continuous activation of the circuit at each of these different neral stations in others from the tongue to the gangly from the ganglia to the first station in the brains them a siconstation in the brains them to the thalamus than to the cortices there multiple steps tat the signally travelling now you might say why these e naval line why did you need to have many stations and that is because the taste system is important to and surer that you get what you need to survive that it has to be subjected to modulation by the internal state and each of this nod provides a new site to give it plasticity and modulation not necessarily to change the way that something tastes but tonsure that you consume more or lest of differ or differently of what you need and when i give you one example of of how the internal sate changes the way the taste system works salt is very appetitive at low concentrations and that is because we need it it is our electralibalance requires sol every one of the murals use ten set as the most important of the ions what potassium to insure that you can transfer this electrical signals within a between from but that high concentrations the say ocean water is incredibly aversive and we all now this because we gone to the ocean and then when you get in your mouth it is not that grate however if i sold deprive you and we can do this in in experimental models by readily i now this incredibly high concentration of salt one molar sodimgloy becomes amazingly a petit even attractive what is going on in here your to is telling you this is horrible but your brain is telling you i don care you need it and this is what we call the modulation of the take system by the internal state presume my if one is hungry enough even on what take good just get you leanly wide on the money none of this is exactly for or if your thirsty and angry you suppress hanger that you do not waste watermolicules ingesting food why because if your thirsty and you have no water you will die within a week or but you can going a angry strike as long as you have watered for months because you are going to eat a old your energy reserves water is a different story you could see or o or that that h they are multiple layers at which the taste system that guides our drive and our motivation to consume the nutria's we need has to be modulated in response to the internal state and of course internal sale itself as to be modulated by theater in a world i and that i thinks a reason why what could otherwise we have been an incredibly simple sister from belong to the morticing one yes where it is not because you have to insure tat he know each state you give the sister the lively oflixilility were were we calling our science blestisit think we are headed into the got but i have a question that has just been on my mind for a bit now because i was drinking this water and it has essentially no taste yes is there any kind of signal for the absence of taste despite having something in the mouth and here is why i ask whet ism thinking about is saliva and while it is true that if i eat a lot of very highly palatable foods that does change how i experience more bland foods i must confess when i eat a lot of these highly process foods i do not particularly them i tend to crave healthier foods but that is probably for contextual reasons about neutrons et camera but i could imagine an experiment where is there a taste of no taste ribs their taste of no taste because in the visual system there is i you close the eyes and you start getting increases in activity individual system as supposed to decreases which often surprises people but the reasons for that because everything is about signal to noise signal to background and in es a good question i can sell you that most of our work is trying to focus on how the tastier works not how it does not work not let me that been he it i know any life and i knew when in voting y add you setting myself a on an on a on a different we are trying to learn thing i o however o i listen i i was mean in this is seem mother and it'll say it here for the second ash i recorded a podcast recently with a very prominent podcast it let freedmen pigs and i made reference to the called new york nor science mafia i will not say whether not we are sitting in the presence of new york hero science mafia member that in any event i i know the sorts of riding in the thin privy those listening this is the kind of hazing that happens benevolent hazing a in macadamia i the tar of course it is it is if it is a sign o li is i in a tell me that i at always about the science in the i i but but a ta thing merest in question look i i i do not know the answer and and i do not even know how i would explore it in a way that you would rigorously teach me e but i u you let me tell ye i am asking and than all offer an experiment yes that it'd love to see someone ages n a to thing about saliva yes with it is no knot not but that we know that we can figure it to lastly but the question is whether or not the saliva in a fed state is distinct from the saliva in an unfed state such that it mogul its no the sensicun that i er siren has been done no has been done you and the answer is now it is not and you i and the way you could do t h experiment is because we use artificial saliva ts o another a not of tears canon o we i do not mean that you got to wulgerings that you i a ye wing my lavoratoring we know the composition of saliva and you can make such a thing and and and and you can take in a taste solving culture or in a tong where you wash it out of and then you can apply artificial alive and what happens is a desisted mes being engineer to the densities to be cam i a apostate for saliva to become invisible e and there is no difference on the state of the animal what is the reason that you experiment absolute a i does not feet any grand have otitis an ne i a pure curiosity that curiosity kill the cant i do but toils o the career of a sin arsing as drives as a varying e they of our lives exactly o err if it is not saliva and apparently it is not a what about internal state and what aspects of this the internal mill you are relevant because there is autonomic there is a sleep and away the sutra o one of the questions that i i got up from hundreds of people when i solicit questions in advance this episode was why do i crave sugar when ism stressed for instance an not to be contextual but what a the basics it makes us feel good by the way will get to that it is you ad tits answer voted i actives e what am willing to generically referred to as we ward plecrsenteres in a way that i dramatically e it changes our internal state this using a why do we ta gal ice cream when were very depress in fact this is a good always to going the into into this entire different world e e of of the body telling your brain what you need in i in in in in important things sugar in fact e o get a any ways going you ware going to us something well now i i would to discuss the most basic elements of internal state in particular the ones that are below our conscious detection and this is a a of course is i saga into this incredible landscape which is the gut brain access which i then fifteen years ago was almost a maybe it was a an are the holsters at at meeting and an now believe you you and others there company's the have companies there are on active research programs there on and beautiful work o many to describe some of that work that you and others have been involved and and a lot of the listeners of this pockets will have heard of the gotbrain access and there a lot of misconceptions about the gotbrain aces many people things that this means that we think with our stomach because of the cot an coot feeling aspect but a off you to talk about the aspects of got bring signalling that drive our change our perceptions and behaviors that are completely beneath our war yes excellent let me begin may be by by stating that in the brain needs to money tour the state of every one of our organs organs it has to do it this is the only way that the brain cabin sure that every one of those organs are working to git it in a way that we have healthy physiology now this money during of the brain is bee known for a long time but i think what can't been fully appreciated that this is a two way highway were the brain is not only money to in but is now mod laying back what the body needs to do and that includes all the way from money during the frequency of hard beats and the way that inspiration and aspirations in the breading cycle operate to what happens when you invest sugar and fat now let me give you an example again of of am of how the brain can take what we would refer to contextual associations and transforming into incredible changes in physiology and metabolism in remember palm pavlova in this classical experiments in conditioning associated condition in ye would take a bell it will ring the bell every time it was going to feed the dog and eventually the dog learn to associate the ringing of the bell with foot coming now the first incredible finding i made it is the fact that the dog now in the presence of the bell alone will star to salute and we will call that i o neurologically speaking an anticipatory response o a i could understand it i get it in ow news in the brain that form tat as nation now represent foods coming and the sending a sign to more entrance to go into your salivary glance to squire them you release i now in now saliva because you nofullis coming but what is even more remarkable is that those animals are also releasing insulting in response to a ball oi this illustrate one part of this two way highway the highway going down somehow the brain create this associations than their anurans in your brain now that no food is coming and send a sign somehow a away down to your pancreas the now it says release insulin because sugar is coming down this cossack to the magic of the brain is tat never ending sorts of bottom and intrigue how the he do they dots it i mean the transit i are i sharer ta li an fascination there is another day or a lecture or a some talks are better than others or that where i do not sit back and just think it is absolutely in yearn me now now over the past in a dozen years i and with great force over the last five years now the main highway that is communicating the state of the body with the brain as been and cover as been what we now referred to us the gat brain access and the highway is a specific handle of nerves i now with it may else from the vegan ganglia the notes ganglia and is the vaguest nerve that it is enervating the majority of the organs in your body it is many boring their function sending a signal to the brain and now the brain going back down and saying this is going a right do this of this is not going well do that and and i should point out as you well know every organ spring archers e on mast the all mast be monitor then fat in i now i have no out that theseases that we abnormally associated with metabolism physiology and even immunity are likely to emerge as diseases conditions states of the brain i do not in obesity is a the cease of metabolism i believe obesity is a the cease of brain circuits i do as well yet and and and and this this this e that we have i now been working on for the longest time because in the polities that were dealing wit are in the body nodding the head in a late tuition to view of course this issues and problems as being one of metabolism physiology and for they remain to be the carriers of the ultimate signal but the brain ultimately appears to be the conductor of the orchestra of philologian mitavolies r no that is go to the gad brain and super may pes is i am in the the the vaguest nerve has a in popular culture has been in kind of converted into this since meaning of coming path ways mostly because she have to tip my hat to the yogic community was among the firs to talk about values on and on and on there are coming pathways to called part sympathetic pathways within the bags but i think that the more we learn about the values the more it seems an entire asset of neral connections as the bus to one nerve a just wanted to just mentionthat because i think a lot of people have heard about the vaguest turns out experimentally in the laboratory many nerd scientists will stimulate the vaguest to create states of alertness and arousal when animals or even people believe it or not are close to dying or going into coma stimulation of the vaguest as one of the ways to wake up the brain counter to the idea that it is just the si way of coming oneself new and also of course a me what one has to be cautious their in that the the the de basest nerve is made out of many thousands of fivers in a individual fivers that make the gigantic handle and it is lightly as words speaking the each of these fivers carries a slightly different meaning throne necessary one by one may be five five or ten five or twenty to then but they carry meaning that is associated with their specific task this couple fivers is telling the brain about the state of your heart the couple over is stilling the brain about the state of your got this is telling your bring about its nutritional state this your panties this your land and they are again to make the same simple example the keys of the spinal yes your right there is a a old of tad y showing that activating the entire saga handle has very m aging for effecting a wide range of conditions in fact it is being used to treat untractable depression though stimulator epileptic fissures but again there thousands of fivers carrying different functions to some degree in a this is turning they lies on the stadium because you need to illuminate were you lost your keas under your see yet ten thousand bolls of a thousand was each a just come on only one of these is pointing to wore and am enough that one of them happened to point to my sit here you accurate the handle thousands of fivers am enough that some of this happen to do something to make a meaning for difference in depression or to make a meaning for difference in thepolipivs but it should not be meson true as arguing that this broad activation as any type of selectivity or specificity where yes lucky enough that among all the things are being ton some of those happen to change the biology of these processes now there reach on this is realivent because the magic of this gad brain axes it is the fact that you have these thousands of fivers really doing different functions an our gold and along with many a the great i now sciences i including steep linerless that started a lot of in o this molecular detection on this segue all gat brain communication line at harbor it is trying to uncover what there each of those lines doing what are each of this keys of these piano plain what is the lotus there just as a brief upset i no seemingly release am i thing i was there when he got is toward hers and i did not slow us on always grade to get be by excellent and o first of hl ism happy you diadem because that way you can focus on this amazing outcasts i but i was very gracious of you om it is always a feels better it is not good to get been out by excellent people seen serves a in is i second tone and he is the fining as you said the molecular om constituents of different elements of these many many fibers is there an plan there are the finding multiple parallel path was i they are they are some that control hard be some that control the respiratory cycle some that i being involved in the gas trip movement in to this notion that your for and you feel full in part because your god gets distended your stomach for example it and hin there little census that a reading that and telling the brain your fool to as e so will soon change on the base as f of liberty is another way innocence thing we are learning enough about is dis dislikes eh it that could really help put to get it is this holistic view of how the brain it is truly changing both physiology metavolisman immunity the part that has not been yet developed and that it needs a fair among of word but it is an exciting thrilling the during of discovery is how the signal comes back to now chain that biology not example i gave you before with pavlovas dog eh li i figure out how the association created is long between the bell but in how dos the brainpan the pancreas to release in the right amount of angry to a tell me came let me tell you it about the gad brain access and our insatiable appetite for sugar and fat insatiable for sugar and quenchable for fat and this is story about the fundamental difference between liking and wanting liking sugar is the function of the taste system and it is not really liking sugar is liking sweet ontic sugar our never ending appetite for sugar is the story of the gad brain access liking verses wanting and this work is work of of my own laboratory know that began long ago when we discover the sweet receptors and you can now engineer miss that lack is receptors innocence this animals would be unable to taste sweet life you sweetness ow horrible and if you give a normal mouse a bottle containing sweet and we are going to put the sugar or an artificial sweeter i they bother sweet they have slightly different tastes but that is simply be cost artificial sweet nurse have some off tastes but as far as the sweet receptors concern they both active the same receptors trigger the same signal and if you give an animal an option of a bottle containing sugar or sweetener versus water this animal will doing ten to one from the bottle containing sweet that is the taste system it and will go a sample is one legs a couple of lies and in the a a that is the one i one because is a petty and because i love it prefers sugar to artificial sweeten no no no no no wo the sister sis experiment this experiment and when i pud only sweet in one bottle and it could be either sugar artificial sweeter i that is a mother wish one or they we are going to do the next experiment were we separate of to for now i sweet versus water and sweet means sweet not sugar sweet means anything that taste sweet o i and sugars on example and slender is another exam ascertain on later o was the fly i you open matter ye a i there same that only humans can taste mice can not taste because there we captures between humans and mice a different but we have put the human receptor into me we engineer mice and we complete human ice this mouse is taste world o i but for the purpose of this conversation we are only comparing sweet versus water a option my goodness the will like to no in in from the sweet side ten to one at least verses the water make sens old now we are going to take the mice and we are going to genetically engineer it to remove the sweet receptors this mice no longer have in the oral cavity any sensors that can detect sweetness be that sugar molecule bead an artificial sweetener with anything else o last sweet and if you give this mice an option between sweet versus water sugar versus water artificial soneverss water it were drink equally well from both because he can not tell them apart because don't have the receptors for sweet that sweet bottle taste was water make sens very now we are going to do the experiment with sugar from now on this focus an sugar an wen a give a mouse now sugar versus water normal mouse will drink from the sugar sugar sugar sugar very little from er water no cow the sweet receptors de eliminating mouse can no longer tell them apart and it will drink from both but if i keep the mouse in that case for the new forty eight hours something extraordinary happens when i cam forty eight hours later and i see what the mouse is licking or drinking from the mouse is drinking almost exclusively from the sugar bottle how could this be it can not taste it those naves sweet receptors during thus forty right hours the mouse learn that there is something in that bottle that makes me feel good and that is the bottle i want to consume now how does the mouse identify that bottle it dos by using atercensory features the tell of the bottle the texture of that solution inside sugar the high concentrations is kind of goofy the side is in which the bottle is in the cage it don't matter one but the mouse realized there is something there that makes me feel good and that is what i want and that is the fundamental basis of our unconscionable desire and our craving for sugar and is mediated by the gat brain access the first true is that it takes a long time to develop immediately suggesting a post digestive effect we reason if this is true and is the gat brain access that driving sugar preference then this should be a group of anurans in the brain that our responding to post digestive sugar and lowed behold identify a group of nurse in the brain that that is and this anurans receive their mud directly from the gat brain access from other no you gadded and what is happening is that sugar is recognize normally by the tongue activates an apery response now you in tested and now yo activates a selective group of sells in yourintestings that now send a signal to the brain be a the legal angle that sis i gat what i need the tongue hasn't now that you gat what you need it only knows that you tasted it the now that you gat to the point that is going to be used which is the gat and now is sens the signal to you rein force the consumption of this thing because this is the one that i needed sugar source of energy anis a these neurons in the got they are dot turns in the god for this are gad sells that recognize the sugar moleguasy send a signal and that signal is receive by the vaguanuran directly got it and the sends a signal through the gad brain axes to the sell bodies of this francs in the vagualganglia and from there to the brain stem to now treasure the preference for sugar to question is one you mention that these sells that detect sugar within the got are actually within the intuition you did not sis stomach you surprise me rising got as stomach i do not no or now in yo as their investing because that were all the portion happens you want the signal you see you want the brain to know that you had successful ingestion and break down of whatever you consume into the building blocks of life and in a bucks and minoacates fat and you want a make sure that once they are in the form that intestines can now absorb them is where you get the signal back saying this what i one one now let me us take it one step further and this now sugar policies activates this unique got brain circuit that now drives the development of our preference for sugar now a key element of this circuit is a the senseless in the gat that recognize the sugar do not recognize artificial sweetness at all not because their nutrient value is uncoupled from the taste generically speaking one can make that by this because it is a very different type of receptors as turns out that s not the tongue receptors being use in the got is a completely different model that only recognize the glucosmolegul not artificial sweetness this as a profound impact the effect of ultimately artificial sweetness in curving our appetite our craving our insatiable desire for sugar since they do not activate the gat brain axes they will never satisfy the craving for sugar sugar was and the reason i believe that artificial sweetness have failed in the market to curve our appetite our need our desire for sugar is because they beautifully work on e tongue the liking to recon nice sweet verses non sweet but the fell to active the geysenseresting the gat that now inform the brain you got sugar no need to crap any more the the the issue of wanting i can we relate that to a particular set of narrow chemicals upstream o the pathway is the glucose is activating the cells in the gut that through the vagus that is communicated through the seemly the notes gangling and up into the brainstand very good and from their wort as it go at where is it go and what is the substrate of wanting i a of course i think molecules opening craving as a book even call the molecule of more et camera et camera dope is a very diabolical molecule as because it evokes both a sense of pleasure is but also a sense of desiring more of craving in if i understand you correctly artificial sweeteners are and i gree are failing as a means to satisfy sugar craving at the level of nutrient sensing and yet if we trigger this true sugar evoke wanting pathway too much and we have all experiences than we eat sugar and we find ourselves wanting more and more sugar now that could also be insolent this regulation but a can we uncouple those leave look it we have a make a problem we over consumption of sugar and thought in we are facing a unique time in our evolution were the series of mile nutrition are due to over nutrition i we how nuts is that e i mean historically the sees of monnetretions have always been lean to and their nutrition and we need to come up with stratagem the convenienfully change the activation of these circuits their control our wanting certainly in the populations an risk and the is got brain circuit the ultimately it is the lines of communication that are informing the brain the presence of investing of sugar in these example it is a very important target in the way we think about is their way that we can meaningfully modulate the circuits i make your be ain think that you got satisfy with sugar even though ism not giving you sugar that immediately was the question are the receptors for glucose in these got sells susceptible to other things that are healthier for us that is very good excellent idea and i think an important gold will be to come up with e strategy and identify this very means that allow us to modulate circuits in a way that certainly for all of those were these is a big sue e can really have a in a dramatic imp in improving i human heart i could be wrong about this and unhappy to be wrong ism oft an wrong on and told ism wrong that we have sells within are got the conscious sense sugar gucks into be specific but also sells within are got the sensimino acids and fatyacids i could imagine a sonaryowere one could train themselves to feel and immense amounts of society from the consumption of foods that are rich in essential fadiacids a men acids perhaps less colonic or less om insolent deregulating then sugar it'll use myself as an example have always enjoyed sweets but in the last few years for some reason i started to lose my appetite for them probably because i just do not eat them any more at first that took some restriction now i just do not even think about it yean you're not rain forcing the circuits and you innocence are are are removing yourselves from bat you ten to be the exception in a we have a a huge a huge a incredibly large number of people there being continuously exposed to highly crosses foods et and hidden that called hidden sugar t did not even have to be hidden i now it is right there hiding i sing aside ye i i dread much as made of hidden sugars that om we often overlooked that they are there are also the over meme we can have a long discussion on the importance of coming up with strategies you know that could meaningfully change public held when he comes to nutrisue but i when they just go back to the notion of i of these brain centers that are ultimately the once the being activated by these essential outrank sugar satin the minoacits are building blocks of our diets and these is that gross all animaspiesies it is not unreasonable in to sum that thidicated brain circuits wit have evolved tin sure the recognition the ignition and the rein horsemen that that is what i need and indeed in o animals if all the to systems it one is the last sister that allows you to recognize i and prefer these pretteterming hard wire immediate responses is on my goodness this is take good is sweet i personally have a sweet both my my an and in all i gone is delicious is fancy for whammy recognizing the minoasit that is the liking pot wit it bat in the wisdom of evolution that good but does not quite do it you wan i make sure that this things get to the place where there needed and the not needed in your tongue there needed in yurintestings where they are going to be assure as the neutriance that will support life and the brain ones to now this and i one know it in a way that you can now form the association between that that i yestastit is what gat worst needs to be and it makes me feel good and now next time that i have to choose what should i eat that association now guide me to that is the one i one i want that fruit not that fruit i one dos leaves not dose leaves because this are the once that actively the right circuits that in sure that the right neutrino got to the right place and told the brain this is what i ant and need are we on rig one thing that intrigues me and puzzles me is is that this effect took a couple of days at least in mice yes and the sensation of are the perception of days is immediate is immediate and yet this is a slow system and in a beautiful way but in a can a mysterious way the wine is able to couple the taste of a sweet drink with the experience of nutrient extraction in the god under a contact where the mouse and the human is presently insulting other things smelling other me and other people that is incredible ye but you have to think of it not as as humans remember we inherited the circuits of our sisters and they through evolutionary from their ancestors and we have not had that many in a years to have fundamentally change in many of these hard wire circuit forget as humans its to get animals in the while one which is step now to comprehend the logic in why should testy a long time of continual reinforcement even that i can tasted in a icon you want a measure that these sours of sugar for example in the while is he base is the riches is the one were a get the most energy for the least among of extraction the least amount of war i when i did not defy rich sources of sugar and if the stand simply response immediately to the first sugar that gets to your gat your on a form the association we those sources of food which are not the new that you should be eaten from do not fall in love with the first person you encounter on my goodness exactly they and evolutionarily by having the taste sister giving you the immediate recognition but then by forcing these midbrain aces to reinforce it only when sustain in a repeat it exposure has inform the brain this is the one you do not wont a form the altercation before and in a when we remove from the contacts of we no we ascot to i not the supermarket we are not hunting there in the while where i need to form and what is happening is that highly process foods are his jacking go option desircuits in a way that you would have never happened in nature and then we not only find these things up a pity van palatable condition we are continuously reinforcing in o the wanting in a way that all my god is great what do i f lit getting let me have more of these you have just forever change the way that i think about supermarkets and restaurants it there understanding this fast signalling and a slower signalling the utility of having both makes me realize that supermarkets and restaurants are about the most unnatural thing for or up was am ever almost almost illrevolent of living in small villages with very few a suitable nights verses on neat inference it would a a noon to make a dustmen cold er because they do serve an important purpose i us one ye but and to supermarkets thing ow it it i thing there not the culprits eating the compress of course yo know it r r or reliance on on foots that are not necessarily healthy now going back to the supermarket did do not fulling one with the forest in need to work you take you you take at tangerine and you take an extract of tangerine that you used to cook that spike the my with sugar and you equalize in both were they both provide the same amount of calories if you eat them both they won't have a very different effect in your god brain acts and your system once you make the attic and you progestin and you at it process sugar i knot to use it now to cook to add to make it really sweet enduring thing now you are providing now fully ready to use broken down source of sugar in the tangerine that sugar it seeks in the complexity of a whole sat robot e came can components fiver long chains of sugar modicums that need a huge amount of work by your stop at your gat system to break it down you are using a huge amount of energy to extract energy and the balance it is very different that when i take these process highly extracted angering by the way i used tenuring because i had a enduring yest before it came in delicious they are doggie it and and these goes back to the sops of supermarket and to to to some degree n a giving a choice you do not when it process ugly process foots because everyday is alreadybeen broken down for you and your sister has no work and you're cooking high jacking the circuits in a way that ere being activated at a time scale that normally would not happen this is why i i often feel that and i think a lot of at are now start support the idea that while indeed the laws of thermodynamic supply calories invested verses calories burn is a very real thing right that the appetite for certain foods and the the wanting and the liking are phenomena of the nervous system brainpan got as you beautifully described and that that changes over time depending on how we are receiving these nutria absolutely look i we have a it of work to do am toking the society am not tong about you and i we also have a lit a wentetnow i i think underspending the circuits it is given us important insights and how ultimately hopefully we can proof human heart and make a meaningful difference now it is very easy to try to de know connect did not a to bee to say to the and i think there is a lot more complexity to it but i do think that the essence of their emerging out of understanding ow the circuits sprit can ultimately in form how we deal with our diets in a way that we avoid wat were facing now in us a society having eats nuts that the over nutrition happens to be such a prevalent problem and i also think the training of people who are thinking about metabolic science and metabolic diseases largely divorced from the training of the serow scientist and vice verse no one feel is to blain but i fully agree that the the brain is is the key one or the nervous system to be a more accurate is the one of the key overlooked features is the armature ultimately is the army sure of many of these pathways as a final question in one which is simply to entertain my curiosity and the curiosity of the listeners what is your absolute favorite who my goodness taste i should say yes taste to distinguish between taste and the nutritive value or lack yes look we an every animal and every the animal species it for the enjoyment of it it does not happening the while most animus eat when they need to it desiderate on enjoy it but it is a completely different story i i have too many favored food because i enjoy the sensory experience the rather than that food itself to me is the whole thing is from the present look be pink this experiments on in psychofisici and we i take a salt made out of living components and an when i makes them all a in a pot pour of greens and are things here and in the other when i when i presented in a beautiful arrangement and when i put in behind a glass caving it and i when i seldom and'when i one for two dollars and one for eight dollars precisely the same ingredient exactly the same amount of each oltimnly yoke when i makes them the all on i be the same am people will pay the a dollars because what i the vogues a different person i gives you the feel that all my goodness ism on enjoy that salad going back to what is my favorite to to me eating is really a a a century during i don in the every day let me have some de now chicken wings because ism angry i but e every peace i think ask an important ivokeen century to and yes in terms of catigroice of food you i grew up in chewy his of meat is always being but i it it seldom now s are rid were because i know i know that is not necessarily the saltiest thing red me them talking about it and i now i grew up eating it every day ism talking seven days a we chilling argentina i now that is the main stay of our diet now maybe i have the red meat i know one silvery for weeks and you newly it it all i love it fart of it is because i have not had it i for weeks but no i lav such but i love tit the the art of such we e ow the whole thing in the was percent it changes the way you tasted i i lave tine food in particular you're in the right place you got it that was the main real when i wanted to come to new york no us getting there is also li a on be o universe its and i came here because i wanted to be with o know people that are thinking about the brain the same way that i to think we you not can will this problem the speak quessional and certainly you are making amazing strides in that direction and i love your answer because it really brings together the many features of the circuitories and the phenomena word than talking about to day which is that while it begins with sensation and perception ultimately it is the context and that content is highly individual to person place in time and many many other things come behalf of myself a and certainly on behalf of all he listeners i want to thank you first of all for the incredible work that you have been doing now for decades in vision in taste and in this bigger issue of how we perceive in experience life it is a truly pioneering and incredible work and i feel quite lucky to h been on the sideline seeing this over the years and hearing the talks in reading the countless beautiful papers but also for your time to day to come down here and talk to us about what drives you an the discoveries you have made thank you ever much you as great fan think you for having me will do it again i we shall thank you for joining me today for my discussion about perception and in particular the perception of taste with doctor charges hooker if you are learning from and ore enjoying this podcast please subscribed to our tube channel that is a terrific zero costs way to support us in addition please subscribe to the podcast on notify and apple and on notify and apple you can leave us up to a five star review if you have feed back for us in terms of comments related t topics were covered or questions were topics or guess that you us to cover on future episode to the superman labpodcast please put those in the comment section on you two we do read all the comments once to day's episode to the superman labpodcast we did not talk about supplements but on many previous episode to the superman labpodcast we talk about supplements that are useful for sleep for focus for hormone support and other aspects of mental health physical health and performance if you are interested in some of those supplements you can go to live momentous to come slash superman to see the catalogue of supplements that we have help them formulate and that map directly on to specific protocols described on the superman lapodast again that is livemomentous to cam slash superman if you are not already falling us on social medium we are superman lab on twitter and superman lab on instrgam and at both twitter and insturgam i cover science and science related tools some of which overlap with the content to the german labpodcast but much of which is distinct from the information contained in the superman labpodcast wells have a news letter in which we spell out protocols and some summaries from previous podcast episodes if you to check those out you can go to superman labor come go to the menu and you will find the curl network newsletter you can sign up for that news letter simply by providing an meal it is complete zero cost we have a very strict privacy policy we do not share your male with anybody again that superman paddock come go to the menu and look for the curl network newsletter and if you examples of previous news letters you will also find those at superman labdobcolm once again thank you for join me today my discussion with doctor charges hooker about the biology of perception and the biology of the perception of taste in particular i hope you found that discussion to be as enriching as i did and last but certainly not least thank you for your interest in since

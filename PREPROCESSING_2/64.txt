this shows ponserbaexpressivypiennus time to stand up against biotech protect or data expression pinta am slashed just a quick reminder the best deal of the year is now here fifty percents off your new daily wire plus annual memberships go to daily wide of comslash subscribe right now to join last night the frailly war cabinet to prove the hostage deal with the terrorist group comas according to the israel government the deal will see fifty is rally citizens released mostly women and children in batches of twelve or thirteen per day the prime minister's office has released a full list and that list shows many many young people but their parents still in captivity or dad still in captivity and mom released families destroyed families split and all the rest for each day of such releases israel will pause its current offensive against comas in the gazestrip israel say it would pause its ere operations for six ours daily in the northern part of the gazes trip that provision was apparently sought directly by ya ya minor the head of comas who wants israel u a vs down for that time period to limit frailly surveillent presumably to save his own skin as he tries to escape whatever rattle he is currently train for its part israel inviscid will still have surveillance capacity without the u a vs comasoill also supposedly allow the international red cross access to the hostages despite the farces publicly obvious disinterest in such a mission israel all also release some one hundred and fifty palistonian terrorist are women and miners in other words a democratic government is trading terrorists for innocent women and children being held by a terrorist group israel will also allow additional fuel into gaze presumably to be stolen by comas the deal is supported by the rally defense forces the shin bet and mad that support led many of the members of the war cabinet to flip from apposing the deal to supporting it according to the times of israel prime minister benjamin intima who further and listed on the potential release of more hostages a refusal to release terrorist convicted of murder and a commitment by hams to locate the other hostages held by other terror groups in the goa ship that last point is really important there are multiple distinct groups in the gozestrip reportedly holding is rails hostage and some of those groups are actually gotten revisions who participated in the massacre of october seventh according to the times of israel quoting an unnamed to government official quote israel beliefs comas could potentially locates some thirty more is rally mothers and children beyond the initial fifty and that the hatstand fighting could be extended by a day for each group of ten more is rally hostages we are located and free the israel government released the statement adingquote the frailly government the idea of and security forces will continue the war to return all the abducted complete the elimination of cams and insure that gosh dies not renew any threat to the state of israel here is prime minister hinting o who explaining that after this pass of the war to eviscerate homes will continue is boohoos the boy servers as outside there is lot of nonsense was havanwy sense fire for the release in the hostages we will stop the war group at coma ten skis o you as i would to care by wear at war then m sumo and we will continue to fight mosbomu mama until we reach all got colayau semen the comayosoge the bonobo has in more than our stages and also in there turning of hostages their stages at tan wilmala go in to an reach the absolute victory and until we ring them all back upon this deal is in fact highly controversial inside of israel there are two separate strains of logic being applied on the one side there are those who believe that as the cord in tightens round compass they will start killing hostages that israel must do what it can right now to free as many hostages as possible before that happens they believe that israel will be able to continue to successfully pursue its long term goal of artisan in camass even if thatch as made more difficult by commands activities during the pas in fighting there is some evidence to support this idea yesterday for example pain an islonicche hod released news of the death of one of the hostages which they then promptly played on israel procrastinating which is weird because the hostages would not even be in gaze if terrisgroups had not taken them there bring the hostages home as fast as possible at the lowest possible close and then destroy camass that is the logic of those who support the deal on the other side there are those who worry that hostage deals have always been terrible policy they remember the two thousand eleven geology sheet deal in which israel obtained the release of one kidnapped is rally soldier from commas in return for and ism not reading the statistic wrong one thousand and twenty seven prisoners including two hundred eighty serving sentences for planning and perpetrating terrorism those prisoners were at the time responsible for nearly six hundred is daily deaths in fact one of the prisoners who was in fact release in that deal was the ya minor the current leader of compass who planned october seventh opponents of the deal remember when the authorities told them security an gaze was good enough to withstand the risk s authorities were obviously wrong opponents of the deal wire most of all tat the current pass will be used as an excuse by the global community to pressure israel for further quartenquote d escalation with a terrorist group that just later twelve hundred is rallies and kidnaped another two hundred and forty and pledges to do the same and pledged israel destruction they worried that as the focus shifts from of compasses evil to hostage deals there will be a broader effort to leave compass in place such worries are well founded for its part compasses already claiming to have achieved such an end last night is malhanea the political had o comas living at fiesta hotels and costar released o statement saying a truce was going to happen the term for truce that have used is the same as the term for seaside conies hopes this will serve as a propaganda o victory telling the radical muscle moral the class has somehow fought israel to a standstill many in the mediate doing the same already the mediate using the pass set to go into effect on thursday as an excuse to talk about leaving comas in place politico to day has an article from one colon clerk of the siphon group and michael penny of the university of pitzburg stating the compass is actually a kind of nice terrorist group that their not sis they have merely territorial gulls they can be negotiated with according to clerk and kenniquot unlike sis some of comasigals are actually political and there wo all be no effect of solutions of the crisis unless it also includes a political resolution that is an absurd contention given the events of october seventh and compasses stated goal one repeating as many october sevenths as possible and their statagoal of completely destroying the state of israel but commas is playing the game come ossreleast the statement that at the very end suggested that what they are really looking for is an independent palistinian state with jerusalem as its capital never mind that what they mean by that is the complete destruction of the state of israel they are not looking for a to state solution but that contention that commons can be left in place is being issued by while variety of sources as the pause begins dividignatious of the washington post hopes that the hostage deal will provide about surprisingly pragmatic formula for easing the conflict expanding into a d escalation of the nightmare presumably someone the body ministration hop the same that the israelies will simply forget about what commas wants what commas has done what comas pledges to do even before the bodies of october seventh have all been buried the white houses obviously conflicted certain members are standing stalwartly by israel others are fretting over the possibility of cranial a egression in reality if israel leaves commas in place the possibility of regional conflict grows exponentially it is only the impression of his really strength that has prevented a wider regional conflict thus far commas would rearm and claim victory because ballad would be em folded in israel north terrorist groups in the west bath would grow more violent the this in common would up the anti the sun countries would shy away from israel and seek their own methods of defeats against the shit in version treating more opportunities for new clear proliferation ran would grow more aggressive until they have fully developed in nuclear weapon at which point pretty much all he would break loose israel must re establish tdeturrnts and security that is in fact the primary goal hostages are a coincident goal but they are not in fact the chief goal if israel does not reestablish to currants in security israel will find itself under violent attack from its enemies every single day the simple fact in the matter is there is no sense fire on the table with people who participated in october seventh and celebrated it here for example is some tapeworm a open civilian who participated in the october seventh attacks bragging about at publicly gamut the cops lusgada wat m when he an saying farther w no he is describing members of a family he slaughtered to his family he saying that one of them beg for his life and with slaughtered one was slaughtered in the bedroom the third in the bathroom the excitement unfortunately a huge overwhelming per centare of palistinian grabs are favor of this sort of activity by polling data seventy five per cent of palistonian grabs supported october seventh ninety eight persenpiloy hate america this means that israel simply cannot allow sudan governmental bodies with control over money and weaponry staffed and governed by such people israel must secure its own security they do not have a choice every one in israel on all sides of the hostage issue agrees on thatch do not believe the media when they suggest that this hostage day is suddenly the prelude to a broader sort of sense fire it is not israel is making that clear and

you appease terrorist groups somehow magically this makes the world safer when precisely the opposite is true israel more israel tried to d scat with comas for twenty years for twenty years and the result was october seven comas has not changed comas is lying to the world when they suggest that here is anything on the table other then comas continuing its mission of destroying israel this made clear every single days israel releases newfootage from the gosestrib for example yesterday the idea for leased footage showing how comas uses moves to protect weapons and this is the thing when your talking that negotiations and diplomacy negotiations and oplemacy obviously have to a our in a situation in which you can trust and also verify at that was the old pagan saw is that in any negotiation spessully with somebody who really opposes you yet to truss but you have to verify we well trust is not possible with people whose entire mode of existence on this earth namely comas derris and their ilk is laying is untruth these are people who deliberately hide weapons beneath maquis in orders that when israel has to hit these they can then claim that israel is attacking holy sights these are people who deliberately hide weapons in hospitals si in israel pesto attack a hospital they can hide inside and pretend that israel is attacking a civilian sight this is lying is part of the game and this is the thing that westerners need understand comas his ball euronyan regime with isnemin radical is gamic opponents of the west this honesty is an entire tactic it is not is though honesty i to facts on both sides to disagreement over politics or anything remotely that it is not one side is perfectly willing to lie as much as humanly possible in order to achieve its ends and the other side keeps screaming into the void negotiations cannot be pursued successfully under such sit you under under such conditions this by the ways what israel found out under the solo cords when they trusted the palistinian authority and the palicinian authority promptly started multiple round to violence when the palicinian authority used every dollar that came into the palistinian authority not to build up civil society but to cipher it off into the pockets of the palistinian leadership to build up weaponry to pay terrorists this honesty is the name of the game in this particular region the only thing that both sides understand because israel understands to policy bandit deponents do not there can play in that in that kittypool the only thing the only currency in the mideleast unfortunately i wish sou were it the only currency is actual deterrent power that is the only currency that actually exists shays some this foot it in just a second because gan it continues to be stunning and astonishing to me that people in the west seem to believe that compass is just you no there just another political group the dividignatiouses of the world pure idiocy diplomacy is a tactic diplomacy is not a policy this some thing that the west also seems to have forgotten let seems so forgotten that when you make policy of a policy goal another you have certain tactics in order to achieve the policy goal if you wish for example for a two state solution that is a policy goal now the only way to achieve that policy goal may be to replace a receive compass in the gosh strip and hope that it some point in the future another rishumarizes that is not a genticitle terrorist group but there many people molest to believe that diplomacy is an actual policy and when asked in presidential debate you will see candidatesate things while i would pursue diplomacy diplomacy is the answer well that is not the question the question is what is policy that you are seeking to pursue and his diplomacy the best available opportunity to achieve that policy this by the ways one the arguments that happening over this hostage deal there a lot of people who believe that israel should not have been negotiating with commas at all that essentially israel should have said from the very outset you have two choices and two choices only one you return the hostages you surrender you've up your weapons and you go into exile somewhere and too you die those are the only two actions but the reality is that when you are in the prime minis reseat in israel or by thewy went i the president of the united states states an seat in the united states all the talk about not negation with terror seems to go by the wayside because immediate interest in obtaining the release of innocent people tends to trump all of the tough talk i thing that is in fortunate by the way again we will get too some of that take showing what commas actually is in just one second first the holidays are here the last thing unit

meanwhile is real his released yet more tape of comes using all sheep ut to build a tunnel net work again the it is amazing how many credulity members of the press were willing to humor o the we that every one new was he lie that all she was the civilian sit predominantly is supposed with homos headquarters even after israel released horrifying footage of commas literally dragging hostages into the hospital as doctors sad around and watch every one new do understand how to gusting the international community is what you really have to understand is how many international organizations new exactly what shift was and continue to propagandize on behalf of compass it is astonishing were talking international red cost they knew were time out doctor's thapword they knew human rights watch they knew and all of them were propagandizing on behalf of commas during this particular conflict in israel breached a wall and what they found behind it shocker a giant well stocked terrtunnel under allshifa hospital it goes even further when commas is looking for a great place to hide it weaponry it does in things baby cribs here is a picture from yesterday comashid in antitank weapon underneath a baby crib now i have a baby it'll lay what a own keep under his crib a miss i soft know about you but maybe that is because ism not a piece of human debris the members of compass none the less an the the typical sort of good hated america notion that every one thinks the same way and everyone has the same general mode of thought and we are all seeking the same thing on really brought brotherhood all the stuff it is crap it is not true the world is filled with real politique a struggle between people very often believe horrible things in people who do not believe horrible things this is why for example south africa has now shifted dramatically on israel then r now accusing south africa is israel of a quonquot genocide that of course is not a shock south africa has been rife with the anti white hatred for years and years since the end of a partied certainleat justifiably in some masher during a partied in the post of partite euro the promise of mandala has been almost completely forgotten in south africa as there has been a move to tremendously racialize the politics again in south africa and israel has been seen as an extension of that according to the times of israel one of israel most significant partners on the continent one time south africa has gradually come out as one of its most vituperative critics accusing israel of atone cleansing it now of genocide the genocide allegation as travelled up the ranks of the government beginning on nonmember second with kumwudzol the shave penny a relatively junior cabinet miss minister and then was expressed by the president sure rammafhoza who called the gaze a quote concentration camp where genocide is taking place which is just the violent most disgusting language especially about again the news actually suffer in a concentration camp where genocide was takin place many concentration camper a genocide was taking place which is not gaze south africa is on to move in very dangerous directions against that harsh population that just a prediction right now in this is true of a huge number of countries ranging from africa i would take to the middle's wit their no jaws in the medalist other than israel betas i olefin expelled already which no one seems to gear about but from africa to rope this is going to be a continuing problem meanwhile turkeys seeking to up the anti because again turkey can do low cost and then make promises to it slams population first there is lot at stake this nonmember do not be a chicken and shop at the grocery store usual instead had never good ranchers where they have great meat punsbut even better meat do not miss their black fridge your wayside it is now live this nonmember an your favorite meet free for a year that is correct one year of free stake salmon chicken or bacon when you subscribe to anybody right now better yet when you subscribe any box on god ranchers a come you not only get a free gift of meat worth up to four hundred eighty bucks you also get fifteen bucks off with cot chi pro the only deal your grocery store offers is on expiring foods ditch the meat you and subscribe at good ranchers do come to day that should ship me a very special shipment of cosher salmon and it is in fact excellent may they may be cosher stake one point that was grant ms toying their stuff is high quality claim your year of freeman fifteen bucks off reshipping with my coacshipiro at good ranchers do come good ranchers is the number one places to get all america beef pork chicken and seafood that is primo coats per at good ranchers do come good ranchers is america meat delivered go check i out right now good ranchers do come reshipping with code shipiro also turkey is also seeking to up the anti because a groan is in his loment dictator according to the times of israel are proctinanly one thousand boats will gather in turkey on one stay before heading toward polite an and attempt to break the israel blockade and destruct maritime trade coming into israel during the war with compass now debt gate ago they tried the same thing thy try to ship in a bunch of weaponry israel had to board one of those ships and there wore tears on board that israel had to kill and that end up being in international incident because this is the way that it works among the one thousand vessels would be three hundred and thirteen boats filled with russia activists and a hundred for with punish activists only twelve furnish vessels would join the flotilla apparently later they expected the number of turkisht vessels to increase to one thousand they then suggested that om the initiative was not associate wit the furnish government which of course is a lie the operation would be designed to cost astrruption in international waters off the israel coasts to the maritime trade heading for the port of shod in order to interrupt the supply of goods to israel for week or even up to ten days wouldn't even be to tryst ship stuff into the gossip trip which is not going to work instead it would be to obstruct other boats from getting into israel to bring goods into israel just though the world is filled with delightful people and delightful countries and it is worthy remembering that the united states does not exist in vacuum we are very lucky as i said before the united states is blessed by god in many unique incredible ways number one a geography the are contiguous continental power to our north a bunch of canadians and to our south are bunch of pelicans on the other to sides is much water that is really really lucky but that does not mean that the world is not a fairly small place and that the more horrifying countries gain more power the more horrifying countries feel em golden the more that effect your here at home ism not just talking about n terms of security sure it means thither will be an up tick in terror attacks because again when terror groups feel that they have a weak horse they attack me somber laden said that much ism talking bat in terms of your economic livelihood there are choke points all over the glob most of trade does not happen sea emplane most of trade happens the oceans most it happens veal waterways there there there dozens of choke points all over the world and as the united states is power was in those particular areas that is going to get a lot worse if the united states in its allies for example cannot guarantee the freedom of the water ways which has been sort the guarantee the united statuses has assumed since the end of world war to i promise you the price of goods services everything is going to increase dramatically if youweriedabout inflation now get ready if you are worked about price spikes now get ready what happens when for example china decides that it is going to take more control over the south chase and then impose serifs on anybody moving through what happens when the straits of hormones are shut off by ran this is the sort of thing that happens in a musty polar world we have all been living in the aftermath and in the current of a dominant america hatreminy and that is a very very good thing america in its allies rule the glob that is good because in that absence the opposite is really bad we can pretend that none of this matters but it matters an awful lot if for example the strait of molocka which is the primary choke point for trained goods in aria it if if vatfhr example is grab by china or control by china that is a serious problem not only because it gives china in enormous amount of leverage over the united states but also because it means the prices are going to go up if the straits of hormones are clothes i mention that earlier that is thirty percent of all oil treated on theworld's oceans which is the majority of oil traded thirty percent of it can get choked off you thing that has no impact on you an isolationism is first order thinking it is first order thing just on real politics level forget all of the moral station arguments forget about democracy for sis dictatorship for second forget about human rights for to some of the most evil groups on the planer forget about all that stuff understand it is to stuff than emotionally moves people but there is a whole group of people out there for isolationist because they are quonqued real politique are thinking about of the the hard power aspects of what it means to exist in the world and they're forgetting that those hard power aspects do not just exist inside the united states of america america again is uniquely blessed by geography that does not mean that america is a tragic it is not we get an vast number of resources from abroad and by the way those markets purchase a vast number of america resources it will have an impact on our life if we go isolationist it will hae an impact on our life if the bad gazed wind in many of these places if russia gains power that army will be used to mobilize toward choke points if china stretches its power a cross these straits of titan and grabs titan that has massive ramifications for merit can t apology virtually all the sophisticated microchips on earth are produced in titan this is why we care about ti wan again forget about he fact that titan is democratic states that shares many of our values and china is a communist hellhole that sure virtually none of them the real question for the real politics crowd because that is what they say they is i they are hard headed ere hard headed and man notice that the hard headdress the hard headed isolationism does not extend to when people are travelling to spain or when they are travelling to hungary to talk with various florin leaders then the hard headed real politic seems to go away and is moral suit ton again but even a suing hard headed real polite pappy cannons isolationism all right well let us pretend for a second the you got your way there's be real massive quass associate with that to the america taxpayer to the america consumer to america families and lest we forget the america economy matters an awful lot two the america family and two america consumers at that is your way of life that is how you live day to day everything seems very distant until the impacts are felt very very immediately and that is the probably foreign policies hard to explain foreign policy generally speaking in real politic terms because it requires a certain baseline level of understanding and knowledge which is li typically there has been a semi by partisan consensus on foreign policy why because once you get in the seats and you see how certain decisions that are made in places very far away from the united states manifest as real impacts inside the united states it seems at that clarifies the mind a lot and that is true for members of both parties largely medical trump came into office pledging a certain level of isolationism and he was able to carry that out to the except that we did not involve ourselves heavily an foreign conflicts but to pretend that dona triples an isolationist on foreign policies absurd he personally helped broker the abrahamicords in the middle east the was not just a good thing to do that also was very helpful for the america economic interest in the middle east president trump engaged intoplomacy south east aria was a thing that he did it is a thing united states will have to do began again seconds order thinking require the unjust look at the problem that is immediately in front of you an say that is very far away it is happening in a different place foreign policy requires you think two steps down there because america enemies are an that's particularly for for dictatorships when it comes to foreign policy the pastorships have a first mover advantage they do democracies are generally very slotomobilize and they ten to get board very easily the pastorships do not have to worry about that this always been the case that china has made with regard to foreign policy for example china has always said we will just out last you well out wait you we will out last you we will still be here it will jut elect another president four years from now and then that kill some stuff and we do not that will win another four years and that guilt gall away having a long lasting hard headed foreign policy is a very difficult thing to do in a democracy and to pastorships know that that is why the america people and people of the west generally speaking have to be a little bit more long sited in the way that they view foreign policy because again to curatorships have the ability to simply hold the line for literally even if the people do not it that just kill them that is not the case in the west which requires more of the people of the west at requires people in the west to actually think about the impacts of the things that they are saying and doing cause those things actually have nan impact and how their leaders act an which brings us to the latest in you crane now the issue in you crane is is really not whether rush is going to win there now russia is not going to defeat you crane the issue is what does an all framplook the issue is can you crane maintain stone security inside the borders that a currently has because it was in america interest to continue to bleed the russia army there is no question about this the is notion that it is i its in america interest notably the russia army is bizarre to me cassia's military has ben quite a aggressive from georgia to crime to the donnas to casextand the ten russia military used is an arm of imperialism by the russia state has ben adverse to america interest across the world including in the mdeleast were the been very active in places serial because brockubon the basely surrendered serial to russia which was a bad move and has heightened the possibility of conflict in middle's again second order thinking when hand over serious to the ruffians it turns out that the ruffians are coordinating with the aronians that has impact on crane because iron is using because iron is working with the ruffians to ship technology over it has impact on the mallees because russia is helping iron with its re source problems to can distributterrall over the midleleast and that has impact on the world economy as we have seen from the shocking extend of the economic impact on the world economy of the wanna crane their lot of interconnections in foreign policy well as america interest in crane america interest in crane was number one preserving the independence of crane against russia number two degrading the russia military an america has largely achieved a both of those goals and then it was an america interest to continue to support eucranian action in the field until the point at which it was clear that a stale mate had been obtain that is basely what has happened here it'd be perfectly happy to continue funding eucranians if they were actually capable of passing the ruffians out of don bassarcrimea they have shown no ability to do that then the question becomes dregs trowing bad money after good beyond a certain point that is the real question we should be asking n crane that by the ways of very different story from for example forbade to israel in defeating commons which they very very achieve a goal commons is a fairest small moderately size terrorist group compared to the is railing military the writing military certainly has thecapacityd to regain control of the security situation in the gosh strip which is my all talk of szesmar fire now from a military real politest perspective is the stupidest thing have ever heard talk of some sort of solution in crane right now makes en sincere ben doing this for a year and a half the lines on the battlefield had basically been stagnant for at least six months and we all knew where they we on and up anyway my wit that said the pension chief secretary defensed button has now made a surprise trip to the cranial capital trying to rally sport for crane even suggesting cranial forces would be even more aggressive in their fight against invading russia forces throughout the winter busting brilliant prediction about the next phase of fighting come after eucranan force failed which you've any decisive brake through during a six month counts a offensive which came at a heavy cost for eucranian troops in the average age of members of eucrany militaries now forty three there is also serious concerning crane about the longer from future of just military aid with some republicans wanting to halt support crane's ability to quotincuo take the fight to the enemy as busting put it will dependent large part on the continuation of just military aid including ammunition but it is unclear whether the eucranians actually have the capacity to push the ruffians back at this point and they have shown no real ability to do beyond the first few months of the war when they had widespread success they keep promising the will e a break through but there has not really been a break through along those lines as former diplomat richer hossiggeste said maybe the solution in u crane is security guarantees to you crane you make sure that such an invasion never happens again crane has the ability to withstand such in invasion well that is your realistic the battle lines dare not moving here's richer boss explaining they are gone increasing the say we are hearing in in the house fore hearing in parts of rope why should we see doing us were already starts for trying to supports really word about ti wan ah and even if we did everything we need to give a wanting if to crane its still will not lead to success what i argued therefore is the united states needs to have some very od direct conversations with e crane forth president seventy talk about we during their emphasis on liberating land increasingly put all their emphasis on holding on to what they have got in the long run diplomatically through sanction as we can try to see the rest of their feretory return before right now let us have eighty percent of this country say eighty percent of this country a rebuild we that happens to be a good real politic perfect of again america interests should be secured all over the globe and we do have an interest in things that happen outside of our borders in

our stuck in place because he will not go anywhere watching them defend him is really is real the quit humors here is p bouddojedge who desperately wants to run for president despite the fact that his a terrible secretary of transportation and running joke who is only actual accomplishment was apparently being mayor of a small town in indaba and also being gag here is a mare pe buddojedge i would add to that here fairs becoming much more reasonable lately and unemployment a that i do not think has state this loaf for this long in my life time but that does not e go round saying i know everything perfect and we recognize that america have had a rough few years especially when you think about covin what that did to our society effects that we are still working three think about some of the political polarization that is going on iron out they saying that all of the work is gone a hereat they're pointing to the good work that we are doing there doing much good work much good work says people to judge out they are not and they've got a lot promise which means wait for it they got a redirection trump when is there entire tray nowt again ism wondering increasingly these days whether that strategy is going to be successful or not he's mad all be baked in to the cake i think that their strategy as next year is trials trials trials trump in front of charts and all the rest but the problem is that because they launch all the indictment early it is possible that they already got their bang for their buck on that one it is possible that his trump appears in court it does not have all that much impact because we are of look he is in court again in the same way that they kept trying to impeach him an were club is it a day ending and why gets their trying to i peach him here gingko do the same thing with these courtcases they are going back to the playbook tho playbook is as we said yesterday he sitter the near times now admitting the quit part i t alow what ignore trump democrats now want him plaster all over the news democrats are hoping that morettention on him can help turn around president by is fortunes reduptstian reporting when donate trump left the whorehouse democrat in want here another word from him president bison dis miss him as the former guy a party wide invent is held that he was best left ignored three years later mister bid's reelecting campaign and democratic official o cross the party spectrum have landed on a new solution to his political slum more trump criticizing the news media for giving trump a platform is out quietly finding for matronettworks to again broadcast live coverage of trump campaign rallies is in behind the i probable longing for the former president to gobble up o political oxygen is democrat's years long dependent on the trump outrage machine since his assent trump has been a one man democratic turn out operation uniting an otherwise fractured opposition and shelling victories in three straight election cycles now democrat's worry the fever of trump fatigue his passed and some voters are softening toward man than once clothes many others may simply be paying little attention as drums share of the daily national conversation has diminished as i said before trumps beststratige in this it is to basically go to the basement and then you plenty jobiton if he does that he could very easily be president again and they keep using the panties o jo scarborough a my goodness this is unhinged here is it job scarborough making doomsday prediction for donate trumps second turn trying to scared you in devoting for the old man here we go just because he has it dot it yet does it man he wall do it why a he get ain't chance to do it at i he has halbonind in to a is the a lot of

it did is the bar regional from actually fulfilled his his joke about shooting some adman fifth haven it i was not he president for four years withal a lots of political executions that were happening at that time did i miss it or was not tonal trump actually we a need with regard to the d o ja that he let killer canton off the hook in the mistaken but i think sort of justifiable belief that we better for the country if we did not rescue our political opponents a rule that was then broke in the eviscerated actually by the began ministration all the struggle how scary trump is it is jo bid nous activated the d of against his political opponents its jo bison who as called his political opponents traitors and that none none of this washes and again million it even watches for jo

victims are dis proportionately black women and women of color no one should face violent living hear or be discriminated pagans simply forbid remelt i justatestically she is from she grisly sionwrong last year they're apparently twenty six corn duo trains women who are murdered as supposed to five thousand dad women in the united states murdered every yer actual biological women and a and a more biological men the the moderate among trains people is extremely low compared to the general population and in fact there is a list from humonrites council of the twenty six townspeople killed in twenty twenty three and in the vast majority of cases nearly all of them no motive is listed for example gasman star mac a a josioa parked stabbdon leg no suspects or motives listed ski we johns murdered and robbed unique banks home invasion mother also killed three more injured saki most we taco shot by coworker maria host revert murder suicide with boifran case handerson shot by habitual criminality repeater portugwita non binary mail shot by police during incremental protest cassia woodland person shot outside bar general identity cording police not a factor again the list goes on and on and on and on and yet we are told again that trains people in the united states under tremendous threat it is magic u why do not they justlistis lamaphobia there to and it just tithe number of phantom social ills that apparently is rife in the united states according to this white house while they ignore actual social ills is truly in astonishing thing in the this still white house that is pretending that the nashvil transshooter who murdered bunch of kids an that had nothing to do with transfers or politics at all here still pretending that one away but there having transgendered days of remembrance a the white house and we all have to pretend the transgender people in the nice or people identifies members of the opposite sect and the routinely being beaten in the streets it just the absolute silliness it is not true at all but you know none of that matters beaks the truth does not matter meanwhile the white house is a very excited because the they have now achieved some

transfacilitating transactions with sanction groups this seems a perfectly valid prosecution by the way ism just wondering why t is that the america federal government also facilitates transactions with sanction groups namely the government of iron but here a secretary yelling very excited about this penance pieces these transactions but it never filed a single suspicious activity report and it also allowed over one and half million virtual currency trades that violated you sanctions we have taken the largest and foreman action in tracery history finish settlement agreement issues a penalty of three point for million dollars o facsettlement agreement assesses a penalty overly a billion dollars again all this is worth while i g one ask the question why is tat the united states government's directly facilitating the movement of money to the baronial machine one of things they're going after balance for is the facilitation of height hundred ninety nine million dollars in process trades between america and users believed to be in on the united states just freed up billions tens of billions of dollars in oil revenues to the baronial government which is spreading terror

over six feet and loud and she really made a show of jumping and shouting and waving er flag i envied her in that moment this is in comfortable for me to say but give sometimes felled to sense of vagueness just being black and that is the thing about the westerndinday parade there is all these black people to the now exactly specifically wear there from an know this one day they tell everyone this guy for example it is not just where he is from but it is how he says it were you from a mica live in his neighbor no one may living to stay on i live in at runs are you can wolredia yes one

of crownhihes the parade is actually part of a week long celebration in brookland called the labor day carnival which is itself just then new york version of carnival which is celebrated all over the carabin in the world most days crownhids feels a lot other neighborhoods give lived in corner bodega here of the restore there gentrification creeping in but one weekend every year i wake up storage and soda feathers and boats and people waving flags fro all o see barely anywhere to stand diapason stilts and ore a police everywhere it feels the neighborhoods been completely travel but of course that is not what is act they has it is more the neighborhoods turning inside out letting you see what is at its core many of the people who make their homes an cowhides also carriage o m a another on and wat bahamas grenada galatea barbados an wosiatrenida every year an he wived from one and two ln people show ire frilling just to stand on a sideline and watch all pass by we know a parade but i wanted to live inside it not understand as best i can how my cousin felt that day to know what it means to have a flag trade it that is we are doing this hour a bunch of us went out that ceca thin had first some of us heaven got pretty wet they with us the typical image new yorkers have wit the westerndinday parade is of thousands of peen dancing down eastern parkway in elaborate costumes that are as colorful as they are skimp feathered had dresses winged back packs tiaras jewel behinds i learned that this is called playing mass the mass is short from askarade my cold produced er jestican i went out really early on labor day an met it with some masqueraders who we dressed in costumes that they had chosen from a selection of different move things the little mermaid coming to america an so birls just to say this were only mainly related to the filling was more about color pilot than anything one woman wore a plume of black and yellow feathers a join quintan terete was most famous heroin i explain your costume which which costume is a to ikilbill a i regret these big feathers out on a enrol with is but ai visit kilville and why do you regret at be as the structyou get imaged you put on a stone i to a wall down a park way with big feathers on it was a bad mistake tethers coming to it is some stones came or what e experience of putting on an outfit does not coming out it took me two hours and a people break it down already we knew a hit the parkway we just know if you going to do it just carry a lot of cat not a la but carry some crazy will with you you will be putting yourself together what you get out here what made you decide i kilbell a to be ones i on shabby kilbill had a mono piny and i liked it i went with that and a i me a two pleas we a friends right now and a we at the jet o ill bill was hi for many people plain starts even earlier than the parade at the parade before the parade it is called jurat and its ha celebration with deep deep roots in the carabin u rase mythology is populated withoutlandish characters the menacing midnight robber with his wide brimmed hat the insanely voluptuous dame again and the many devils rider a mighty brown grew up with jury but she did not she stop going until she got to brooklet her story starts over two thousand miles away in triad carnival is big that she study it in school the year i turned ten we were given on a sign went to pick one of the traditional carnival mass characters we just learned about create a costume and put on a performance in front of the rest of the school picking my cargo was a struggle but in the end i settled on the jab classy sometimes called the blue devil in trinidad i picked it mostly because i knew the costume would be one of the easiest to make and time was running out i cut holes into an old para shorts an a thin teacher i fashion horns from paper towel rolls and loose strips of paper into a chain that i could wrap around my body a pitch fork i fabricated from tree branches from my back yard completed the look on the day of the performance i changed into my costume in the classroom scared myself all over with blue paint and then headed twats the auditoria i was the kind of child who avoided attention and everything in me was fighting the idea of being on stage when i stepped out alone in front of the whole school my heart was racing my teacher told us that the ja classy was a demon that terrorizes a creature barely kept on its leash on the stage that day i might have crouched or jumped or his or bared my teeth at the crowd ism not sure i just remember my anxiety was not painful any more it was exhilarating i felt wicked and nasty an playful and tricking completely out o character and still utterly myself deeply inside my body and yet somehow flows hand bovid when it is good that is what it feels to plasmas for long time master wo we mine i grew up in trinidad but my father and mother are from jamaica and liana respectively carnival in those places simply does not compare to the space the festival takes up an trinidad when carnivals came and its influence swirls year round everyone my mother would say laughing as share her head every one from the biggest partial to the most religious church mouth is out on the road come mandate my family did not go to church regularly but there was no way my parents began let me participate and carnival prop as a teenage that was for grown people when i left grenada for college in the states the loneliness took me by surprise i was eighteen and homesickness was o physical and nearly constant ache it was then that i played jive for the first time at brooklynds labor day parade there i finally felt at home again and in the year since the parade has become a spiritual practise jive always begins in the dark this year climb in up and out of the subway at gran army plaza the sky is not quite pitch black but it is close against the clear of police flood lights i can just make out a stream of people trickling down the road in clumps my friends and i join the stream moving towards the end why p d metal bar is that narrow into a check point we are patted down an our bags open i uveas arrived from the french rural word for daybreak and traditionally brooklet starts as a round four i am ending not too long after the sun rises but this year the rising sun is what marks the beginning of the parade at six i am the parade is starting much late than usual the reason given is that it would help cure the violence that many have come to associate with the event in twenty fifteen a young lawyer in governor andruwkomofs administration carry gaby was hit and killed by a stablest along the rut the next year it was reported that four people were shot at the parade two of whom died here is whats rarely mentioned in those usual ports the violence that black people experience in these long neglected neighborhoods his year round it does not end when the camps leave the parade and in some cases the incidents that the media of connected to the parade happen away from the parades actual rout the news coverage jive tipping receives is frustrating but not surprising no matter what parts of the globe your from that this is part of what it means to be black the things you do to secure joy for yourself in a world that would rather see you dead the come the way the world then rationalizes your suffering for the media for every one outside of our community the story of the parade is the story of the violence this is why it feels impossible to smile back when the offices checking our bags grins is if wore sharing an inside joke and comments just need to make sure you do not have a gun before letting us through once were past the check point the crowd thickens it is clear that for some people the morning is just beginning and that for others a long nights e parting is simply stretching itself a little it longan every one is drifting chipping own the street in no real hurry no one is wearing anything that would not mind sacrificing to the java gods old tanks and short shorts rate the starts and scrappy dresses that ride up the the flags are everywhere tied around waists worn as capes the had green and gold a grenade's flag in particular can be seen near and fought the closer we get to the front of the rout the more clearly we can hear the sound of whistles and cons up the road the tinny sound as somebody thing out are them on a small metal pan is joying briefly by the heavy beat of a combat both are swallowed up by the sound of the steel pan ban warming up and the devils are out the grenadine jabjabs are covered from head to tow and slick black oil the whites of their eyes and teeth seem to jump out to their skin locks and wages and grades are wrapped up tightly in plastic bags sacrifice and old clothes is one thing but get in oil and powder out of a newborn is quite another the devils wear hard hats and helmets crowned with black horns i narrowly avoid getting hit by one of the many shopping carts many of the devils are pushing down the road most of de full of plastic bags and buckets and in some cases other passed out devils the smell of great and smoke rows heavier two young devils spot my friends and me and loudly program that we are too pretty one of the devils dips his hands into a bucket of ail and the other beckons us closer he smiles wide and it is both a dear and or promise and invitation and o threats we shake our heads but we are all laughing as he walks up to us and starts rubbing us down with the oil anyway you do not come to jive if wee not prepared to get their to you harass pulling along the rhythm section and eel pan bands who are now in full sway start inching down the road a woman climes on top of the bump of van whining her waist slowly in a smooth rippling motion that extends from her shoulders down to her lags a man waist himself up behind her and she picks up he makes we flag down a young woman selling nut crack es sweet drinks makes heavily with rum and badge the spite reports of a crack down on the sailor whose brings she ask if she can take a picture of us that she then pulse on her integrand to promote her business we all gage if known each other for years as we a trying to mark the moment the parade slides from darkness into daylight is trying to tract the ripening of a mangle it happens slowly and then all at once suddenly i am squinting into the sun and everything that felt clear in the night looks and feels strange to be now this is a part of it too within this space what is real and what is a hallucination mock jumbos shore for the performed on six foot stilts drift by clouds without looking down three devils loved and white paint are on the roof of a nearby building whining and waving a huge trinidad flag over the crowd as if claiming territory how did they get up there i have no idea but somehow in the moment there is nothing that does not make terms jive began as a way to celebrate surviving the most brutal aspects of slavery in jive you can see ut of the eyes of the demons that one's drove with the win you can embody the worst thing that ever herd you and come out the other side invincible when our people were enslaved they were driven into burning cane fields to harvest the can those that survived came out covered in soot and ash the hard defies imagination but at every turn we have been taught that we are weak that we are cowards that we are less than human we play duvet to remember that no one has the power to make monsters of us but ourselves we play jive and in that time we become more fearsome than anything that could ever terrorize us in a world that ask us to be quieter to do less to except the worst of everything and to pretend to it jive becomes the altar where we can finally fall to our knees and worship ourself i am too not practice in when the brass of the rhythmsection really gets going something deep and sweet sails me this year has been harder than most i have not had the money for a plain ticket and it's been over as years since i was an my back yard pressing my feet into the grass watching the sun set feeling the wetness of the air hug my body there is a person i am when i am home and i miss her desperate now a cart runs through my chest my belly my legs i am not home but i am hoe ism home i swing my hips and on my waist and slow days and for a moment feel the way a day when i was ten jumping back and forth between fear and exhilaration getting low to the ground feeling something a and prod start to crack my chest many ground is he jamaica writer and poet here work focuses on race gender and cretin she was pretty much all summer if we walking around certain parts of brookland with a sound of steel drums late to the night but she never really see them i was wonder where the steel drums coming from because when the parade comes along it is all flatbed trot loaded with deva equipment and booming speakers r was all that steel drumming i heard as turns out part of laborday carnival as a whole steel drum competition it called panorama those mysterious tropical sounds in the night those who steel due orchestras practice sometimes a hundred people all playing together what i say to people i practice every night those ay what can you do this and i know i have practice you

competition the band age ancona playing is called radios the name comes from this famous band an printed at called desperados the best bring of it was called vespers but then there was a rebellion in the ranks and the band split it was a divorce the rebels were you want to be desperate find well be radios that was years ago that and it is all good now well kind of the rivals friendly rivals we do

she is choosing to spend every night right here with her mom getting ready for the competition the way the panorama competition works each band plays in eight to ten minute long incredibly complicated arrangement of a popular soda song the arrangements are filled with crazy runs and break downs which in a kind of clips arms race get more and more virtuosic every year every one will tell you the see to winning this thing it is having a god arranger the person comes up with all the parts most bands use local arrangers from brooklet but radios hires a ringer from trinidad got b j normal they will bring up b j for the whole summer to teach the song but this time is a problem he had trouble getting a visa he is been teaching over the phone every night some one gets their see for with ta cable an a connected to this giant speaker that everyone gathers around b j teaches the music by calling out the notes one by one through the phone which this other guy called the drill master then repeats to the rest of the orchestra that fans you stop a b basis o the m b ja has to teach every note of a ten minute song this way and there is not just one part it is in a hundred person orchestra with different sections that play different notes in items no sheet music involved this is music learned o entirely by ye a r the yard feels an extended family barbecue that happens every single night the a make shift bar in the back that serves beer and food that is for all the good gossip happens over all it is about half players and half people who are just there to hang out lots of kids running around significant others of band members plusacan tiger of old guys smoking weed in the back people said a feels kindling being back home in the carabin during breaks dona hangs out with her best

in brooklet city the neighborhood that the parade goes through includes another group of people that are apologetically themselves that is the fatidic cues on this day you will see many of them dressed up in a costume that particular to their culture but on the mass players they were their colorful costume around the long black coats and black hats and beards out fits the day back to nineteen century poland during the parade they all seem to be rushing down the street people on their way to an important appointment not looking at the festivities at all my cold work er i reglaze the regular host of this program was at the parade with us and tried to talk to some fossils about this huge fly event that tikes place in the neighborhood walking up to holds on the street feel walking up to people from another planet people add a general air of hostility for at we suspicion towards outsiders me the wade me off best i got was from a young man who took pity on me and gamely mustered this non committal quote about the parade every person has a right to do what they want wat they feels right but if final found one tossed who would actually talk to me but marching myself over to seven seventy eastern parquaye the word white headquarters of the bad movement abode is the biggest tossed organization and seven seventy is such an important spiritual sight for them that a repined the building it seven seventy eastern parlay was built in jerusalem her we are brick by brick copy withother replicas in cities around the world we include the number seven seventy on the building the number has mystical significance meaning among other things bending on he asked bade mocha house of the cassia the seven seventy is not just has three did get number on the door an the direst to some see eastern parkway brook the new york it is the house of our leader the leader of the entire human race the a lot o over ai rite the man telling me this is you hood i canasta gold seen

handmaid sign across the parade rout about the seven laws of norther in the woodlice he as in hoping that the sign would do a lout the poetizing for him to day and he would have to engage too much with the crowd to the weakness of the of the eyes i tried to put signs over there to do my work for me cause if i see what is going on over here it really triggers a lot of emotional or a been

the number masqueraders has been drop of the years tissue falcon he designs costumes for damage hes wearing a jewel in crusted scheme mass t time there's all but to fact as at plays a part but over all i think its stay people may want to do different things wit their income they may not get sterile what be half may gat other told bark flour is a what narrow means is they prefer to be half naked on the road for considerably more than a few hours he says the mass play business is suffering because people feel the sit is getting more and morse strick every year about when the parades pose to and every one supposed to be off the road by six masqueraders are less inclined to pay a bani ramashate for the experience they one of our bat biggest battles why should i spend since sonjallos for costume in new york when ti can spend on h slip send lush o got to make up o somewhere else than play mastic that is r a shell the woman we met in the feather shop on thirty seven she founded damage about a decent ago and turned it into the family business her father played mass and trinidad and to this day still spends months helping her make the bans lavish costumes by hand for a shell these days not enough people are willing to commit to the masquerade to the tradition of playing mass when you work when you see now ye do not see much costumes in you see a lot of teashops and dislikes alone people do not get the witness the beauty of the cousin the cautions an ecus the jess flags a lags in shall basin they do not see the beat of lot of the notions any within carabin culture not everyone a steep in the same traditions shell was taught the celebrate or over they can though theirs one way of cutting loose that seems to be happening more and more and it drys ray shell and her staff crazy when damage rose down the pathway speaker's gladsome by standers hopped the metal barriers and flood the ban's ranks dancing and waving the class people call this storming some mass players welcome it the more married but it does not look great the traditional mass players in their feathers and jewels jostled and crowded by stories and shorts and cheeshirts and everyday street clothes its just massing an the can also be dangerous people get harassed even assaulted nice can break out the dele is kept trying to separate the non pang civilians from the costume players what bi mewed us tret ass we pa be pa o an to i fa far fish means see masskeryos a yetis any story wee don't the as lot at large an to think at sons is get they made this announcement over and over without

that day to what last i ah that no cat happen again it is easy to think of a parade as something unchanging something the pass is through the same place the same time every year the carnival is this living thing that goes anywhere its welcome picking up pieces here and there and dropping them off along the way just as homage is reaching the end of the parade ran the sky cracks open again drenching the procession in steady sheets of rain plenty of people fleet through the barriers for the safe to v open subway entrances or store front awnings but a lot of people stay and then something kind of magical happens damages here's crank up the music she leave the mass bands an chance of wetted up and the people want water almost as if they were taunting the clouds daring the rain to fall y the masqueraders already soggy from earlier collective my decide what the hell and stare to jump up in unison harder and more exuberantly than they have all day was they cross the finish line the band

right now the united states experiencing the biggest border crisis in america history and ism looking at the front pages of the biggest newspapers in the united states rah now and none of them are even covering it the top head lines over at the washington post are all about a you en sort which is entirely irrelevant ordering israel to do more print harm in the goes strip or an albata man being put to death with nitrogen gas nothing about the giant wave the legal migration on a border that is now spurring a constitutional show down between the state of texts and by he way twenty four other states and the federal government same thing over at the you times nothing at the top of the home page nothing on what is going on at the border why because when it comes to the democratic party and there lackeys in the press they must cover up what is going on at the southern border because if america understand what is going on at the southern border jobidon will not be reelected it is that simple what is going on at the southern border is a travesty as i mentioned to you if mentioning too for a few weeks here near the beginning of canary we assume went down to the southern border in arizona and it is absolutely stunning what is going on at the southern border not merely the numbers of people or showing up at ports of entry and then being caught and released catching releases where you claim asylum they bring you in the process you there are no beds for detention facilities and they're not going detain you anyway to coming with the kid for very long instead they just release you into the interior with a come back later date which nobody ever does is not just that is that the drug cartels are in complete control of the southern border there a documentary that is now available at daily wire plus that shows you everything that we saw at the southern border we took a giant tour about twenty five miles of the southern border in arizona with brand and mud who is in fact the head of the border patrol officers union and it is astonishing because again not only is the southern border largely undefended it is made by this administration this administration has decided that what they are going to do is turn c b p into a bossing and processing service there effectively the d m b on the southern border for elegaliigrants what yule in a c in the documentary when y over to dailywire plus one o the things the you're going to s is a sin that is at the southern boarder that literally says two e legalimigrans in punish push this button for boarder patrol help this is over at the sand bagel gate in arizona which is actually on a native america reservation right at the border there is no boarder wall over there because the native america reservation is not want a border wall over this can literally just step over the border walk in a mexico walk back across the border into the united states people are arriving on mass dropped off by drug cartels drug cartels are literally taking trucks filled with the legalimigrans and they're driving them yards from the border dropping them off having people walk across because of jobidons asylum policies with are different than dona trumps asylum policies people are throwing up their hands surrendering to border patrol for patrol is then letting them into the country that is what catch and release is and we are talking about millions of people every year some estimates low end estimates say six million y legalemigrantshave entered the united states since jobidon took office high and estimates put that number all a up at an million illegal migrants and is not just that because the drug car tells know exactly what yo bison has done they have essentially decided to use this asylum process not only to smuggle more people across the border because does not require very much literally just drop somebody off at the border that they went i would drop ma his off at school they do not just do that they flood these particular areas of the border border patrol than has a legal duty to help process all of these people and as we show in the documentary this means large waves of theborder than in protected we drove for twenty five miles long america southern border in narizona not a single border patrol agent not one zero borer patrolagents why they we all over the mention facility in processing for where they take basic in formation about your life illegal emigrants our coming across the border with phone numbers of people in various cities they wish to visit we literally have on tape sheets of paper with phone numbers of people in denser in aslant in button they the entire desert is covered in trash over there trash left by illegal emigrants or crossing that dueler to get in and again it is not just that the drug cartels are getting paid for the illegal emigrants that they smuggle in at the border it is the drug cartels our trying to gather border patrol agents to the processing facilities and away from guarding the border that the really dangerous people not just the illegal immigrants want to come here and who want a work some one been well for were tongue about the people who are actively dangerous people with criminal records people who are terrorists people who want to smuggle drugs into the country when the borders in protected that is when these people cross the border with the help of the medical drug cartels how much technical superiority do the born did do the drugcartells have at america southern border when we are down there as we shown our documentary it is the first upper of new series were putting out called the divided states widen we should go checked out right now at daily firelock come one incident that we observed we are sitting down there at the border and it is the night were matins to it happens and suddenly i here a buzzing in the sky ani look back and it is drone and i turn to the borer patrol agent with whom we are siding and i say i assume that that is in america drone to monster the border is not we an't have drunk in this area that is a medical drug cartel drone flying over america territory by way is an america territory flying over america territory and hovering near the car we are sitting why are they hovering near our car because the drug cartels no with such precision which border patrol agents our where that they recognized that this car did not belong at the are hovering to trying establish what exactly that car was i ask the borer patrol agent and see this almedocumentary ask the border patrol agent why do not we shoot it down right men that that is eight that is a foreign aerial survalans vehicle from medical drug camels from a criminal cartel and he says you have to elevate that all the way to the secretary of homeland secure to get permission shit tat down that is what jobiton has done on our word he has turned our border patrol agents into either sitting ducks or facilitation agents for illegal emigrant and that is why f the state of texts is now saying to no we are going to en force the border get to more on this in just one second first if you are me it is

it the company you can be proud to spend your money with again that is pure talk dot come slash shipuro pure talk dot coma slash a pray to get started now here is the problem the state of texts can only do much far meaning that the state of texts can put up race are wirer the state of texts can put physical i pediments on the boarder to stop people from crossing over the america boarder one of the probes of the true border wall which again is a great thing the borderwall is very useful except you actually have to have people to guard the boarder wall that elegalimigrans and drug car members do not actually just sober directly through the the boarder patrol wall e get you saw evidence of this get in that documentary you will see sections of the wall the eve ben completely cut through cut through by the drug cartels is but one of the things that tat is amazing truly amazing is again that not only would texts have to build more i pediments there texts would somehow have to come up with a mechanism for expelling people back south of the boarder and that something the texts has not done yet not only that even if texts were to do that because of jo batons asylum policy all that would do its then focus all the rest of the legalimigration at ports of entry were people would still clam asylum toyed be better than currently is where here is crossing the southern border anywhere and throwing up their hands and the drugcar tells our literally using them as distraction technique than get dentinal across the boarder and purrs across the boarder you'll be better but the federal government is to blame for all of this the federal government has purposefully left the southern boarder not only undefended but in the control of criminal drug cartels this is not merely people wo are straggling across the boarder one by one trying to get to a better life this is being facilitated it is being created by the medical drug car tells in fact where we were down at the mammal eight in pelvis happening why because the day that we are down of the sanmagell gate which was again early canary there was not a lot of legal immigration that day why because the drug car tells were busy having a fire fight on the other side of the border with one another they are too busy killing each other to actually bring people up to the boarder that day the drugcar tells are in complete control down there tee in complete control and ism not the only one saying this this is right this t jo bison policy this did not exist on er dona tromptonal trump had a couple of policies that made it significantly harder for legal emigrants to cross this way one remain mexico remain a mexico is the single most important policy that jobidon dumped and dumped it a one an officiant you could reinstated to day again it is illegal to do what robin is doing on the border the law specifies that illegal emigrant must be detained not that they can be detained they must be detained until they have and asylum hearing remain a mexico change the law the executive border and executive agreement with the state mexico that remain a medical policy sad that effectively speaking if you came to the border and claimed asylum you had to weight south of the border before you could get your court date will that radically cut down on the number of people who arearriving n the border and claiming asylum because e you claim asylum and you are immediately released into the united states within seventh seventy two hours which is what is happening right now that is a very different story the you arrive at the border you claim asylum we tell you weight mexico you shop for a court date young have a claim for asylum and go back to mexico it's a very siren outcome its it one hundred per cent if now come habit the fact is jobinnesie did not the outcome with lassyleglimigration his facilitating all this and is really really dangerous is a letter that went out that a week and a half ago for from a couple of former members of the f b i and the c i a than inches sucker is assistant director of the criminal investigated vision of the f b i retired and heaven broch whose an assistant director of thdirectord of intelligence at the f b i at the national counterterrism center also retired an what they point out and they are totally right is that this is a massive national security threat they say has former senior executives of the f b i with deep experience combating dangerous to the nation we right to express our concern about a current specific threat that may be one of the most pernicious ever to menace the united states the danger arises from the nature of the threat itself wars ant expionotion bommington riots are sadly familiar delivery systems of instability intimidation and insecurity the country has face these and more throughout its sister and is held together the not without struggle that throat we call out today is new and in familiar and it is modern history the united states is never suffer and invasion of the home lend and yet one is folding right now military aged men from across the globe ut many from regions or countries not friendly to the united states are landing in waves on our soil by the thousands you be difficult to overstate the danger represented by the present s inside our boarders of what is a comparatively melted risen army of single young dust mails from hostile nations and regions whose background intend or allegiance is completely unknown in twenty twenty one they say the demographics of those crossing the ports southern border started to shift young men from around the world travelling alone and holding questionable motivations dramatically increased in number to become the most common profile of those region the nations o borders this happens to be true by the way we are told by border patrol agent who shall remain nameless that the number of terrors wo are being captured at the border is completely unspecified they have no idea even when somebody has caught on the terror watchlist that does not necessarily mean that the person is a terrorist because the tear matchless is really really say it is the unknown unknowns that are truly dangerous whenever we look at the stats on the southern border hive to recognize that it is a few different things that are being aggregated together one is border apprehensions to border apprehension by the way does not mean the person is kick back to mexico a border apprehension or a border in counter means the person it is taken by c b p and then process which means they end up in the country the vasmajority of the time under jobidon if they know the magic words if they say open sesame i want asylum i fear to go back to my country they are let into the country if's that simple s that is tight number one all get's moron this in just one second first it is twenty twenty four lot o people trying to get our finances in order they've some good

roadways there is largely camera coverage of the entire southern border if it camera coverage is is very comprehensive but you need to have actual agents wore watching twenty four hours to day the camera coverage to see what they can see now a bunch of those people do not get captured they get seen on the cameras and they escape into the interior weave no idea who they are that number it is at least six hundred thousand last year at least six hundred thousand known roadways just last year how but the unknown roadways how the hell should c b pen they have no idea get manual gives som estimate but they literally have no idea mean that that that is an unknown unknown s they do not know how many o there t but what we do know is that if those people want to just be released in the united states and for they us government to know who they were and what they were about if that is what they wanted if they just want to come here and the one to work legally and then hope for amnesty et some point them on to come her o get married to split for green card hey in to come here beyond welfare in in californium whatever if they wanted all of that the easiest way to do that is you throw up your hands and surrender to c b p the people who are crossing as unknown roadways our people who should not be in the country under any circumstances not just because they're are leglimigrans but because they probably have criminal records o drug connections at a minimum and many of them probably have terror connections as well because that is why you are avoiding c b p it is one thing back in the olden days when c b p was actually trying to stop everyone from crossing the border to say that many of the people are crossing the border between ports of entry and trying to evade border r patrol those people are are not criminals in in the sense of anything except fore the illegal migration than many of those people are you now the people who proverbially work in the fields or do the cleaning or whatever the left wants to say their important for because the left is very races with rehardtolout of the people but with that sad now that it is very obvious that you can surrender to border patrol and then move to button or good wood laptop or go to colorado or whatever the only people attempting to evade the border patrol are people who are presumably dangerous and that amounts to millions of people every single year because of what they are doing by he way the drugcar tells this the drugcar tells no this some the most shocking footage from the documentary that we just put out at daily wireless and any should go check it out lies really is shocking stuff s b p told us that some of the stuff that the drugcar tells do for example is they literally if they are being chase by so p and they are travelling with children they will literally discard the children were tong about babies come out babies the toilers or smaller discard the children hoping that s b p well go and care for the children as they are morally duty band to do they can evade a rest still literally take human babies and throw them to the side of the road in an attempt to distract sexy piece that can escape into the inter of the country they've no regard for human life the druggie tells none and this being again facilitated by the federal government as these former aftbii agent say all of this is particularly alarming and light of the commons terror attack on is real last october seven those whose who have fought terrors whom know that historically successful terrattax in vote mimicry we know as well the terror leaders intentionally cultivate the longs of young men possessing a certain easily manipulated personality type to carry out atrocities in the stark to say but having a large number of young mails now within our borders who could begin attack and gathering som unarmed citizens and imitation of ten seven must be considered instinct possibility that of course makes perfects and what we are watching wright now is absolutely unprecedented on our southern border and the media have nothing to say about it the only thing media can do is yell a republicans jo bison has the legal power to close the border to day no further legislation is necessary jobidon can do exactly what dona trumped jo bison can reinterpret the asylum laws to require the you make a colorable showing that you will in fact receive asylum before your releasing of the country jobidon can detain people and should detain people when the cross the word jobidon can renegotiate remain in mexico and do that again apparently sage do not won to that is this afraid total hand trump victory they w literally rather keep the border open rather than handle hand dona trumpet victory all of this is leading the states at the southern boarder led by texts to actually trying do something not mi say the takes o the souther order i really only mean texts new mexico is democrat govern they do not care about an open border arizona is governed by kat hobs she is deployed the national guard back an remember a little bit but i can tell you the border is wide open cause i was there it is kat hobs has said nothing virtually nothing about the bid administrations malfeasants here grab abbot for his part is trying to set up physical bar ears along the southern border that is t that razor wire is that is why they put barriers in the middle of the red ground because they have not come up with a process yet whereby texts will actually expel people backs out f the board which is what you had actually needs to you if you were going to repel wave legal migration that is currently happening pus you need way more personal down at the border is not just enough to have razor we you would actually have to have people who could theoretically a rest people and then come up with some mechanism for to porting them back to mexico because if they get to the razor war another get through the razor wire then the same laws that applied to word a patrol still apply presumably there is no mechanism in the state of texts freshly expelling people once they cross legally they would hand i over the federal government presume limit the federal government we will then presumably release these people a tor processing them in any case here is governor abbot explaining the he is doing the best that he can over here what quick point direction the o something bill you just sad an everybody saying n that is tat the free cry you say the drink were sad wen texts cannot we if you look it with a frinkwal as the issue they did not od it hap of location all they did was to vac a this circitcord who pills order an to sit back to the fessicar for o bills the two senses then there was no opinion abode anything about raze wire what teas is doing anything that i an but that join side regardless of well federal state may exist the supremos these supremacy law means then the constitution itself is the supringalon the land the construction it self good taxes with a my i self the sense in this case because you not as face as a abandoned is responsibility to teen e texts pellet more on this in just

fine black rifle coffee and grocery and convenient stores near you that is black rifle coffee america coffee hey the bide administration is can be forced to a choice here that choice is going to be to either sue the state of taxes for trying to enforce the border and try and force them to open up the razor wire just actively sue not it not to allow taxes to a low board patrol agents to cut the rewire but you stop tack is from reinforcing the border to actually side with vast swathes e leglimegration they are going to have to so or then in o have to acquiesce that is the there true the right now thar choosing a third path which is to try to blame republicans politically i do not think that is going to work republican governors all over the united states our backing great abbot's play as hell they should there is twenty seven republican governors in the united states at this point one of them is a governor abbot of course and then every other republican governor in the country has back great abbot's play if you looking a map it is every red state basically they are few sort of exceptions that a red states of blue governors in the blue governors refuse to back grew abbot's play and as you will see arizona in medical our couple of the statesmen ore not doing what great abbot is doing here but many of these governors came out early they said were sending national your troops down to help do what texts needs to do here here is governor discants o flora making that case brain is going after texts saying that they must re move fortifications from their border they put war they put thins to keep people out a bin saying y get a take that down the at people come in illegally which is just crazy and i remark that if the constitution was originally understood to mean that a see could not protect itself against an invasion that the federal government could force the state to allow an invasion the constitution would have never been ratified in the first place texts would have never joined the union when tin i and if you lek at federal at forty sex we cha i denial for it is pointed out a names malison talks about a situations were federal cuts men can be mitigating a by by state action say you have texts here a that is holding it is grown they have every i the forth my the border the of the in invasion an that is article one sexton tan of the constitution a they're in the right e the basis of course is correct here woes an a governor eff landed he also express his support for great abbot we supported you not i you e migration we support secure in safe borders not open border policies tell coos human traffic king and drugs to portion this country we stay we governorabment an texts in remaining the federal government that under our constitution states o still sovereign and we have the right the protect our citizens meanwhile both republican candidates still technically in the resnicky hailed is still technically in the race and of course dental trump is the leader in the republican nominations nick hale ash put to a statement before trusted there is nick whale's statement yesterday about what is going on at the border she said governor abbot is right the state of texts has every right to defend itself and its borders it is absolute ridiculous that jo bionic trying to stop governors from doing everything they can to protect their citizens it also nothing new ban was par of theadministration that suit me when i passed one of the sofas t anti legalongration laws in the country as governor u south caroling and the reason i point this out is becausewhen it comes to the twenty twenty four copy nominationrises let us be clear about this there are no open boarders its in the race and there really have not been throughout this entire republican nomination race donate true did come out late yesterday with a couple of statements untruth total he said when i was president we have the most secureboarder in history tjobiton has surrendered our border and is aiding in abetting a mass of invasion of millions of e legal migrants into the united states instead of fighting to protect our country from this onslaught bison is in believably fighting to tie the hands of governor abbot and the state of texts s that the invasion continues unchecked in the face of this national security public safety in public health catastrophe texts has rightly invoked the invasion class of the constitution and must be given full support to repel the invasion we courage all willing states to employ their guards to texts to prevent the illegal the entry of illegals hand's remove them back across the boarder now gain that is an extension beyond even at texts is doing right now texts not actively removing people back across the boarder once they get in the presumably being turned over to border patrol but that is what texts will have to do or we will have to beat what will have to make that case to the supreme sort the a candy all america should support the commonsense measures by texts authorities to protect the safety security in sovereignty of texts and of the america people says true when i am president on a one instead of fighting texts a work hand in hand with governor abbot and other for states to stop the invasion seal the border and rapidly begin the largest domestic deportation operation in history those baton has let in should not get comfortable because they will be going home is a firs felt great statement obvious trumpton rite it may they added some some weird capitalization try make item our up but does not matter again here is a thing about trump trump from one and presume a prospective trump true to the people who make policy in the trump administration are going to do a pretty good job and that is true when it comes to legal emigration above all other matters again having spoken board patrol agents and can see us talk about it again at the d plus documentary that we just made about this the should go check outright now become subscriber n you can see all of it the policy radically shifted from donate trump to obit join came in got rid of all the policies and that is why you've a wide open border beget more on this in just one second first according to forces canary is the hottest month for hiring with the calender it is canary business owners and hiring managers

positions on the border overtime it really is truly an incredible thing here is join back in two thousand seven talking about sanctuary cities again that when when people talk about by partisan polarization the united states something that is worth knowing here the republican party has not actually got more right wing on anything my entire life in fact they have gotten more left wing on wide variety of issues ranging from say game marriage two things federal spending the only area where they seems to we even held the line is on emigration democrats are the one who have had an asymmetric polarization them in radically the left on every issue here is a person you might recall from when he was sentient hoiden talking in two thousand seven out sanctuary cities would you alow these city to ignore the federal law regarding the reporting of illegal emigrants and in fact provide sanctuary to these emigrants the reason the cities ignore the federal law is the fact that there is no funding an the federal level to provide for the kind of enforcement of the federal level you need pick up the new york times day there is a city not far across the river for my state that impose the similar sanctions and what they found out is as a consequent of that their city wen the dumps in the dumpster store started closing everything started tohappenand they change the policy part of the problem is you have to have a federal government that can force laws this administrations fundamentally heroic in not funding any of the requirements are net even enforce the existed tenter bi yessing out which you allow the cities to ignore the federal law no o get that is jordan back when again he is a sentient person by way the a amazing contrast between jordan speaking in two thousand seven not just one policy and jobidensping in two thousand twenty forts astonishing you watch that back to back with jordan speaking now this is not even remotely the same human being a truly an amazing then will get to jobidon an the fact that he is breaking down in real time in a little bit here but that is how far the democratic party has moved they have moved just that far it is truly amazing much that h top ice official nan trick lighter actually had his chief of staff meat with a foolish border's actress andthn had to defend that the other day here we go ism wondering why the islet of a tat within abolished border is actor is earlier this week could you explain what is that counter ices missal o that is verger o to all ya stay ire re are ye me wit ma a a you a a ye real steps were is for and r inion ai tat not a of i vary formation er wore a rest ferritin woe leer my is ate he rearbyal r that is ridiculous ism sorry abolish sorts actives do not need be meeting with ice they do not need me me with their partnefhom that's carry their literally their goal is to ignore the law and eviscerate the law again one of things we saw down at the border when we are in in arizona signs of called humanitarian groups literally directing illegal immigrants aware from law enforcement people leaving in the apart bottles of water by the way not by the ports of entry not by the places where only the sort of civilian illegal immigrants are going a criminal place work criminally elegalimigrants are the most likely to be actually getting those bottles of water as they run into the country again nobody wants people to suffer nobody is suggesting anything remotely that but if you want a facilitate human suffering let the drug car tells continue to do what they are doing the earning tens of billions of dollars every single year the illegal immigration and drug smuggling at these borders it is a democrats have now been left with a final attempt move here before they have to cave on this thing and that is they are going to try to pretend that they are willing to compromise on the border when they really are not and there some republicans wo are willing to help them out in this it round being the most prominent among them here is coma arris making this case she says that here is a congressional negotiation going on it is ben going on fronts of this point it is a congressional negotiation over one hundred five billion dollar bill that will provide sixty billion dollars in aids you crane military ads crane some fourteen billion dollars in military aid to israel little but military aid to titan and some border money the problem is that all of the provisions on the border are really really soft as animal earthy has pointed out the republicans in the senate have negotiated a truly bad piece of legislation according to mac party's back in remember he says what is reportedly being discuss is a triggering mechanism that would empower government agents to close the border to illegal immigrants now so pristinely democrats do not want border closes are trigger until five thousand aliens have cross this that is on average day five thousand new leglimigrans a day that is what democrats were looking for in this negotiation republicans have signal they would agree to three thousand border crossings a day hem due to point out of this point three thousand border crossing to daywould be one point one million people crossing the border over the course of a year that republicans were seeking to do as they compromise with democrats now again join does not need the signal authority of this orbit would do it to day version could simply declare that he is going to pursue it remain in medical policy that everyone across o the border will be detained until they actually have a wait in sort no matter how long that takes he can do all those things he is not doing any of those things an these that these republicans have not pursuit that the stuff the democrats a unwilling to sign off on include for example a provision that requires that if somebody shows up at the border and claims asylum they have to show by a preponderance of the evidence that they actually will get asylum otherwise they will be immediately deported now it seems perfectly real singable to me you are making acquaint for asylum it should not be enough for you just to say i claim asylum woo michaold scout walking into the middle of the office toe clearing bankruptcy gets to show some actual evidence that you require asylum and by the way should be point ted out of this point there is no certain what right to asylum that is not e thing the federal government has the power to declare who can get asylum in who cannot get asylum there is no unspecified right that attached to foreign citizens of other countries we simply declare things without any evidence in encase your as coma derris pretending that because republicans are not caving on this border deal it is republicans far that the border is open jobidon could close it to day the first bill that we offered was a bill to fix the emigration sister and that is why an't central bout hollies and congress did not take it up and i will tell you that this is first of a on in incision but but sadly it has become deeply partisan and the subject of then political gamesmanship when in fact the solutions are at hand and we are for to solution early on and invited by partisan work let us work on it to fix this and in fact we have right now a proposal for fourteen million dollars that we can put more resources to address the very situation and on we hoping and and and are really trying to compel in particular some of the republicans and congress to participate an the solution but sadly you know we want o fix it they want o run on it no you you do not want fix you want to open the spigot wide they want more funding for the border what they mean by that they want more administrative law judges to allow people into the country more easily and more resources at the border patrol stations for detention processing that is what they want they do not want more resources along the southern border we can actual guard the southern border for example it is not what they want but naturally have people martini who are doing the biding of democrats on the sort of stuff heres martini who has not yet

worse ism ben to hero and this died states of bison invasion on the southern border watch now on daily wire plus the southern border as we have been saying is totally wide open the blame is on job biding and jobidon only he could stop this tomorrow join me on the ground as i bring you the real world consequences of on the most destructive presidencies an america history watch invasion on the southern border streaming right now over a daily wire plus meanwhile again the senior trying to drive a sentiment that its really republicans here standing in the way of the border issue join is the president jobidon is the guys who is in charge of the border it is jobidon who's going to war with the state of texts to keep t that border open meanwhile the senate negotiations at continue according to politico the white house is not backing away from negotiations over border deal even as don a trump moves to scuttle those talks n again it is not final trumps political interest for jobidon to be put on the defensive this is not unusual in politics it is not dona trump we would for jobidnd after run on his border record and he is not wrong jobidon has the legal authority to all say this a thousand times could is true has the legal authority to day to close the border an he is not doing any of that you do not need any more negotiations you do not need more border lie do not need any of that stuff jobidon could close it to day he is not doing it it is on him bother trying to blame trump for no more border negotiation or something that the white house is still hopefully deal could be struck on the here negotiators spent the frantic day trying to salvage talks after it was reported on late wednesday that senate minority leadermat's my call was basin trumps desires tot is all the ordeal the following day my call clarified he still supports pursuing for security link to crane funding tough he an other top republicans were not able to entirely as swish murmurs that it deal is on its death bed democrats were quick to cause trump of trying perpetuated crisis at the word for political gain the democratic sent campaign committee said sent re publicans are duo tanking a boreal for political reasons but the white house did not join the chorus they felt it was imprudence to join the fragwhel it is imprudent to join the francs severance just can a point out what i did which is he do not need a border deal tho close the border you got all the laws on the books already need the other thing here is that again if jo bin yous caped her if he scape he would get as you crane funding which supposedly he wants my call for his part there is suggestion that he had basically killed the deal himself because he sees there is not enough support in the house actually pass i deal but apparently on thursday he said he still supports o for security teal link craned at at tale end of the senator pie's last meaning of the week my call removed outs he said he is still forcefully pushing a deal the would par new border an migration destruction with money fort you crane but that is not actually in a solve the problem because still have to pass in the house it is not goon happen to day a bit we berth notice border compromise even looks at this point before pecan make a judgment as to whether republicans should sign on to it in the house in senate we have to find out what looks and e both line is that even if the sin on to the ore compromise join is still responsible for it goes on the works again he already has all the legal authority all legal authority of also on to the twenty twenty four race itself the republican side of the allezardy decided it is it is it is over but bad look for the ran c the are c yesterday declared that the were basically going to ut that there is a draft rains he resolution to declare him the presumed did d declared trump the presumptive hominy that is stupid what is the point of that an all of this can hubbub and mayday over nick helper man there is dumb it is really dumb just ignore her if your trump she is not going to win the more attention you paid her r theme immediate gan a pa mention to her and nickel valley is banging on trump and here is nickel half yesterday mocking dona trumps gifts suggesting he is lost to stop and then donate trump got out there and just through a temper tanker he piece to fit he was he was in soothing he was doing what he does but i know that is what he does when he din secure i know that is what he does when he is threatened and he should feal threatened without a dow you know tin tor think big o the few days ago he was going on and on about me i mean for a while on and on about why i did sending security to the capital on canary thick he said it over and over and over and over again i mean somebody's got a tell him i was not there on canary this a never den at the capital working in a job that that i think he is a it confused and well let that has again town trumps just ignorant to gait i meant the more he pays mention nick hailing the more the in see tries to preemptively declare the ran over which cast attention and it he daily the worse it is for dona trump which trumpet he knows which is why he told the arrest to stick it he is lestn'nt i need you to pass resolution here guys they ready know that i have this wrapped up do not need you to preemptively crown me king chippy of course who is right on must the issues chip re publican congress men from texts he says it is stupid that the araks he is attempting to this just go and earn it if trump trumisgon with the nomination anyway why are we doing this well first lemme say that i think they he with you prospect to hat a represents that all part of the republican party that i just for scat a land basting that spit spending an all defense and endless wars i think we need to move a differ direction i they present true represented in twenty sixteen that challenge to the establishment a challenge to drawing the swap but i do not think we should be coronation somebody i went out an campaign and i we do not corineight people you do not wed not just choose somebody and yer you get anointed i go through the process go earn it i because it makes you sharper in the generallection ye know if he does not think that he has not in to worry about the to work about it go campaign and go win he should be able to wet in south caroling i base that i think the elect tor in south caroling we should proceed with the elect electoral process and if he is ultimate lye the domino by votes then he should be supported as the domino for the republican party but you got to go earn it you do not just get coroneted a he is obviously right about all of that meanwhile jobidon continues to be on the campaign trail but when i say he is on the campaign tell i mean they've let the prey much wheeled out his prone body and it is just making noises now he is very weird here he was just luring his way through a rally yesterday a as jo me can let you a don't mass with the region e n i we also have some screaming jobidon and more gaffing join but its endless i meanies an endless source of a consternation i think it should be to america it is it is pretty incredible that disguise the president a an a to ma tan a to ma beer be here west for get is make two beard an was a a would ream an under my professor we go tears one my premises i a people keep pretending that he is not in the cline and i play to clip earlier of him talkinmat the border forget about the content to what he saying i don't play that again for you because the contrast between jobidand twenty twenty four and toilet don't seven is printystrong for people who do not believe in not decline in elderly age for i for jobidon and here is jobidon this a an seventeen years ago and this s not the same do the reason the cities ignore the federal law is the fact that there is no funding in the federal level to provide for the kind of in foremen of the federal lever you need pick up the new dark times o day is a city not far coss e river for lie state that impose ta similar sanctions and what they found out is as a consequence of that the city wen n the dumps in the dumps tor stor started closing everything started to happen and they change the policy that is not the same do right there one of the reasons that he is unpopular it feels no one us in control that sort of feels but a corn compel garrison because they have not take an adequate credit this is one my favorite political lines and there there certain political line to heraldic when somebodywho retires from office for a scandal they say the one spend ore time with their family s thing no you do not you are a tiring becauseyou are banging shucker and and one o the other favorite political lines is the reason were in popular is because people just do not understand what were doing enough an have only we explained at better of can explain his was comely you are right we have a lot of accomplishments and i think what the america people wat most in their leaders is that we actually get things dot and we an dot it we have not taken adequate credit for it frankly and we got in to the matter top of getting the word out about what we have a comprise and who did it and who in yet that is that is your a promise people do not understand you well enough i think people understand you they just on it very much meanwhile the democrats a rolling out the big guns in preparation for twenty twenty four the rolling out in fact a very biggest gun john steward is back now you may be saying yourself is not john start really old and you would be craton start is now sixty one years old john steward is six years younger than my father john steward is he decade older than nick daily and two decades older than rondosantis john steward is in fact a senior citizen and that guide the rolling him back out as though he is the voice of a generation over at the daily show because the daily shows been a crapshoot ever since john start left now there is something to points out here one the rolling john start out as though he is a trustworthy force he is had a show an apple to for last year n it is literally one of the worst things it is it is just an awful awful show and one o the reason o really awful shows cause he does not have his good comedy writers first of all comedy central was a comedy it was a comedy central right it was it was a comedy network and because was a comedy network that meant that he had joke writers but his new show is not his old show an apple ten he actually tries to understand shes n t does not go well for him because he he just does not understand issues he is not somebody who spent his life in politics john stewards in tire routine for literally entire career has been what we used to call clown knows on clown knows off and that was when you critique his politics you put on the clown is ism just a comedian you expect a commdionto know anything ism just a comedian i do not know anything look at these idiot politicians expecting media ism a comedian and then the minute the hold question somebody would be cloned us off have a very serious question for you is it not not a commeteaquhat a very serious c scion for you and was really obnoxious and really ugly but i want to clibettemi john start as a singular media figure did more over the course of the first decade of the twenty first century two destroy actual political media in this country more than anyone else more than any one else there used to be a time in this country is funny earlier this week lexfreetman his wonderful guy released a debate that i did with a streamer call destiny i folks man on show little but earlier see befell seven t e perfectly nice fellow is on the left that a really good interesting discussion like two and a half hours an just us going back and forth on the issues really sticking to the issues and it was conciliatory in in mood but but very different in terms our politics obviously and most of the comments on line were things it is just great the people can have a discussion any more you want knowhow ended the discussion it was john steward it really was ow no who recalls this because now an entire generation has passed this kennistuff makes me feel old an remember when it happened wive as twenty when it happened and up john start an two thousand for during the two thousand force between gorge snobbish and john carry and john start wont on a show that was down as cross fire for those you do not remember at a media history cross fire was a show on signed that star tucker carbon in a much earlier iteration of tucker carbon is bogie tucker carbon firs as polbagala who is a democratic consultant originally for bilclintn and they would basically get on the air and the were debate issues everyday and john start who was a comedian playing the clowns on clown not offering he goes on signed and he then proceeds to say that these two are ruining the country for having what was effectively a civil debate about the issues they were ruining the country and here was john start rocking cross fire again that was a place where people to added discussion from different sides the out uni you cant we a so this any more an used be lots to shows this here is a show fox us to be call handy and comes a generation ago allay calms doffed off now just strong handy at there used to be shows on the air all the time in which you would have a member o the right member of the left they were debate and believe there not when jo scarborogh's morning jo started jo scarborogh was more of republican and mega brushinsky was morgedemocrat used o be more that the has completely disappeared the modern media landscape i it is because of what john start did here what he did is he lied he said that a partisan disagreement is inherently bad and that makes the country worse that when people air there disagreements in public with one another and they argue back and forth that this rips part the country it is precisely the opposite it is when jack assist john start mug for the camera after showing a clip out of contact that the country gets worse instead after having to know anything the entire game becomes show clip of somebody doing due thing then go that was john start's entire stick for twenty years and that substituted for actual political conversation it is substituted for actual political date nobody got smarter watching john start in fact's got significantly dumber watching john start show because he is entire stick was basely a twitterdunk he hose twitter dunks before wore dunks worth thing here is john steward going after locker carbon in polbigalla and basically because of this again the notion of e civil debate between competing sides o the out which was hallway back to shows firing line in the late sixties early seventies you be debates with people between willing f buckle and john kennel galbrays are you used to be people showing up on the show to debate each other and it would be people malcolm murage and bob woodland or not choosy would show up and he would be to bating somebody henry passenger made that that kind of stuff happened on tenia used to actually be an intelligent country the country and then john steward came along and again it is not as though we are at the peak of television politics firing line was significantly better show than and cross fire because willing f buckle was frankly much more intelligent than any one in politics for a very long time but john steward ripping down cross fire was in fact one of the signal medium moments in america history here was i made a special ever to come on the shortly because i have a privately among my friends and also and occasional ispavrtion elisions mentioned this show as being a a bad and not us and and i wanted to i felt that that was not fair an i should come here and and tell you that i do not it is not much that it is bad as it is hurting america si wanted a on o i day won and say wen i ha nothing e we car ares just want what i wanted to tell you get ye is stop o top stop stop hurting mere o you and and come for for us but i we ask the people hat you pa the people not not were i what you can sleep at night see the thing is winging her your hell you are right now you are helping the politicians and the the the corporate and we are left out there be om a for i we too rough on he wen ma is ta on o no you not too rough on them you are part of there stratagem you are partisan a what he call hacks you are doing theater when you should be doing debate which would be great not i ones why don de i no ones what you do is for e partisan hackery gay again he is one being dishonest and how do you say and you would help the country rain he is this is a demand godjec argument in the disguise of comedy which is what john steward to better than literal known very talented at it now come press end's on towns tat he was who supertawlented at it but what he is doing in that particular club is really dishonest what he is saying is tat you got you are you are just you are helping the politicians because instead of just having a debate you are actually helping the politicians by being partisan has well what you are basically saying is that one side deserves defense and the other side is hers mockery which was actually john steward's model john stewards and then when ye called the pines to omits to comedian ism just commits now the bringing him back from the dead and they are going to have him on i guess once a week on monkeys to talk about the election and make the country worse again but i think it is worth while to point out that nearly all political commentary on cable the has now become john start john to returned everybody into john start richly every main stream political commentator on t v now does this model of what it looks much if you if you pick up a chelonian then a masenbusy or even fox news right now if you watch those shoes your very unlikely to see inept political commentary what you are much more likely to see is somebody doing a quasi cosmetic monologue with a pickax pick weresmebody makes a face that every one turn to johnstord because of john start to par or poticscep batter or worse it turns out that mockery is really bad for politics sometimes mockery deserved and mockery is funny and we do some of it on the shell well we also try to do is a should go through the issues in at johnsteren never tried to do that but he is really successful in not doing that to ignorance it turns out is really a successful it is a successful strategy being in ignoramus for pay is a great strategy in the modern media all you dost i do not even know wit is going on man you what is going on all i know is that now john starts entire model and what it became all of politics and that was not good for america politics joining some e line is spencer at linguistic o fields report fort the aware and he is cruelly down at was lexica border right now spencer thanks much for joining us very much rather less talk about what you are seeing to day down at the southerbordr where are you at the border some right here a shall be part this is an eagle past taxes this rind me a here this is the international bridge leading in the mexico and this park has been the a recenter of this fed between the state of taxes over rabbit and t the federal government of course we have this supreme court ruling just this week n have this on going struggle over whether not the state of taxes can put up razor wire to the our iris coming in the state of taxes can in fact thatched have not ben ordered not to take the rewire and put it there is just that they cannot stop the federal government from dismancelling the razor wire if porter patrol wants to go in dismantle the razor wire than the state of taxes according t the supreme court has to let them go and do that this all seems to be coming to a head because of course governor abbot has now suggested that he is going to not only continue to erect razor wire but also may be take other measures the reality is of course until texts comes up i the mechanism for expelling people back to mexico that razor wire can only stop people theoretically from crossing the boarder where is the razor wire is it actually in america territories it right on the border what are you seeing over there trusting two different tax of wire the they are using her the borer and this is right on the banks of the real grand la adding the entire lag for this park they have got shipping containers non top those shippinyetanas they have actual full leg razor wire and on the ground that gotsomlin called triple strain concertino wire which is similar but little bit different the all this is to serve at the determine and of course with the supreme cradasruled as you stated is that fort patrol or can through this wire they are lo to do that but the each is that the taxon fatal garden laxity yes are not allowing for the patrol into this park the park is sealed off all the aces i it is very timely control of and really its just eats authorities and certainmember media t a being bit but beyond that this entered all these entrances are very much sealed abort by text national guard and a department of public safety we what are you hearing from members of border patrol or any one else over there about that stand off which really does not seem to be at the at the razor wirerself seems to be at the entry to the part has there been any arguing what exactly happening the been loin a confusion because we actually have seen some port of patrol vehicles entering the part and something interesting here is that there is a botgram they are allowing limited acts of to bort of patrols a they can use this botgramd but beyond that i really have not seen any interaction between members of bort of patrol and members of these acts authorities the conflict really does seen relegated to of course the media and the courts and the water political struggle but here on the ground there really is not too much tension between these two groups and we know to day that there was an ultimata at a dead line really that was set saying that borbetral must be given aces the part from what have seem on the ground here there does not seem to be much confidence at the federal government is act can be taking much in the way of action if that dead line is not that we have you seen a line of i llegalimigrans at the actual border itself is what was the standing of the the actual on what you seen there it certainly seems that these fortifications have worked i came here in may i twenty twenty three and who a wildly different seen we saw i really this was publicly accessible and you could go really almost all the way up to the border and you did see people coming in this venters at ascerculanded of ta dozens even hundreds of people coming in through this crossing but right now were not seen very much the way of crossings there was recently just at damn that letmore water flow down the rear grand this increased water is increased rising water level this suppressing some of that turned out from the migrants but at the same time we do know that the actions from deep play in the national guard are cutting back on the number of crossing at the seeing i just last night actually obtained of video were taxes upon of public safety and national guard were together the to apprehend some political migrant and actually arectisit an imprison those two who came here that they charged them was trespassing a we do know that these these tactics have been effectual these tactics have been effective presumably the yo you mention they've been charged with trespassing that a domestic america crime presumably they would be if con evicted holden in domestic america prison or turned over to the federal government if emigration stud was chapter case whom it will be there not here legally and the he question then is what the federal government does with them o you have any status or was the plan with those particular people that is one of the ticket points right now like you said these people they are being taken to he local domestic jails domestic prisons a we do not know exactly where these people on to and out but we do know that they're going out of their way the text authorities that is to to not just hand is people over order patrol because they know that if they do have them over toe port o patrol what were like have s they will be processed et may be handed off to an engine that will allow them to fly throughout the rests of the country they are and specific actions at a being taken by texts authorities to make sure that these people do not be handed over boarder patrol for that reason for the fear that they wolves process in blowing of the interior he to obviously that this the situation continues to be very fluid on the ground were going to have to come back to you for updates as you gain any more information what what are you hearing from tat the various sides of this debate on the found you said that there seems to be mostly confusion on the ground what a you hearing from and texts state authorities as well as that the border patrol the federal authorities well it certainly seems that texts d pes and national guard or u set on that maintain their fortifications here just last night i saw engineers with the national guard putting up more razor wires they certainly have no intention of backing down contention of taking down this razor water and it does not seem the they have not intention of letting port of patrol take control the park ark either it seems that taxes is taking in their heels and it certainly certainly engobe inviting to watch how this situation grasses in the coming days id spent linguist reporting from the borer spent to really appreciate your time and thanks for to you are inside on the ground than you very much ill gan just one second were going jump into the latest news from the international court of

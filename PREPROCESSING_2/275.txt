from w e s chico it is this america life ism kinda off yo want sitting in for era glass writ is here but ism taking over to days show because we are talking about questions that i think our pretty fundamental to all of us at serious points in our lives but are especially pressing for me these days it'd to explain with a brief example of a situation i find myself in all the time lately with my two children feeling deeply lost it is bathtime job the older one is running a restaurant he's giving out grief prizes cups were grown ups and all animals i won on animal i of says if some one in your family is christian he can get one of those an w no oi ta no theroid you he snatches the animal and says sorry w y cannot have any animals christian why can a i no news aloud says my three and a half year old to my jewfish face o a here is my question what am i supposed to say writ here because i should say something wright i should say that is not o say because why because i said because you are a new because news your great grandparents were driven from their communities by exactly the mentality you have just express to me my gree and half your boy or because we live in a majority christian country and ism worried that have clearly already failed to provide you it the positive relationship to nudism or is the best approach not to say anything he is just having you bath i do not know as you will here but pled is it is not nice to say that somebody can not something because they are not ay your car o have thy a o see any y r nor i many rules in this any to mini restaround he says there kind for some people job not my kind of people ow e the problem with talkingkids about anything that is actually important bis that they do not know anything it is your jab to teach them about all the stuff that matters most bat you have nothing to work with they do not know religion they do not know history they do not know how ta maintain proper hymen also a problem they are little and they have feelings you have to be careful about saying well plenty tell you a story about a man named at off either you would have the way you run your restaurant by the way we have all been on the kid side of this kind of conversation where a grown up is fumbling through with some thing that is clearly important the big one most of us remember is when some one told us about sex and on the adult side whatever the question is what is sex what is god or what is sis what is transgender me in that moment that what you say could really matter could be the thing this person remembers and carries with them into adulated could shape the way they feel about their safety for their sexuality these conversations are how we make are mark on the next generation they are also very often how we learn how much we do it know and into day show we are gin a listen in as people take on three of the most difficult things to talk about we gong to hear teenagers talking very frankly to each other about sex parents talking to their children about race and kids talking to each other abouttdest to dey show the birds in the bees we have got jot and gold seen comedian do canoe bow stay with us a o act one some it not on the new to begin i should say throughout this hour we are going to be talking about subject matter that can be difficult to discuss with children if you have got kids listening that is something to consider also in this next story as era says we will be acknowledging the existence of sex and talking a lot about our reluctance to speak of its existence o get let us start with the beginning one way a lot of kids learn about the birds and bees is from each other the seven year old name foxy told me a friend of hers this guy errand said something to hear that bothered her on the bus he said if you drew a picture of a baby on a piece of paper and put it in her belly that would make a baby foxy knew this was incorrect that is why bothered her a week later at the playground across the street from her house she sat errand down a such a way shat a bet e a paper not working a that be on the buff a few days gall you talked about pay to et body en about li a a only a a ta shut a i data do a i not sure jut the baby cat to my you see i u say so need a make ta for an the from fa how a a a an the cot work i do that to at ha now ya do say when it comes the sex a lot of us learn the wrong thing first an the right thing later you learn through a series of corrections you start to find out the half the things your brother told you we are not right that that seen in the move is not realms it that sepia discants was lying when she says she did that thing because that thing is not possible that is busily our system you learn things wrong last them out and hopefully get the real story from some one ma moon this begins on the playground and just continues all the way until you actually start having sex and all the weird information that was not corrected begins to matter you hoping there going to cover hope web tender is in a class from at buffalo state with about fifty other people mostly men mostly his fraternity brothers he's her for some sex at i to a she she l of e w don't you know i alga she good question this is a voluntary workshop about sexual assault an consent on a money night you think this event might not went out over say pitting up the jump just or staring at your vangoposter but this room is pocket the students are wide awake knees are bouncing hands are shooting up in the air the instructor paulomagrical is talking about the importance of consent o consent is a verbal and enthusiastic yes o ka why is it enthusiastic you why exactly you want to do it and sex should be why a yet i hope this kind of worship was repeated in classrooms all a crass campus here and throughout the country in the last were college administrators are panic about sexual salt as they should be there turning to this kind of education as the answer instead of mostly focussing on protecting women things grape whistles i travel with a butty programs they also wane to teach men actual sentences to say do you this can i kiss you but the sins here are struggling with the basic premise they have to learn to speak in this new way because if you do not your rapist because it is just more virtuous they have questions rite from the start it is a continuous process of checking up what it are checking in either or what is that mean a it we says yes if she says yes on much o when a if she says yes at this you knows she you saying ye i got to be e o sure you really sure you not to do is ism almost the am o the go a she this get the protection no not you a you re you war you are w no on yourself an i stop bike but the keep to we information of yes her obtain the conto you miss of the move hope like should the be a number of toms that she us he presses them on this to three seven but that guy is overtaken by his fraternity brothers who also have urgent questions does body language countess consent what if she said yest before you got into the room when you are both sober and a message on twitter something how many beers is too much to have consent again please offer and member li you've heard the turned uncles liquid crime what if a sent a sent always you you by covers that you on be nous about his at a give you was you liquid coatee i am not will be taking wit she doubled you fill me light you not use in that to get a yes the next guy over interrupts what if both parties are drunk and then across the room does the girl need to ask for consent another student of what if we have been together for a year paulomagrigal replies you always need consent even if your woman even if your man sleeping with men even if you are in e relationship eve if you have sex every day even if you are in the middle of see or if you guise are engaging in sexual activity and may be all of a sudden someone decide i want to try it rough if you guys already starred having sect that the other person can withdraw that consent o ka that is why it is active what if some one's i want to have another person here now let us have three people you already haven sex if all a sure there surprise i have another person o a you can be at om i did not really sign up for that i not a here o ka does that make a little bit more sense when we talk about ouzo checking in in the active process those are carefully chosen examples the vast majority of sexual salts on college camasses occur between two people who know each other and there is not always physical force pula is trying to say take the picture you have in your mind of a serial predator rapist put it to the side for a moment imagine instead a person who wakes up in the morning and wonders quietly to himself she was into that right yet she was in to that imagine that person is wrong the workshop was suppose to be forty five minutes it is been an hour pall a madrigal is trying a wrap up how do you guy d you guy a was for how do you gas for contact i aka o is mess a gold molly my extent it is been an hour and the students in this room are still fixated on this question of the mood i do not remember there being a whole lot of mood when it came to sex in college annoy maybe ought all had candle darkrooms but there is genuine panic behind that question it is dismissed in a workshop about sexual assault because of course it is were taking bout assault you are talking about the mood those are two separate conversations but these gas are trying to have just one conversation about everything e conversation that takes into account consent but buss all f their questions and anxieties when it comes to talking to a person their sleeping with it seems that is a conversation they have never had that is one of the hardest thins ever she chair on find out how would gig my final with the other personal this is magic mandalas a college freshmen in buffalo i known magic from previous reporting he is lovely and every freshmen at his school he is been to a constraining in the last year i fell if wergana lay the burden of changing the way we talk about sex at the feet of eighteen year old people who are already many years into learning weird and bad and confusing information if that is our answer to reduce sexual assault i wanted to know more about what these guys actually know and where they learned it then walkabout women all the time they i just thought moon may always talk to me about his favorite sex position or and old the to to tell me their favor sexmentions and then we will just talk about oh that is cool that is of it'll try out on wen her it thought to men who are sleeping with women talking about what women two other men yet that is just it is more et well decide what women do what do not when you take to women about what they yet loci is defile men talk to men about what woman that is how i like that is how even if you get told by women when she you will be of i know that i lately magic's biggest source of information is his roommate elite less he brought elite up a lot elite says he first learned about the person be from his cousin then you get older than you see know sportilasreted than you see the playboys an you see the porn than you see the girls gone wile than you see those lake the girls go wile t late commercials pulp that thee born morning girls go awhile the i think i think that is wake when you start learning else was not the first or the last person i interviewed who told me he learned about sex from corn magic is learning how to engage with women from other men who are learning from porn that s learning chines from a white america and coming her missing some key primary source information every person i talk to who works on sexual assault prevention brought up one thing as particularly troubling about the way men learn about sex and it was not porn it was baseball that we talk about sex its baseball getting a home run as a metaphor for sex they said think of how many bad lessons are built into that metaphor you go first base second was this was there is only one direction to move and a home run is a wen not to mention you are on opposing team it is competitive and it is a sort that mostly only men play magic gins alive is not attach to secs being baseball or born nail just wants to be a good person he wants to be good to people he is looking for some guidance magic is always looking for guidance hes solicits advice often this is not example i homer my cousin telling me only got a kiss a got tin that gokisshe got new out i got holy all the him all mucro lazy itself that soften that is motorway let magic ever the careful student kissed news every one of them another friend told them women it when you are funny he tries to be that but then haji about a girl friend who told everybody he was a bad kiss er an some one told them please stop kissing my neck she thought was gross and he felt wait do i know things or doing not know things thatfinly when you younger you think of it more as rules an steps to get to of like to get lad all when you young you think all it is i have to do this that i have to follow this steps shall have to kiss her in this certain place than i have to make her than i have to i on old touch her to an o in no a pul but er something if a and then finally we get hi but is not that for is not that at all it is less it is very i is if very is different from personal person i is he could be anything iron it got it give that not envy go something that you do evenothers different every one is different girls very people very what if that was the first thing you learned about see what if instead of starting at eighteen years old with rate and moving backwards to teach consent what if you just started with people very because if you understand that consent follows you have to ask questions and talk about what you and do not otherwise you will never know you may be with one of those neck people and you may not i li for the rest of to day show we are going to leave sects behind and we are going to step forward from the beginning of life to the mercy complicated middle the other facts of life that you really do not want to have to explain to children because you wish they were not facts or part of life at all our next try is from w comma bow he is a comedian on a father and recent we come outs then planning for a conversation he really does not one to have with his children one that is familiar to black parents everywhere in america act to if you see racism say racism here is come out i talk about race and races in my act a lot some would say too much it was how i was raised something is have harder stores mi family as thinking about races sos no surprised me that after i became apparent i began to do jokes about raced races and fatherhood it be class not time your black a to racealok have you talk to you doter about the fact she that she is black w no shes tree tax don't ant a buyer to at soon o say big black is great bits bits big responsibility know to o wit ls e for to now be acid she do the rid a when i should to like to dine you not where we will not a ye table lie whats he go ye and your black o all an a secret that lay every say cake tout every day which is kind if having i a it is couldn't know win out cut no there is e historical cots i for the and ow is too girls a baby named and an almost for your old name mammy my wife solicit is wife and mammy calls herself pean butter she noted to say much of anything et my wife and i have both put our toes or at least our older daughter mammy's toe in the race pool to we have not even put the slightest hint of a sammytoe into the racism pool yes those are separate pools the race pool is filled with positive stories of black achievement african america roll models books and teeny shows featuring diverse characters our race pool even has quanta but mammy's racism pool is completely drained with the lock on the gat and we run past it every day on the way to the race pool and every day that goes by i fill guilty the racism pool is treacherous it is not fun to swim in when if you are not careful you drown in the sorrow of the black experience in america we live in berley people hade been protesting the police blocks from our house how do i explain that s this was on my mind recently how to teach mammy about racism when this thing happen it was canary twenty six my birthday i was having a low key celebration just i hem i was carrying a children book i just bought for mammy the case for loving the fight for inertial marriage minded richer loving are the interracial couple responsible for the supreme court striking down the laws in sixteen states that band into racial marriage and if i was going to get into raise with mammy than the loving story which was about a family ours seemed a great place to start i was headed to meet up with my wife at the emit came a restaurant she loves this was her second time eating there that day after we would gone their earlier for breakfast it is not really my conclave slip to impress with itself blue two humble bragging about its late served in bowls i get to the el with came and i see my wife sitting at one of the sidewalk tables with our baby and three other mobs and there babies the four moms all look they would go out for the say passing call for white woman mid thirties who was recently had a kid and while exhausted is doing a great job of keeping it together my wife introduced me to the group we made small talk one of the women asked about the book in my hand i turned it over and showed it to her she nodded at the cover i did not get the sense to the story that is what i heard knock knock knock it was on the cake's window coming from inside i looked up and saw a woman a serve her who clearly worked at the elnmwit came she was angry and looking at me next she flicked her head and mouth something i did not know what but the message was clear git or maybe was gram seriously what is the difference i was flooded with thoughts i could barely process i was stunned i was hissed i wanted to run away i fell i might pass out i was actually strangely em embarrassed as if i had done something wrong maybe i shouldn't have been talking to my wife and her friends list and i might have exchanged words we might not have i think i said something the effect of a woman told me to get out o here there was some realizes and a couple of whats within seconds another servant came out and pretended to do her job she did not have a water jug she did not busty tables she did not drop or pick up any checks she just stock the area and by the area i mean me finally molissit could not take it this is my husband oh the waiter said looking at nobody in particular we thought you were selling something she thought i was selling something that is my wife and my daughter i said we just eight here earlier to day we thought you were selling something she said sorry in berley selling something is code for homeless what she was saying was we thought you were homeless first wall is wearing a knit cap a goodie gas and sneakers i was just mark zuckeberg in winter but i knew the part of me to look homeless was not my clothes it was my skin specifically how my skin was getting close to a bunch of white mobs and their white babies but you know only looks white she is it of late each is again ism sorry me i bet your sorry oke ism going to take a walk and think about racism that is any what i said i did not yell it but i did not say onto my chest e melisma stayed behind to give the waitress a peace of her mind then we went home and militia cried we hugged each other and were preoccupied with it really bothered really obsessive and stuck in it we knew we had to do something i blogged about the whole thing and posted a picture of myself wearing exactly what had worn when i was at the plywood and also holding my book on the leavings within a couple hours the storied spread around the bear people on line started debating every single point people debated whether what happened was races whether or not i was races people blame me for marrying a white woman it became the righteous indignation story of the week it is hard to know what to want after something this happens i did not wanton apology from the owner though we got one i did not want the waters to be fired though she was moles and i wanted something more substantial we wanted a public conversation between us and the came owner and the employes involved we wanted the community to show up and talk about their experiences with things i this we wanted or re and we found out a lot of people wanted that many people wanted to discuss the in with came that our idea to have a public discussion snowball with our daughters in our mind before i could say rose of parks we had a venom and an event planter the cafeowner was there and a full on panel of betted academics and active there was a detailed i itinerary and a modern ism sure the i many of you heard the story a the get that get that happened on canary twenty six on a fridge in march mils and i sat on a stage at a middle school an a packed auditorium my main concern was that somehow the planning structure was going a lead to an event that was careful sanitized and may be the worst thing boring it was not do in large part to two amazing women on the panel cedetia means who get to an a minute but first picky ones o get but a mi professor voice nickel ones teaches at she berk she said something that for me made sense of the world not just about the small racial injustice that happening cares but the bigger deadly ones the are happening all around america she asked us the thing of the world in terms to black space and white space credits elite undersea for the theory but to night she made it her main point like says people have ideas about black spaces it is tied to blackness and poverty and the ghetto it is impossible to say there were ghetto in america without thinking about black people see a black man in a suit your brain does a calculus what poor neighborhood did he or his parents rise up out of or his parents pants it all goes back to the get i ain't gate we thought as believe to be carried on the body i on inion black people i neperethen special do limit when black people are in white space what is white space jest about everywhere else i she says you see berley were she teaches white space most all education public and private white space move theaters restaurants some of my own stand up shows ism looking you spoke can white space public radio white space and of course the elm will came is win ten white spaces black people have a special burden an a face a number of dilemma they have to pro that they belong there the burden is on that to prove that they belong in a particular space now let us go back to the incident who belongs in that space what is the presumption about what comma was carrying on his body of course not belonging can work both ran a white person in a black space likes a similar trustworthy of us but think of how rare it is that a white person goes to a class spae a tourist in another country you can leave when ever you chaos an abut the highland of the night high school senior cassia means his eighteen a made a man for herself in the maria as an actors she is an also public speaker who importantly to me knows that a open with a joke number one i want to say that been black all of my life am that is e pretty god about of medications for me to a be at u suggest ice a in it o and then she said something that made me take actironnos she talked about being younger than my daughter sandy when she learn race i learned about race it a really young edge ma two or three i my at has a really had way of teaching about stations when you mud make me trust you would cut it and half and you ti a its the for though learned about race in a kind of similar way a learning that white did not mean white paper a a it was a constructs salon that pretty you not heard am my oldest daughters for she is just wit them understand that people different colors i cannot imagine somehow can new sing that to the fact that race himself as a construe ism not star i and to find the work construct to another adult let alone a for year old capita then closed with a few tips on how we can all be less races just this one for it less on color blindness because honestly you are not going to get a gold star for that be more color spite be grand this one please don't call people articulate do not come out to me a a ow man live do no do that and that the wholmench of reasons why that we do not have time for black on in a grab penance om paper because she is on a run your mind makes generalizations that is what it dos it is not bad to d that it is bad to think that that one generalization what every one is the you all to have to take a strap outside of that and remember that people are individuals people have different lives just because ism black does not mean i act other black people black people built this country wether you it a not let lest please thank you nose was impressed by a reason i began to think about her dad the one ho taught her about fractions in race cadisios completely first in the evils of races but she was also idealistic about the future she understood how well inti the people to de races things but how they does not always make them bad people she got the broad strokes and the new dances ancadisia also knew how to do something that is absolutely essential to your surly what's a black person in america she saw and identified racism in her everyday life and she did not internalize but she also did not ignore it she is get flip did not kept walking i wanted some advisor how to made i kit that who was the dad i imagine him to be a makes of sixes er a burly hippy and hoping change our old mama i do not smile tat som not the smiling black man yet that is cliff means he is a self escribe business man who means business i to imagine that his business car reads on one line cliff means and under that business in fact when we asked cliff to do the interview impishly said i do not know you i do not know your audience no when my producer robin and i met with clinic amnesia i knew he was still reluctant but i was not sure war to change his mind i had to ask why are you doing this interview then could easy really want me to do this is the bottom line now had i found i anything too horrific about either one of you then it probe still would have been now but i could not find anything terrible i take one thing at leaned in your favor i did read something written by you si for do as much homework as i kid cause my answer did would you know and your writing had made enough white people angry that sat o say maybe he is actually trying to do something it is clear that cliff is not exactly a why cannot we just get a long type o my and he has very clear thoughts about what should be taught the kids how old it was red easy when he first i explaining race to her i would imagine four or five years old she was an early talker we spent a ton of time together as i asked her to she wanted and her a speech for the mind at the king celebration tat her school and we to rote a speech that people were very enamored with and i explained to her that man the king was not keeled five a dream speech but was yo start toboggan poor whites and poor blacks together than he had togo but my chosnot talked you will be going to school and you you will be getting told that there justice for all and then when you find that there is not then you will be confused and i soft want my children confused almost the knowledgeable in it what age did you get into the the history of black people's country can have to cover things cresol writes movement him crow and slavery things that at five i thought about slavery and i taught it as what it is that a rope went to war with west africa for centuries kid just a love native americanswhen is it say far back who do la pro if i bat what he did and were slaughtered and terrorized and tortured and murdered and rated i probably left out rate at that age for her captured kidnapped and brought over african to america and they were here terrorized and murdered and we go from that stage all way to being here enslaved he taught her that it five cliff is clearly it afraid to throw his kids into the deep end of the races in pool and let them learn to swim this is pretty much the opposite what i had done far how deep did there races in pull gid she learned things a white officers following the black migration too northern californium to work in shining yard and son account form ship yards had we better bring some race white cops here to keep these people aline she learned that there were been black cook's grinding at a glass in the kitchen to make sure that white races brutal slave masters and testing would believe hin be open an and he rebel gone was your question do you want the church thing bout at it it fine that is condesian i do not know what the church thing is but i could tell it was one of those family stories could easy let my producer robin and i n on it after my dad told me about races that i distinctly remember li being angry with white people how dare you and slave my people i and we were at church one day and it was not actually at church it was a chum h function you was in the church it was a church function hailed after i guess i went up on to the pulpit and asked for the mike and i told the entire congregation that black people and white people should not be together an and that wit my synthesis a races an america and slavery that i ad come up with throughout the week after my dad told me about races saying you became a fiver out segregation as i did i did in my house we cannot have a five yoarold segregation's i mean non you be wrong it be fun forbid in a kid say the darkest things kind of way i ran aversion in what academia said in church by my while less as a hypothetical what would you do if mammy told you white people in bite people cannot be together it would be an media investigation list would ask what makes you say that why do you think they cannot be together and yes wo came white people did her your people but also mommy and daycare together and that is good is not it it would be a conversation with me it would be a conversation with mammy every day all the time i ask cliff how he felt about academia speech at church o li well she learned what she learned as probably healthy reaction for having knows she learned this wee i think that was a little suppressed was there was there a white person her that you fell o if she thinks that about all like people that she is got to hate this one white person is sexual a nice person i no absolutely not ism ism not concerned about the white man in america i think he is doing very well and i had no concern or do i had now have any concern for any one feelings or whenever else being heard you five grow maybe start a conversation when the think of think about some the things that thing enjoin that no one else in join this country know i really cliff cliff is not an easy person u then why should he be ease cliff is the type of person who keeps the rest of us a little more honest i want more cliff in my life academia told me that even with her candid unfiltered upbringing she could tell early on the difference between white oppression and the white people in her life but to be able to do that she had to learn about it and get angry i get that when i first began to really understand the violence of racism i was angry it makes sense to be angry the angry helps you pushed back against the injustice anger's not the got it is the fuel even sometimes i feel i have too much anger there are black people in america die from races that treatment of a fancy coffee shop is the softest and easiest part of races there were times during this whole thing i felt i chon just drop it cliff and i talked about that to being told the leave a caftan college avenue that is not a big deal on a on a based level but i knew that you can just keep letting your boudryg an pushed o no let anything go i do not let anything go do not shake my hand your black or something you shake my hand a white man you shake my hand shut you do not relate to me do not let anything go i the message of the day that that is what i feel but i never put in those words those the words i was looking for do not let think racism is real and happening right now every day that means that every day i have an opportunity to teach my daughters about races this is to you sammyance i promise you for now on ism not going to let it go the stakes are too high de e you canal bow yes the host at united shade of america am liana coming up i a grown us who are not rumbling at all they have a plan and it includes costumes volcanoes and a talking stick that is in a minute from chico public radio when our program continues it is this america life ism ancona joffywalt sitting in for era glass to day show the birds and the bees we are listening in as grown ups try to convey their most important deeply how beliefs to small humans who cannot yet zip up their own jackets we started at the beginning where d you babies come from in this last part of the show where n i talk about the end act three about that farm up state jonathan gold seen has this last stray and a quick warning us at of the beginning of the show these are stories about grown ups talking with children about difficult subject matter if you have kids with you keep that in mind look at here is jonathan there is a house in sal city were kids come to have death explain to them not just that people die but how they die it is called the sharing place and the first person they meet there is woman falling this is how she explains a heart attack ye are a heart stopped to working and could not live your blood through your body this a quiverfull of midsized explanations for all the ways that life can end kidney failure your kidneys are washing machines for your blood and when your blood they stop working in your bloods shirty than et poisons your body you die overdoses overdoses is when you have a sickness in your brain call the diction and a diction makes you take medicine that is not good foreskin you take away too much of it but not all medicines bad either give you do with that murder it is when somebody chooses to make your body stop working it is a choice we also do choice an not choice a murder is a choice cancer is not a choice we so do contagious or not contagious the you're not when to get my depression and you are not get a gad my cancer the sharing place is a grief support center for kids who have lost a family member it is one of hundreds of centers it around the country kids sit in support groups led by grown ups but the point is to allow children to talk to other children about their grief there encourage to speak in concrete language about death because the thinking goes that is how to process death's finality people do not pass away you do not lose them they die we invest much effort trying to shield kids from the scary things in life we place advisories before chevy shows that warn against tan appropriate language and subject matter and what could be less appropriate than death for all we led on bunnies lay legs your mother means well and life pretty much goes on for ever to do otherwise feels your breaking a basic pack that grown ups have with one another o we e who if your have i my dad an i dog to cad and my do that is all the kids here a more comfortable talking about death than most adult are valley who lost the sister and brother to mite cordial disease she and her other brother have the disease too but not as bad they have had to deal with something that most other people have not had to let alone other kids it is hard to talk about with the kids at school sometimes they dontwen oil we talking about cause the as e o all these words a nobody's heard no o the other cans heard about li a her logical resin like o what does to mean o feeding to what does that m tit is i a really hid to explain it is not hard explain with its hartalike all them and they still do not not understand where it goes or what it does to help you but this is a place where kids do understand there are more than a dozen separate groups at the sharing place broken down by age the groups meet twice a month for about an hour and a half in a refurbished house made to feel homy and safe it is visiting her grandmas there are rooms for kids meet and talk and rooms were their parents do the same but most of the rooms are dedicated to play there is a costume room er kids can dress up police ballerinas cowboys inspire of me you to do what every i ta your o do and beside it is a room called the soft room which is full of props and toys including an old telephone one little girl who watched her mother of a heart attack spends an entire playsession pretending to call for help high nine one one she would say my grandma's dying hurry come quick then she would hang up and dial again hid nine one one my dad's dying hurry come quick one of the most popular rooms as a padded room called the volcano room not ye it is full of cushions and large rubber yeogoballs it is even got an at old size doming and wrestle and punch the kids can scream yell pound the walls and throw things round they love her o o a o it is a release eve is nine years old and her father died about two years ago she knows that feeling of keeping it all bottled up in she she says she can go days at school that it kind of feel them really overwhelming and it is you you would do not know what to do and on we ins idea it is hurting somehow an we o feeling like y hurt somehow where do would you say it hurts usually with mud her in trot and kind of you my stomach it is em something that needs to come out but just i really need learn how to do that i think there are people who in this world who can grow up and do not really know how to talk frankly about lots of things nancy riser is one of the founders of the sharing place and this is what she says when children asked her how people die well close your eyes and listen and there is not the next breath does it hurt i do not think i do not think their face does not look at her nanny's a therapist who works with young children for a long time the very concept that children do in fact grieve was hotly disputed frond said that it was difficult for children to even conceive of such loss and does a culture nancy says that is pretty much the idea that we operate under oh look she is playing she is o key she did not really understand what happened well she is playing but the half an hour later she is in the householding her teddy barn second her them and crying we need to let people know that children grief and hop them when they grieve it is not stuck in sided and comes out when they tried to have a relationship later when they start to get intimate the they cannot bear it and they go off and they do not know why nancy says children just grieve differently than adults especially little children they grieving fits and starts they cannot focus on it for very long and grief is more physical for them the lacked out their anger maybe kick a door which is the reason for the volcano room at the sharing place they might also regress suddenly using baby talk or sucking their thumbs and if their potty trained they might become untrained they are also magical thinkers i heard stories of kids who were afraid to go to sleep because grandma went to sleep and did not wake up one little boy wandered away from his mam at the emergency room saying ism looking for dad we left him here last time another boy said he just wanted to die for a few days we can go to heaven and teach his little sister had a right a critical children also retrieve that is with every new stage of development they experience their grief anew and with every mile stone when the braces come off when they get their drivers license when they graduate they will inevitably think i wish my mam was here and given all of this the thought behind the sharing place another enters it is that kids can help one another in a way that adults perhaps cannot help them that is why they are brought together in these groups in short kid speak the same language turn on olein before their session at the sharing place i sit down with gave who sex and his brother den who is ate there both dressed and matching long sleeve poofs shirts pavan sits on his mother nap hole's lap den sits beside them ut you you want to introintroduce yours i i in ain i my dead i twice as i so say id his little brother pavan points his finger to his head and pulls the pretend trigger he snaps his head back ye that is a open we the shot i had an then we did not know he was did i mam we did not an en then a got dad no you did not this mummy found him and yes already he was aridly dead de you turn over i did not cut him o ka she knew he was a bake did because she saw blood an things i on is him yet e ad he was terrific die nice generous you would always help any one he is a terrific die what would what did you learn here that helped you the most to understand how he died sometimes that task telling the kids that their parent committed suicide false the jill mac falling because the our living parents air guardian might be inside their own grief that they cannot bring themselves to do it jill explain suicide as simply as she does other kinds of death there is ha sickness in your brain called depression she says and it can make you decide to make your own body stop working she says it is required that the kids know how their brother or sister or mother died before starting the group why had one can we say he died i because he was sick when family that that he died in a car accident one family said that he accidentally shot himself he did not mean to it was jill who help their mam break the news to maiden and gave that their dead shot himself she says that conversation was especially hard the boys immediately sad you do not you do not know my at why would you say that you do not know less we the i know i do not know you and but your mom's here to dacha she needs she needed my help in telling this cause is the really hard and scaverything that happened and and your don't told me that that is what happened and den just was your crazy lady there is no way that work in a talk about this this is not what happened it is horrible and was awful and i rid that whole night i just it was just awful i just felt horrible and my husband as you cannot do that you have to go to the director and tell her that you cannot do this again suicide is always one of the highest if not the highest cause of death for sharing place families in any given time this actually e special group devoted specifically to suicide and a lot of the stories you hear in that group are horrible that you cannot help it wonder why tell the kids what happened at all why not to say they died and live at that according to file and her colleagues we need to tell children they will not find out later in life and wonder what else did they lie in about they also do not want to have to cloak it in a way that suggests it is unspeakable and shameful they get enough of that idea at school this is eve again while father also shot himself wit some people at school they say this makes me feel really said to they say the em why am somebody kills themselves that means they go to the wrong place i do not believe that but it just makes me feel ray said when they say that instead of going to a happy place they'd go to sat even even if you even if you do not believe n it is nonsense it is look an a hurts suctlmen would say that yet it does cause like it is somebody judging om the judging my papa which s not a bad thing a lot people do that but just kanji feels a little weird on the inside it makes me see ism gain to scream him he is something that wat what of the things that you wish that people would say probably it is cay madam that has happened in them e we can help you with them feeling better and understanding you that is call something i want somebody to say once a child knows how their loved one died there encouraged to say it out loud there is a kind of sorcery to it naming the dragon you can defeat it i sat in on the suicide roup which is different in the other groups an that kids tend to come to meetings for a longer period of time hardly because they did not get to say good be the kid sit in a circle at the beginning of the meeting and hand around a talking stick one by one they say their name who died and how they died y a is he lie and the person e died be my dead and he he did bi shooting hin himself with the gan and hem and he wanted el my name is sense my a die he ti by a suicide and ire a not seeing him cause i hadn't seen him for a couple of months before his death there is also a different question they respond to each time they meet what you miss most about the person is there anything you do not mess to night's question is what you regret my shame is e en an the person who died is my have he hard by shooting is from the head and know for have any rear h cannot re member it can take a long time for them to get to this point where they can say the word suicide the sharing place never corrects any of the kids or forces them to say anything they do not want to but they notice when a child is finally able to say it the night i was there den the nine year old i talk to who had a hard time saying the words suicide was finally able to say it in grave been the volunteer sat around and talked about it afterwards it was hard for him i could tell he was not about to say it but he said it and i was proud of him but it took him probably at least a minute to actually get those words out is momawhos o kiss so henasn' coaching no no you on the other hand den's brother gave the six year old talks about his dad she wayside incessantly he also draws guns during playtime and even sculpt them at of planet this is hole mac garland again he tells everybody at school my earshot his brains and it brakes everybody out and then he gets in trouble at school which then he was like us i cannot ever talk about my at but this is how canna partners talk and press has thinks it is just easy for them to talk about but it is scares other people visit o kid for kids other kids in the class to hear their will ya i but i mean i but is i right answer to that i do not know i do not know either if i were a parent ism not sure it'd want my kid hearing that kind of thing at school and while jill does not have an answer she does think kids being allowed to express themselves is much healthier than sending them a message that it is wrong to say this kind of stuff out loud and that is got to be a step in the right direction i have very very very fond memories of this place i actually tried to come through the side door cause ha was the door that i always came in through that i was i can use the adult entrance finally hearth hammed has not been to the sharing place for a full six years she is twenty one now but when she was eleven her older brother hanged themselves even though he was supposed to be baby sitting her her parents had told her to keep an eye out on him because of his past suicide attempt obviously what happened was in her fault but she blamed herself which is something i heard other kids here talk about too it is easy for an adult to say do not be silly it is not your fault but it is a whole other thing to talk with the kid at the sharing place who says i know exactly what you talking about it was it was kind of i being the older kids who he do not loved ones had been gone fir a few years how they were able to go to school normally and an just live there normal life cause i just did not want to go to school i did not want to be with kids who just id don it was just it was too hart i asked para if there was a turning point a moment when she began to feel maybe she was doing a little better she said yes she was in the court yard with a bunch of other kids we were just out there painting rocks or something for a funrazer and and we were just talking just talking normal and i really that i had not how to conversation that and about a year just where where i felt under present free and just laughing and not feeling guilty about laughing and just happy n that was yet i was really the first time in and in a good nine months after my brother had passed that i ill oke it is the kids themselves who decide when the ready to stop coming to the sharing place but on average they stay about to ears when they are ready to leave they have to announce their intention two times and grew before their final good bye any view that would to say something than which ism sure several of you will the good bye is ceremonial and on the last night i was there at the end of the meeting they said good bye to a kidnap lobby he sat in the circle with the other kids and volunteers and anybody who wanted to could pick up the talking stick and say a few words his friend jessico was the last kid to do am it'll that flay miss you because you one of my best friends in this group and all me seeing you an or major fight that we had in the volcano room it was not my fault naif you did no am it will just really fun and ism gin a miss seeing you in missinging out with you at bobby's last meeting there was a kid who just shown up it was his first meeting ye had long bangs hanging over his eyes and except for his name did not say anything the whole time whenever new person joins the veteran kids have a chance to gage their own progress to remember what they were when they first showed up and think about how bad it used to be and how now it is not as bad and ultimately lobby they will make way for someone on the long waiting list a list on which new names are added all the time they will say i think it is time to go and then they'll say it again tojohnathan goldstean is a prettier at gimlet

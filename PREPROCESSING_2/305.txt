exactly when you are hungry you never find a bed exactly when o when to go to sleep and you probe notion to find out what it is that you got on the road to find out in the first place and of that all that going into it and you still we all still buying to the crochet about road trips the what a road trip stands for is hopehope that somewhere anywhere is better than here that somewhere on the road

and no expectations fit a future and hasten the journey we bring you now this hour of radio to day d i you be easy chico and public rater international it is his america wife a mi were glass tit is program road trip i one bushman's holiday is washer peeve loved riding the bus from city to city until one last seven day trip the took him off the whole deal to mel we to how do you've say that mere we mel we can a road trip in rope save a marriage answers with one case study i three on the road natucsito at the age of ninety too committed an gorge burned was still travelling all the time maria rocking brief we travelled with him what it is when being on the road has been your job for decades it for ill pall for jess shit trick achieves what every one once when they hit the road she actually fines adventure and it is not pretty stimulus i on bushman's holiday shall regular listeners to a programed remember dishwasher peed he travels from state to state washing dishes and publishing wizened dishwasher usually only stays in one place for a few weigh and then he takes the greyhen bus to the next town little he is ben loving in portend but he was only too happy to get back on the bus i right in greyhound over the last day years i fear i have redden at least a hundred thousand miles on gray hound and total about four solid months of my life have been spent crooked up in their busses i would consider at my home away from home if only i had home what i most about greyhound is how long it takes to get anywhere on the best are long passengers left complain about the five excruciating me long hours that takes to fly from coast coast but on the buss that same distance takes three full days to cover which is what i think is about the perfect amount of time for such a trip i unlike air plane flights no movies are shown on greyhound no had sets handed out no free magazines available no waitresses force bags of pints on you every five minutes on the buss passengers are largely left alone with their thugs i have the theory about people who ride greyhound about how as we sit on the bust for hours and days waiting to reach our destination we travel in what i call a transitional state thinking about where were coming from and where were going to i know i do and for my talking to other people on the ass i know many others do as well for example this one route have ride lot go south through crescent city californium home with the police an bay maximum security prison i wrote next to the sky who would been locked away for fourteen years and have just gotten out i cross the aisle from me was a denature with the bus cut on hits way to boot camp we talked for a while but mostly we just sat and thought about the different places we were headed n then ten for a long time ice been wanting to tapercord to stories have heard on the buss the document this phenomenon that have been trying to figure out it's pretty excited when this america life offered to send me on a greyhound trip with the fancy taper quarter in a seven day a mayor pass for a week i could want to any greyhound route i chose and last my theory about the buss i packed up a look of pen better n jelly sandwiches and bunch of bananas and stepped on a greyhound i spent the first ten hours trolling down the coast of organ i eager to talk with the other passengers i stayed awake all night even though everyone else was sleeping it was not until we stopped for breakfast and crescent city as finally able to strike up a conversation stove was about fifty years old sported a bushy beard and wore an olive green army jacket a large wooden croci fixtangle from his neck he said he was an itinerant preacher and that greyhound was his chapel we i just preach in my own time not inspicitic times an busily try ovoid audiences when i do speak is that way i i reduce the possibilities of reaction or mockery y you avoid you avoid audiences than who are you talking to well see i believe in transmission of voice or spirit can transmit three hundred sixty degrees into the world i times three hundred six d degrees and and greyhounds a conducive for for year a travelling minister well in the fact that i do not have my own privacy i in a private vehicle y i there becomes a either intermashing or clashing of spirits on a crowded type greyhound i some times the things are more harmonious another times e the people pick and poke an a the solicit or reaction norm you preaching on the ass would con with you just talking to the person sitting next you most my preaching a is done by my sold just speaking into the air o though without another he would been be in there a you might be one the first him to be unless i s ever really listen to me or acknowledge that in in my presence stoves minister was not limited to the teachings of price but also included healthy to of praise for natural medicine cannabis and apian i thought i was agreeing with him when i said that it did a meticulous that farmasuitable companies si we old nature back to us but stove took a fence and pulled out a ball of ambasall which he described a sixty per sent grand out call playpens cane which sis a chemical a as a chemical similar to the the naturally cursing coming and a the person wit let it for well it just a little topical anis thetic which is a local number and as they a they talk about two day and a things of that nature just something certainly not a central nervous sister a relations the old beam copy which i consider more a valuable plant is is pain relief catalog just a little new just a little net now sos that numbing your hole mouth now well it take si i stock ten fifteen seconds it is not textually there is an immediate back yes it is it is actually believed her not nothing and a very less stove continued talking but it became increasingly difficult to understand what he was saying as his speech slurred by the end of our fifteen minute talk he told me as the longest conversation he had in the last three and a half years then stove got on the north bound bus bound for portend and i continued on to san francisco a sedans is to i wrote ten hours to loss angels sitting next to an e evener old kit that did not one o talk to me at the holly would gustation i saw a bus head o for sarantisco and figured what the he maybe i to get lucky on nabs si spent the next ten hours retracing my route back north sitting beside a guy who slept the wholeway i had to wonder where were all the talkers all those chatty passengers that usually the next to me and chare the stories about where the coming from ere going to in rent i switch to a strut have always been curious about the one that headed south through old mining towns down to losfagus my attempts to find out who wrote that particular by let nowhere i approach the other half dozen passengers one by one but no one would talk to me on the bust from lot fags to flag staffarizona i asked the woman sitting next to me if i could report our conversation for the radio she acted is nuts you want to talk to me about greyhound for the radio what weedy a station is that well explained it is just show that is on different stations in different cities what station is it on in lass angels then she asked lot angels ism not sure you want to record me for the radio and you en even n what station it is ye are right she scoff give me a break she alerted the other passengers around us that was trying to pulse up a over on her soon is verbally assaulted from all sides the but of everyone is jokes i put the taperquarter away and stared to the window my enthusiasm for this trip was rapidly dwindling at a estop i slinked away from the pack of passengers who were smoking their cigarettes and ridiculing me stood off by myself maybe it'd been wrong maybe there was not anything significant on the minds of greyhound passengers after all when the smoke break ended i reluctantly got pack on the bus on any bus there is roughly some sort of outcast the drunk my who smelts ruin were the woman babbling to herself then it downed on me wit these dorky head phones on my head the footling microphone in hand trying to get people to let me interview them about where they are going it was me i was the weirdo this bus lie is since nubbin o demeans e e n to in for hours e s as in we so m muse meet somewhere e we her e busy so ma enonderai guess i did not have much more to say than anybody else on the buss all these years i most et to being some shout of party greyhound passenger i trivia salts things that many people complain about but seemingly never ending rides the toying passengers the closer phobia i mean i sat next to a guy vomiting on himself in his big deal i sat across the lie from per pile having noisy sex in it in pother me but now on this trip greyhound was starting to get to me and bust of phoenixes i thought my self wedge between the window in a guy you took a way too much on my seat i tried to sleep for the first time in days but found that it could not my whole body was sore i had shooting pains in the back o my thighs my backache i had a headache the babe in front of me cried the whole way the toddler behind me got smacked round fer not sitting still after having been pumped up on candy is becoming increasingly closer phobic is beginning to lose it normally i survive long bust rides by concentrating on my destination but now i did not have a destination i was not really going anywhere hog could i expect to find any one in the transitional state when i was never in transition myself maybe this was the problem with the whole mission i had sealed being a regular greyhound passenger i was an outsider i stood in line for the bust to lust crisis new lexica trying to come down i thought i was in patrol i watched ta mother drag her kicking and crying toddler across the gustation by the kit is hair i snapped i could not take it i could not handle being constantly surrounded by many people any more i sure was in feeling at home i usually do i stay that a line for the last crusts puss i had to get home sadly portend was still a thirty six hour ride away i the a is on the californium boarder a new pasture sat down a cost the isle from me not needing any more abuse from strangers i resisted my initial temptation a talk with her i couple miles down the road i watched her pull colored photo from her purse stare at it for a half minute and then tuck it back in her purse a minute later she had the photo out again and this time i snuck a peak in so that of the photo fer sitting in the lap of a guy wearing prison care since she had border to bus in a prisontown i realize she had probyjus visit a jailed boy fend her husband now she had to sit on the bust for who knows how many hours and dwell upon the person she had just left at last i thought the one person had been looking for on this whole trip someone in transition some one who could help me prove my theory about the buss her name was list and she was just as suspicious with me as any other pasture had been but she did consent to let our conversation be reported arson at theconversation did not get very far she gave only one or two word replies to most of my questions ye eventually she end up asking me the majority of the questions after a couple of awkward minutes i put the microphone an tapequarter away she stared out her photograph some more while i watched the desert or fading sunlight half hour later after the buss had darken a people dozed off we said tape me on the arm and told me she had inherited powers from her grandmother powers with which she could grant me any wish i desired for this service she would only charged me five dollars it my shop she said usually i charged ten a twenty dollars for a wish she said it just that ten a twenty dollars well five dollars for a wish seems a bargain i started counting out the hundreds of nickels i had one in the lost papa's slot missing but she sad it only work with a five dollar bill i did not have any fives but did have a ten a tend will work she said i followed her instructions folding the bill into a little ball and handed it to her she squeeze in her fist and said now make a wish but she cannot tell any one what it is i made a wish then she told me to tell her my second and third wishes that these wishes were important too but not as important as the superimportant first wish well in my state i only had one wish i needed fulfilling i just me to stuff up for the merely important second and third wishes this thing for better health and a new romance in the dark buss she whispered a cross the isle assuring me that was now in better health and that i could expect a new love in my life then she asked me to tell her my superimportant wish my number one wish but she told me not to tell me one i said you can tell me she said but do not tell any one else i told her i wished i was in writing the bust any more oh she said we tired of writing the buss i can see it in your face that sher very tired you have a kind face she whispered about my face and described how tired i looked for five minutes then toning three times that while i might be laughing on the outside i was really crying on ha inside but i was not laughing not even on the outside when she was done i watched her slip my ten in her pocket meanwhile i was still in the esse this outer people we putting out a new issue of his been dishwasher or in a few week scrape a pan if you sent him a dollar you can get it at p o box eat to one

cheerleaders as woe do get wen your job is one longer a trip and you are thy ninety two your old gorge burns we have an i witness account that is a minute public rainy international when our programmed continues its is medical life from your glass he took in a program of course we choose a theme ifitvariety of rioters and performance to tackle that time to day's program as our nation heads out on the road for the memorial day we can roketrip the pleasures and disappointments of life on the road we have arrived tact three of our program i three on the road in a tuxedo there two ways you feel when you interview i celebrity there are those that make you feel a person then terrace the kind who make you fell a blip there is nothing wrong with a blip interview in fact it is liberating you can say whatever you want to them they will not remember you ten years ago reporter maria rockling was sent to to a magazine's story about gorge burns for ninety two you road he was spending a lot of time on the road twenty five shows a year at conventions another one night gigs post we longstins an vagus in satanic city this is the story of a road trip his business not pleasure gorge is on to role and it is entirety at that time included irking fine his then seventy seven year old manager and forty jacobus his pianoplayer for at that time twenty three years from the started was queer darkie there were kind men there were polite men they called e kid the way they called everybody kid there hunter or lot of some of or older jewfish relatives but this was a blip story nine o'clock fridge night mascot dah university in we sit around in the common living room that connects gorge and ring's bed rooms gorge an irking always get connected bedrooms with a living room and between if they can in the late afternoon when it is quiet this is where gorge and irking to sit they watch television they read the trades right now forty's here the sun is set and its early evening in general they have three main topics of conversation the act we sequel and where they want to eat here is some typical dialogue forty will say where shall we eat and irking will say the broiler room that is the hotel stake house and then gorge will say john will know johns the handler who picked us up at the airport and drove his to the hotel and then irking will say i think we should do the broiler room and then gorge will say john will know ask john and then irking will say ism making a reservation at the broiler room but not move towards the telephone and on and on and on it is dialogue that avid mammoth would write if avid mammoth road seeings where absolutely nothing was it stay we had done to the broiler room all through dinner there is this constant traffic of founds including at one point for cheerleaders there wearing gorge's skirts and tight sweaters and their nervous energy fills the room gone gorge go they scream over and over again while they shake and wiggle and do air splits and rattled there crape paper pompoms then floorshow over they run out in a single file as if everything they do is part of a routine then incomes the shaft to ask for gorge's autograph but gorge burns likes these intrusions he is nourish by them when it is finally quiet says to me are not people nice because ism a reporter ism a blip but the public gets his full attention he establishes like contact with each approaching fan and he smiles at them and he ask how they're doing and when he leaves the broiler room he will choose the most complicated root slowly threading his way through the tables of the main dining room touching people on the shoulder lightly and saying things do not pay the check while we are on the road i probably see him do his act five times each time it sounds told spontaneous he is making it up right there just riffing for the crowd even though giver take a gagger to it is the exact same act his been doing for fifteen years re e a a e y were what is amazing about all this is that on the surface the act does not seem to very from city to city but to gorge it is an eternal work in progress every night he makes microscopic changes maybe he will decide to sink young at heart before old bones when he does as he gets all works out about it thinks about it all day long but this is how he is been able to be on the road for long this is how he keeps the acts feeling fresh for himself sometimes thill change upon lone he has a gages act about people having to retire when their seventy he says when i was seventy i have peoples but one day gorge tries out a new line on me he says when i was seventy i had cupid's regime i think that some sort of dirty but ism not to be the one to tell him in fact i have tape of this of myself lying to the nicest man on earth oh you be o you is tat g at again a i yeas is o e o a i we is a no not a to o i a e under i you o o yo a you i e i e lie you red e its ya yo o yo yo i you be having i you o o a ye re yo o my o o we r o yet re trip gorge and urging can go on this for hours they go back and forth h and back in forest and that night gorge tries out the cupid's legs i a line it does not get laughs on the way home in the car were silent gorge in a driver in the front me in the back squeeze to hip to elbow between irking and morning suddenly gorge's rumbling voice cuts through the darkness it'll never do that again he says it is quiet for a while more party he says to morrow night lets and then the conversation starts all over again can normally when i think of going on the road i think of waking up at any hour of not having to be anywhere at a certain time you're on a big adventure the rules no longer apply there is no account ability but that is a savigians road trip i am on a very different kind of road trip the road trip ism on is not about adventure and unpredictability the road trip ism on is about making sure the everything is message this is the secret to gorge burns is longevity of how he is been able to stay on the road for long without going crazy he wakes up at a certain time he goes to sleep at a certain time when he goes on the road he likes his driver to take him to the airport in the late morning when he agrees to a booking its stipulated his contract that he will be provided with a back was still to sit me a lightly rehear storicastri and straight to flick his ashes in and a free shows speedball made up of a couple of martinis chase by a cup of black coffee he will only smokeill productive in the afternoon he likes to take at to our nap he hates fresh root in vegetables by the end of our time to gather i could order for him an a restaurant of necessary he likes trim cocktails he l asks most chicken he likes his marines but does not care what brand of liquor they are made with he just wants him to come one after the other he is ninety too and no one can tell him what is got or bath for him to put in his own mouth same goes for what comes out of it as the gin for mouth kicked his conversation tends to get naughty one night he resides to me a particularly memorable limbic that involves a mouse the phrase hickey dickey doll and a reference to his own private parts morning irking laugh but i do not know what to do if i laugh too hard ism scare the'reging to think ism some sort of let girl and if i do not then ism a pill no fun at all i feel as if ism in another country with different customs and morris and i simply try every possible reaction one after the other laughing groaning shaking my head waiting for something that works the pace is very slow i wake up in the morning drink coffee wait for ring's call mostly i have free time i lay on a variety of queenside's beds and a variety of shag carpet hotel rooms and stare up at the saying one day irking calls to invite me to talk to gorge as he's breakfast whats a the get ho o o or for i gorge is wearing a thick age terry cloth bathrobe age pajamas and slippers his stiff gray to pay is somewhere in the other room it is startling to see the man that lives underneath the hair the stacked he'll shoes the chis tuxedo he looks vulnerable bird i have this realization this will be a man who i will get to know in the moments between words even on a road trip design to avoids so prices i find myself surprised by these main my view them comes to change as we spend more time together eleven a m ring evade valley's hotel ism trying to keep my focus but ism tire tired o the empty hours tired o waiting for irking to call whenever i call my boy friend his answering machine picks up finally i take the elevator to the hotel casino i play the south machines mindlessly pulling down the handle somehow irking linesmen ism playing the quarter slots ism risking a grand total of ten dollars but he is positive that i will return home having handed over the title to my car he goes away then comes back and tells me it is time to quit he goes away then comes back fifteen minutes later and tells me again ism annoyed it is nagging and touched to save me from financial ruin he asks me to take a walk with him irking takes my hand and loops so passed his bent elbow arm in arm we stroll past places with names the mate's hotel and the liberty bells saloon the way irking is almost bouncing down the street lets me know he is in going that we come off a mismatched couple that i am his babe and he is my silver haired energetic sugar getting most the time irking does the talking he tells me but his past it is a history of twentieth century show business big jobs at

hunter bison gets indited on gun charges and faces a debate in prison and he media question the the re publicans can now leave jo bison alone join unleashes magus comics and make in kelly grills donate trump i bencher o this is the menshgaro shot he benshcuresh responser by express a vision privacy is a right not a privilege defend tourists at express veins to come slash man in what has to be one o the most obvious ploys of all time the do ja has now indicted hunter bison on federal gun charges why do i say this is apply while there a bunch of reasons why i say this is ploy he is not going to jail for a significant period of time this prosecution is not over the actual charges that anyone carries about namely the tax charges and the foreign agent's registration a charge that i not yet been brought the clock is ticking on those this is a distraction it was always a distraction the gun charge was basically away for them to smuggle in ran at and the rest of all these in investigations in the gun charge that does not mean he does not deserve the gun charge he clearly deserves the gun charge his notches that he lied on gun form its that he lied on a gun form and then attained the gun a should got the gun then he had the gun and the threw in the garbage can as can be awkward for the widen administration because now hunterbidon and his lawyers are going to argue that violates the second amendment for him to be prosecuted under these terms meanwhile his dates out there saying that no as you have a gunner sure covelarvos serin aggro s that can awkward for join but is this a key issue interns of hunter and jo of course not we coronary have an impeachment inquiry going on that is entirely predicated upon the corrupt relationship between hunter bison and jobidon and jobidon's response to this and his deejays response to this presumably is we will prosecute hunter bison on some ancillary charge tell get off with a relative slap on the rest and then you got you allies go bat your business there is nothing else to see his that is that is the ploy according to noisy news federal procures have indicted hunter biding the sun of president widen on gun charges quirtdocuments echo bison was indited thirsty in federal court in delftware on three counts tie to possession of a unwell using an narcotics two counts accuse widen of having completed a form indicating he was not using e legal drugs when he bought a colt cover revolver on october to thousinatin the third count alleges he possess a firearm while using an arctic indictment has the began certified on a federally landed in form quote he was not in unlawful user of and addicted to any stimulant arctic rug and any other controlled substance when in facts as he knew that statement was false and fictitious two of the countsecarry maximum prison sentences of ten years a third has maximum sentence of five years each count also carries maximum fine of two hundred an fifty thousand dollars given the fact that hunter bison has not spent the day in jail yet and his never played guilty to a crime far as ism aware this means he is probably again not going to go to jail for any significant period of time that cases being overseen by special council avid nice but is he any mac earthy points out this again is canola scam prosecution a why well there few reasons one this particular case is happening in delawares any my earth he points out well as your recall the entire scandal revolving around avid wives is that he was not granted act ass to prosecutes hunter bison in any jurisdiction outside of dear he always had the jurisdiction to prosecute hunter bison inside of delftware what took him long the answer is who is trying to cut a sweetheart real with hunter bison the a jobidon and this also does not actually robust any of the charges that avid wises was denied the ability to prosecute hunter bison outside of delayer becks again his crony prosecuting him inside of delftware as h anime earthy wrights therefore no bison appoint you o us a turkeys to blame for wise's failure for five years to file the indictment those finally returned on thursday the stature limitations was on the precipice of expiring it was wises and whites alone who delayed bringing one the most straight ford fellow gun cases you will ever seed wives was not being blocked he was stalling and also is anime earthy points out given the fact that t biding justice department tried to dissuppure the case against hunter being just a couple of months ago with that diversion plan his defended hunter bidet's offencecan be really really easy they are just going to point to the prosecutors in say guys they did not take it seriously they we willing to sign the deal with us five seconds ago it is only because that deal fellow part in public view that they ran away from it but the obviously do not consider us a particularly serious crime as he anime earthy says it is rich for the same justice departments put out o statement in connection with to days indictment stressing that hunter is facing up to twenty five years imprisonment if bin is convicted on any or any or all of the three felonies his defencelayers are gingko hae a really strong argument those us been to recount of the prosecutors set and did in the first place and then his anime earthy points out quite correctly the only case whites is brought is the one that hunts or bison is involved in but job is not he did not bring the tax case yet now remember the clock is ticking there is a six year statute of limitation on possible tax crimes those charges have not yet been brought the latest possible tax crimes that we know about for hunter bison there were in some of the charging documents in the proposed plead deal arrangement the latest charging documents carried crimes up to two thousand eighteen two thousand nineteen it is currently two thousand and twenty three it assume that the last crimes that they are going to a ledge are in two thousand eighteen that means they have in ti the beginning of next year to charge him on the tax crimes the middle of the campaign election what what what is that mean well means the statute of limitations could easily run while they are trying to distract over cere were the shiny gun gun indipemen object now one cares about this anothewrds should thy indent him of corse the should inside him it was crime should he go to jail i mean under his own fathers interpretation of the law he should certainly go to jail does this make any difference at all to the real underlying issues surrounding hunter bison of course not they are charging him on the ancestry crime to distract from the fact that here it charging him on the key crimes namely violist in the foreign actions registration act which might immediately link up with jobidon and influence peddling or on the tax avoided stuff which again might immediately link up to his father jobidon hunter bidet's lawyer for his part is claiming that really the only reason this is happening is because a partnessin interference which is feared the reason this really happening is because you got tried to create a sweetheart deal and a judge exposed the sweetheart deal and then the go go j was em barrio in read on the sweetheart deal be brand statement from hunter widens attorney baby law that has just combat it says i park quote as expected prosecutors fix charges to day that they deed we not warranted six weeks ago following a five year investigation to this case the evidence in this matter has not changed in the last six weeks but the law has an has mama republicans improper and partisan interference in this process he says k baby law also continued by telling ran burnt quote the law says whether or not the person is possessing the gun while they are addicted there is ambiguity in the statue which we will have to pursue if the case continues at the time you purchase the gun i fronting this evidence that that is what he was suffering when you referred to his book head just come out of rehabilitation there can to present whatever defense is they are going t present but really again what is this about this about the d o j getting this charge off the table said they can then claim that they have done enough here and then they can wash their hands of the entire thing this is the direction in which they're moving pretty obviously and you can see the media are calling for willet to that momentarily first let us talk about the america meat am america met it is the best et why why e you get meat from anywhere use america makes the best meat and not only doesamerica make the best meat we know t company in america that makes the but meat that would be good ranchers you care about what your family eats does good ranchers that's why they spent years building relationships of local farms to source the best one hundred percent america beef chicken pork and now wild caught sea food as well the best of the land and we can now get conveniently delivered directly tour door right now they proffering two years of free ground beef to any one who subscribes that they four

whole person also deal i a person who loves meat i wish that dis meat were cocker go to good rancherstot come to day use ma good ben for over five hundred bucks in saving subscribe to god ranchers america meat delivered o was what is all this really about what all this is really about is providing the impress for the media and for democrats malison has not hunter suffered enough has not his loving father suffered enough why did you leave hunter a love you can hear this is the tenor that the media a are now taken see an ends breonaceelishus is anyone else you an charge this way hunter is actually a victim is not he he is kind of a victim when you think about it no that hundred pythons the tennis ate an a point without ruling in the fifth circa the calls him to question whether this law is been going to stand ill men by the time o this is all set an done and certain for get the spree sort why then even pure it i mean if this was another defending would they be pursuing it i no the question of thinking you were to here o old from hun her biding tam and shorten for people who support him yet wo why why even pursuing it why why ye ism sure they be asking the exact say questions if one of do from children had been charged where who is president of the united states or or maybe maybe he'd actually just be cheering that i should break out the possums an sureleader out that is all the rest reporters we are going after names comer comer of course has been leading the investigation into hunter biding crust business relationships with dad and report is not this enough why cannot you leave the poor drugged diced prostitute using diralick alone you are still expressing the skepticism here i mean the idea that younger you you wanted an indictment from your prospective your that is not enough an in i but fur o money landing we nation of the for ago tregoutracion at activation the lis goes one on a you have never heard me s anything about on charges at again that is the one crime is committed that you cannot ta the jo but correct that is aims comer from kentucky of course this is right antics also by the media they league one wiped the slakelin and that is all they want they loved o the sweetheart deal it was their favorite it is what democrats want as well but here is the reality the i preachment inquiries not going away because it is perfectly movies as i said yesterday the show when you hear people shouting there is no evidence there totally it there's no evidence that job was involved in hunter's business in his business transactions in his business life except for evidence from two of under biding business partners statement by hunter bin himself tabs from hunter batons what is as from hunter biting actual bank accounts moving money into shell companies cat's i for all that there is no evidence what however tot totally clean is the riven now aims comer meanwhile he is pledging that the inthicent peaches inquiry they will get into personal biding bank accounts that themselves hae fix suspicious of cabs and i don't honer are they helping you are they obstructing you at acts on ma like bank be happy o on burden themselves and shat this stop to you the banks a been bury helpful with the shell cups that we are getting to the personal biding bank caw and we suspect that the lawyers board warn the banks get hanging anything over death a but we are getting in the banks and other chance and will see represent i nancy makes how south caroling she is similarly saying that they will siren a hunter while investigating job which is which is right do they explain why they did not siscipen and hunter baton well i believe that will happen but we have got to get the bank records for i may ate the chicken before the a we have to know wonder bin as i can to tell the truth and er under o an we want to make sure that we have all of the financial statements and records in accordance with the transaction as at elegealy happened and into that way we know if he is telling the truth and love got to have that there is got to be some dew diligence we have got to be deliberate we have got be actual we have to tell the truth and meanwhile if you ever wonder he donate from hand happened how he happened the reason is it hominy an that is the reason the down from happen for a wide variety of reasons reason amber one is the the media the left attacked it money who is most milepost politician of our era with extraordinary alacrity and everybody n the republican girls all an wouldn't give you a giant orangemental thinner now you did not the superpolike guy who refuse to say a bad word about anybody don't that guide he was too much for you bit have out this hes that is reason number one but reason number to is because it money is a guy who is spent a lot of his political career providing cover for democrats and the reaction for lot republicans we do not want people admit money at the top of the party and i see it i do i get it i mean first what i think the entire republican party broad it has rejected that sort of direction even the other people where up for the republican presidential nomination for running right now are not admit romneylan there is not much to admit romneylane the republican party any more nor should there be admit money yesterday again his sole job appears to be to to gain strange new respect from the left at this point and again i think he is a good person by do not understand why he thinks that the mark of a good person is to gain respect from the we an ends in the mean b sees yesterday money was asked about the impeachment inquiry into jobidon ans a now now i the you wonder why that why the democratic party has tremendous loyalty among its base and there there is not a lot of breakaways in the democratic party the reason is takes the democratic party's an excellent vehicle for progressives when when i comes down to jo bison and burniystanders are not separated by much other than affect movies policies look a lot burned senders the radical left looks at job and e oka bags old ma's de credit ma's corruptive is doing the things we want to do meanwhile the republican base looks at the republican party and we we ask you to do acts and just will not do it here it here's it money saying that is not hearing a high crime in misdemeanor when it comes to hunter and jobidon i know the house is begin an peace inquiry a i have not heard anyaligation of something the would rise to the love of a high proof is to be i think it be very unusual to actually see a i furl of it b i i do not expect that to happen get that that is an amazing statement given the fact that he voted for i trumps peaches on both accounts right of the on the first one the grain one which is insane give you crimson ton mean allege a crime and he said that that dona from deserve to be in peach for high crimes and is demeanor while by the way defending the business relationships you hunter and job there is it money just a couple of years ago the grave question the constitution tasks senators to answer is whether the president committed an act extreme and eggregus that it rises to the level of a high crime and mister leader yes he did the president asked a foreign government to investigate his political rival the president with held final military fun from that government to present to do the president delayed fun for an america ally at war with russia invaders the president's purpose was personal and political accordingly the or as in this kill to of an appalling of use a pubic trust a by the way in that exact same speech he actually defended hunter and jo ism not getting i means solo you on by the republican party turned to trump it is because of it runny that is part of the issue here what he actually said in the speech is quote with regard to hunter widen taking excessive advantage of its father's name's unsavory but also not a crime give then neither case of the father nor the son was any evidence presented by the presidents council that a crime been committed the president's insistence that they be in estimated by the craning is hard to explain other than is a political pursuit there is no question in my mind the were the names not by in the president never would've done what he did again that the fact that the went round spent his days defending the bisons while attacking trump and is still doing that is kind of an insane referendum on the old school republican party again just one second we'll get to jobidons a tempt to avoid a a rather bad presidential electoral fate by relying on his economic plans good luck would tat first the benchpiri so sponsor by gran canyon university in a portable private christian university with a vibrant

democracy over and over and over again that is on be his campaign his campaign is going to be dona trumps insurrectionist i stand for democracy it is him to work out fairly well for him in the twenty twenty to elections when he ran against the called man o republican insurrection us and all of us and running against stole trump he is hoping that it will carry him to victory again he certainly cannot rely on his economic program because economic program is a full scale disaster area according to the your times president bin challenge his republican opponents on thursday in their area political strength organ he has done a better job of managing the economy than former president donate trumped and accusing his predecessor's congressional allies of under cutting working class america ah you good luck with that again america do not agree with that by every available pole this thing the trumped better job on the economy than widened by leaps and bounds bison is now relying on old stand by talking points the jest do not work a here is jobidon explaining it is republicans will not air what the for the usoideric wok half of what your for is what you are against we should point out if if you say i wish to take this car and drive it over a cliff and i say you should not do that ire enough to offer what ism for hard ism for you not driving the car over the cliff here is jobidon trying to say words from his mouth hole and in failing were aka has the strongest economy in the world of and major a economic to always do is attack but you know notice o for all the time they spend e tact o me in my plan here is what they lever they never talk about what they want no think about the tell you wat the gan who for you not doing the things you are doing that is what we

that your employ is in buzzing against you and you are you call up the police you tarmac against my employing buzzing can you arrest them apes a hey you are tongue us what your against from you decury your for know that is not the way any of this works meanwhile jobidon branding genius he is decided that he is going to out coin a new term since bionomics is not working he went deep into the recesses of his brain that they are not very deep it is its it it is a very very shallow puddle that brain at this point and always actually he was always a she he was always a a mile wide in inchtyp

have decided again that he circular firing squad is the proper way to fight the demo cats which is they are everyone is good at this then that is the amazing thing when t whenever folks tell you that they watch a show house of cards you should just know politics is not house of cards no one knows what they are doing they are all idiots they're munch of morons who run into walls at top speed and then yell about how much it hurts and however one has victimized them and then they turn around and run into other walls at top speed ad they do all this hell spendingyour money this is how politics works typically speaking it is the best system except fur it it is the worst system except for all the others but i it is what we have naturally republicans have decided they are going to run top speed into walls over a possible government shut down no i do not know exactly white of the deliverable here give set before give me a list of deliverable that you are seeking for cevenmic earthy an maybe can deliver them maybe he can but there is one thing that i have noticed and that is that the democrats control the senate in the presidency it isms the thing i noticed seen get some small concessions from them but the notion the'reging to radically remake america government because the power of the purse is with the house yes the power of the persons with the house and guess what happens if you lead to a large scale government shut down you probably lose the house re publicans wildly under performed in last electoral cycle they have a majority slim is are there going into an election cycle that is going to be at best very close for re publicans and this is a time that yore into pick a fight inside you are party the reality is they are republicans should make hay when the sunshine the sun is not quite shining right now you make of it what you can bheninstead therein have circular firing squad time um mandates is attacking cevemc earthy for for no reason that i can what is the principled reason from mandates ere theta what is is deliverable he gives me deliverable ism perfectly happy go along with the liveable chip boy during the last speakership fight give me as list of delivers and ifs very much in favor of lot of those deliverable end that is fine and then he got most of em and then he made a deal my earthman that's good but em s wondering what is the point of this mandates treated out sounds speak of my party's having a total normal one not rattled at all truth it is heaven controls is own fate instead of emotionally cursing let us do this single subject spending bills turn limits vote balance budged vote release granary six tapes to all seeing hunter we must begin to me early pull your self together caveman we few of those are deliverable hundred is going to get sopenan that is going to happen releasing the canary six tapes to all fine he can do that that is fine a ballast but you vote is gin to go down to flaming defeat and a bunch of republicans run avow against it one of teething that you do not do when your speaker of the house is bring up a vote that your own party is not on to vote for that is a typical thing you do not do just do not bring in to a vote mic comes to terms of its same sort of deal and hen it comes to single subject spending bills listen i would love that i would love to run it that way also you not is on to happen none of that is us can pass if the idea is all of this or government shut down the reality is going to be government shut down that is just what its on to be i hate own of a facades i think their garbage i also do not believe the democrats are simply going to cave to republicans because machetes goes on mas and beseiniells about have my earthy he is challenging my party's speakership again hes suggesting that he is going to u to challenge my party's speakership again apparently in a behind clothes does meeting my earthy was define with his caucus and a he said don't move the motion then move that find motion to remove this from his position if you think that you can do it and he happens o be right about that again there a hundred it hundred ninety republicans inside the republican causes were not kin vote for anyone else apparently he said if you think you scare me because you wan to file e motion to vacate move the effing motion and then he said if you end up replacing me my successor will make the same exact arguments i an and then gates reportedly responded by saying just move the effing spending bills but again he can move the spending bills and they could go nowhere what what is the fight even a you that is the part i do not understand what is the big victory here what is the victory you are seeking to achieve here my earthy for his part he saying no one winds in a government shut ton n understand something my earthy won the last government shut down he did he wanted against bison why was bide made a massive tactical blunder he open by saying i will not negotiate over government shut down is that it will not negotiate over spending at all and then my carthyis a cay ism perfectly willing to negotiate all i want is these few things is that one reasonable in fact i pass to bill my a big omnibus bill because you virtually everything you want why will not you negotiate and a wrong footed widen bison has not made that mistake again now bison's cases ism happy to negotiate let us talk about it we have to do whatever we can to ahoy to government shut down if my earthy now takes the stand ism going to shut down the government then all of the benefit of the government shut down a cruise to e democrats that simple calculate there is something that that i object to in sort of my industry a the lot of people in my industry who are who believe it that idealism requires you to charge headlong into hard objects idealism is understanding what we would realism is under standing what you can get an idealist wo is not a realist is a fool if you are not if you are an idealist and what you think is they always go for broke always and for ever and that anything short of that is ideological treason that is in correct it is not true that is not how business gets done its not how politics cats done is not how anything gets done in fact in fact it is a recipe for losing repeatedly because when you go for a hundred and yo will not to get any less than a hundred you are much likelier to get zero than you are to get eight if you than get most of what you wants well then you better know the way the land you there actually take into account tactics and strategy and there is this defeatism that has come into the republican party that o just no matter what we do where not can get watch want may hell just yell as loud as we can with no actual end gold here that is doable and then everyone who refuses to do that which is can yell them out of the party or gang when they alien at them or gin to put up candidate to are bound to lose because if we yell to may we will feel better defeatism is a sin the feat ism is a sin to spare s a sin is not stuff these should be doing and somebody who watchers spousal and people in my industry ton be doing either it is my job to tell you yes what my principles are but also the realistic lay of the lands we know what we can get and and i think there a lot people in my industry who do not tell you the way the land and they give a false perception of what it is that you can get and that is a mistake because it sets up unrealistic expectation s it means that there are politicianswho are negotiating who are trying to make the sausage and the we object to the sausage making process then the sausage dust get made than really mad the sausage did not get made we blame them a ut the reality is that it is an ugly process it will always be snugly process if you want republicans to make serious changes in the spending habits of the united states which is what i would what i would is the stuff that no one will talk about i will not restructuring the settlements the vast drivers of our national that are not marginal programs but it is not marginal cutting around the edges of what the defense budget the vast cuts that we need in our programs are going to be had by restructuring major programs yes medical and social security those third rails of america politics democrats and republicans know and there we will come up on the austerity has to be brought upon theamerican people that will include tax increases it will include massive cut's to social benefits all those things will happen is just ta question of wen or you can plan for it now but nobody will touch that instead will jab ere about pork barrel spending and bridges to nowhere that cost a fraction of what it would cost to you actually look it social security medicare and realities we are not can do any of that unless you actually win a t win you have to own the guide to own the house if to own the find if to own the presidency then you can move stuff what is amazing to me is that the the calls for political courage constantly seem to be directly and in inverse proportions the amount of power re publicans wheel its penmen amazing think truly when re publicans control the house the senate and the presidency the calls for political courage disappear on the right when trump was president and republicans round the house in the senate where are the calls for uts now's the moment guides let us restructure social security its restructure medicate wit's change how we do spending bills now's the time let's do it right now let us it is do it right now where are the calls they totally one way don't care and then when the republicans are a barely an control of one house of songs be strong you will have to stands up and now the now is no actually you known you get thing's done when you have control of the levers know what is that what is that be speak it bespeaks that when your victorious you tend to be lazy and when you are not victorious you tend to be defeatist and thus desperate and thus charge to walls at topped here is mac earthy talking aback on nobody wins in a government shut down which i mean speaking in terms of of just political winds and and losses were got several of these no he's been a big winner from a government shut down in the recent in the recent past the so frustration here us the trust tires lustre wit som people in the comfy come back war of o told we get this go nobody winds in ta government shut g that that happens to be true you can you can yell about it you canoe can protest about it a government shut down is not going to result in brokoboma re pealing abomicary wasn't going to when had cruise did this routine back in twenty thirteen a a government she down is not on result in jobidon engaging on the inflation production act or whatever garbage shun toast as i can o do it again it'll giveyou the idealism it'll all yo what i want and they'll telly what is realistic because that's a responsible people do and it seems to me that if you are talking about the fate of the united states and our fiscal future responsibility should be at the top of the list or we can just bee to feet sand then on against walls will get to that in just one moment first let us talk about hike makeyourself healthier more easily an bat would

in a bunch of states he shouldn't have lost including arizona and georgia and i do not know how he is can make up the ground in places arizona and georgia given his turn campaign status the fact the he spending all of his campaign money on for example legal expenses and the fact that he's can a face down four separate criminal incitement in the next year an but that does not mean he camp possibly be president there is only one thing that could certainly four clothes trump from being president one hundred per cent he will not be president there is only one thing that could happen that would do that and that his he is own allegation that the the election is rigged gave said this before one stoned trump says the twenty twenty election is rigged he's now created in unfalsifiable reality because how can he ever win serious question how can he ever win if i tell you i played really hard last night my bascapollgamble let me tell you the refer was actively paid by the other side actively paid never tome i touch the bollix call the fowl did not matter what was happening on the sort there is no way for me to win ay say what guides next game same reef same other ten can you win the answer is now he is been paid off the only way ironically for trump to be able to claim that he can win in the twenty twenty four election is one of two things if he says that is rigged one yes to stop saying that it is rigged yes to say was it if we get enough voters out there we will win because is not rigged because yet i lost in twenty twenty set don't get enough votes but ism an a win next time he is come to get more votes a is not rings who should vote because we rashly know that when when he says for example that things are rigged you should vote you knot the comas twenty twenty one georgia election two democrat senators and seven trillion dollars and spending thinks to donate trumps dommaass a tempts to turn the georgia twenty twenty one special elections in to a referenda on how he did in georgia leading a bunch of rule republicans not to vote and hand two separate sentenced to democrats and control of the tenant and seven trolling dollars in spending yo know it strategy i would to not do that strategy again dona trump can win yes to stop saying that the election is rigged the reason as to tossing the election is rig is why would you vote if the election is rigged why would i vote if the election is rigged no matter what i do they are going to rig the election cay the other thing the h could say the critically is something has changed chemically between twenty twenty and twenty twenty four right he could say well they are bunch of re publican states that have cleaned up their act which sure i mean georgia pastobill flora passtogoloki he could theoretical make that castle those can have a tougher him an arizona he he could he cold make the case that we are taking serious on the ground steps to engage in some the things democrats do ballad harvesting or early voting h could say those things right that would change the factors on the ground does he say any of those things he does not say any of those things yesterday he did not interview whit again it it is youritting to me dona trump could still be president he would still be president to day if he had run a good campaign in twenty twenty and by the way you would be leading jobidon by leaps and bounds if after the election of twenty twenty he had said o k i lost but your bins can be a terrible president and it'll be back in a year telling you how terrible it was and your no want me again you been that simple or not doing that in any case doll trump does not interview with main kelly and she asks him the question that i have been asking for a couple of years at this point if you say the twenty twenty election was rigged how did you plan on winning the twenty twenty four election if it is similarly rigged and his answer is every thing that i said he should not say his answer is it is rigged there's no way i can win they will just ring it they'll bring hin face voters the bring in face ballast they will throw out good ballast and what is his strategy he says hell we will get great voter torn out that does not matter if you are entire argument is that stolen is in the back room throwing out the vote you get a pavilion votes you no win by a hundred million votes and you will still lose be cause your argument is as we would have maiden local an argument that proves too much in fact you are discouraging your own voters from voting when you say their votes do not matter this just strategic it is strategic foolishness i do not understand it i if he is ta nominal in o vote for him i want him to win if he is thenominy but does not the strategy for winning this not the vote the strata for getting voter turn out up it is a strategy for creating to spare inside your own party i do not understand this here he was of making belly yesterday every one knows he think twenty twenty was rigged how are you going to unrig it gain twenty twenty four i get that question to look they use coven decree they cheat anyway because how can you win elections open orders hi taxis hi intestrits no posterity a everything this does aril folks they'd we opposite we they have horrible policy they are only good to cheating an elections you want another to that i get the question town have unbelievable people and one going to be fighting hi because if in win the election i can he won't there is a second we have unbelievable people in are gingko be and were going in on gin be fighting hell is not in answer to they cheated and rigged all the rules how are you going to win in twenty twenty i assume he would have said the same thing that need unbelievable people an the going to fight hell fighting hell is not a strategy fighting hellish description of a thing it's not a strategy if i tell you again the refer in this basket ball is paid in this baseball game is paid off by the opposition and his going to rig the game for the opposition and you say how re gan win and i satin o play unbelievable that does not answer the question it does not answer in the question must be answer because if you want him to win he better have an answer this question otherwise they will just do the same thing thy didn't twenty went according to him not according to me according to him again my cases pretty simple he want twenty sixteen he lost in twenty twenty he can win in twenty twenty four be cause you want an twenty sixteen he could also loose he lost in twenty twenty right which means he should run o election campaign and and he will win but he is four closed that possibility now and now it is a box it is a box of his own making and the only person o benefits from that box is tonal trump the brand but not doll rump the presidential candidate do trump the brand benefits because if he loses he can claim that he was not actually a loser is somebody ease's fault an they rid the rules i brews mean to him and all the rest this wining nonsense or an by the way when i say nonsense it area is not true i we e the wining in politics if you are wining or losing ay that is just the reality winter's wine and winner's win if he actually wants to win he should stop with the wining and he should start actually i do not know investing tens millions o altars and pallet harvesting operations he should start investing tens millions dollars and get out toe vote efforts with regard to early balloting he should spend tends it send of his own money he should be spending this money on his legal fees that when i give a dollar to his campaign in the general which ism try well then that money will not go to his legal f few will go to actually doing the things necessary to win votes but didn't stop there he needs troubling down on it according to down from the election is hit just read it is super ring which does not answered the question because if i do not win the election meaning this philosophy this thought but if i of win the election i think our country is finished i think it is the most important election we have ever had if i do not win this election you talk o to me about all the different prosecution the earn prosecutions he is earned of these a bite indictments is indifferent this is in god coming down from his and an dating yours this is crooked job bones crooked is e three dollar bill used to say to it dollar bill but we have a few of them an how does not ratio toast how he is in won consideration and he said in dit my political opponent when they saying ta in silvery testy the press first they saw that way but there with time they for he is under i never now the are all biting indictments including the dais office he put his stop guy in the let's office and an that and everybody says it is not even o canal in it should even be brought you have see that you have heard that you prom lives tat not o hates a ridiculous it is a ridiculous but they put he put his top people in the day he is dealing with fanny was in at land it is all hooks to but but has the a ut he has that is very important for people ta on ligans are burned out they thinking ism not in get not forget it my votes not in seriously opposite there i do not they are get ran it nice i down in brownest again they get avoid numbers that you have never seen before because they see what is happening should they do the malar should the jet pe voters to the balling o a here is what we cannot allow yet would i would say let him do it by the way you know less on that id the toes day stuff but then you see what happen to carry lake we are all the machines were broken or big portion of en if be smarter to banks some vote before it a you i a i hurry lain you o bestow plop for a second pop for sang carry lake is rung again in this for now for the sent warison a claiming that she won she did not wing she last way wet dish towel and e what drives down the vote it t it actively drives down voting to i don show wen they vote relation the not early i section the malt it yo of course they should bell it in are you are you kidding me are kidding me o there is w one state in which there was a red wave and twenty twenty two you know which state that was it is the state i living why cause every whole i know voted early every one because they learned the lesson of twenty twenty you vote early you vote however he got of hot you make sure you get the votes it why is he a bivalent about this he is the candid i do not understand what are you agent a able is they throw the votes out ism it is crooked we have a angle waving o be clear what is the message o t vote do you want them to do the an the marlin voter no everybody people say yes do it i we have a bigger u i believe they send in far ballatoky that is the bigger that is you third problem that is your the pom they send in fake ballast they throw out the ballast that you are sending they broke all the machines no matter what happens ism on to lose also vote for me how is that possibly your campaign message on hiring a win how what is that leads to it leads to came this can of protest mentality of if i yellow loud enough than magic happens that is not how this works if you want trump to win he needs have an answer to this question in actual on the ground answer that involve spending money in particular ways and to plying resources in particular ways and if he is not focus on any of those things you have to ask the question is to why he is not focus on those things i i soft know the answer is it because it takes to much effort is it because hit is not care why if the only thing he cares bottles defending bison do the things you need you do to defeat jobidon that does not involve complaining that they are literally going to take all the ballast and throw them out the window use if that is true it do not matter what trump does you can a loose according to him not according to me we the was not the end of donate trump's interview with making call main gave the first interview of trump have seen in a very long time that actually was a good interview with trump cause main is the best in the business was not sic phatic nonsense about how he is like stomach pence and it was not the the left simply ask him why such a bad mean man who was her asking actual incisive questions and i got a say trump under performed he did i mean hits just the reality of the situation in this interview of main call n if i if therefore any one who are still objective in this race i do not know that they would be in love the trump's answer for example she asked him about his per romance on bovid his performance on cord was at bast eight in extremely mixed bag every one who was there and who hasn't memory longer tan a goldfish knows that i remember it you remember it he is ripping on brain camp in one moment say ha why is he reopening is state in the other he was liberate much again and is i i do not understand what you want on the one hand it was doctor face would the greatest thigh is at on the other hand it was doctor gauche he is there it was just all confused an dis combobulated that is best case area in any case she asks true a question that a lot of people have asked trump which is why in firefouching not wasn't i should think there is a reason he wouldn't firefouching his big mistake was putting touchy in charge in the first place once he put touchy in charge it happens to be the political case and de sense i trump that fought being fired would hae created this massive fire storm in which weave been the signs versus trump and the would been bad going into the elections i get it i silly do get that but now trumps hin a forget once once the we would moved you will further along why was he giving gauche a presidential metal of commendation we get that is at that's a real u scion that presidential metal of commendation came long after all this here ere is trump with making cell trying to explain is this the criticism of you that you made hin the face of the white house coroner iris you think sos and he was added every pressor that he was running hard for the administration on covet and that you actually in the presidential commendation before he left office would not you a do over on that i do not know who gave him the commendation i really do not know who gave him the commendation as a notation en wan o mark somebody notably candid in e commendation he probably but limit us say about touchy douche was very important in the bean administration much less important if he did not want o stop john he wanted to let everyone come in from john i stopped it i overrode it i overrode many of the things he did he was much less important to me now without all being said he is been there for years he was respected he lost a lot of the respect because of covet but he was respected and on covet if what i did i let the governors run this dace ya that was the best partner that he did not bag at governors rung he is right about that but he gave a president yes of course he gave a presidential commendation to on the day before he left office wo kat as by canary he would already lost the election who is leaving office and he gave a presidential commendation to by the way not just not just anchovy vouch he gave one to the much marine to general mark silly he gave one to debag bucks if you recall this is literally in the same list he went to desert bucks he gave one to mark silly and he a ones we anchovy fancy but he is not now who did it bi men since your signatures on the page i assume your the one who did it then of course he suggest that to cantus was a big touch he found which wilt come on this he just that is you can love trumping butter tram all that is fining panty and we stop pretending that he is being an honest advocate here he is not that is a lie it is a lie the that donate trump was some how a less or fan of anchovy fancy than on the artist that is absurd he said that in the cell interviews ridiculous this hance has fought back on that of course as he should ism sure you saw the former president's interview with making kelly last night i trying to litigate a lot of these covet issues and and controversies from the end of his presidency am you were you were accused of having one of the worst knockdowns in the country vain mandates i praising touchy for months on and i want to give you a chance to respond to all about because that all that stuff was mentioned by the former president at at interview well person is important to say that that is her from from the i to used to say i mean he used to race florid for having been open he used to say i was one the country's great governors i said we her of copy correctly and brilliant my he used to say that he was on record always say that i now we as o a tract and that when he is now changing his ton that that obviously is true that wasn't the end of the cell interview g nowt is a really goon interview by mansion really good job but this shark trump about his classified document's case and by the way pagan is a believer that trump should not be prosecuted on the classified documents case far as ism aware specifically declass killer canton was not prosecuted for pretty much the same thing but you ask him a petty simple question which is why did you keep the documents and then why were you waving them around and also why did you light o get barren say that the documents you're waving around on tape saying that they were classified and you could have declassified to them but you did not why did you say that those were golf plans in they clearly were not and at this point trumps lawyers mush as be setting their hair on fire i mean my goodness he is just again guys if you've do chiming do not to the chiming on tape and then do not retrospectively admit that you did the chiming the here is tonal trump making his lawyers i sting his lawyers it'll have just brain aneurism to this point ow why would you describe a newspaper article as highly confidential and still a san seine si ossified it the meginhow you shan't at lumigistis number one i did nothing because i come under the presidential records the factious who are going after me and than not going after by even though he has about ten times more documents may be more than that he has document's on back forty years or fifty years we did nothing wrong i come onto the presidential records act ism allowed to have these documents this was done in nineteen seventy eight and this was done for exactly this reason ism allowed to have these documents ism but in other words he light remarries to their gallants and are not newspapers they were classified documents but he's making the argument he is a last to have the classified documents i mean now he is basically just relic what he is talking about is a legal interpretation of the statue it by for the record the presidential records act covers personal presidential communications its if you keep a diary of your time in the white house that does not become classified material that is yours it does not mean thatifthere is a see i report the crosses your desk and you do not declassify it and you take it home and y but it your drawer that it is now magically to classified that is not wit the presidential records aces in never said that is that is a misstatement of the law but even if you interpret the law trump is interpreting the law that is a legal argument that is not a factual argument what trump sign to be acts to testify about if he testifies that cases he says that he will in his lower certainly will not let him if he if he were to testifying that case they're not going to ask him about his interpretation of the presidential records act that is an argument for legal annalists there on to ask him whether he declassified the documents whether you wen through any crosses and he is going to say no because he did not go through any process he is going to say there automatically to class that again that is legal argument not a factual one they're not say did you go through any crosses free classifyingthe documents can say no then they go to say tape did you say that you could have declassified the documents but you did not and he did not have to say yes o they have montage can hen there going to say were those documents the iron plans were they something that was classified and he is going to have to say well yes that cause he is saying all of it right on main kelly show again should tat prosecution we broughtagains from no is trump his worst his own worse enemy when it comes to these legal matters absolutely finally pagan did ask trump about his stands on transgenerasm which has changed radically overtime he used to say that he would allow men to compete against women in this universe contest ye he said that he would famously in twenty sixteen allow cateran general to use the woman's rest room even though cateran i is a is a male and a and cure us his answer at it is amazing how uneasy he is to just say that a man can become a woman it is can a fascinating and now cateran is ruse i knew brush and you a brush was a great aptly and a very handsome person very handsome guy and all of the sudden bruises cateran i said whats this all about this was a branded subject too is a brandy subject ask him about whit he was aloud use the female rest from then and he was well you know nobody is talkingabout t the time first wale not true but o k fine that is that is your case she ten ask him you can a woman be come man an he cannot hesitates own the question in a very weird way because here a thing by trump its very easy for him to simply say the things that would be they would be correct which is i changed my mind on this subject but trump has never admitted ever that he is ever made a mistake it is impossible for him at now is any this con a matter the answers no for lot re publican voters the on and they are not looking at what he says that i even looking what he does they feel they know the guy and they are loyal to him and they believe that that because he one in twenty sixteen he will pull a rabbit out of the hat in twenty twenty four and does not have to have a plan the will magic his way to the white house ski fine but in the world of actual political analysis we we are supposed to look at what people say an what people do making cold did a good job of theinterviewing trump and he did not do job handling those questions just on any objective level of gate time for some things i in than some things that i hate things that i to day ism excited to announce to you that the union solidarity coalition which is apparently a group of a quasi famous actors and actresses and writers and such they are now auctioning off their services to benefit their cruise half care fun now at this point i should remind you that every single person his auctioning off setts is worth many millions of dollars and if they actually wanted to hew benefit their crusted car from they could cousin track in fact

great way to help out the people who are members your crusinima track they amazing you don't get much money could do that if you are say bob open kick and a you made a massive success of yourself over the past few years and you have a net worth that range is in the sixteen million dollar range well maybe your sin a check well no are they doing any that no what they are actually doing is their

welcome to the superman cancans w a science science pace to e for i m an druhubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today we are discussing breathing a breathing is something that we are all familiar with because frankly we are all doing it right now and we do it during our waking states end while we are asleep and most of us have probably heard that breathing is essential to life we hear that we can survive without food for some period of time may be even up to a month or more that we cannot survive that long without water but we could survive a few days without water depending on how well hydrated we are when we go into that water deprivation and the heat of the environment we happen to begin but that we cannot survive without breathing for more than a few minutes n that if we cease to breathe that our brain and our bodily tissues will die and in fact that is true however despite everybody's knowledge that breathing is essential to life i do not think that most people realize just how important how we breathe is to our quality of life and that includes our mental health our physical health and what we call performance that is our ability to happen to skills either physical or cognitive in ways that we would not be able to otherwise if we are not breathing correctly to day we are going to talk about what it is to breathe correctly both at rest during sleep in order to reduce our levels of stress in order to wake up or to become more alert deliberately and many many other things including how to stop hiccuping this is one of the most search for topics on the internet to day i will teach you the one method that is actually linked to science now it does not involve drinking a glass of water backwards from the opposite side of the cup or holding your breath in any kind of a esoteric way it actually relates to the neural mechanisms that is the braintobody connections that cause the hiccup hick is a spasm of that neural circuit and it'll teach you ow to turn off that neral circuit in one try and that is not a technique i developed it is a technique that is she been known about for several centuries and we now know the underlying mechanism to day's discussion will give to you many tools that you can apply all of these tools are of course behavioral tools there completely zero cost and in telling you how those tools work you will learn a lot about how the breathing ache the respiratory system works and how it interfaces with the other organs and tissues of the body in particular the brain in fact one of the most important things to understand about breathing right here at the outset is that breathing is unique among brain and bodily functions in that it lies at the interface between our conscious and our subconscious behavior and it represents a bridge literally in the brain between the conscious and the sub conscious what do i mean by that well breathing does not require that we pay attention to our breathing or that we are even aware that we are breathing it will just carry on in the background either normally or abnormally n teach you what normal and abnormal breathing is in the little bit however breathing is unique among brain and bodily functions in that at any moment we can consciously take control of how we breathe this is an absolutely spectacular and highly unusual feature of brain function for instance your digestion is carrying on in the background right now whether not you have had food recently or not but you cannot simply control your digestion by thinking about it in a particular way in fact most people cannot even control their thinking by trying to control their thinking that actually take some practice it can be done topic for a future episode however breathing is unique breathing will carry on involuntarily subconsciously in the background as i said before but if at any moment you want to hold your breath or inhale more deeply were vigorously or exhale longer than you inhale you can do that very few if any other curl circuits in your brain and body allow that level of control and turns out that level control is not an accident it has been hypothesize that by controlling breathing the brain is actually a tempting to control its own state of mind now the way this was originally stated in a scientific research paper was a habit different as limit more physiological the statement was the brain by regulating breathing controls its own excitability excitability in the context of neurobiology is how able the brain is to take in new information or not how able the brain is or not to turn itself off to go to sleep and to regulate its own levels of anxiety focus et camera if that seems a little bit abstract it'll make it simple for you by changing your pattern of breathing you can very quickly change what your brain is capable of doing in fact lo it later it'll tell you that while you inhale you are far better at learning and remembering information than during an exhale and it is a very significant difference does that mean you should only inhale and not expelled know of course not it'll teach you how to breathe for the sake of learning in memory as well as for physical performance and a number of other things hopefully have been able to highland for you the importance of breathing not just for life because yes breathing is essential for life but that the subtleties of how we breathe the duration and intensity of our inhales and our exhales how long we hold our breath between inhales and exhales very critically defines our state of mind and our state of body what we are able to do and what we are not able to do and the great news is we can control our breathing and in doing control are mental health physical health and performance before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element elemi t is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reunions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephysites an cognitive end physical performance element contains a science bactolectrolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doc come slap supermen let us talk about breathing and of course we breathe in order to bring oxygen into the body but we also breathe to remove certain things from our body in particular carbondoxide the main players in today's discussion are going to be oxygen and carbonoxide now a common misconception is that oxygen is good and carbondioxide is bad that is simply not the case let us just take a step back from that statement and let us think about this when we breathe in we are largely breathing in are in order to bring oxygen into our body and we can just stop right there and say why do we breathe at all what why cannot we just get oxygen from the world around us well it is because oxygen cannot diffuse through our skin into the deeper cells of our body other single cell and very simple organisms can actually bring oxygen into their system without the need to breathe but we have to breathe in order to bring oxygen to the cells that reside deep in our body in particular our brain cells which are the most metabolically active cells our body require a lot of oxygen and those brain cells are sitting course in the brain which is in cased in the cranial vault the skull and oxygen cannot simply pass to those cells we need to have a system that will deliver oxygen to those cells we also need a system ice turns out to be the breathing or respiratory system that can all load or remove the gas that we call carbondioxide not because carbondoxide is bad but because too much of it in our system is not good in fact much of to day's discussion will also center round the common misconception that carbondoxcide is something the we want to get rid of you do not want to get rid of too much carbondoxide or else you cannot usually get oxygen to the cells and tissues of your body in an efficient way you need oxygen and you need carbondoxide in your body you also need to be able to all load or remove carbondoxide and bring in oxygen in the correct ratios that you can perform the kind of mental functions and physical functions that you want to if we just dial out even further we say what are the key components of breathing what are the elements within the body that allow us to bring oxygen to the tissues and cells as is required and remove carbondoxide from the body as is required and yet keep enough carbondoxide around in order to allow oxygen to do its thing well that breathing or respiratory apparatus has two major components and ism going to just briefly describe those and as i do this i really want a highlight the fact that any timeout are thinking about biology and physiology in particular whether not about the brain or the liver or the gutmicrobyom it is useful to categorize things either as mechanical mechanisms or chemical mechanisms what o i mean by that will is just take the analogy of hunger there are mechanical mechanisms that tell us when we should eat for instance you have neurons nerve cells in your gut that signal how stretched or non stretch the walls of your stomach are how full or how empty our gut is and send that information to the brain to make you feel to some extent hungry or not hungry in general when our stomach is very full especially it is very distended even with liquid it suppresses our hunger whereas when our stomach is devoid of that mechanical pressure specially for a number of hours it tends to trigger hunger by signaling vianurons to the bring in addition there are chemical signals that go from the gut to the brain for instance we have neurons in our gut that can detect the presence of a monoacid from prolines that we eat fatyacids from the foods that we eat the lipids and sugars different forms of carbohydrate the neurons in our gut are paying attention to or respond to how much a monoacid fatyacid and carbohydrate is in our gut and send signals to the brain to either stimulate or suppress hunger those are chemical signals that are being passed from gut to brain and they work in parallel with the mechanical signals and this idea of parallel with again as a very common theme in biology especially neuroscience the term parallel pathways refers to the fact that any time there is a critical bodily function it is very unlikely that just one type of information just mechanical information is going to be used almost always it is going to be mechanical an chemical information i could pick a number of other examples for instance if a you want to avoid damaging your skin or other tissues of your body which is essential to life well then you have mechanical information about for instance whether not something is pinching or ready to period skin that is mechanical information its send via specific neurons up to the brain to signal a retraction reflects of you move your limb away from wherever that intense pressure is coming you also have chemical sensing in your in the presence of things that elicit a burn or that elicit itch or that elicit extreme cold all that chemical information its being signalled up to the brain is well in parallels or parallel pathways is a common theme when we are thinking about the respiration each a the breathing system we also need to look at the mechanical system what are the different components of the nose the mouth thelungs et camera that allow oxygen to be brought in and carbondoxide to be removed from the body but not too much carbonado have removed to allow breathing to work as efficiently and as optimally is possible and then we also need to look at the chemical systems of the lungs the blood stream and how different cells use oxygen in carbondoxide in order to understand that is well if you can understand the mechanical and chemical aspects of breathing even just at a top contour will then the various tools that i discuss during to day's episode such as the ability to calm yourself down most quickly by doing what is called a physical social sigh all going to this in more detail halo bit but this is too very deep inhale through the nose the first one is a long inhale and then the second one after that is a quick sharp inhale to maximally inflate your lungs followed by a full exhale through the mouth to lungs completely empty it is big inhale through the nose then short inhale through the nose immediately after that in order to maximally inflate the lungs and then a long exhale through the mouth until your lungs are empty you will understand why that particular pattern or breathing and not simply one inhale ere not simply an in inhale through the nose and an exhale through the nose is well is optimal for reducing your stress quickly that double inhale through the nose followed by a long exam through the mouth works to reduce your levels of stress and lowerour levels hove called autonomic arousal very fast in real time and it works better than any other known approach it is not a hack this is shall something that your body has specific oral circuits to do and shall performs during sleep on a irregular basis and even throughout the day and that you can perform voluntarily and it work well to reduce stress very quickly not because it brings in the maxim amount of oxygen and removes the maximum amount of carbondoxide but rather because it ultimately balances oxygen in carbondoxide if you understand the mechanical and chemical aspects of breathing then you will understand exactly why that particular pattern of breathing the called physiological side is the most efficient way to rapidly reduce stress in real tide if you can understand the mechanical and chemical aspects of breathing you will also understand why most people are overreaching that is their breathing too often even if their breathing in a shallow manner their breathing too often and they are blowing off for removing too much carbon oxide and if you understand the carbondoxide is critical for the way the oxygen is delivered from the blood stream to the tissues of the body including the brain will then it will make very good sense as to why people who are breathing too much do not actually experience all the effects of elevated oxygen but rather their putting their body into what is call the hypoxia state they are not getting enough oxygen to the tissues of the body in particular their brain and this is true notches for people who are obese or who suffer from sleep apnea or although that certainly the case but for people that have believe or not certain personality types will talk about breathing in personality type and actually how breathing has been shown to alter personality that is right breathing can all or personality in positive ways that allow any one to show up to the various social and non social endeavors of their life with more calm more focus alertness and improve their over all health o case let us talk about the mechanical components of breathing it is really quite simple you have got your nose obviously and you have got your mouth and a limit later will talk about the incredible advantages of being a nasal breather most of the time but also the incredible advantages of using your mouth to breathe both for inhales and exhales during particular types of endeavors and we will get back to that blow later but for the meantime the only two ways to bring air into your system are through your nose and through your mouth we also have the drinks which is a rigid tissue or pipe that brings the air from the nose and mouth down to the lungs now that word rigid is really important here because what we will soon learn is that your lungs basically act a pump you sort of know this already but these are too big bags basically that can fill with air or that can squeeze air out now what most people do not realize is that the lungs are not just too big bags of air your lungs are actually too big bags of air that inside of them have hundreds of millions of little sacks that are called the avidly of the lungs and by having those hundreds of millions of little sacks you increase the surface area of the lungs and by increasing the surface area you allow more oxygen to pass from the air in your lungs into the blood stream then if you did not have those sacks and you allow more carbondioxide to move from the blood stream into those acts of the lungs and than when you exhale the carbonioxide can be removed case those little sac fecal avidly of the lungs are inn important part of the mechanical aspect of breathing will get to a obit later i at a first pass the mechanical aspects of breathing are really straight for red yet you can breakthrough your nose you breathe your mouth goes down through the larynx i told you the brings is a rigid pipe the lungs are not rigid that can expand and they can contract a pump to bring in air or to expel air keep in mine that the lungs do not have any muscles themselves we need muscles that can either squeeze the lungs or that will allow the lungs to expand and there two general groups of muscles that do that and they are the diaphragm and the called intercostal muscles the diaphragm is a thin muscle that sits below the lungs and above the liver and when we inhaul provided that we are using what is called diaphragmatic breathing that diaphragm contracts and when it contracts it moves down which allows more space for the lungs to inflate with fire now the intercostal muscles are the muscles between our ribs a number people tho probably do not realize this but your ribs of course a bone but in between those bones you have muscles and they intercostal muscles when you inhale contract and that allows your rib cage to move up and to expand of it i think again people probably do not realize that your ribs are not fixed in place they can actually get further and closer apart from one another when you inhaul your rib cage actually moves up sometimes the shoulders will move up as well that is because those intercostal muscles are contracting now muscles cannot move on their own they are controlled by nerves we have got the nose the bowl the marines and the lungs the lungs have all those we vile in them and as i told you we have got the diaphragm as a muscle to move the lungs and we have the intercostal muscles to move the ribs which can allow the lungs to expand again where just on the mechanical components of breathing but because muscles cannot move themselves you should be asking what moves the muscles and it is really nerves that control muscles whether not your contracting your bias are your walking in your contracting your quadriceps and your hamstrings in your calf muscles it is neurons nerve cells that control that there is a specialized nerve called the irenic nerve p h re e and icy irenic nerve that comes out of the neck and when i say it comes out of the neck what i mean is that their little neurons that reside in the brainstorm in the backer brain and they send little wires that we call axons down and out of the neck they go close to the heart and a obit behind it and they go down and they form snaps as that is they form connections with the diaphragm and when those neurons release hero transmitter which are little chemicals the diaphragm contraction it moves down we say that the phrenic nerve is a motor nerve is designed to move muscle however the phrenic nerve a few other nerves in the body is interesting in that it has conscious motor nerves in there neurons that control the contractions muscles it also can sense things there has sensory neurons it also sends connections down to the diaphragm and actually down deep into the diagraming close to the liver and note that i said liver twice now already were on to get back to this later when we talk about physical movement and cramps of the body those censer turns dive deep into the diaphragm and the they go back up to the brain and they allow you to sense where the diaphragm is there giving information about where the diaphragm is in your body now most the him you are not paying attention to this but right now you cannot hall try this and i would encourage you to do this diaphragmatic breathing is in many ways the ideal way to breathe and that it is the most efficient way to breath will talk about what we mean exactly when we see breathing efficiency later but the diaphragm is desire to allow the lungs to expand or to contract the lungs to bring air in to the body or to remove carbonoxide from the body and if you want to know whether not your using diaphragmatic breathing it is very simple if you inhale probably best to do this trough the nose it you could do it through the mouth if you inhale and your belly moves outward on the inhale well then that chronic nerve is controlling your diaphragm properly and then when you exhale your bellies should go in just a little bit that is diaphragmatic breathing now diaphragmatic breathing is talked about in the contacts of yoga it is often talked about is a was to calm down and on but diaphragmatic breathing is just one mode by which your brain and the frantic nerve can control muscle the diaphragm to control the mechanical aspects of the lungs to bring in air and expel air mention before you also have these muscles between your ribs were the intercostal muscles and there is a separate set of nerves that allow those muscles to contract and for your rib cage to expand in order to create more room for your lungs to get larger and fill with air or for your ribcage to contract a bit when those muscles relax in order to expel i it'd to go on record by saying that there is no rule that diaphragmatic breathing is better than breathing where your rib cage moves this is a common is conception people say oh you no if your shoulders are going up and down in your your rib cages moving while your breathing will then your not breathing right and if your belly goes out and on the rest of your body is still while you breathe whole then your breathing correctly i know of zero in fact zero witness one data to support that statement you have multiple parallel mechanisms to control the mechanics of your lungs and for breathing and when you are exerting yourself very hard you tend to use both the intercostal muscles and your rib cage moving as well as your diaphragm in order to bring in a lot of oxygen and to off lot a lot of carbondoxide and when your calmer frankly you could use diaphragmatic breathing or you could use rib cage tight breathing in order to bring enough oxygen into your system there is no real data showing that diaphragmatic breathing is somehow better or worse however being able to mechanically control those independently or to combine them and use them together is of tremendous power toward regulating your mental and physical states and will talk about how to do that obit later for right now please understand that you have these different mechanical components then allow you to bring oxygen into your system and to expel air and to thereby off load carbonoxide from your system again we have not talked about the a s exchange of carbon oxide and oxygen and how that is happening the bloodstream will talk about that next but the basic mechanical components are pretty simple right once again just to re view its nose mouth marines lungs ignobly within the lungs and then those two muscles the diaphragm in the intrcostle muscles of the ribs one thing i fail to mention is why it is important that that larynx be rigid that it is a a tube that is very rigid and the reason for that is that unlike the lungs which you want to act as sort of a a bellow pump where you can you can deflate it and inflate it in order to move air in and out the drinks needs to be rigid that it does not collapse while you are bringing air in and out you can imagine that if it was a very flimsy tube or it or the walls of the lacings were very flimsy and thin well ten you can imagine breathing in very vigorously and it would shut a tube a that suddenly flattens on itself which is would not be good the fact that the balance is rigid is actually a very crucial part of this whole system the other important aspect of this system as it relates to the mechanics of breathing is the fact that your nose in your mouth have different resistances to air you can probably notice this right now if you were for instance breathe in through your mouth and only through your mouth verses breathe in through your nose some of you perhaps have a harder time breathing in through your nose by the way it is perfectly normal that one or the other nostril would be harder to breathe through or easier to breath through in that that switches across the day as to do with the flow of much's and three hospital flood and intracranial pressure totally normal many people out there think they have a deviated septum who do not actually have a deviated septum a limit lay will talk about how to repair a deviated sept with out surgery cause that actually as possible in many not all cases and is immensely beneficial to do but what we know is that breathing in through the nose is a little bit harder and its posed to be a little bit harder however because it is a little bit harder because there is more resistance as we say you are actually able to draw more force into these mechanical aspects of the breathing apparatus and actually bring more air into your lungs you can try this right now try breathing in through your mouth to maximally in late your lungs and try and do it through mostly diaphragmatic breathing just for sake of example in other words trying breathing through your mouth and as you do that have your belly expand and maximally inflate your lungs it'll do what right now with you that we can do it in together and i can prove every one that ism just as deficient in this as you are o case i can inflate my stomach doing that but now try doing it with your nose and please do hail before you try going t with your nose with your nose you are going to feel more resistance but you will notice that you can inflate it quite a bit further and you will feel your entire cavity your your belly and maybeven in your lower back fill with some pressure the increased resistance actually blows you to draw more air into the system this turns out to be very important and it also wipes away a common is s conception which is if your somebody has a challenges breathing in through your nose that somehow you should avoid breathing in through your nose actually quite the opposite is true and we can go a step further and say that if you have challenges breathing in through your nose chances are that is because the increased resistance of breathing in through your nose provided its not completely excluded is going to allow you to bring more oxygen into your system this will turn out to be useful later when we explore different techniques for instance not just to calm down quickly but to elevate your energy quickly to i remove a cramp during exercise and a number of other things that breathing can be used for that can be immensely useful for mental and physical challenges it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all your foundational nutritional needs give been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to be the robotics that i need for got health our got is very important is populated by up microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptegens fitments and minerals that make sure that all f my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastescripe if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a years supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic green stock calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply a vitamin three k to sonatas talk about the chemical aspects of breathing and the two major players in this discussion are oxygen which all the cells and tissues of your body need and carbondioxide which all the cells an tissues of your body need in fact carbondoxide plays critical rolls in delivering oxygen to your cells and without carbondoxide you are not going to get enough oxygen to the cells and tissues of your body that said if carbondoxide levels are to high that is very problematic in fact one of the ways that one can reliably in duce panic in anybody is to have them breathe air that contains too much carbondoxide much that for people that lack a called a eidola many of you we probably heard of the imigola this is a brain area that is associate with fear and threat detection even in people who completely lack a mandolas on both sides of the brain because they were removed because they had epileptic seizures there and therefore those people are completely unafraid of things that they ought to be afraid of heights poisonous snakes any number of different things dangerous to humans well if those people breathe and excess amount of carbondoxide they immediately have a panic attack what that tells us is that again there are parallel mechanisms there is redundancy in the system to protect ourselves from having too much carbondoxide in our system we need enough carbondoide and enough oxygen in our system but not too much the way that is accomplished is that of course we breathe in air are lungs in flight and if you recall those little avidly of the lungs those little sacks oxygen can actually move from the air into those little sacks and then from those little sacks into the vaxculature the musculature are the capillaries the veins and the arteries of the body because the walls of those little ravioli are exceedingly thin and they have tons of little capillaries that go into them and are all around them this is amazing right this oxygen literally passing from inside of these little sacks our lungs as we inhaled the oxygen from the air into the blood stream and then that oxygen gets bound up by prolines in the blood in particular hemoglobin and hemoglobin an then delivers oxygen to the very cells and tissues of the body however oxygen cannot just hop on hemoglobin in and cruise along with hemoglobin until it gets to say your brain and then hop off does not work that way you require carbondioxide in order to liberate oxygen from hemoglobin carbondoxide has this incredible property of any being able to change the shape of hemoglobin hemoglobin is chape is a sort of a cage around oxygen molecules and when it is in that cage shape the oxygen cannot be liberated you have got oxygen and hemoglobin bound to one another moving through your blood stream but if a tissue needs oxygen there needs to be carbondoxide present to open up that cage and that is what carbondoxide does it allows that age show change shape and then the oxygen can be liberated and then can be delivered to the tissues whether not that sprain tissue or muscle tissue on and forth and those of the major chemical components of breathing there are few other apes related to the chemical composes of breathing such as the fact that carbondioxide is strongly related to how acidic or how basic your body is in general for instance if carbondoxide levels go weight down your blood p h goes way up that is you become more alkaline now for many people the word p h and the whole concept of p h immediately starts to a woke anxiety and anon itself a p h is achy very simple you want the body basically to b at a p h of about seven point for the are some regions of your body in particular along the gut which that number is importantly different in order for digestion to work properly you have all hear the gut microbus the little microbes that provided you have a enough of them an their diverse enough allow your brain and body to function optimally at the level of mien system hormone system brain et camera well in the gut you want the p h sometimes be slightly more acidic because when it is more acidic the little microbiota flourish far more than if it were more basic but easily you want the rest of the body to be at about p h seven point for if carbondioxide levels go too low the p h increases in a way that you might say where that is bad but that actually allows more oxygen to be available to the tissues of your body at least temporarily we will talk about this a bit more later if ism losing any of you just hanging there because we are almost done with this whole business of the mechanics and the chemistry of breathing andthan we can get into the tools and revisit some of this later to clean up any misunderstandings it may have arisen but as we are talking about carbondoxide over and over again and how key it is to have carbonoxide and the promise with it going to higher too low you shouldprobably be asking yourself what actually makes carbonoxide go too low right we know the we breathe in oxygen and then it can pass from the lungs and the evilly into the blood stream andthat we need carbonoxide deliberate oxygen from the hemoglobin into the sells and tissues f the body and we know that when we exhale or ritually i have told you this yet but you should know that when you exhale carbondioxide is actually taken from the blood stream back into these avidly of the longs and then when you exhale it is expelled through your mouth or throughout nose out into the world the way i just described all that inhale bring in oxygen exhale expel carbondioxide pretty straightforward right indeed it is and it also tells you that were you to hail a lot more or a lot more vigorously you would expel more carbondioxide and in fact that is exactly the way at works when you hyper ventilate of course you are inhaling more than usual but you are also exhaling more than usual you are of course bringing in more air and oxygen to your body but you are also removing more carbondoxide from your body than normal carbondioxide because of the ways that it regulates brain state in fact the way in which it regulates the excitability literally the ability of your neurons to engage electrically or not it can create states of panic and anxiety which is why when you hyper ventilate you feel an increase in anxiety or when you feel an increase in anxiety you hyper ventilate it is a reciprocal relationship in fact i do not want anyone who has anxiety or who has panic attacks to try this now but for most people it is probably safe as long s you aren't driving or doing something mechanical or opening machinery that is probably safe to do twenty five or thirty deep inhale and exhales and you will notice that by about breath ten you will start to feel tingly and you will probably feel will bit more alert and again if you have anxiety or panic attack tendencies please do not do this but you will feel an increase in called autonomic arousal in increasing the activity for over all sympathetic nervous system which has nothing to a sympathy as everything to do with alertness you'll actually deploy a adrenaline from your adrenals sill just do this now you can try this now again provided your in a safe place andyou do not have anxiety our penicatac tendencies you will just breathing through nose and out through your mouth t remember were breathing in more and more vigorously and were exhaling more and more vigorously than we normally would it got something this now by breath eight or nine or ten you will notice that your body starts a heat up that is due to a couple of things ta mainly the release of a adrenaline from your adrenals i am already feeling i bit lightheaded the lightheadedness is usually because your musculature the calories in veins and to some extend even the arteries of your body in articulating your brain are actually starting to constricts to your cutting off blood flow to the brain why well because carbon dioxide actually is of azo dilator normally it exists in your body to keep caplaryes veins and arteries dilated to allow blood to pass through them when you hyper ventilate sure your bringing in a lot of oxygen which you think would make you more alert and indeed it does but you are also expelling a lot more carbondoxide than you normally would and that is causing some azo constriction in your in a start feeling tingly in the periphery in your fingers and toes perhaps or your legs you will also notice that your feeling more alert in the brain but that you might start to feel a bit of anxiety hyperventilation springs in more oxygen also removes more carbondoxide the removal of excess carbondioxide puts you into a state that is called hypocapnic right hypoxia hypoxia is reduced levels of oxygen relative to normal hypomania is reduced levels of carbon dioxide relative to normal and is those reduced levels of carbondoxide that are largely responsible for that elevation and energy and at the same time a feeling of a bit of anxiety the constriction of the microvaxculature in the brain and body and therefore the feelings of being kind of tingly and having kind of an urgency to move o case by now it should be clear that we need both oxygen and carbondioxide and across the course of this episode i will explain how to adjust those rations of oxygen to carbondoxide depending on what your immediate needs are and what you plan to do next wither not that sleep or exercise or mental work et camera before going any further however there is something i want to touch on because even though not everyone will experience this i think enough people experience it that it is of interest and now the right time to touch in to what happens when you go up to a very high altitude meaning what's hard to breathe when you get up to high altitudes if you are close to sea level you are getting the potable balance of oxygen in the er you breathe as you ascend in altitude policy you go to six thousand feet or ten thousand may yogin eleven thousand feet above see level or maybe you one of those car individuals that climbs deny or you climb mount verist and you get up there andyou notice it you most people are going to wear an oxygen mask why is it that you need an oxygen mask at those very high altitudes or when people do these very high altitude sky dives that they need oxygen a way up high well a lot people say oh there is not much oxygen up there the air is thinner look well perhaps a better way to think about it is that remember when we were talking about the mechanical aspects of breathing and the fact that the lungs do not really move themselves that they have the muscles the diaphragm an intercostal muscles to move them well a lot of the reason why your lungs can fill readily with air is that when you do not have much air in your lungs there is very low air pressure in your lungs relative to outside you what we mean then is if you were to open up your mouth or your nose and breathe in that is breathing through your nose or mouth what is going to happen is air is going to move from high pressure to low pressure it is very easy to fill your lungs even though you need those muscles to move the various things around that allow your lungs to fill the air is going to go from high pressure to low pressure for those you listen agustocabeen big inhaul through my nose and then when you entail right you are basically taking the lungs from a state in which the pressure is really high in the lungs you high pressure the balloon that is full and the pressure in your lungs when your lungs are full is higher than the air outside it is pretty easy to expel that air through the nose or mouth when you are a high altitudes the air pressure is lower and what happens is when the air pressure is lower outside your body and your lungs are not full of air you do not have that really steep radiant of high pressure outside the body to low pressure inside your lungs and you actually have to put a lot more effort into breathing air into your lungs you have to really exert a lot of force you've to get the diaphragm those intercostal muscles working really hard you might even find that your shoulders are lifting with each breath as you really have to generate a lot of force to get enough air an oxygen into your lungs now an important principle to understand is that in humans and in some other species but really what were talking about now as humans when you inhale that is an active process you really need to use those muscles of the intercostals an the diaphragm in order to inflate the lungs but the whole process is made easier when air pressure outside your body is higher than it is in your lungs because then they are going to fill up really readily exhaling at least for humans is a passive thing you just have to relax the diaphragm in relax the intercostals and let the ribcageion fall back to its in original position inhaling is active and exhaling is passive and what happens is we haveyou are at a high altitude and the air pressure is very low then you tough to put a lot of energy into breathing air into your lungs to get an equivalent amount of oxygen into your lungs and then into the blood stream that is why when you arrive at a high altitude location for the first few days you can feel lightheaded may be a headache you also can have more build up of carbonic oxide in your system and the whole balance of oxygen and carbondoxide is going to be disrupted i mention all that because yes indeed there are some changes in the atmospheric gases that high altitudes and i that can impact how much oxygen you can bring into your system ant your tissues but now have heard many explanations of whit is hard to breathe or why you feel palsy at altitude well you just discovered one reason which is that you do not have that steep high pressure to low pressure gradient from the outside of the body into the inside of the body the converse is also true if you have been at altitude for a few days and you have had the opportunity to adjust a lot of athletes for instance will go train at altitude it is hard for them in the first days or weeks and then they get really good at training at altitude thereat number of different adaptations that occur in terms of the amount of oxygen that can be carried in the blood by hemoglobin and the inner axioms begin carbondoxide and hero global an oxygen that allow more oxygen to be delivered to the tissues such that at altitude you can function just normally but if you then move very quickly from altitude sat you havebeen training at eight thousand feet or ten thousand feet you been fighting up at the high level an you have adapted and you come down to sea level well for about two to five days you are going to feel an absolute beast you are going to be able to essentially deliver far more oxygen to your muscles our breath impart that is because of the way that the hemoglobin and the oxygen that it is carrying has been altered when you are at high altitude but it is also because when you are at the high altitude those intercostal muscles and those diaphragm got trained up quite a bit and allowed you to generate more air volume for every breath and other words those muscles got stronger and you got more efficient at driving the irenic nerve consciously to really breathing a lot of oxygen you do not feel light headed headache et camera has that is a little bit of in aside but it is an important aside i believe because aid answers a question a lot of people ask and the lop you will wonder about and be because it corporate both the mechanical aspects of breathing and the chemical aspects of breathing i realize it is a low bit of a unusual circumstance but now if any one ask you why it is hard to break at altitude has to do with this lack of a high pressure to low pressure gradient across the body in with the the atmosphere outside you it is also an opportunity for me to say that if you do find yourself at altitude you have a headache are you feeling you just cannot catch your breath spending some time really consciously trying to draw in larger breaths of air as much as that might seem fatiguing and you will be short of breath it will allow you to adapt more quickly and li bit later in the episode will touch on a few methods including deliberate high pereventilation combine with some breathholds that can allow you to d deliver more oxygen to the cells immediately upon arriving at altitudes get don't get quite as much headache disorientation and on leaving breathing at altitude aside let's all come back down to the same conceptual level we can ask ourselves for instance what is healthy breathing and what is unhealthy breathing and t he first place we want ta tackle this is within the context of sleep when we go to sleep at night we continue to breathe that is no surprise if we did not we would die during sleep however there is a large fraction of the population that under breathes during sleep they are not taking deep enough or frequent enough breaths and therefore they are experiencing what is called sleep apnea they are becoming high toxic hypo toxic there is less oxygen being brought in to their system than is necessary people that are carrying excess hate either fat weight or muscle weight or both are more prone to nighttime sleep apnea however there are a lot of people who are not over weight who also experience sleep apnea how do if your experiencing sleep apnea will first of all excessive daytime sleepiness and excessive daytime anxiety combined with daytime sleepiness is one sign tat you might be suffering from sleep aphonia your thing is if you happen to snore it is very likely that you are experiencing sleep apnea and i should mention that sleep apnea is a very serious health concern it greatly increases the probability of a party of vascular event hart attack stroke it is a precursor or sometimes the direct cause of sexual dysfunction in mails and females cognitive dysfunction during the daytime it can exasperate the effects of dementia whether not age related dimension of the normal sort or claimer's type dimension which is an acceleration of a rely connive decline if your somebody who's had a dramatic brain injury if your experience in a lot of stress sleep apneas going to greatly disrupt the amount of oxygen brought ins your brain an body during sleep and is going to lead to a number of nighttime and daytime issues it is something that really needs to be addressed and will get into this a bit more later but since i raised it as a problem i do one to raise the solution one of the major treatments for sleep apneas that people get a seep hap device which is as am face mask in a machine that they will sleep with and while those can be very effective not everyone needs a seep hap one of the more common methods nowadays that is being used to treat sleep apnea which is purely behavioral in intervention and is essentially zero cost is that people are starting to shift deliberately to nasal breathing during sleep because of the additional resistance of nasal breathing and because of the fact that there is far less tendency if any if any souse me to snore when nasal breathing taping the maushut using medical tape prior to sleep excuse me putting medical type on the mouth prior to going to sleep and then sleeping all night with medical tape on the mouth is one way that people can learn to nasal breathe during sleep and can greatly offset a lot of sleep apnea snoring and sleep related issues number people do not want to or do not feel safe putting medical tape on their mouth prior to sleep for some reason they think they are gin a suffocate but of course you would wake up if you start to run out of air a at any moment that is not much to concern but what they will do is they will start to use pure nasal breathing during any type of exercise or even just for some period of time was king during the day or while working and again later will get into the enormous benefits of shifting to pure nasal breathing when not exercising hard meaning at a rate that you could normally hold a conversation although if your our nasal breathing you will not be holding that conversation or when simply doing work or on any number of things that are low intensity you can train your system to become a bed or nasal breather during the daytime through these deliberate actions of taking the mouthshutter just being conscious of keeping your mouth shut and that in addition having a number of positive health and aesthetic effects during the daytime is known to all transfer to night time breathing patterns and allow people to become nasal breathers as supposed to mouth breathers during sleep and to snore less and to have less sleep apnea again if you have severe sleep anna you proudly duty to check out a a sleep a sea pap you should talk your position but for people who have minor sleep apnea or sleep apnea that starting to take hold o these other methods of shifting to becoming a naval breather are going to be far more beneficial and farmer cost effective then going all the way to the see pap which by the way does not really teach you how to breathe properly as much as it does a just the air flow going into your system that is an important point that when you shift from mouth to naval breathing during sleep your actually learning and training your system to breathe properly and when i say learning and training your system to breathe properly what do i mean let us put some scientific and mechanistic meet on that we already talks about the irenic nerve this nerve that innervates the diaphragm in that allows for the longs to fill up because of the movement in the diaphragm what we did talk about however where the brain centers that actually control the phrenic nerve and control breathing knowing about these two brain areas and what they do is extremely important not just for understanding the content of this episode but for understanding all of the tools that will discuss and indeed your general health as it relates to respiration there are basically two areas of the brain that control breathing the first is called the rebutting or complex you do not have to worry about the name much just know that it was named after a bottle of wine and that it was discovered by the great jack headman who a professor of her science hat the university californium lost angels is one of the most fundamental discoveries and all of hero science and last hundred years or more because this brain area that jack and his colleagues discovered controls all aspects of breathing that are rhythmic that is when inhales follow exams follow inhales follow exhales that is all control by a small set of neurons in this brainstorm areas on the in round the region of the neck call the rebutting or complex and we really owe a dead of gratitude to jack and his colleagues for discovering that area because it is involved in everything from breathing when we are asleep to breathing when we are not thinking about our breathing it may have a roll in that is when it is function is disrupted it may cause things sudden infandesths in drum believe it or not it can explain in large part many of the deaths related to the opioid crisis because emotion is opioid sentinel and other sorts of drugs which are opioid obviously bind to opioid receptors on that structure and shut it down now keep in mind these neurons are designed to be incredibly robust and are designed to fire inhale exhale inhale exhale no matter if we are awake or aware unaware or sleep to keep us alive lexicon is opioid sentinel and drugs that are similar to that can shut down that structure because it is rich with these opioid receptors into it binds to that and it shuts off the prebutsinger complex which is the major cause of death of people who die from opioid overdoses the yulopul do not realize that they thing the pods must shut off the brain or shut down the heart now it shuts down breathing jack's discovery the no doubt will lead to some important things as it relates to addiction and a holly i think we frankly can expect that it is also going to eventually lead to ways to prevent death that in people using opioid or other types of drug may be by blocking opioid receptors in prebotsing or complex using things now redone et camera in any event prebutsinger complex is controlling inhale exhale inhale exhale patterns of breathing the other brain center controlling breathing again through the irenic nerve right it all converges and goes out through the trending nerve of these intercostal muscles is the called trifacial nucleus and the trifacial nucleus is involved in patterns of breathing where there is not an inhale followed by exhale inhale follow by email that is it is not rhythmic one than the other but rather where there is a doubling up of inhales are a doubling up of exhales or a deliberate pause in breathing inhale paws exhale paws inhale paws exhale paws this sort of thing a littlest later will talk about a pattern of breathing called box breathing which has o very specific and useful applications in particular for adjusting anxiety and in that case it involves going from rhythmic breathing of inhale inhale inhale exhale that is relying on the rebutting or complex neurons to reliance on the trifacial neucleasnerons and box breathing just to give away what is probably already obvious as you inhale hold exhale hold and repeat and that pattern of breathing even though it is rhythmic in nature because inhales precede exhales priced inhales an on there is a deliberate breath hold inserted there any time we are taking conscious control of our breathing the trifacial nucleus is getting involved now you do not have to assume the the trifacial nucleus's the only way in which we take conscious control of our breathing we can also take control of the prebutsinger complex you can do that right now french as you are breathing an some specific pattern not that unless you are speaking or eating no doubt is going to involve inhales followed by exhales b you could for instance decide that yes inhales are active and exhales are passive but now you are going to make the exhales active as well rather than just inhale and then let your lungs to late you could inhale and then force the air out that is going to represent a conscious taking over of control of the prebutsingor complex i the reason ism giving this mechanistic detail is a it is superimportant if you want to understand all the tools relate to breathing be it is chalk a pretty simple system even though the areas have fancy names presuming or trifacial it is pretty straightforward right you have one air that controls rhythmic breathing in helfollows tells and the other area which gets involved in breathing any time you start doubling up on in has or excels in fact the trifacial new place is the one that your relying on while you speak in order to make sure the still get enough oxygen it is also the one that you will use if you incorporate the physiological side or box breathing and frankly most of the time your using both of these circus or these brain systems trifacial and prebutsinger in parallel again biology loves parallel systems especially for things that are critical that if we did not do them we would die breathing and it make cense that we have two different brain structures that control this now you have an understanding the mechanical control of breathing that is the different parts within the parts list that involved in breathing everything from now to mauthto evilly the lungs et camera and the muscles involved and moving the lungs you understand i to think a bit about bringing oxygen in and removing carbondoxide but not much carbondoxide that you cannot actually use the oxygen that you have and about two brain centers one controlling rhythmic breathing and one that controls non rhythmic breathing i want to repeat something that i said alibi earlier as well which is that breathing is incredible because it represents the interface between conscious and subconscious control over your not just body not just your lungs but that how you breathe influences your brain state by using your brain consciously to control your breathing you are using your brain to control your brain the best way have ever heard this described was from a beautiful i should say now classic paper in the journal physiology publish in nineteen eighty eight from blustery known summon where the final line of their summery in to states the brain by regulating breathing controls its own excitability and just to remind those of you that do not remember what excitability is excitability is the threshold it which a given neuron nerves can be active or not when we breathe a certain way the neurons of our brain are more likely to get engaged they're more likely to be active and when we breathe in other ways our brain becomes harder to activate it is excitability is reduced now you might think excitability is a great thing you always want your brain to be excitable but that is i hall not the case and in fact that very statement the blustery known summer made led to a number of other investigations that we are really important in defining how if people over breathe that is if they hyper ventilate at rest they expel that is they hail too much carbondioxide what that classic paper by blustery owns sumption led to was a number of different investigations in humans looking at how different patterns of breathing impact the overall state of the brain end the ability of the brain to respond to certain whatare called sensory stimuli keep in mind they're brain is always active the neurons are firing at low level low level lo level but when you see something or her something or you want a focus on something or you want to exercise ore really listen to something or learn certain circuits in your brain need to be more active than everything else that is there needs to be really high what is called signal to noise there is always a lot of noise in chatter in the background just the the chatter at a oxtail party are a stadium event in order to really pay attention focus learn all the incredible things that the brain can do you need that signal to get above than noise there is a beautiful paper that asks how does the pattern of breathing in particular how does over breathing change the patterns of activity in the brain this is a paper entitled effects of voluntary hyper ventilation on cortical sensory responses and i will provide a link to the study in the shownote captions it is a somewhat complicated paper if you look at all the detailed analysis however the take away from this paper is exquisitely simple and i also believe incredibly important basically what it showed is that when people hyper ventilate they expel that is they hail more carbondioxide than they would normally they become what is called hypo panic of carbondoxide levels are low in the blood and over a short period of time they become low in the tissues of the body when that carbondoxide level drops low you would say o k well they're still bringing in a lot of oxygen because they're these people are hyper ventilating they should feel really alert and indeed that is what happens the people feel very alert however because they are not bringing enough carbonoxide in or rather the proper way to say t would be because there over breathing emailing too much they are not retaining or keeping in enough carbondioxide well then that lack of carbondioxide means that the oxygen that they are breathing in cannot be liberated from the hemoglobin cannot get to the brain and what they observe is about a thirty to forty per cent reduction in the amount of oxygen that is being delivered to the brain and the reduction an carbondoxide also prevent some of the normal patterns of azo dilation that the dilating the opening up a the capillaries again less blood flow but most importantly as it shown in this paper the brain overall becomes hyper excitable it is as if it is being starved of oxygen and blood flow and all the neurons in a very non specific ways start increasing their firing levels to the background activities getting louder and louder the rumbler the n rise of a crowd at a stadium and as a consequence the sensory input from a sound or from a touch or from some other event in the world does not get above the noise what this means is that when we hyper gently because we are not retaining enough carbondoxide we are not getting enough oxygen to the tissues that need oxygen and as a consequence of that the brain becomes hyper excitable we have sou know that there is an increase in anxiety and we become less good less efficient at detecting things in our environment we are not processing information as well at all the noise goes up and the signal goes down again incredibly important set of findings i should also mention that hyper ventilation is one way that in the laboratory anyway or in neuron surgery unites for some time physicians would evoke seizure in seizure prone patients the real on that works is exactly the explanation i just gave you seizure is a hyper excitability the brain not enough inhibition or suppression of the over all circuitry you get these waves are these storms of electrical activity low levels of carbondoxide in the brain because of low levels of carbondoxide in the blood are one of the major triggers for seizures now i realize that most people listening to this are not epileptic but none the less this brings us all back to this question of what is normal healthy breathing s i mention before normal healthy breathing is breathing about six leaders of air per minute but of course most of just do not think in terms of leaders of air when i can go measure our long capacity at least most of us are not going to do that basically if you are taking relatively shallow breaths and you are just sitting there working or make even walking slowly get not talking are engaging in any kind of speech or eating chances are six leaders of air per minute is about twelve shallow is breaths and when i say shallow i do not mean breathing low running habit or something that i just mean we do not casually breathing in out in out the studies that hove explored the breathing patterns in a large populations of individuals who are not suffering necessarily from any one specific ailment have shown that most people breathe far too much per minute that their engaging in anywhere from fifteen to twenty or even thirty shallow breaths permit they are vastly over breathing relative to how they should be breathing now of course if you breathe more deeply you take a vigorous in out and then you expel that air well then for to get six leaders of air in your system per minute you are probably only going to need somewhere between for and six breaths in order to get that six leaders terminate now the total time that it takes to do that in had and exile is not that much longer than a k of shallow b death provided you are not deliberately breathing quickly during those shallow breaths then you say well how is it that normal healthy breathing that delivers the appropriate amount of carbondoxide into the system and does not expel does not exile too much carbonoxide now how we spurt to do that normal breathing and ow useless to breathe four times than hold your breath until the minute passes no what you find is that the correct pattern of breathing is going to involve two things first of all nasal breathing because of the resistance at providesthrough the nose we talked about earlier is going to deliver more oxygen into your s you are going to be able to generate more air pressure to fill your lungs that greater air pressure is going to take longer to exile already we are increasing the amount of time that each breath is going to take and also what you find is that people that are breathing in the proper healthy manner that is that are balancing oxygen and carbonoxide in the proper ways are also taking pauses between breaths this is extremely important because even though we have a brain center the preboutsing your complex that can control or uses a does control in hale exile rhythmic breathing those pauses between breaths are not always present in fact often are not present from people's baseline breathing patterns as as a consequence they overbreathe and as i told you before when people overbreathe the brain becomes hyper excitable at the level of the background noise and yet they are less efficient at detecting and learning information we will get into the specific studies that rely illustrate the learning aspect of it later but they are less efficient at detecting and learning information at focusing and on as a consequence of this overreaching and the hypericcide ability that causes now of course that is also just emphasizing the effects of overreaching and lack of carbondoxide on the brain there are hundreds if not thousands of studies showing that when we do not have enough carbondoxide in the tissues of our body that is also problematic for all the tissues the liver the lungs themselves the stomach et camera that relate largely to shifts in p h because of the fact that carbondoxide strongly regulates the acidity alkalinity of the blood and the tissues that that blood supplies nutrients to including carbonoxide the basic take away here is you want to breathe in healthy manner at least and the best way to do that is to spend some time and it does not take much may be a minute or each day paying attention to how quickly you are breathing terminate when you are simply at rest when you are making coffee in the morning when you are sitting down to read when you are on social media chronically holding your breath is not good but neither is overreaching and again every study that is examined the typical patterns of breathing and patterns of breathing that show up as normal and abnormal has found that more often than not during the night time people are underbreathing and in the daytime they are overreaching their hyper ventilating next i to address what you can do about your normal patter is of breathing that is how you or any one can adjust their normal patterns of breathing from an unhealthy to an unhealthy state but the first thing we have to do of course is determined whether not your already breathing in an unhealthy or in a healthy way and again when i say heal the you are unhealthy i mean are you over breathing are you underbreathing are you delivering the appropriate ratios of oxygen and carbondoxide to the tissues of your brain and body in order to do this we arguing to do a simple test again please do not do the well driving or operating heavy machinery or on near water of any kind but assuming that yore not doing any of those things i encourage you to sit down certainly not lie down but just sit down suppose you also to do it standing and we are going to do what is called the carbondioxide tolerance test the carbondioxide tolerance test is i sort of back of the envelope measure of how well you are managing carbon dioxide that is how well you con control your breathing at both the mechanical and the chemical level it is a very simple test we you're going to do is for the next ten seconds or while ism speaking you are just going to breathe normally now again and again throughout this episode ism going to encourage you to be a nasal breather whenever possible but of course there are instances in which you want to engage mouth breathing but for the time being as i continue to blab on for the next few seconds just inhale through your nose exhale through your nose you do not have to deliberately slow your breathing or increase the cadence of your breathing however in that time you are also going to want to find some sort of time measuring device could be your phone ore could be a stop watch what ism going to ask you to do in a few minutes is ism going to ask you to inhale through your nose as deeply as you possibly can that is you are going to fill your lungs as much as you can through your nose and then start a timer and measure how long it takes for you to deliberately control that hail until your lungs are empty case this is going to be a controlled exhale through the nose after a big deep breath but for the time being keep breathing at a and of calm regular cadence you can find that time measuring device now or you can come back to it later if you when i say inhale you are going to inhale as deeply as you can through your nose remembering that the diaphragm can really help you here to get a deep inhale by having your belly move out while you inhale and then when i say start youregin a measure the time that it takes to do a complete lungs empty hail in fact it'll measure it for you a this will be one of the rare instances in this podcast where an there is going to be along period of silence as i measure something have got a stop watch here please prepare to do the big inhale and start inhaling now inhale as deeply as you can through your nose fill your lungs as much as you can toque now start meaning slowly control the exhale through your knows you are trying to let that air out as slowly as possible and ism just on o call out every ten or fifteen seconds or and you want to note when your lungs are empty i know you can hold your breath with your lungs empty that is not an accurate measure fifteen seconds it is important that you note when your lungs are empty and that you are trying to control the hail as much as possible that you do not arrive at that lungs empty time too quickly it'll explain what too quickly means thirty seconds for those of you that have already reached lungs empty please go back to breathing normally for those of you that have not and hanging here a little longer if you are still discarding that i forty five seconds and we are rounding toward a minute not quite the some of you are probably still letting out that air i want to point out none of this has to do with cardiovascular fitness level at least not in any kind of direct way and sixty seconds and i realize there will be a small subset of you out the that are still expelling your air in a slow lungs a slow email manner through the knows o case or what we just did is a back of the envelope carbondioxide discard rate o k if you need to pause this and go back and try it again just want a time how long it takes you to go from lungful to lungs empty again with the full understanding i know that you can all sit there beasts and hold your breath you are lungs empty but please do not do that because that is not gin been formative for what ism telling you now when ism n tell you now is that if it took you twenty seconds or less to expel all your air that is you could not extend that email longer than twenty seconds in a kind of back of the envelope way you we can say that you have relatively brief or low carbondoxide tolerance if it took you somewhere between twenty five and forty may be forty five seconds to expel all your air that is you could control that hail for about forty five second or thirty seconds then you have a moderate level of carbondoxide tolerance and if for instance you ware able to go up fifty seconds or longer for that discard until you hit lungs empty you have a fairly high degree of carbondoxide tolerance now here is the deal if you had low carbondoxide tolerance that is you are twenty seconds or less you are going to right down the number three o k if you had moderate levels of carbondoxide tolerance you are going to write down the number five or you could even put five to six and then if you are in that bracket of people that was able to discard your air over a period of fifty seconds or more you are going to write down the number eight to ten o k now what are these numbers what are we talking about and before we get into what to do with these numbers i want emphasize again this does not have to do with fitness level per say i know some world class try athletes that have very fast carbondoxide blow off times that is their discard rates are twenty seconds or lest i should also point out that if your very strait that number is going to be very small if you are very relax you spoke up after an long night of sleep and you feel great that number is going to be extended case this is a back of the envelope measure that you are going to use each time you decide to do the exercise i men i tell you about in a moment and the exercise i ma tell you about in a moment can be done every day if you but what the most interesting studies at least to me indicate is that you could do the exercise it'll tell you about even just once or twice a week and greatly improve your efficiency of breathing and shift yourself away from overreaching when at rest even if you are not thinking about higher breathing at rest o can what is this exercise hell you just got your number other low medium or hihbracet number for carbonate dioxide discarded rate member if you are in the low category your numbers three if your medium it is five to six and if you are in the long carbondoxide discarded rate long duration carbonado ad discard rate that is eight to ten is your number now you are going to do two minutes of what most people would call box breathing what is box breathing box breathing are equal duration inhale hold exhale hold repeat in hail hold hail hold sounds very easy rite how long do you inhale and then hold hail and then hold well you now know if you were in the low group of carbonado idea discard rate you are inhales can be three seconds your hold will be three seconds your hail will be three seconds and then you repeat three seconds each sides the box if you will is can be three seconds long if you ware in the moderate carbonado idea discarded rate category then you are going to inhale for five to six seconds hold for five to six hail for five to six hold for five to six repeat for about two minutes you could do three minutes if you want but i think it is important to have protocols that are feasible for most people and that is going to mean doing things for about two to five minutes when it comes to these breath rehabilitation exercises for restoring normal breathing and then course if you were in the long category of carbondoxide discarded rate you should be able to do in eight to ten second inhale eight to ten second hold eight to ten second hail eights its tend second hold and repeat of you could do that exercise now if you or you could do it at some point offline you can pause this podcast if you want and go try it that is an exercise that you can do for about two to three minutes once or twice per week what is happening when you do that exercise well first of all you are greatly increasing your curl mechanical control over the diaphragm this very important most people are not aware of this frantic nerve pathway in the diaphragm and your greatly in increasing your mechanical control over this pathway through the process we call negro plasticity when you deliberately focus on a aspect of your nervous system control an particular nervous system control over musculature that normally is subconscious pandour not paying attention to when you actively take control of that it requires that your brain adjust and rewire the relationship between the different components of that circuit and the wonderful thing is that has been shown to lead to changes in your resting pattern of breathing now why did we go through the whole business of doing the carbondoxide tolerance just well for people who do not tolerate carbonado it very well they do not have very good phrenic that is nor mechanical control of the diaphragm for whatever reason again does not mean your not fit it just means you do not have or you have not yet developed nor mechanical control o the diaphragm it is would be near impossible for you to do box breathing for two or three minutes with eight seconds in eight seconds hold eight seconds exile eight second hold that is why we do a a test to see what your capable of doing you do not want the to breathing to be too strained were you where your really challenge should get around the whole box you want it to be relatively easy because remember your trying to translate thispattern to your normal pattern of breathing that is your pattern er breathing when you're not conscious you thinking about breathing and what are we really translating when we do this box breathing type exercise what you are translating is the ability to pause between breast and yet take full mechanically driven breast that involve the frantic nerve and diaphragm again you are encouraging especially v use nasal breathing when you do the box breathing you are encouraging irenic control over the diaphragm and your getting that six leaders of air terminate or using fewer and fuel breath over time this is a again zero cost although it does cost a little bit of time zero cost approach to adjusting your normal pattern of breathing at rest which has a huge number of positive outcomes in terms of your ability to stay relatively calm to not get the hypricideability of the brain it is actually been shown and a various studies will talk about one in particular later to greatly improve notches levels of calm and reduce bouts of street but also improve night time sleep there are huge number of benefits that can come from doing this box breathing exercise but you got a get the duration of the sides of the box right and that is what you do the carbondoxide tolerance test one thing that many people notice after doing the carbondoxide tolerance test even just once and then doing this box breathing exercise once or twice a week is that after two or three weeks the box breathing itself becomes very easy and in that case i recommend taking the carbondoxide tolerance test over again and almost always what you will find is that you have been able to extend your carbondoxide discarded rate and therefore you now fall into a different category not just the lower medium but the long carbondoxide discarded rate category and you are able to extend the duration of those inhale hold exhale holds during the box breathing and of course the ultimate benefit of all this is that it translates to deeper and yet less frequent breathing when at rest and when not consciously paying attention to how your breathing during the daytime again if a all possible do all of this breathing through the nose for those of you that have a severely included nose the recommendation always is to breathe through your nose more but i do realize that for some people its really uncomfortable to breathe trough the nose because they have such an included nasal pathway and a for you folks doing some of this breathing through the mouth can probably a suffice but if at all possible do the breathing through the nose and a please also let me know how your progress revolves over time with the carbonoxide discarded rate and the box breathing and of course the positive shifts that occur in normal unconscious daytime breathing translate to all the opposite things that we talked about when you are overreaching during the daytime what i just described in terms of the carbondoxid tolerance test and the exercise using box breathing to restore normal patterns of breathing and not overbreathe and therefore not eliminate to much carbondoxide is exactly the two tests that were incorporated into a study that my laboratory did in collaboration with our associate share of psychiatry ate stamphorid school medicine doctor avid eagle was also been a guest on this podcast previously and that study explored box breathing but it also explored other forms of breathing and actually compared those forms of deliberate breathing to meditation as a means to explore what are going to be the minimal effective doses and most effective ways to chronically reduce stress around the clock and improve mood and improve sleep the study on referring to was just published recently it is entitled brief structured respiration practices in hansemood and reduce physiological arousal we will also provide a link to this paper in the shownote captions what the study really focused on was a simple question which is what is the shortest and most effective practice that people can use in order to reduced their levels of stress noxious during that breastwork practice or meditation practice but around the clock twenty four hours a day including improvements in sleep and we were excited to do the study because many studies that explored how meditation or in some cases fewer studies at explored how breastwork can impact different brain states or bodily states but very few studies that explored how those breathworkor meditation practices influenced body brain states around the clock when people were not performing the particular meditation or breastwork practice the reason we were able to do this study was really fortunate a the folks over it whoop were generous enough to donate bunch of whoop straps which allowed us to measure heartbeat variability a number of other different physiological parameters we also got subjective reports about people's mood an feelings of well being we got data about their sleep pined to us from remote locations these people rather than being brought to the laboratory an being in a very artificial circumstance the laboratory as much as we to think our laboratory is realistic i we have virtual reality and tings that there is nothing as realistic as the real world and we were able to have more than a hundred subjects out in the real world living their real lives pinging back to us data all the time twenty four hours a day that we could measure how their different interventions that we asked them to do breastwork practices or meditation practices were impacting physiological parameters and they were also in forming us regularly about their subjective mood et camera we got a lot of data as you can imagine and the basic take away from the study was twofold first of all we discovered that deliberate breastwork practices done for about five minutes per day across the course of about a month led to greater reductions in stress then did a five minute a day meditation practice now that is not to say that meditation is not useful in fact there are dozens if not hundreds of papers including one particular i should the particularly dutiful study from when syzuki's lab at new york university showing that a daily ten to thirteen minute mindfulness meditation practice can greatly improve focus memory and a number of other things related to cognition and learning however the research on meditation has shown us that meditation at least short meditations mainly lead to improvements in focus in memory not much reductions in strassal though they do lead to reductions in stress will we found was that any number of different breastwork practices and we explored three done for five minutes a day out performed meditation in terms of the ability of breastwork to reduce stress around the clock compared to meditation the three types of breastwork that we explored also show different effects i should mention the three types of breastwork that we compared were box breathing of the sort that you just learned about we compared that to something called cyclic singing which involves two inhale through the nose to get maximiliinflated lungs followed by a long exhale it'll return to that in a moment that was repeated for five minutes at a time for each cession and a third breastwork practice which was cyclic my preventilation which as the name suggests involves people inhaling deeply through the nose than exhaling passively through the mouth and then repeating inhale through the nose exhale through the mouth repeating that for twenty five cycles one cycle being an inhale end an exile that equals one cycle repeat that for twenty cycles than exhaling all their air and holding their breath with lungs empty for about fifteen to thirty seconds and then repeating inhale exile cyclihyperoventilation for the duration of five minutes was people were divided into these different groups either mindfulness meditation where they sat they were not told to control their breathing in any says vice way that closed their eyes their focus their attention on a region just behind their forehead one group to that the other group did cyclic sawing another group did box breathing another group did cyclic hyperventilation as any sort of clinical trial this ought to we then swap people into different group they served as their own control we could evaluate any and a between and within individual variability gan there lot of date on this paper but the take away was that for the sake of stress reduction around the clack and for the sake of improving sleep and mood the most effective practice of the fore practices that we examined it was the cyclic sighing again cyclic sighing as performed the following way you inhale through the nose as deeply as you can then you do a second inhale immediately afterwards to trying maximallyinflate the lungs in fact that is what happens we know that during that second inhale even if it is just a very sharp short inhale the extra physical vigor that is required to generate that second inhale causes those vile of the lungs which may have collapsed and indeed in between breaths and often even just through the course of the day in a special if we get stressed those aviolyvef the lung starts it collapse and because their damp on the inside their they have elicit of fluid that a balloon with a l a bit of fruit in in the middle it takes a little bit of physical force to put to pop those open i you not literally exploding them pop but your reinstating them with air and then you perform the long exhale through the mouth until lungs are empty it looks exactly this now we know that one single physiological sigh of the sort that i just described perform to any time of day under any conditions whether not you breakout to walk on stage to give a talk or you are in a meeting in your feeling stress or you're in a conversation that is very stressful or you can feel stress mounting because you are traffic or any number of psychological or physical stresses that may be approaching you or you feel our oppressing you doing one physiological sigh of the sort that i just described is the fastest physiologically verified way that we are aware of to reduce your levels of stress and to reintroduce calm that is to shift your autonomic nervous system from a state of heighten levels of autonomic arousal that is sympathetic nervous system as it is called is at a higher activation level than the call part sympathetic nervous system again sympathetic nervous system having nothing do as sympathy as everything to do with called fight or flight a though it controls other things do including positive arousal and the para sympathetic nervous system often referred to as the rest in digest system although it does other things to is associate with calming those two things are always in kind of pushball with one another a sea saw or pushball hover one to think about it one physiological side meaning that big deep inhale short second inhale also though the nose and then long exile to completely lungs empty is known to restore the level of balance in the sympathetic part sympathetic curl circuitry's and is the fastest way to reintroduce calm that is one physiological side in this study what we asked was that people perform that repeatedly called cyclic sighing for the duration of five minutes and the people who did that cyclic sighing for five minutes a day regardless of the time of day that they did it experience the greatest reductions in stress not just during the practice but around the twenty four hour cycle an it translated again to all sorts of positive subjective changes improvements in sleep lower resting heart rate at all times of day this is important again this study was not just exploring what happens during meditation or breath work cyclic sighing et camera it was exploring how the changes that occur during that practice translate to changes in breathing and heart rate mood et camera throughout the twenty four hour cycle the take away here is twofold first of all if your somebody who wants to improve your mood and reduce your over all levels of stress and you only have five minutes a day to invest in that hope full your doing all the other things try to get proper sleep and exercise social connection nutrition et camera sunlight in the morning of course cannot leave that out but if you were going to devote five minutes a day to a stress reduction practice that is now supported by data to translate to reductions and stress around the clock the day to say that you would want to invest that in cyclic going that is double hail through the nose extended hail through the mouth until your lungs er empty than repeat for five minutes a day you of course if you could do meditation it still had positive effects meaning it reduce stress although not as much as cycle i singing you could do box breathing if you want for the purpose of reducing stress all the practices we explored did reduce stress but cyclic sighing perform for five minutes a day had the most robust in pervasive effect in reducing stress improving mood and improving sleep that is the first message of the study the second take away is that one physiological sigh that is right just one physiological sigh where you inhaul deeply through the nose another inhaul through the nose to maximal plate the oriole the lungs and then you hail to completely lung's empty and then go back to normal breathing is the fastest way to introduce a level of calm and to reduce your over all levels of stress in real time and this is very important i think that out there these days we hear a lot about stress reduction techniques and most all of the stress reduction techniques that's been explored everything from massage to meditation to breath work a to a hot shower out to a foot rub will calm you down the question is due they calm you down just during that practice great if it does but does it also translate to reduce levels of stress at other times in the twenty four hour cycle and other plosive effects as well one physiological size a very efficient way to a just that ratio of sympathetic to parasympathetic activation and immediately bring about calm a s excellent for real time control of stress the other thing about physiological size is that it is not a hack it is not the application of a breathing practice to something that it was not intended for in fact physiological size we are not discovered by me at all they were discovered by physiologists in the nineteen thirties who found that when people underbreathe they have a build up of carbondoxide an their system and even though carbondoxide is essential for life you do not want too much of it in your system and that people whether not they were sleep or awake would engage of physiological size spontaneously subconsciously the would do this double inhaul through the nose and extended exile through the mouth and that did not just eliminate excess of carbondoxide from the system it also rebalanced the oxygen carbondoxide ratio in the proper ways in fact it is observed in animals you might see this in animals that are tired when animals or humans get tired they tend to start underbreathing a little bit and that can often disrupt the balance of caronoxide an oxygen and right before a dog will go down for a nap for instant you will notice that he'll do this double in hill exile people when they are sleeping if they hold their breath for a period of time which frankly all of us do periodically throughout sleep they will engage of spontaneous physiological she during the daytime we are often holding our breath especially nowadays and there's a study on this an that we will talk about obit later where when people ten message or there emailing although nowadays people are are mainly on social medium ten mesygen they often are holding their breath they will follow a breath hold by a physiological size because during that breath hold their building up the level of carbondoxide in their system now mind you i spend close to half an hour telling you that most people are overreaching at rest and that is also true but people often will shift from overreaching to underbreathing which is a terrible pattern physiological size done either as a one off one physiological side to clamp stress are reduce stress in real time or repeatedly over five minutes as a practice that you do each day is going to be not just the most effective way to approach reducing stress around the clock and in real time but also the one that is highly compatible with the way that the nerd circuits the control breathing were decide the physiological size has some other very useful applications one of the more a i would say useful ones at least to those of you that exercise is going to be the use of physiological size in order to remove the called side stitch you've ever been running or swimming or exercising you felt a cramp on your right side chances are despite what your hyghschope coach told you that raising your arms above your head or drinking less water before you exercise is not going to get rid of that cramp and here is why it is not a cramp at all if you recall the cervical three four and five nerves that give rise to the phrenic nerve and go down and innervate your diaphragm well as i mention before a certain number of those nerve fibers actually course into the diaphragm and go up underneath and it you recall earlier i all o said that the diaphragm sits right on top of the liver in other words you actually have sensory innervation of the diaphragm the deep diaphragm and the liver and there something called reference to pain which is what people generally experience when they have that side stitch on their right and side if forever exercising in you feel a cramp on your right hand side it is possible that it is a genuine cramp but more likely is the fact that that relic nerve sensory innervation is now being carried up to your brain and you are detecting some local or reference to pain in the liver and in the diaphragm now that does not necessarily mean your doing anything wrong although you might not be breathing properly for running at that moment and that is what gave rise to it could be some spamming of the phrenic nerve or some inefficient breathing during running with an entire series on fitness with doctor and galloping one of those episodes included lot of information on breathing it was the episode on endurance although breathing was a topic that was thread through multiple episodes in that series you can find that series that huborman label to calm take a lot about how to breathe during running how to create during weight lifting et camera but the point for now is that if ever your experiencing that right side side stitch i incurve you to perform the physiological side and the good news as you can perform it while still running or while still swimming although i suppose was swimming you might have to i make some adjustments a because of course you don't want in had water er while cycling or any type of activity if you would perform that physiological side generally two or three times what will occur is that because of changes in the firing of the irenic nerve and in particular because of changes in the sensory feed back from the sensory component of the irenic nerve back to the brain you will experience an alleviation of the pain from that right side side stitch another word you can get rid of side cramps doing physiological side during activities in particular during running activities now i should also mention that if you are experiencing a side stitch on the left side chances are that has to do with excessive air or fluid in your stomach and there are reasons for that that also have to do with the way that the irenic nerve is its bi lateral and branches to both sides and is catching sensory in put on the left side from some of the local organ s and sensory innervation of those organs my but if you have right side side stitch the physiological side done two or three times while still running ought to release that side stitch now as long as were talking about breathing and the phrenic nerve in the relationship between the phrenic nerve and your liver and your stomach and some of the other organs in that neighborhood we should talk about the relationship between breathing and hart rate this is an incredibly important topic much that i perhaps should have brought it up at the beginning of the episode but none the less you now know what your diaphragm does right when you inhale your diaper moves down that is right when you contract your diaphrament moves down it create space for your longs to whale an when you exhale your diphase moves up well when you inhale and your diaphragm moves down what happens is there is more space created in the thoracic cavity and particular if your also breathing deeply and you are using those intercostal muscles to expand your ribs as a consequence the heart actually gets a little bit bigger it is a temporary in argument in the heart but it is a real enlargement and as a consequence whatever blood is in the heart is now in a larger volume cause the hart got bigger and as a consequence that blood is moving more slowly through that larger volume for a short period of time but none the less it is moving more slowly your nervous system detects that and sends a normal signal to the heart to speed the heart rate up in other words inhales increase heart rate the opposite is true when you exhale when you exhale your diaphragm moves up your rib cage tends to move inward a bit and you compact the heart you reduce the volume of the heart over all when you reduce the volume of the heart over all blood flow through the heart accelerates because it is a smaller volume giving you a blood is o move more quickly through that small volume your nervous system detects that and sends a signal to slow the heart down just as inhales speed the heart up exhales slow your heart rate down now of course even though you can double up on inhales ore even triple up on inhales sooner or later if you inhale you can have to exhale right and the converse is also true of course what is this mean in terms of controlling your heart rate well it say you are going in for a blood draw or your going out on stage in your stress while i would encourage you to do a physiological size may be too physiological size to bring your level of calm up in your level of straits down none the less if you have any reason why you want to quickly reduce your heart rater accelerate your heart rate forsake of physical work out put or to calm yourself down additionally not just use the physiological size well then you can take advantage of this relationship between inhales an exhales controlling heart rate if you want to increase your heart rate you can simply inhale longer and more vigorously relative to your exhales and if you want to decrease your heart rate well then you are going to make your exhales longer and or more vigorous than your inhales in fact this process which is called respiratory sins a rhythm is the basis of what we call heart rate very ability harry verybilding inhales the vaguest nerve the tenth cranial nerve which is a part sympathetic nerve that is associate with the calming aspect of the autonomic nervous system slowing your heart rate down by extending your exhales and it really forms the basis of most all breathing practices if you look at any breathing practices whether not whimhoff breathing tumor breaking cundolining breathing pronto o breathing physiological sighing cyclic singing and on and on and on if you were to measure the ratio of inhales to exhales and the vigor of inhales to exhales what youwould far in is that each one would create a net increase or a net decrease in heart rate that could be very accurately predicted by whether or not that breathing practice emphasized inhales emphasized exhales or had those two features inhale and exhale be of equal duration and intensity in fact if you wanted to equilibrate your heart rate what you would do is you would do boxbreath n because inhale hold exhale hold is by definition creating equal duration inhales an exhales of essentially equivalent vigor when you do a physiological she our doing too big inhales which i con speed your heart rate up just a obit within a long extended exhale the exhale in the end is much longer than the two inhales even when combined and you get a net decrease in hart ate the calming effect and then practices such as too breathing or whimhoff breathing or cyclic hyper ventilation deep inhales an exhales the inhales are more vigorous compared to the more passive exhales are going to lead to increases in heart rate gets the relationship between breathing and heart rate is an absolutely late one where your heart rate follows your breathing your heart rate and your breathing are in intimate discussion with one another but where always an forever your inhales increase your heart rate your exhales decrease it now this feature which physicians call respiratory sciences ay rhythm or we sometimes here about more often nowadays as heart rate versatility is something that people in sport have known about for a very long time it is why for instance that marksman will exhale just prior to taking a shot that is particularly true for people that compete in the biathlon where they cross country sees of the heart rate is up up up up up than they will get to the point where they actually have to shoo to a tartan they will exhale and then they will they will shoot the target this is also why for instance if you want o bring your hart rate down very quickly between rounds of marshal arts their number different ways to do that but an extended exhale of any kind or frankly any breathing practice that emphasizes exhales is going bringer heart rate down this been incorporated in number different contacts including sport military it is also now being incorporated in the clinical contacts for people who feel a panic attack coming on ism very gratified to learn that the physiological size is now being explored as a tool to prevent panic attack and anxiety attack this is prior to the panic attack people bringing their part rate down again though those extended exhales learning to extend your exhale is really a terrific skill to master and it is very easy skill to master frankly why do i say a kill will remember what i said earlier which is that humans inhale actively and most typically will passively exhale just let the air drop out of them at whatever rate depending on how much air they inhaled actively exhaling that is actively relaxing the diaphragm and actively relaxing those intercostal muscles of the chest those one at ere i should say of between the ribs is e skill that you can very quickly acquire and will allow you to use that relationship between the frantic nerve the diaphragm the size of the heart t the heart volume and all that stuff to really take control of heart rate quickly that if you feel your heart is racing too much and frankly a lot of people have a lot of what is called interceptive awareness specie anxious people they can really sense what is going on in their body other people less i on my on my heart's beating is the rip had end jump out of my chest and i do not that do not that big long exhale does not matter if you do it through the nose or the mouth big long exhales can allow you to slow your heart rate down let us talk about hiccups everybody experiences hiccups from time to time think most peoplewould agree that one hiccup sort of funny two hiccups in a row is really funny and three hiccups in a row is where it starts to be concerning in part because hiccups can be kind of painful experience pain in your got your a lower abdomen and sumdiyes in your chest is well if feel's kind of intrusive it gets in the way of having conversation or just sitting there in relaxing fortunately there is a simple way to get rid of hiccups and you can arrive at that simple technique if you understand a little bit about what gives rise to hiccups the reason we get hiccups at all is because we experience a spasm of the phrenic nerve the frantic nerve as you recall is a nerve that emanates from the cervical region to be specific see three fore an five those spinal nerves go down course behind the heart and innervate the diaphragm which is the muscle that when it contracts it moves down allows along to fill and then when you relax the diaphragm then the diaphragm moves up and the longs shrinker they expel air called exhalation now the frantic nerve also has that sensory branch it is not just involved in controlling the diaphragm at the motor level it is also sensing things deep within the diaphragm and in the liver as well as the livers it is right below the diaphragm a hiccup has that painful sensation from time to time because there is a rapid sensory feed back or a signal rather of a sharp and of sensation of contraction within the diaphragm and that is relaid back to the brain and you consciously perceive that as a little bit of pain and then of course the hiccup is the the hiccup which is the spasm yo the phrenic nerve the experience more less in your throat but all this really is happening along the frantic nerve and toward the diaphragm what this all means is that if you can stop the frantic nerve from spamming you can stop hiccups there are a lot of approaches that people have tried to take to eliminate spamming of the forensic nerve you will hear that you breathing into a bag which is one way to you re ingest or re inhale carbondoxide that otherwise would be expelled out into the firemen can help that is a very indirect method i rarely works frankly because it is really has to do more with adjusting your breathing to try and adjust the activity the phrenic nerve it is a really roundabout way of trying to a alleviate hiccups some people will experience relief from drinking from a glass of water from the opposite side of the glasses or have to tilt over at the ways it is a kind of messy approach again it does not tend to work a lot of the time for some people at works every time but for most people it does not work at all however there is a technique that can reliably eliminate hiccups and it is the technique that takes advantage of hyper contracting the phrenic nerve over a short period of time that it then subsequently relaxes or alleviates the spamming of the forensic nerve and that simple method is to inhale three times in a row this is a very unusual pattern of breathing but what involves is taken big deep inhale through your nose then before you exhale any air take a second inhale through the nose however brief that inhale might be and then a third even micro or mill a second long inhale through your nose to get that third inhale and then hold your breath for about fifteen to twenty seconds and then slowly hail even though ism not experiencing any hiccups right now i will demonstrate the method for eliminate hiccups the you've all clear on how to do it my here i go o ka it is three inhales all through the nose and it is true that that second and third inhale take some physical effort to really get additional air into the lungs without exhaling first it feels it the only way i can describe it really is as a sharp second and third inhale cops you really have to engage the musculature of those intercostal muscles in the diaphragm in order to do it and then that long exhale can be through the nose orgy the mouth but i find it particularly relaxing or even pleasant to do it through the nose this method of three inhales through the nose followed by a long hail through the nose or mouth will eliminate hiccups right away because what it does is it hyper i cites the irenic nerve three times in a row a very unnatural pattern for the frantic nerve to fire and then it undergoes a hyper polarization as we call it in which the frantic nerve actually stands a much lower probability of getting activated again for some period of time afterwards it is important the you try in return to normal cadets of breathing after doing this three inhales followed by the long hail if you need to perform it a second time in order to eliminate hiccups because there simply not going away that is fine you can do that but as far as we know this is the most efficient and science supported way to eliminate hiccups now up until now have been talking about breathing techniques and have mainly focus on breathing techniques that emphasize the hail whether notes the carbonoxid tolerance test whether or not it is cyclic sighing or the physiological side that use in real time to reduce stress one thing that we have been talked about much is cyclic hyperventilation sickly hyper ventilation as you recall is about of twenty five or breath inhaling deeply through the nose and then passively exhaling or sometimes actively exhaling typically through the mouth it might look this that is a very active inhale through the nose and expel through the mouth it can also be done active inhalthrough the nose passive exhale through the mouth in any event that pattern of breathing repeated for ten to twenty five breaths greatly increase is levels of autonomic araks in fact it is known to deploy a adrenalin from the adrenals and in our study we had people then expel all their air breathe out hold their breath for fifteen to thirty seconds and then repeat for a period of five minutes that did lead to some very interesting and positive physiological changes in terms of stress mitigation although not as significant as was observed with cyclic sighing as i talked about earlier now there is a lot of interest in cyclichyper ventilation forsake of for instance extending breath holds this is become popular in part because the call d whim off method which is a method that combines breathing cyclichyperoventilation followed by lungful or lungs empty breathholds depending on which variant of the whimhoff method one is using separately and i really want emphasize separately thug whimhoff method also involves deliberate cold exposure which is all if ism a big than and we have done episodes this pod cast on n we have tool gets on deliberate cold exposure for creasing dopamine levels a an veteran levels a mean system function et camera whimhoff method also in corporate that and it has a mindfulness component an you want a caution people that any time you are doing cyclichyperoventilation you want to be very cautious about not doing it in or near water because it does greatly increase the risk of shall or water black out and that is because when you do cyclicyperoventilation you are expelling your exhaling more carbondioxide than usual and what i have not told you yet is that the trigger to breathe is actually and increase in carpbondioxide when i mean by that is you have a small set of neurons in your brain stem that can detect when carbondoxide levels in your blood stream reach a certain level and when they reach that level they trigger the gas reflects and or the hunger for breathing in other words we do not breathe because we crave oxygen although we do need oxygen of course an or just survive and for our brain to function or bodily organs to function but our brain is wired such that it has a threat cense or which is carbondoxide levels are getting too high and that is what triggers the motor reflects to breathe and to in some cases gasp for air depending on how starved for air we are if you do cyclichyperoventilation whether not whimhoff method or whether or not it is too method again these things are similar there not exactly the same there are other breathing methods that incorporate cyclicyperovenintilation w you're doing as you are getting rid of a lot of carbondoxide and therefore your removing the impulse or lowering the impulse to create that when you enter that breathhold phase after the hyperventilation it is a much longer period of time before you feel the anxiety and the hunger in the impulse to breathe that is one of the real benefits of any technique that incorporate cyclicyperoventilation is that rather than red ss your stress level in real time it actually does the opposite it increases your stress level increases your level autonomic arousal but your doing it deliberately and then during those breath holds what is happening as you have a lot of a adrenaline circulating in your system because of the way the hyperventilation triggers the release of a adrenaline from your renal glands it also triggers the release of epinephrin which is the same as a adrenalin from an lobranarical locus serum's which makes you feel more alert and then during those breath holds and in the subsequent rounds of cyclicyperoventilation people experience what it is to have a lot of a adrenalin in their system but they are controlling the release of that adrenaline which is far an away different than when life events are thing that a adrenaline what it really is is a form of self induced stress and ovulation and i do think there are benefits to practising cyclicyperoventilation because it does allow you to learn how to self deploy a adrenaline and epinefron from locus sedulous and from the adrenals write got that backwards a adrenaline from your adrenals an eponepron from locus serious and it allows you to explore what it is to main tain calm state of mind in body when you have a lot of a adrenaline in your system which certain studies are starting to show can allow people to be able to lean in to the stressful aspects of life and lets bones life is stressful in any event ow we are all going to experience stress at some point or another and when we do we want to make sure that we are not overtake by the release of a adrenaline from the adrenals that sudden surge of epinpron from locusrulius doing cystic cyperovenilation be one or two times per week again twenty five breasts active nihil passive or active exhale do expect to feel tingly because of that reduction and carbonoxide from sailing much do expect to feel lobiagitated be very careful doing this of your somebody who has anxiety attacks or somebody who has panic attacks or disorders of any kind but if you do not in you want o explorthis you will notice you start to feel really ramped up and then during the breath holds which again can be done by exhaling and stopping for some period of time fifteen maybeven sixty seconds is a time in which you can explore how to remain mentally calm some people i en choose to do math problems or think of things in a kind of structured way while they have a lot of these homo narrow transmitter circulating at high levels in their system in other words as a way to learn to manage your mind and body under conditions of stress now if you are somebody whose using deliberate cold exposure other cold showers or i spas or cold immersion i often get asked how best to breathe during those different types of activities really there is no best way to breathe although if you wanted to turn those activities into their own form of stress and ovulation again please do not ucyclicyperoventilation it is dangerous i do not recommend it whatsoever but you can try to actively slower breathing that is to make sure that you are engaging in rhythmic breathing now up until now have said that rhythmic breathing is the de fault prebougt sing or newcalios controlling rhythmic breathing is the default and that doubling up on inhales and exhales is something that happens when you deliberately take over the action of prebutsinger complex now that is true ninety nine percent of the time however there are certain condition such as conditions of heighten state of emotional arousal and if you think about somebody's been trying oftentimes they will do the double inhale exile that's as or triple inhales or i somebody is very very afraid it is all inhales o ha it does sometimes happens spontaneously actually when we get into very cold water there is a very robust decrease in the activation of the prefrontal quartets which is the area of brain real estate right behind the forehead that controls structure thinking your ability to reason and make sense of what is going on you get into really cold water you should not expect that brain region to work here t least not work very well at all for the first twenty or thirty seconds that you are in the cold water from the time you get into cold water is here who i mat deliberate cold exposure i encourage you to trying control your breathing and make it rhythmic that is inhales follow exhales follow inhales follow exhales even if they have to be fast inhale whale inhale exhale why because the default when we get into a stressful circumstance emotionally a physically restful circumstance is that rhythmic breathing stops and that artificial nucleus takes over and it is and it is that conopanicy mode and by simply controlling our breath again even if it is fast from inhale to exhale and making sure that were alternating inhales and exhales rhythmically and what you will find is that you will be able to navigate that what would otherwise be a very stressful circumstance and make it less stressful or maybe even pleasant and that skin definitely translates to other aspects of life in which now your hit square in the face with something stressful you will notice your breathing and your pattern of breathing switching to multiple inhales or breath holding essentially departing from rhythmic breathing and by quickly returning to rhythmic breathing and maybe even trying to slow the breathing and extend those exhales you will find that you can very quickly clampdown next id to discuss what i find it be in absolutely fascinating topic it is also one that is highly useful in the world which is how your specific patterns of breathing relate to your ability to learn and to remember information how it can modulate fear and a number of other aspects of how your brain functions this is a literature that is been reviewed recently in a lot of exquisite detail in a beautiful review by jackfeldmen who i mention earlier one of the pioneers of the now science of breathing the title of the review is breathing rhythm and pattern and their influence on motion again we will provide a link to this review in the shownote captions this review includes discussion of several studies a one in particular that it'll am get into in a bit of detail that describes the following right now i just want you to breathe regularly meaning rhythmic my you can inhale an expel through your mouth or throughout knows that prefer that you do it through your nose because nasal breathing unless you need to breath through your mouth because of hard exercise or eating or talking is always going to be the better way to go nasal breathing improves the emetic of your face that is been shown will hook about that just briefly in a few minutes nasal breathing improves the amount of oxygen you can bring into your system et camera et camera act just breathe inhale expel in hill expel and know that during your exhales your pupil that is the pupil of your eye is getting bigger and as you exhale it is getting smaller in addition when you inhale your reaction time to anything that happens around you a car swerving in front of you something that you might detect in the perfect of your vision or here off in the distance increases significantly compared to when you are exhaling in addition when you are inhaling your ability to remember things especially things that take a bit of effort to remember and your ability to learn new information is significantly greater than it is when you are exhaling now as you hear all that you are probably thing you'll get how to i just inhale of course that is not in to be the best approach you need exhale as well for all the reasons you now are well aware of but what these findings really illustrate and i should mention these findings are all carried out inhuman rites these relate to some stuff in animal studies but what i just described has been shown inhuman studies consistently when we inhale and in particular when we inhale through our nose our brain is not functioning in the same way as when we exhale now that does not mean that our brain is functioning in a deficient way when we exhale it just doesn't function as well as it relates to memory retrieval memory formation and some other aspects of cognition now you might be asking why in the world would this be well i was not consulted that the design phase and any one that tells you that they were you should back away from quickly but one reasonable explanation for wire brain functions better at least in the contacts of what i just talked about when we inhale is because the old factory system is actually the most ancient sensory system of all the sensory systems we have before vision before addition before touch before all of that the old factory system is the most ancient system and the old factory system of course is designed to desert chemicals in the environment and if you imagine an early organism that perhaps we have all from or perhaps we did not but none the less that we share some features of at least in terms of all factory function in order to get that chemical information into the brain you need to inhale need to bring that information it now for a aquatic animals they could take it in through water but for animals that are terrestrial let on land they oud have to get through the air inhalation we know activate certain regions of the local preform sort lies are areas of the neolquartechs that are more action as well as increasing the activity of brainareas such as the hippocampus which is a brainariinvolved in learning your memory in fact one of the studies that illustrates this most beautifully is a study that was published in the journal of nerd science i in twenty sixteen by the way journal nescience is a very fine journal and the title of this paper is nasal respiration in trains human limbic oscillations and modulates connive function this is a paper that followed up on an earlier paper that showed that when people breathe in through their nose their recognition and their discrimination of different odors was far greater than when they breathed in through their mouth now that was always interesting but it was also sort of a dove because you smell things with your noses not your mouth you taste things with your mouth and you speak with your mouth an their munch of other things you do with your mouth but none the less that study pointed to the idea that the brain is different during nasal inhalations verses nasal exhalations verses mouth in relations verses exhalations what it basis showed is that the brain ramps up its levels of activity and that signaled noise the we talked about earlier you recall that ability for the brain to detect things in the environment is increased during in relations but because that earlier study focused on smell on all faction there was a bit of a confound there was hard to separate out the variable this paper the one i just mention nasal respiration an trains human limit oscillations model's count function did not look at detection of odors rather it looked at things reaction time or fear and basically what it found is that reaction time is greatly reduced when people are inhaling they had people look at fearful stimulate they look at their reaction time to fearful stimulate another words their ability to detect certain kinds of stimuli and they were given a lot different kinds of stimulus at head to you be able to discriminate between one sort of obscure me one he by the we fox for those losandes bump the micrhrote getting rather animated here what the subjects had to do was detect one type of stimulus for s another stimulus that they were being exposed to and what they found as if people were inhaling as that fear inducing stimulus was presented their reaction time to notice it was much much faster and they related that to patterns of brain activity and they were able to do that because they were actually recording from the brain directly from beneath the skull and they were able to do that because they had somepations the had intracranial electrodes imbedded in their brain for sake of trying to detect epileptic seizures there is a lot to this study and a lot that we could discuss but the basic take away is that when people are inhaling that is when their drawing a in through their nose in particular their ability to detect what is going on in the world around them is greatly enhanced and not just for fear but also for surprise of all sorts when people are inhaling their ability to detect novel stimuli things that a unexpected or that are unusual in their environment is significantly increased yen we will put a link to this study as well i find it to be one of the more interesting studies in this realm although there are now many additional studies that support this statement that i made earlier which is that during inhalation also called inspiration there are number of very fast physiological changes such as changes and pupil diameter changes in the activity of the hippocampus this memory in coding and retrieval area the brain and other areas of the brain what is the tool take away from this if you are sitting down to read or research or study or you really one o learn some in formation may your listening to a podcast or some other sorts of information that you want a retain it actually make sense to increase the duration or the intensity of your inhales as you do that the more that your inhaling relative to exhaling in terms of duration the more that your brain is in this focussed mode and this mode of being able to access and retrieve information better now there is one caviar to this that i think is important because i know a number of people listen to this podcast for sake of gleaning tools notes for connive enhancement for physical enhancement it turns out that when you are inhaling air you are actually less able or i should say less efficient at generating voluntary movements now that might come as a surprise until now we basely been talking about inhalation is great almost of the point where you wonder his exhalation good for anything o you do not overbreathe and kick out to much carmondoxin will of course exhalation is great for things in fact if you are somebody that is played baseball or softball what what re you told that you should exhale on the swing to generate the maximum amount of power if you are somebody who has done martial arts of any kind was traditional western boxing as you strike that is where people typically do the that the ayah lay in the sort classic coati type thing that is more of a move thing i do not know whether or not people shall use the hiya but in boxing oftentimes people d do the s they'll l do it a rapid exhalation a forceful ex exhalation keeping in mind again that inhales typically or active the engaged the diaphragmatic muscle they engage those intercostal muscles whereas exhales tan to be passive unless we take active control of the exhale and indeed durability to generate fast directed called volitional voluntary movements is greatly enhanced if we do them during the exhale not the inhale now with all of that said i have not yet really talked about mouth for sis and anal breathing and it really can be a fairly short discussion because what abundant data now show and has been beautifully described in the book called jaws a hidden epidemic this is a book that was written by pal garlic and sand con my callings at starwort school medicine has and introduction and a forward from jerodimond and from the get robots suppolski sos real heavy hitters on this book what that book really describes is that whenever possible meaning unless your speaking or eating or your exercising or other activities require some change in your pattern or breathing we should really all be striving to breathe through our nose not through our mouth and that relates to the increase resistance to breathing through the nose we talked about earlier again it'll say at a third time that increase resistance through the nose allows you to inflate your lungs more not less the other thing that breathing through your nose allows you to do is it both warms and moisturizes the air that you bring into your lungs which is more favorable for long health than breathing through the mouth hold breathing through the mouth or simply mouth breathing at all as actually quite damaging or can be i should say quite damaging to some of the respiratory functions of your lungs that of course does not mean that you should not breathe hard through your mouth when your running or sprinting your exercising hard but you do not want mouth breathing to be the chronic default pattern that you follow nasal breathing is the best pattern of breathing to follow as a default state another aspect of nasal breathing that is really beneficial is that the gas nitricoxide is actually created in the nasal passages it is a gas that can cause relaxation of the smooth muscle that relate to the musculature noxious of your nose but of your brain and for all the tissues of your body this is why nasal breathing and not mouth breathing is great for when you want a relieve congestion a lot of the sing seen counter intuitive it your noses stuffs that mainly makes people breathe through their mouth but turns out the breathing though your nose will allow some dilation of the musculature more blood flow dilation of the nasal passages and delivery of nitrogoxide to all the tissues of your body and that dilation of the small capillaries that enervate essentially every organ of your body allow the delivery of more neutrons and the removal of carmodioxide and other waste products from those tissues more readily than if you are not getting enough a excuse me nitrocoxide into your system as a lot of breathing to be a nasal breathe if you want to check out that book jaws a hidden epidemics the terrific read and it also shows some absolutely striking pictures twin studies and forth and some before and afters of people and the esthetic changes that they experience when they shifted from being a mouth breather to a nose breather these are striking examples that a been observed over and over again when people mouth breathe there is an an elongation of the jaw droopiness of the of the eyelids and the entire jaw structure really changes in ways that are not aesthetically favorable fortunately when people switch be coming nasal breathers and of course that takes some encouragement either by mouth taping or doing their party of vascular exercise with mouth close or by doing the sorts of exercises that we talked about earlier when they switch you becoming nasal breathers by default the esthetic changes that occur are very dramatic and very favorable including yes or elevation of of the eyebrows not not in an artificial sense or in it kind of outrageous way but elevation of the cheek bones sharpening of the jaw and most notably improvements of the teeth and the entire jaw structure in fact one simple test of whether not you can be an efficient nasal breather and whether not you been nasal breathing efficiently or most of the time in the pastor whether not you been relying more on mouth breathing that was described in the book jaws is you should be able to close your mouth and breathe only through your nose an this is at last not during exercise necessarily we might do during exercise but close your mouth put your tongue on the roof of your mouth and it should fit behind your teeth and you should be able to nose breathe in that position a many people will not be able to do that but fortunately as it mentioned earlier if you nasal breathe that is you deliberately naval breathe when at rest for some period of time you will experience and increased ability to naval breathe and you should also experience some addition of space within the pallid of your mouth to allow your tongue to sit more completely on the roof of your mouth this especially true for children that perform this technique again i refer you to the book jaws a hidden epidemic it is an absolutely spectacular book you conalsoggust and look on line before and after jaws hidden epidemic and look at some of the changes an facial structure that occur when people move from mouth to naval breathing and its really quite striking during to day's episode per always we covered a lot of information first we talked about the mechanical aspects of breathing the lungs the diaphragm the train and forth we also talked about the chemical aspects of breathing that really breathing is a way that we bring oxygen to ourselves and that we get the correct levels or i should that we maintain the correct levels of carbondoxide in our system neither too much more too little in order to allow oxygen to do its magic end to allow carbondoide to do its magic because as you learn during to day's episode carbondioxide is not just a waste by product it has very critical physiological functions you need to have enough of it around and therefore you do not want to overbreathe especially at rest we talked about a tool to measure how well you manage carbondoxide the call carbondioxide tolerance test and various exercises that you can use simply by breathing to decrease your stress in real time decrease your stress chronically around the clock obviously that is a good thing improve sleep and prove mood how to increase breath old times and why you might want to do that also how to eliminate hiccups we talked about how to breathe in order to eliminate the side stitch or sidecramp the you might experience during exercise and how to breathe in order to improve learning and memory reaction time and various other aspects of cognitive and physical function i do realize it is a lot of information but as always i try and give you information that is clear hopefully interesting as well and actionable toward a number of different end points if you are somebody that just now starting to think about the application of breath work i would encourage you to please yes do that is carbondoxide tolerance test that will give you some window in to how well or how poorly your managing breathing and then hears the great news the great news is the t breath work that is deliberate respiration practices are very effective at creating change very quickly in some cases such as the use of the physiological si or picnic haproventilation those changes can be experienced the first time and every time because again is are not hacks these are aspects of your breathing apparatus including the mechanical stuff and the neural stuff and the gas exchange stuff all of which you were born with and that are available to you at any moments all you really have to do is explore them and deploy them as you feel necessary if you are learning from vendor enjoying this podcast please subscribe t our u tube channel that is a terrific i zero costly to support us in addition please

episode that is the best way to support this podcast not much on to day's episode but on many previous episode to the superman labpodcast we discuss supplements while supplements are not necessary for everybody many people derive tremendous benefit from them for things improving sleep hormone function count function and on the superman lab podcast is now partner with momentous supplements we have done that for several reasons first of all momentous supplements are of the very highest quality second of all momentous supplements ten to center around single ingredient formulations this is incredibly important because if you are going to include supplements in your daily regimen you are going to want to use the right supplements in the right dosages and you want to do that in the most biologically and costoffective way and single ingredient formulations are the only way that you can determine what works in what does not work for you and it is the only way in which you can adjust the dosage of given supplements or may be even alter night days that you take one and not the other in a way that really allows you to home in on which supplements are going to be ideal for your mental health physical health and performance also momentous supplement ship inter nationally and that is great because we know a number of you reside outside of the united states if you would to see the supplements discuss on the superman labpodcast you can go to livemomentous spelt o u west livemomentous dot come slash supermen if you are not already following us on social media we are superman

welcome to the supermen tasciencescienceei manderhuberman and on professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this month were talking all about disorders of the mind things depression attention definite disorders eating disorders skit phrenic and by polar disorder during the course of this month we are going to discuss the psychological and biological under winnings of mood disorders of all kinds you will learn a lot of science you will also learn a lot about the various treatments that exist and that are development for these various mood disorders we will talk about behavioral tools things exercise meditation breastwork but also prescription drugs supplements and novel compounds that are now being tested in various clinical trials across the month i think you will start to realize that there are common pathways underlying many mood disorders in fact moo disorders that look quite different from one another often depend on the action of the same petrochemicals or neural circuits in the brain and body that actually should be a point of great relief because what it means is that by understanding the biology of one mood disorder or understanding how one treatment or behavior li intervention can impact a mood disorder we gain insight into other mood disorders as well as always we will discuss science and since related tools that people could implement should they choose before we dive into to day's topic i to discuss a very particular set of scientific findings that relate to to day's topic and that ore important for understanding all mod disorders and all states of motivation happiness and sadness as well as depression basically i am going to paraphrase a brief segment of my discussion with doctor analempki who i sat down with the discuss a diction and the biological basis of a diction and addiction treatment a very important aspect of that discussion was when doctor limpkin described the pleasure pain balance literally the circuits in our brains that control our sense of pleasure and pain and ultimately whether not we remain happy in our pursuit of pleasure or not this is an absolutely crucial aspect to the way that we function in everyday life and especially under conditions of mood disorders the pathway that so as describing is the called pleasure system however what most people do not realize is that the pleasure system is also directly associated with and in fact is the very same system that modulates mental or psychological anguish and pain essentially what she described is that whenever we pursue something that we think will bring us pleasure and that could be anything that we think will bring us pleasure from food to video games to sects to a particular r job or goal short term or long term that we experience release of the demodulator dopamine now dopamine is associated with increased levels of motivation in drive it is not the molecule f reward it is the molecule of craving motivation and drive however as doctor leak pointed out when we are in pursuit of something there is a release of dopamine in our brain that makes us feel motivated and in general it makes us feel good but very shortly thereafter and beneath are our conscious awareness there is a tilt of the pleasure pain balance in the brain literally a shift in the nurse circuits that underlie pleasure and pain such that every bit of pleasure or pleasure seeking that causes release of dopamine will we balance doubt by a little bit of pain and we do not experience this as physical pain at least not at first we experience it as craving for more of the thing that brought us pleasure now that sounds pretty good you get pleasure and then he get a little bit of pain to balance it out its subconscious and you experience it as the desire to seek out more pleasure however its actually more diabolical than that and we really need to keep an eye on this if we are to remain happy if we are to remain in pursuit of our goals the crucial thing to understand is that if we remain in constant pursuit of pleasure the inside of the balance tips that each time we are in pursuit of that pleasureful thing activity or substance we are going to experience we literally achieve less dopamine release each subsequent time we get less pleasure and the amount of craving increases now after a certain point or threshold we call that addiction and the way to reset the balance this is very important the way to reset the balance is actually to enter into states in which we are not in pursuit of pleasure to literally entire states in which we are bored may be even a love bored and anxious and that resets the pleasure pain balance that we can return to our pursuit of pleasure in a way that is healthy and that in an ongoing way will not lead to this over tipping or this increase in the amount of pain or addiction this is very important and if this seemed vague what this means is we should always be cautious of any state of mind or body or any pursuit that leads to very large increases in dopamine and if it does we should be very careful to not pursue that repeatedly over time during to days episode ism going to give an example a real life example of a discussion that have been in with a young man whose twenty one years old whose dealing with a disruption in this pleasure pain balance he is essentially depressed and he is depressed because of his on going pursuit of a particular activity that initially led to a lot of dopamine but over time has led to less and less dopamine and more and more of this inside of the balance we could call him addicted to that particular activity whether not he is addicted by clinical standards are not really is not important what is important is that he experiences this as depression as low affect as it is called or an hedonic an inability to experience pleasure from that thing or from anything else and he is currently undergoing treatment through a balancing of this pleasure pain pathway while i cannot reveal his identity to you that wouldn't be appropriate he do give me permission to reveal the general architecture of what he is coping with and i spend some hours with him on the phone this week talking to him as well as to the various people that he is working what to really understand what is going on here as i think it can illustrate the relationship between dopamine pleasure and pain forsake of addiction but also for understanding how to avoid depressive states how to remove ourselves from disdepressive states and as you will see to day as we discuss depression many of the molecules and neral pathways in biological mechanisms that we know can be used to counter depression feed back on to this pleasure pain balance before we begin id to say that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletic greens once or twice o day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which are vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you i free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at an ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even i for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic restock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five travel packs and the year

function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have soda magnesium an potassium present in the properties all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise are mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your

with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want o try element you can go to element elements doccam slash supermen to day we are discussing depression in particular wherein to talk about major depression the phrase major depression is used to distinguish one form of depression from the other the other one being by polar depression by polar depression sometimes called by polar disorder is really characterized by manic hies where people are not sleeping and their talking very fast and their buying things in pursuing resources that they cannot afford there starting relationships left in right their manic followed by periods of crashes of feeling very low lethargic and on by polar depression is an absolutely crucial thing for us to discuss and therefore we are going to have an entire separate episode related to by polar depression today we are gin o talk about major depression also sometimes called uni polar depression just because it does not have the higher and lows it is more characterized by the lows we area to talk about the biology the psychology and the various treatments behavioral drugs supplementation diet exercise all of that before we go forward into the material i just want to emphasize that any discussion about mood disorders carries with it a particular sensitivity and that sensitivity is one related to self diagnosis today's episode and indeed in the future episodes for this month on mood disorders you are going to hear very symptomologies that are used to diagnose and characterize these disorders if you recognize some of these symptomologies in yourself or in others that that is an important thing to take note of however accurate diagnosis really should be done buy a qualified health care professional at once ism saying keep your eyes in your ears up for things that sound familiar to you that might be of concern and at the same time ism saying do not necessarily leap to conclusions take those flags of concern if they are there and bring them to a qualified health care professional and they will be able to properly diagnose you w as having an particular moo disorder or piano somebody is having a particular mood disorder or not and that is an essential step in do not say this to protect us i say this really to protect you toque let us have a fact based discussion about depression and i promise you that where we do not know certain things about depression i will be clear to tell you in fact we are going to talk about some treatments for depression that are looking very promising and that right now are actually being used more and more and from my read of the mechanistic literature we are still a bit in the dark as to how these work nsicualy common theme of medicine many times their treatments that seem promising or that look really terrific and there is not a lot of understanding about mechanism however any good discussion about nor science and in particular about moo disorders has to get into mechanisms o ore going to do that and in doing that we are going to frame the discussion for the tools of how to keep depression at bay and how to deal with it if you happen to find yourself depressed or if somebody else who is depressed what is this thing we call depression was i mention before it has two forms by polar depression which we are not talking about to day and major depression also called unipolar depression is the other major depression impacts five per cent of the population that is any enormous number that means if you are in a class of a hundred people five of them are dealing with major expression or have it some point look around you in any environment and you can be sure that a good portion of the people that your surrounded by is impacted by depression or will be at some point this is something we really have to take seriously that we want to understand it is the number for cause of disability a lot of people miss work missschool and before then likely perform poorly in work or school do to major depression now there is a very serious challenge in having a discussion about depression and it relates directly to the challenges in diagnosing depression earlier i did an episode with doctor carl diceroth who is indeed a a medical doctor and a pity a psychiatrist and he made a very important point which is that the field of psypsychiatry and psychology are confronted with a challenge which is there trying to understand what is going on within the stuff that is in are brains that deep to or skulls we do not have access to that without brain imaging and electrodes and things that some one just comes into the office and the direction tool for depression to speak is language in order to determine if somebody has depression or not we have to use language how they talk about things also how they carry their body also some general patterns of health let us talk about depression the way that clinicians talk about depression because one of the issues is that we use the word depression loosely a lodpuo s my ah ism depressed i did not get this job ore ism depressed i just own i had a really rough weak or ism exhausted ism depressed or ism depressed i thought i was con go on vacation and than they cancel the flight eh that is not clinical depression that is called being bummed out being sad or disappointed now that person might be depressed but clinical depression actually has some very specific criteria and those criteria are mainly characterized by the presence of certain things and the absence of a few particular things s let us talk about the things that are present in somebody that has make your depression first of all there tends to be a lot of grief there tends to be a lot of sadness that is no surprise the threshold to cry is often a signature of depression now that does not mean that if you cry easily that you are depressed some people pry more easily than others but if your somebody who typically did not cry easily and suddenly you find yourself crying very easily that could be a sign of depression and i want emphasize could there is also this thing that we call anhedonia a general lack of ability to enjoy things things that typically or previously we enjoyed things food things sex things exercised things social gatherings a kind of lack of enjoyment from those things sometimes that lack of enjoyment is sad and sometimes is just flat it is just kind of neutral it does not feel good because there is nothing there it is bland food it is these experiences or analogous to fighting into your favorite article of food and it just not tasting very good it is not taste anything at all and that is a common symptom of majeyour depression the other one is guilt oftentimes people with depression will feel very guilty about things they have done in the past or they will just generally feel badly about them selves and we are going to talk about this because it relates to some of the more serious symptomatology seem in depression sometimes things self harm mutilation or even suicide but for the time being we want a frame up antedonia this lack of ability to achieve or experienced pleasure a kind of a flat affect as it is called sometimes even delusional thinking negative delusional thinking and in particular anti self confabulation what is anti self confabulation will swell confabulation is an incredible aspect of our mind in our nervous system you sometimes see other forms of confabulation in people who have memory deficits either because they have braindamage or they have adulated domensha a good example this would be some one with age related domensha sometimes will find themselves in a location in the house and not know how they got there and if you ask them whatare you doing here they will create these elaborate stories oh i was thinking about going to shopping to day and i was a you known oi was going to take the boss and then i was going do the my create these elaborate stories they confabulate and yet that person has not left the house in weeks and that person does love a driver's like sentence the'rerealy just creating the stuff they are not lying to get out of anything they are confabulates if a brain circuit that write stories just starts generating content in major depression there is often a state of delusional anti self confabulation where the confabulations are not directly or completely link to reality but they are ones that make the self the person describing them seem sick or in some way not well a god example would be somebody who experiences a physical injury perhaps maybe they break their ankle may be an athlete and they also happen to become depressed and you will talk to them you say how things going hows you are behave them o it say and oh no ism just i feel like cam getting weaker and weaker by the day ism just not performing well and then you will talk to the person that they are working with there kinesiologist or whoever that the physical therapist as they will say now there actually really improving and i tell them they are improving but somehow they are not they're not seeing that improvement they are not registering that improvement you notice that sometimes it subtle and sometimes it is severe but they will tart confabulating you will say actually hard you are doing much better you are you are getting better you you taking multiple trips around the building now before you could barely get out of bed and they will say yea well basically they change some things about the of about the parking lot that make it easier to move around it is not really me and these aren't people that are just explaining away their you know there accomplishments cause there they are trying to you brush off praise they are viewing themselves and they are confabulating according to a view that is very self deprecating to the point where it does not match up with reality it is not what other people see and it is actually not matched up with reality and that is a symptom of depression that i think we do not often think about ore conceptualize enough it is not just telling people oh yet it is not as good as it seems everything bad these people really believe that and it becomes disconnected from reality is if their sort of sinking into a pit and they're losing touch with the realities of the world including data about themselves they're ability to move and get around for example in the a particular instance that i used as an example but their re others as well the other common symptomatology of major depression is what they call vegetative symptoms ora vegetative symptoms are symptoms that occur without any thinking without any doing or without any confabulation these are things that are related to our for physiology the word vegetative youmight know a sounds vegetable it actually relates to what a system in the body that nowadays is more commonly called the autonomic nervous system the vegetative nervous system in the autonomic nervous system historically were considered or one and the same and it relates to things the stress response or to our abilities a sleep vegetative symptoms be things constantly being exhausted the person just feels exhausted it is not because they exercise too much it is not necessarily because of a life event it could be but there just worn out they do not have the energy they once had it is not in their heads it is probably and now i think we have good data to support the fact that there is something off something is deserted in the autonomic or called vegetative nervous system and one of the most common symptoms of people with major depression one of the signs of major depression is early waking and not being able to fall back o sleep despite being exhausted waking up at three a m or four a m or five a m just spontaneously and not being able to go back to sleep now one emphasize that that could happen for other reasons as well but it is a common symptom or warning sign of major depression let us talk more about sleep and depression it is well known that the architecture of sleep is disrupted in depression what is the architecture of sleep have done entire episodes about this but very briefly in two sentences although they probably be run on sentences early in the night you ten have slow wave sleep more than remsleep or rapid movement sleep as the night goes on tend have more rapid movement sleep that architecture of slow wave sleep preceding rapid movement sleep is radically disrupted in major depression in addition the pattern of activity in the brain during particular phases of sleep is disrupted now this is during sleep this cannot be that people are creating this situation for themselves these are real physiological signs that something is off in this called autonomic or vegetative nervous system and then there are some other things that relate to the autonomic nervous system but that we normally think of as more voluntary in nature and these are things decreased appetite you could imagine that one could have decreased appetite because of the antedoni the lack of pleasure from food and if you do not enjoy food than you might be less motivated to eat it that makes sense as well because of these destruction in the autonomic nervous system these vegetative symptoms as they're called you can imagine that some one would have decreased appetite because some of the hormones associated with appetite hypocrite recon and things of that sort gremlin that those would be disrupted and if those names of hyprocretan erection in ireland do not make any sense to you do not worry about it what those are just hormones that impact when we eat when we feel hungry and when we crave food more as well as when we feel full we have enough called satiety you want to learn more about those we did entire episodes on eating and metabolism you can see that the symptomatology of major depression impacts us that multiple levels there is the conscious level of how excited we are generally well that is reduced there is grief there is guilt there is crying but then there is also these we putative things there is disruptions and sleep which of course make everything more challenging when we are awake we know that sleep is vital for resetting you are waking up early you cannot get back to sleep that is in a that is going to adjust your affect your emotions in negative ways we know this and appetite is off and there are hormones that get disrupted corpus all levels are increased in particular there is a signature pattern of depression whereby courts all this stress hormone that normally is released in a healthy way only in the early part of the day it shifted to late in the day in fact a nine p m peak an carousal is one of the physiological signatures of depressive states it is not the only one butts an it is an important one there a lot of things going on in major depression and by now you are probably thinking a goodness this is dreadful there is all this terrible stuff an indeed it is terrible it is a terrible thing to find ourselves in a mode where things feel sad you feel guilty you are exhausted and oftentimes there also an association with the anxiety system just because people are exhausted and lethargic and they do not enjoy things does not necessarily mean that there is an absence of anxiety there can also be a lot of anxiety about what is can happen to me and i can be able to achieve my goals in life will i ever get out of this state and things really start to layer on and is if the sounds depressing to it is indeed depressing this is really the place that many people find themselves and it is a pit that they just do not know how to clime out of lis just take a few minutes and talk about some of the underline biology that creates this cloud are this constellation of symptomatology i think that is really important to do because if we want to understand the various treatments how they work and why they work and how to implement them we have to understand some of the underline biology let us spend a few minutes talking about the biology of depression what is known what is not known because in doing that i think you will get a much clearer picture about why certain tools work to relieve depression and why others might not one of the most important early findings in the search for a biological basis of depression was this finding that there are drugs that relieve some of the symptoms of depression those drugs generally fall into three major categories but the first set of ones that were discovered where the called tricyclic anti depressence and the m a o inhibitors the mono mean oxidases inhibitors you do not need to understand that nomenclature but of men give you a little bit of detail that if you want understand it you can most of this work took place in the late nineteen fifties and in the nineteen sixties and continued well until the nineteen eighties when new classes of drugs were discovered and these tricyclic into depresses and the man inhibitors largely work ked by increasing levels of nor epinefferon in the brain as well as in the body in some cases and they were discovered through a kind of odd set of circumstances we do not have time to go into all the history but suffice to say that they were discovered because of the exploration for drugs that alter blood pressure nor up inefferan impacts blood pressure and drugs that lower blood pressure reduce levels of nor upinefferan and that in many cases was shown to lead to depression or depressive symptoms and these drugs these tricyclic drugs and the main hitters actually increase nor upineran and frankly they do quite a good job of relieving some if not all of the symptoms of major pressure however they carry with them many side effects some of those side effects are sideaffects relaid to blood pressure itself by increasing nor nor adrenaline nor epinefferen as it is called you raise blood pressure that can be dangerous that can be uncomfortable but they also have a lot of other side effects the reason they have other side effects is because they impact systems in the brain end in the body that impact things libido appetite digestion and others and will talk about each of those in sequins o c the experience that clinicians had of observing some relief for depression with the tricyclic an to depressions and with main hitters was terrific but they were all these side effects exideaffects that people really did not they did not these drugs at all o people get dry mouth i mention the libido they would have sleep issues appetite issues weight gain they made some people uncomfortable that they preferred not to take them even though when they did not take them they had a worsening or maintenance of their depressive symptoms a debate or later there was the discovery of the called pleasure pathways in the brain these are pathways literally groups of neurons that reside in different locations in the brain but connect to one another it is a circuit and when you stimulate these neurons with certain behaviors or with electrical stimulation in an experiment believer not that is been done in both animals and humans animals and humans become very very motivated to get more stimulation of these pathways this pleasure pathway or these circuits for pleasure a very what we call reinforcing in fact animals and humans will work hard to get stimulation of these brain areas even more than they will work to obtain sects drugs or even if they are addicted to a particular drug and they are in a state of withdraw the ultimate state of craving if given a choice a person or or in animal will select to have stimulation of this pleasure pathway instead of the drug itself and that is a major and significant finding this pleasure pathway as its sometimes call involves areas the uncles recumbent and the ventral segmental area these are areas of the brain that are rich with neurons that make dopamine and if you think to the symptoms of depression of anhedonia lack of pleasure a lack of ability to experience pleasure well that was a smoking gun that there is something wrong with the dopamine pathway in depression and indeed that is the case it is not just norpineferon its also the dopamine or pleasure pathway is somehow disrupted and then in the nineteen eighties there was the discovery of the called less s worse most people are now familiar with the less es rise the selective serotonin retake in visitors the eyes arise worked by distinct mechanisms from the tricyclic ante depressence an the ammo and visitors as their name suggests es s rise selective serena reuptakn visitors prevent ceratonan from being wiped up from the snaps after to neurons talk to one another what do i mean by that well here some very basic neurobiology not a one if you do not know any neurobiology you are gin to notum in about fifteen seconds neurons communicate with one another by spitting out chemicals into the little gap between them the little gap between them is called the snaps or by the blitz the snaps those chemicals bind to the neuron on the opposite side and cause changes in the electrical activity of that neuron on the other side of the snaps ceratonan is one such hero transmitter or more specifically its angry modulator can change the activity of large groups of neurons in very meaningful ways selective ceratonan retake inhibiter means when a person takes this drug some of those drugs include things prosaic or loft the more typical names or a morganatic names are things fluoxitine when people take those more ceratonan hangs out in the snaps and is able to be taken up by the neuron on the opposite side because of this selective retake in ambition it prevents the clearance of ceratonan from the snaps and thereby more ceratonan can have an effect eyes arise do not increase the total amount of ceratonan in the brain they change how effective the eratonan that is already in the brain is at changing the activity of neurons oke they do not increase ceratonan they increase the efficacy or the function of ceratonan in the way that i just described that was more than fifteen seconds but now you understand how guess arise work and i wouldn't be talking about assess arise if they did not in fact work yes there are many problems with eyes arise they do carry certain side effects in many individuals also about a third of people that take assess arise do not derive any benefit it does not relieve their symptoms of depression however for the other two thirds there is often a relief of some if not all of the symptoms of major depression the problem is the side effects that accompany those essessorses and these days essessorise are a complicated topic it sort of what i will call a barbed wire topic because we often here about all the problems with them but these drugs also have saved a lot of lives they have also improved a lot of lives the issue is that they tan to have varying effects on different individuals and sometimes varying effects over time they work for a while than they will not work for while they're also a lot of mysteries about the essessorises and those mysteries bother people what mysteries are my referring to well essessories increase the amount of ceratonan or more specifically they increase the efficacy of ceratonan at the snaps that happens immediately or very soon after people start taking esessorises but people generally do not start experiencing any relief from their symptoms of depression if they are going experienced them at all until about two weeks after they start taking these drugs there something going on there that is not clear one idea is that the essessorise actually can improve symptoms of depression or even remove symptoms of depression through called euro plasticity by changing the way that curl circuits function and there are many studies on this but the main categories of studies on ecessarize that relate to neural plasticity fall into two camps one is the ways in which essessorise might and on emphasize might be able to trigger the production of more neurons in the brain in particular areas of the hippocampus called the dentil girls and others that impact memory this is important were ion come back to memory the other is that the essessorise have been shown in various scientific studies to reopen critical periods of plasticity you just briefly described one of those studies was a study done by loment maples group in piss that explored brain plasticity that is known to be present in young animals and disappear in older animals this is also true in humans the younger humans have a far more plastic brain can change in many more ways more easily than can the older brain and what they showed was that fluoxitine prosaic given to adult animals can reopen this incredible period of plasticity can allow more plasticity to occur i was interesting am and it is purely through increases in ceratonan transmission and there are other studies showing that fluoxitine can increase the number of new neurons that are born into the adult brain called negro genesis the production of new neurons it is very clear that there are at least three major chemical systems in the brain nor upon efferent opening and ceratonan that relate to and can adjust the symptoms of depression and those actin can be divided into separate categories for instance epinephrin is we nor epaneferan is thought to relate to the called psychomotor defects sometimes called psycho motor retardation this is the lethargy this is the exhaustion this is the inability get out of bed in the morning dopamine is thought to relate to the anthedonia or i should say lack of dopamine in depressive patience is thought to lead to the antedonia the lack of ability to experience pleasure and serotonin is thought to relate to the grief the guilt some of the more cognitive or more emotional aspects of depression we have got the normal efferent system related to activity in alertness the dopamine system relating to motivation pleasure and the ability to seek and experience pleasure and then the serotonin system that is related to grief an unfortunately brains and organisms do not work in a simple mathematical way where you just say oh while this persons experiencing lot of grief but they do not have any problems with on lethargy and lesions boost up their seratonent on paper it works but oftentimes it does not work clinically and the an another patient you might get somebody who cannot experience pleasure but there kind of anxious they do not have any trouble sleeping and a but there there just much more anxious and and frustrated than than they normally are in hatband they meet the symptoms of depression well you might think o well do you just give that person some drug to increased dopamine and everything will be better and indeed in some cases that is true there are drugs well button which function more specifically on the dopamine system to increase dopamine and they also increase in roup and efferent many people get great relief from things well button they do not really impact the ceratonan system much and therefore you do not get a lot of the craton uric or ceratoid related side effects however some people feel far too anxious on those drugs some people get addicted to those drugs in it in a way because lot of those drugs that increased dopamou make you want more of those drugs you start to realize that what makes sense on paper does not always make sense clinically and this is why it is complicated and a e really good psychologist and really god psychiatric will work with some one to train pull in push on these various systems to find the commination of drugs that may be or may not be correct for them there is a fourth aspect of the chemistry of depression that is really important understand and that is pain we have take about pain on this podcast before but even if you did not hear the episode on pleasure and pain one emphasize that pain is something that we experience in our body no surprise there and injury a cut et camera but that we also experience emotional pain and those systems are linked in very intricate ways there is actually some date a showing that pain relievers tile and all asper in these sorts of things can help certain people with emotional pain nim not recommending people run out and take those things for emotional pain but actually if you think about that shun come as any surprise given the enormous number of people that take pain killers opioid in things them to try and relieve their psychological pain and as we know those drugs are very very problematic for many individuals they can help certain individuals but they are very prone to abuse and they can induce addiction very easily in a number of people there is a substance that is literally called substance p the letter p that manufactured by neurons in our brain in body which underlies our sensation of pain and indeed substance p inhibitors have been used to treat depression and in some cases works a lot of people with depression are hyper sensitive to pain and of course they could have multiple things going on they could have chronic pain or chronic injury and major depression s you start to get the constellation of of the many things that could happen that is all i want to say to day about the chemistry under lying depression or major depression there is a lot more there but i think if you understand the group in efferent system and that it relates to some of these things lethargy the psychomotor defects as they're called dopamine and how it relates to motivation and lack of motivation and lack of opening and depression and ceretonan and its relationship to grief and that low ceretoneand can lead to extreme grief and shame and high higher ceremony an levels can sometimes restore a sense of well being and safety and feeling good about oneself f you understand that and you understand that physical pain is somehow involved in certain cases i think you will know more about depression and its underlying chemistry than most all people out there and if you to learn more i invite you to pursue on searching those terms o further on the internal and will certainly go into them in more depth but that really sets the stage for where we are headed next next i to talk about hormones and how they relate to depression and it'd also to talk about stress and how it relates to depression as well as talk about some of the genetics or the predispositions to depression and for those of you there are thinking hay i want the tools i want o not to fix depression i understand the desire for that i will just ask if you hang in here with me a low bit longer not only will you learn a lot more about how this complicated mod disorder works some of the more interesting things about it but it will also position you to get a lot more out of the tools that we will describe you always have the option tot skip forward of course but i think it is important understand some of the hormonaland stress related aspects of depression let us talk about hormones twenty per cent of people that have major depression have low third hormone fibroid hormone is related to metabolism oftentimes we think about theroid is only related to having a fastmetabolism but fibroid is related to all forms of metabolism including our ability to synthesize new tissues proline and repair injuries i did a whole episode on third and growth hormone if you want ta check that out all of that is are lived at supermen albedo comets all time stamped et camera you can find on utubapple notify all those places if your curious about theroid hormone and growth hormone and you want to do the deep given those you an learn how to alter their levels using serious enriches check that out but twenty per end of people with major depression are hypo thyroidal they do not make enough thyroid and that leads to low energy low metabolism in the brain and body and there is a condition called hachemodos which is essentially low thyroid output and again i do not want to get into l the tools relate to third sometimes of a pcychotris will prescribe thyroid medication to increase thyroid output in people that are depressed and that will work to relieve the symptoms there is not necessarily a direct problem of seratonean opening an norupan efferent or substance be sometimes it is a third problem there are certain situations are conditions that can impact the thyroid hormone system and make people more susceptible to depression or make a are existing depression worse and those are things child birth it is well known that women who give birth can often undergo what is call postpartum depression naturally comes from the r postpartuition depression they give birth what is what is happier what is more joyful than the birth of a new healthy child and they will lapse in to a depression and that is thought to be hormonally related either directly to the third system or perhaps to the coatis all system as well will talk about cortisone moment as well certain women during certain phases of their menstrual cycle experience symptoms that are very much clinical depression and oftentimes are diagnose with clinical depression appropriately and of course the menstrual cycles associate with shifts in hormone levels as well meniposan and postmen apostle women are more susceptible to major depression regardless of whether not they have had that major depression earlier in their life these are things to be on the look out for and to defile talk to a doctor and get a blood panel that hopefully includes measures of thyroid hormone and coatis all hormone why coatis all hormone well more stress is correlated with more bouts of major depression across the life spin how many bouts well it turns out that as you go from having one to two to three well when you hit four to five bouts of really intense to stressful episodes in life these tend to be long terms stressful episodes your risk for major depression goes way up whether r not you have a genetic predisposition to depression or not one of the best things you can do to try and avoid getting depressed is to learn to control your stress system to not go from short terms stress which everybody experiences we all have short term stresses to medium terms stress to long terms stress and do not have too many bouts of long terms stressed because that probability of getting depressed goes waylay up and this is something have seen over and over again not just in my scientific career but just throughout life people in all sorts of domains young and old have seen that people will go through a very intents relationship that break a break up sometimes it is the staying together that stressful sometimes it is a graduate school that can be stressful sometimes it is some other event and then some months later they become depressed and that is because the stress system is associate with the release of coatis all the coatis l system can dramatically impact the way that these different neurmodulators dope nor up in iffernanceratone an function and there's this kind of late or longer lasting impact on the systems that that impact mood and well being learning how to control your stresses really k if you are not depressed ere your somebody that has not lapsed into a depression recently take control of your stress system and we did an entire episode on how to conquer stress and that involves dealing with stress in the short term the medium term and in the long term in their lot a different ways to do that one of the more important reasons for learning ho to counter stress in order to offset depression is that there is a genetic predisposition that certain people carried to become depressed the are these studies now of many many thousands of individuals these were mainly done in new zealand but these studies have now been done elsewhere looking at many tens of thousands of individuals who carry particular copies of genes what they call polymorphisms in particular of a gene called five h t t l p are which is a ceratonan transporter this is a gene that controls or regulates how much ceratonan is available in the brain if you have this gene this polymorphism it does not necessarily mean that you will be depressed but it greatly shifts your susceptibility to depression under conditions of stress i realize some people are listening in this and some people are watching it on you love when to describe this in a way that does not require looking at any grafts what i want you to imagine is a very is a very shallow hill a a very mellow hill it is just a ramp set it about ten or fifteen degrees of what were plotting there in your mind is that with each bout of serious stress that can be try to finish a degree or relationship break up ere a a family member that sick or the loss of a loved one or a pet with each bout of stress the probability that you will experience a major depression goes up however if you carry this gene this h t t l parent the steepness of that curve goes way way up or its action more a line such that you need far fewer bouts of stress in order to lapse into a major depression k if the typical person who does not carry this polymorphism has to experience two or three or four or five bouts of stress before they lapse into a depression somebody with this gene is susceptible to getting depression after just one bout or two bouts of intense stress that is how these genes work they do not preordained or determine you to be depressed they raise a susceptibility and many an genes many things related to heritability in general work in that way and we know there is a strong genetic component to depression how to we know well in what are called concordant mnosigotic twins these would be identical twins and they can either be in one biological sack or two biological acts while in uteri what is called monocoreonic or dicoreonic well typically it is monocoryonic and identical twins for which one of those twins goes on to have major depression there is a fifty per cent probability that the other one will have major depression it is not a hundred per cent it is not a under per cent inherited not a hard per s went genetic s you might say but there is a much higher predisposition for depression whereas in fraternal twins that number drops and in siblings that number drops to about twenty five per cent and in half siblings it is about ten per cent the numbers very from study to study but basically the more closely related you are to somebody who has major depression the more likely it is that you will also get major depression and therefore if you have not got major depression the more likely it is that you should take steps to learn to mitigate stress because stress is the major factor that can trigger one of these depressive episodes covered a lot related to the stress and the hormones and the chemistry of depression in fest i think this probably the deepest have ever gone into the biology of any topic on this pots before getting to any specific tools i mention that learning how to mitigate stress and distress learning how to measure and adjust your thirotormon those might be useful but next i to turn to some very specific tools that people who both have depression or who are prone to depression as well as peoplewho do not have depression and simply want o maintain a good mood who want to maintain a positive affect and pursuit of things in life what are the things that you can do turns out there are things that you can do and all of the biology that under lies utility of those things meaning the reasons those things work will now make cense to you because they adjust things ceretonan and opening and they adjust them through very specific pathways i know for many people learning about mechanism is kind of grueling i realize this pots is not necessarily one that you can listen to passively while doing other things although i would hope that a you could do that and still enjoy it and extract the information why mechanism mechanism is key because mechanism is a little bit understanding some of the chemistry of cooking if you read a recipe and you can follow a recipe you often here people say i can i can follow recipe that means that if you have every ingredient in that recipe your good you likely can make that dish you can make that meal however if you understand a little bit of the chemistry of why salt has to be added third and not first or why the heat has to be adjusted at a particular time well then not only can you follow a recipe but that also gives you flexibility for when salt is not available or when you want adjust the flavor of the dish or when you want to try a new dish ore you want to get experimental when you understand mechanism it puts you in a tremendous place of power to work with your system it is not just plug and shut take twelve telegrams of this you either feel better or you do not you can really start to understand how prescription drugs supplements nutrition behavioral tools how those things weave together to either work for you or not work for you and get you to paths of healthy mind and body let us think about why any tool would work to relieve depression e talked about out some of the drugs that impact these different chemical systems might work and why they create some of the problems they create probes are mainly created by the fact that they impact lots of systems in the brain and body take a drug to increase teratonum but that ceratoid is also related not just a mood but to things related to libido and appetite and you start destructing multiple systems you the thing to be said for behavioral tools right that any behavioral tool that adjust the levels of a particular chemical ought to perhaps provide some relief for some of the symptoms of major depression let us take an example that it have talked about before on the podcast which is if you get into a very cold shower or you take an ice bath you will relief nor up in efferent in up in efferent in your brain and body there is no question about that i do not think any one can really escape that it is a kind of universal response to be in cold water well if some aspects of depression are related to low levels of group and effort we will taking could showers relieve your depression perhaps it might even relieve certain aspects of that depression is it a cure well that is gun depend on the individual well exercise hour well if you go out for a run you are going to increase the amount of group and affray in your body if you enjoy that run it is likely that you will increase the levels of dopemeng and probably serotonin in your brain and body as well well that cure your depression well there are a lot of studies exploring how exercise can impact depression and indeed regular exercise is known to be a protective behavior against depression but it also can help relieve some of the symptoms of depression you may ask yourself why would you need drugs at all why would there be prescription drugs or the need for supplementation or other things to alleviate the symptoms of depression ah well that is the diabolical nature of depression which is if people are far enough along in this thing this sometimes called disease sometimes called disorder but major depression oftentimes they cannot get the energy to even get up and take a bath or a shower they have no motivation to do it they have no desire to go for a run you sake come on let us go you will feel better i know you feel better it generates all these chemicals give heard on the whatever podcast you red ladpocas or another podcast that getting into action does all these things and they just do not want to do it and to you a person whose not experiencing depress ton that perhaps could just seem the most frustrating and confusing thing in the world but it is very important to highlight the fact that these circuits that are accessible to some of us the circuits for happiness for pursuit of pleasure for exercise for getting into cold shower if that is your thing that those circus are present in all people but for certain people that are experiencing major depression and are really in the depths that of their depression they cannot really access those circuits in the same way that people who are not suffering from depression can that makes it clear it is not offering an excuses for them and indeed i think those behaviors would help jolt them out of some of the symptomatology of depression but there just not accessible to everybody let us talk about the things that people can do to deal with depression again any time you add a behavior or a tool or a supplement or or subtract a behavior tool supplement druggist that are you absolute would talk to your physician especially four somebody that is dealing with major depression i want a focus on the stress system and ism not just con to tell you to get sunlight in your eyes and to get a good night sleep although i think everybody should do that on a regular basis ideal every day talked about those hadnausium on this podcast they will help your sleep they will help you alleviate stress i think you should have tools to deal withstress in real time et camera but let us lookout depression from the standpoint of a deeper biological phenomenon which is inflammation and the immune system there is growing evidence now that many forms of major depression if not all of them relate to excessive inflammation inflammation plays an important role and wound healing is that it is a positive aspect of our mine system are ability to combat wounds combat illnesses et camera but inflammation on unchecked inflammation that last too long or is of too high amplitude mean meaning too many anti in inflammatory or inflammatory citacinds and things of that sort in the body is bad and there is decent evidence now that inflammation can lead to or exacerbate depression and that if we want to control depression or limit or e eliminate depression that focusing on reducing inflammation and its associate pathways is a really good thing to do and i think this is a really good thing for everybody to do regardless of whether not you suffer from depression or not and to day we are do not talk about exactly how depression comes about through the inflammation pathway first of all who are the major players in creating chronic inflammation in the brain and body they are the inflammatory side of kinds things ill six interlucansics things too me necrosis alpha t and alfalfa things sea reactive proline right not all of these are citachns you have interferon and prostiglandans and body rings but when we are stress chronically stressed we get inflamed a brain and various locations in the brain become inflame because certain classes of cells in particular those gleam cells the cells that are typically thought to just be support cells those cells and thereby chemistry in their dialogue with the neurons of the brain embody starts to become disrupted i may have mentioned it earlier i do not recall but i certainly mentioned it in an earlier podcast that a adrenaline apinefran when its relieved in the body does not cross the blood brainbarrier but there are certain things that are able to cross the blood brain marry when we are stress things the e two prostaglandens those cross the blood brain barrier and are blood and a brain therefore or brain in our body can communicate because certain things can pass through this barrier we call the b b b or the blood brain barrier and also we have something called the lymphatic system which is really plumbing system that link the brain embodies the link between the immune system and the brain well there is a set of actions that we can take in order to limit inflammation and this has been shown in several quality were reviewed studies now to reduce inflammation and to relieve sum and in some cases all of the symptoms of major depression one of those approaches is to increase a intake of called e p as or essential fatiacids there is now a very long list of papers in quality preview journals showing that when people in jest a certain level of e p a o megathere fatiacids the relief from depressive symptoms matches the excess arise that is incredible might that essential fatiacids could relief symptoms of depression as well as some of the prescription anti deprescids now this does not westerly meaning run stand stocktaking your into depressence if you been prescribed than please do not do that please tout your physician and i should mention that some of these same studies have shown that increasing or intake of these essential fatiacids in particular the e p a variety of megatheres can lower the effective dose of things accessories meaning if we required a fifty milligram or forty milligram dose of fluoxitine that one can get by on a lower dose and thereby perhaps not experience as many or as severe made effects by taking or supplementing with e p as now the threshold level seems to be about one beam a thousand milligrams of e p a you will sometimes see on a bottle of crilloil or fish oil or any other source even plant source or other source of lava e p that it is a thousand milligrams a twelve hundred milligrams but what is really important to look at is whether or not there is more than a thousand milligrams of e p a because the e p a in particular is what is important here and a tally in exploring some of the literature on the effects of e pes on cardovasque cardiovascular health use me as well as their effects on depression there some interesting dose dependent responses such that people who took anywhere from four hundred milligrams to five thousand milligrams of e p es achieved a variety of different benefits and in some cases some side effects will talk about those and it does seem that this thousand milligrams is the critical threshold for benefiting or getting some relief from depressive symptoms but people who took two grams seem to do better and in the cardiovascular health realm there its a little more complicated some studies point to a very positive effect on carry of vascular health by taking increasing amounts of e p e others not much the current data point to the fact that for every gram of e p e that one in masters about a nine per cent improvement in cardiovascular health the same dose dependent improvement on psychological health on a in combating depression cannot really be stated i would not say that the more e p you take the better you are going to feel to speak i do not think the dates a point to that however it does seem that if you take a gram a thousand milligrams or two thousand milligrams of e p e there does seem to be some substantial relief for many people oh emphasize many not all for many people in major depressive symptoms how would this work while turns out that these inflammatory sidakinds they impact neurons and the and the circuits of the brain that relate to things ceratonan dopamine an noropaneferon these inflammatory cdakinds act in a variety of different ways but they mainly act to inhibit the release of ceratonan noropan operon in dopamine or the synthesis of ceratonan noropan operon in dopamine and it'll give you one example of how e p s can positively impact this process and then it points to a second tool which is the proper utilization of exercise to offset the effects of depression now you should understand why having healthy levels of ceratonan is important for maintaining healthy mood it is not responsible for all the aspects of having healthy mood there's also dopamine norpanefron but it is a very important one dopamine also called five h t essentially derives from a precursor called tryptophan trip down arrives inter system through our diet c trip domains in amino acid trip down is found in turkey its found in carbohydrates and that should therefore raise the idea i wonder if one of the reasons why people who are depressed have such an appetite for carbohydrate at in food is because they are trying to get more trip down and therefore more ceratonan and indeed that is the case trip down is eventually converted into serotonin however if there is excessive amounts of inflammation these inflammatory sidokinds cause tripdofan don't be converted much into serotonin but to be diverted down a different pathway the pathway involve some that called idea dolomite which converts trip down into figurine of figurine actually acts as a neurotoxin by way of converting into something called quinolinic acid of and quinnalinic acid is prodepressive that seems a complicated about chemical pathway what is basely happening here is that the trip down that normally would be made into serotonin under conditions of inflammation is being diverted into a nerotoxic pathway and ingestion of e pes because it limits these inflammatory sidelines things iolite reactive proven et camera kin cause more of the trip down that one investor has in their body to be diverted towards the seratonergic pathway exercise it turns out also has a positive effect on the tripdofan to serotonin conversion pathway and the way it does it is really interesting you now know that trip tolan can either be convert into serotonin er can be convert into this neurotoxin which is a bad thing exercise the activation of the muscles through rhythmic repeated use in particular robin exercise but also resistance training has been shown to do this to some extent tens a sequester or shuttle the inuring into the muscle that it is not converted into this serotonin that is prodepression came their a lot of steps in the pathway leading depression but what this essential means is that hitting a certain threshold level of e pecan take whether by supplementation with foil or cricoid or through some plant source if you are not into ingesting shore cry or trying to get up above that thousand milligram threshold fore pe by ingesting particular fruit sources you certainly can do it through food you do not pap to supplement but it is easier to do a supplements that doing that will limit the inflammation that that diverts trip tolan into this nerotoxic pathway and exercise as well augments this conversion of triptofan into serotonin because it takes this thing that would potentially be a neurotoxin and it sequestered it it pulls it away that it cannot actually have its prodepressive e facts you have got multiple steps here f it were describing to tools increasing a p and regular exercise as a way of increasing eratonan somewhat indirectly rite its by limiting this bad pathway to e promote the activity of a good pathway but from the data that are published in quality pure reujeurnals it really appears that this inflammation pathway does function to increase depression through these pathways and knowing that their behavioral steps and supplementation base steps or if you prefer getting are p s from typical food from nutritional approaches i find that her very reassuring that the mechanisms all converge on a common pathway her atone that gives me great piece of mind that when people say ha go out into a now go out for run or you should get out doors exercise or you should take fish oil r the skin inavians yo have skin avian family members and they are known to or i should say they are quite open about the fact that during the winter months an particular when depression is more likely but throughout the are really they make an effort do regularly in jest high levels of e p either through in jest in jesting fatty fish and its skin ism not particular fan of investing the skin of fatty fish or by supplementing with card liver oil or other types of fish oil sardines and things of that sort sardine oils they're number different things out there that one could use i find it her very reassuring that there is a common by o chemical pathway that can explain why these things not just work but why they should work they should work because they operate in the very same bile chemical pathways that and to depressants that are prescribed to people do what does this mean for you well if you are somebody who suffers for major depression again do not stop taking your prescribe medication take your doctor but talk to them perhaps about the e p s and exercise and how these things can impinge on the same bile chemical pathways if you are somebody who's not suffering for major depression i still think these pathways are really important to understand an actually knowing these pathways is additional motivation to get regular exercise i think we all know that we should be getting anywhere from a hundred and fifty minutes to a hundred eighty minutes per week of called zone two cardie for cardiovascular effects zone to is the kind of yellowish cardie where you can sort of hold a conversation if you needed to but it is obit though your kind of sucking for her little bit and that is going to limit these depressive symptoms i think in all of us i do not think the we should think of depression as as a strict threshold ism somebody who personally has made the choice to take a thousand milligrams of e p per a i do that by supplementing fish oil there are de bate out there as to whether not its better to take e p n d oh in particular ratios and whether not d oh can impact the a d l which is the called bad colesterall that that is getting really down into the weeds and we can talk about that in future episode but for myself i notice it a pretty substantial positive effect of taking anywhere from a thousand milligrams to two thousand milligrams of e p per day i do that through supplementation and i do on strive to try an eat some fish even though frankly have never the this fish for those of you that would a little more detail or perhaps a lot more detail into the effects of e p on depression and in relieving depressive symptoms and if you want to get into the kitty gritty of it i invite you to go to examine to calm put in dear session e p a they list off and have links to twenty eight studies on the effects of e p a on major depression if you go to pulled the a many many studies on this now that date back o several decades really a i if your interested in the specific facts of e p a as a post d a oh a i want appoint you to or a particular study entitled not surprisingly e p but not d a h appears to be responsible for the efficacy of megathere longhand polygon saturated facias it supplementation in depression evidence from a reanalysis of randomize control trials this is a really wonderful paper the author is sultan martins m a r t i ans was publishing two thousand in nine we will provide a link to this study in the caption that studies really the one that at least to me points to why e p a in particular is what is effective and that whether not d a oh a is problematic or not is a separate issue but it is really the e p a that one wants to hit a certain threshold level of if one's goal is to get relief from depression or to up depression at bay by keeping mood elevated which is why i take a idol p we have got e p a we got exercise now you understand how they work to a just mood now i want a talk about something that at least for me was quite surprising when i first learned about it forsake of treatment of mood disorders and that is create cretin has a number of very important functions throughout the both for those of you that are into resistance training om and actually for those of you the are into endurance training as well creatine as achieved a lot of popularity a in recent ears because supplementation with creatine can draw more water into muscles and can increase power output from muscles om it is something that does indeed work a there have been debates about whether not it is unhealthy for the kidney is to take long term creating supplementation at hidroses and i invite you to go down that rabbit whole i think most people now accept the idea that for most people not all but for most people loose creating supplementation of anywhere from one graham to five grahams per day can have a number of positive effects on physical performance people with kidney issues et camera need to be especially cautious but creating is interesting for that purpose however there is also a called phosphor creating system in the brain and that phosphor creating system has everything to do with the dialogue between neurons can these other cell types called plea and plea comprise non several cell types micrulia assercises et camera but the phosphor cretin system in the for brain in particular in the front of our brain has been shown to be involved in regulation of mood and some of the reward pathways as well as in depression and there are now sever real studies at least three although they are probably more by time this comes out because there coming out very quickly now at least three quality studies pointing to the fact that creating supplementation does not just have the plosive effects on physical performance but can also be used as a way to increase mood and to improve the symptoms of major depression this has been now done in several double blind placebo controlled studies these studies have looked at women have it looked at men have looked at adolescence some of whom were taking excess eyes some of whom were not they have done magnetic resonance spectroscopy spectroscopy is a way that you can look at the concentrations of particular compounds in the brain in real time in humans o it can be use for other things as well of course and basically what been observed is that increasing the activity of the phosphor creating system in the forebrain can be beneficial or at least is correlated with improvements in mood such as talk for a moment about what is involved with using or supplementing creatine in order to improve mood and perhaps even treat depression first of all when i talk about creatine ism talking about creating monohydrate there are number different forms of creating here impi to creating monohydrate the america journal psychiatry in two thousand twelve published a study which was randomized double blind placebo control trial oral creating monohydrate and what it found is that it could augment or enhance the response to a selective ceremony and retake inhibiter in particular in women with major depressive disorder e p a creatine supplementation seems to either lower the required dose of escessori that is required to treat depression or can improve the effectiveness of a given dose of excess or i however there are other studies that have looked directly at creating supplementation in the absence of essessorise and those are interesting as well there's a wonderful and very comprehensive review on creatine for the treatment of major depression that includes beautiful tables of all the subjects and the dosages et camera am not in a read off every line and a every column in that review but we will provide link to that review as well one of the things that is really striking about the lists of studies that they include is that most of them used dosages that are pretty reasonable for most people anywhere from three grahams to five grams sometimes up to as many ten grams per day of creatine many of these also were shown to increase activity of this phosphor resting system in the forebrain and some show a relationship between that pros poor creatine system and ut particular category of receptors in the brain called the n n n m souse me d a receptor n methyl d aspirate receptor the n m d a receptor is one of the first things that every budding neural scientists learns about because it is the receptor that has particular electrical and chemical properties that make it a critical gait for called neral plasticity it is not a receptor that is activated in the brain typically for just the functioning of the brain on a dated a basis it is a receptor that is activated when circuits are going to change when they are inspired to change by some very strong stimulus meaning some experience or in some cases of drug or in some cases something else but the end a receptor is a kid of a key node for shifting brain circuitry and while the details are not entirely clear it seems that creatine supplementation leads to increases in the phosphor creatine system in the forebrain and that increases in the activity of the forebrain phosphor creatine system relate to changes in the way the no d a receptor's function and may lead to some of the plasticity that changes in marry circuits that underlie the shift from negative mood and affect to positive mood now there a lot of gaps of or yo now there lot of little boxes are bins in the diagram i just laid out for you and some of them are still truly black boxes as we say meaning we do not really know what is in them yet and more mechanistic date are coming however when you look over the data in this reviewer when i look over the date in this review we find is that the pretty striking passive effects of creatine and one of the more interesting effects is that creatine has actually been shown to increase mania in people that are already manic and that is interesting were not talking about by polar depression today but it seems that creatine elevates levels of activation and and of mood over all andyou could see why that would be a problem for somebody that is already in a manic phase but it actually might be beneficial for somebody who is very low affect and has major depression should you supplement with creatine well as always taught your health your provider but if your somebody who is thinking about things that you can do and things that you can take in order to improve your mood keep depression at bay maybe even support other treatments for defer major depression the creating system seems a logical one there is at least strong studies and a good number of them to look to to determine wether not that is right for you i personally take fivegrams of creatine for other reasons i take it for the m physical performance enhancing effects a but it is kind of nice to think that perhaps it is also helping me improve my mood that the choice that have made for mean within the margins of safety for me in my life i do not know that it is right for everybody but i find it very interesting and again i find it particularly interesting because there's a logical biochemical pathway to support the finding that it improves mood in can offset the effects of major depression in some cases or can improve the effects of antidepressant medication in many cases when i see mechanism and i s effectiveness and the mechanism in the effectiveness map to a lot of the same mechanisms that are involved in prescription drugs that gives me great reassurances that this is in just some sort of mysterious pathway or mysterious compound by which a cretin might be working now we have an a cluster together e p s exercise and their relationship to inflammation creatine and its relationship to forebrain function and the phosphor creatine system and this no d a receptor and as you will see in a few minutes the no d receptor turns out to be vitally important and is actually one of the main notes of action for some of the more novel and exciting therapeutics the a being explored now in psychiatric clinics let us talk a litlebite more about this n m d a receptor and how it relates to some of the more experimental or novel therapeutic compounds for the treatment o major depression and the compounds that were going to be talking about you may have heard of before one is redefine which is getting increasing interest in psychiatric clinics and in various experimental and clinical studies and the other is p c p both redefine and p c p are known drugs of abuse for many years people have abused these drugs go by the street names special k et camera and they create dissociative an esthetic states dissociate states were people do not feel as closely meshed with their emotions end their perceptions it is an odd state i here and it is an odd state that clinicians are now leveraging for the treatment of depression will talk about why that is but it is talk a obit about this n m d a receptor and why redefine an p c p might work for the treatment of depression or how they even could work i want to be very direct that this is an area that still needs a lot of data there are however some excellent papers from really terrific groups one of them is a paper that was published in nature last year twenty twenty o first author is vena say vagina v s u n a the last author in the lead on the study was doctor carl desert who was a guessed on the human labpodcast few months ago the world expert in nerasciencies a psychiatrist this paper from san vagina and and carl and colleagues explored how these dissociy of states come about and they looked at this both in animals and in humans and found that there was a punchy a common mechanism whereby a particular layer of quarter a your your brain has this outer shell of tissue that is called the real quartan its where our perceptions lie its where our associations lie at it is a very important area for processing decision making and planning et camera it is literally stacks of cells an one of those layers in the stack of cells is lay or five and the layer five neurons in particular when into a particular rhythm of electrical activity this one to three hurts rhythm after mice or humans were administered redefine or piece p there was activation of a particular are of the brain this retrosplenial quartan as its called and the dissociative state that emerged was an interesting one and clinically what is described in the trials for redefine and things it that people who are depressed will take redefine will experience a kind of separateness from their grief an from their emotions and that possibly there is plasticity there actually shifts in the narial circuitry such that their emotions do not way on them heavily amusing very loose language years but that they do not feel as over ridden or were as burden by their own emotions as they did previously to the redefined therapy now absolutely in no way shape perform in my suggesting that people run out and take redefine in order to treat their own depression these drugs are still very much experimental although they are approved in certain contact at least in the us o by prescription for the treatment of depression what is interesting to me is that these dissociative states sound at least hat the outset to be more of a separateness from everything it sounds a limit depression itself the sort of a antedonia an into inability to experience pleasure and then t one takes a dissect of anaesthetic and somehow is able to get relief by getting even further away from in experience to me that does not make sense but that just speaks to the fact that these drugs in these receptors in these pack pathways operate through very critic means and we really do not understand all the pathways in the brain that relate to motivation and mood and forth and the results with these redefine trials are looking very promising in fact there are number of trials that show that a fair number of people that take redefine inatheraputicceting legally with a psychiatric guiding the experience are able to get relief from their symptoms without the need for many many treatments with the drug just how many treatments varies from individual to individual but it is not people have to take this stuff on going this is really an attempt to t tap in to this end receptor that is related to neural plasticity both cenemine and p c p essentially act as antagonists which means they block the end d a receptor they do it through different methods non competitive and compete for you chemist and pharmacologists out there look it up if you but whats therefore even more surprising is that every neural scientists learns that activation of the enemy a receptor not antagonism are blocking of the enemy a receptor leads to changes in naval circuitry in very profound ways in fact experimentally and have done these experiments myself if you want to prevent plasticity you want to prevent in experience from reshaping neural circuitry you give an end d a receptor blocker give done that many times in the course of my experimental nail science career not to myself obviously but in on the course of doing experiments it is still a bit mysterious to me how this could work a couple things one is this layer five activation is pretty interesting were in a come back to lay or five when we talk about yet another emerging treatment for depression which is sylicibin call magic mushrooms and the effects of sylicivan on mayor five neurons in the quarter there is a common theme emerging here which is that mayor five activity in the quarters may be important for rewiring the brain in certain ways that can lead to recovery or to an alleviation of some of the symptoms of major depression if this is sounding a littebit vague to you it is because this is still truly experimental and new and still very much on the cutting edge of what is happening now we do not have all the answers if it sounds ism moving slowly through this and i being extra careful about what i say i your you are correct your on your intend are correct in this in this case i never want a mister and say something that is not true but that is especially the case when we are talking about experimental therapies in drugs which formerly were taken as drugs of abuse which are now being used as drugs for therapeutic treatment in the clinic there is an a very interesting study this was publish in science in twenty nineteen these are very recent studies a the last author on this is listen all s t o and the title of the paper is sustained rescue of prefrontal circuit function by antidepressant induced spine formation and here when we hear spine were not an referring to spines in your vertebra running your spinal down your spinal column were tango about the spines which are these little protrusions on neurons neurons are not smooth by any stretch if you cumin on a neuron you ware to come to my lab and look down the microscope at a neuron in cumin on it you would find that some neurons are smooth but most barons have these little protrusions and those little protrusions are called spines and those little spiny p retrusion are little sights where neurons can reach out and form and receive new synapses from neighboring neurons they increase the surface of a neuron and allow new connections to be formed in spine formation is synonymous with nauru plasticity which is synonymous with changes in circuit function which is synonymous with changes in the ways that we think we feel and we behave and what was shown in the study is really interesting what they showed is that etamine can relieve depressive symptoms rapidly by changing or increasing in this case the spines on these neurons in the prefrontal quarter and if that word prefrontal rings belt well now you remember the phosphocreatine system the ingestion of creating monohydrate and the forebrain activation of the forebrain were related to in some way or another to relief or improvement of major depressive symptoms ere trying to converge on a picture here whereby these drugs etamine pa p used in the therapeutic context may be increasing euro plasticity literally the changing of nauru circuits in the forebrain somehow through dissociative states and i do not want to speculate too much about how that might come about but one of the things that such an and a resounding or repeating theme of major depression is the when you talk to somebody as major depression it is a real downer and ism not being disparaging of those people but if you have ever had a conversation with someone who is depressed they are always talking about how exhausted they are or in really severe cases they are not even responsive at all they just come a stand the outstare at you blankly or they fall asleep in their truly depressed their system is lowered in terms of its activation state i think that it is interesting that the application of drugs that allow people to separate from that state of not caring or being uninterested or unwilling to do anything is rashly one of the paths to treatment it is not always about just getting people peppy and excited and happy the are also seems to be requirement for getting them distanced from their own grief and this brings us back to something that we talk about way back to the beginning of this episode which was this particular feature of the anti self confabulation that everything that happens is a reflection that i should say for the depressed person that everything that happens is a reflection of how life is bad in their experiences just point to the fact that nothing is going to get better this is the common language of of depression if is very depressing to hear on me talk about it is it is heavy and that is what it is to to hear these things that even heavier of course for somebody to experience them and those beliefs those patterns of guilt and grief and antedonia and delusional anti self confabulations those of the things that ha eventually if they get severe enough start to convert into things selfharm mutilation and in the most tragic of cases of course suicide and i think we can look to these treatments such as determine and pa p but in particular redefine and its use in the clinic as ways for people to get distance from the negative affect that they feel is in just inside them or overwhelms them but that for the very severely depress person they feel is them and we hear that sometimes you are not your emotions ow that is a statement that i have always been a limit challenge by went yet yes indeed emotions are not who we are and they are states that we go into and out of including happiness and sadness but they are very much a part of us when we experience that we do not experience them as next to us a behind us or across the room from us we experience them as our emotions they they are much part an parcel with our experience of ourself that a statement we are not our emotions is a very hard statement to digest especially for the depressed person and i think that the enemy a receptor and its capacity to induce neralplactosy circuit changes the fact that pa p an redefine are both showing active creation of nerd circuits by way of suppressing activity the enemy a receptor and some of the positive or exciting therapeutic outcomes that are coming from this really point to the fact that determine and pec p and removal of negative experiences or the experience of a negative experience sort of getting met there but the experience of a negative experiments may be an important path by which people treat their depression especially in its most severe forms where people are revering towards selpharm mutilation and suicide you may have noticed a theme which is that certain categories of approaches that we have been discussing for offsetting the symptoms of depression such as exercise in getting peas reducing inflammation or even the access rise for increasing ceretonan focus on changing some for biological function raising the amount of a chemical ceretonan or reducing the amount of inflammatory citicinds in the brain and body and yet things determine focus more on rewiring circuitry changing neral circuitry that it functions better in the immediate and hopefully in the long term as well and keep people with major depression in what they call remission away from major depression another category of treatments that being actively explored now in laboratories and in the psychiatry realm are the psychedelics and that is a huge category of compounds however one in particular syliciban is one theta being most intensely and actively pursued for its capacity to try major depressive disorder i one to be very clear that the work that i am going to describe is work that is being done in university settings university hospitals to scientists and psychiatric and these are clinical studies clinical trials leading to previewed data and those of the data that will be discussing a some of the major luminaries in this area include of course a not limited to but include people matter johns whose at john's hoping will discuss some of his work now and fortunate to say that he will be coming on the podcast as a pesto describe the studies in a variety of laboratories working on a variety of different psychedelic compounds but let us focus on sylicibon for its capacity to rewire nor circuits and alleviate depression there have been anecdotal data or evidence over the years that scylicibon has this capacity had o solicit an work while sylicibe and magic mushrooms as it sometimes called mainly works on what is called the keratose and five h two ay receptor with some affinity for the five h to one receptor what is that mean will basically you have got a lot of different kinds of ceremony and receptors just as you have lot of different kinds of dopamine receptors or other types or receptors the advantage of having different receptors expressed in different parts of the brain and body even on different parts of individual cells in the brain and body is that the same compound serotonin can have a diverse set of effects on different cells and tissues this is also the basis of some of the sidepiece profile of assessor's because maybe for instance we know that taking prosacloxitine will increase serene in one area but also in another area and then they will go have diverse effects on different brain circuits because of the variety of receptors receptors are just parking slots where the molecule craton and parks and has different effects well sylicibon engages or increases serotonin transmission meaning it increases the amount of serotonin mainly by acting at these five h to a receptors but where in the brain does it happen in what are the major effects first thill talk about the major effects cause i think that is what people are interested in the study that to highline is a fairly recent one it was publishing may of twenty twenty one in journal journalscuse me of the america medical association psychiatric o mama psychiatry and its entitled effects of solicit an assisted therapy on major depressive disorder a randomize clinical trial s an absolutely beautiful study a very important study it includes some of the luminaries in this area matter johns iatric final roman griffin's and others we will provide a link to this study it is available in its full form of at zero cost if you want o read it its colodidytail sumjuscan a summarize a few things but basically what they did was they a screen for patients to come into the clinic these are people that suffered from major depressive disorder and administered either one or two rounds of sylicibon a they used particular dosages their list in the studies you can look it up if your really interest in that level of detail om typically it was a twenty milligrams parkilegram of bodyweights o depends on bodyweight or thirty milligrams of siliciben per seventy kilograms of bodyweight o they were given in causal forms of people were not eating the mushrooms this this obviously a very controlled study am en they want to control the dosages appropriately a they randomize to begin the treatment immediately or after an eight week delay a they had all the appropriate control groups that one would to see what is really striking about this study is that there was a very significant improvement in mood and affect and relief from depressive symptoms in anywhere from fifty to seventy per cent of the people that were subjects in tie study who received om the siliciben treatment and whether or not it was fifty or whether not it was seventy one per cent a varied according to how long after the study they maintain these anti depressive effects whether not they stayed in remission from the depression but these are are really enormous and significant effects very exciting om and are pointing in the direction of siliciban very soon becoming ay treatment four various forms of depression including major depression now of course this is limited to the laboratory at present there are number of elements of these studies that are important to take into consideration too which is that there are highly trained guides meaning people to direct people through the experience as am matter johns is told me their uni there is the occurrence from time to time of people having called bad trips of having anxiety attacks during the hallucinations and all that and they have ways to mitigate that and deal with that because the guides are trained they have om all the sorts of medical monitoring devices for heart wait and temperature and things that one would to see a for study this because these are very powerful compounds i do not want to give away any elements of the discussion with a matter johns because it will be released in podcast form reasonably soon here the hubermenlapodcast but one of the things that came up and is a fundamental question that i had that i think probably many of you or asking is does the experience that one has on these compounds make a difference for whether not somebody gains relief from depression from these siliciben journeys or not a in other words does it matter what they talk about does it matter what they think about does it matter if they have a good trip or a bad trip and a i do not t hold you in too much suspense it'll let matter provide the more thorough answer but what is really interesting is there are some common themes to silicic an administration and experience that lead to relief from depressive symptoms but they are subjectively excuse me subjectively very varied meaning that whether or not t people feel they had a good experience are a bad experience whether not people thought about their parents or thought about a the color of the ceiling does not seem to have too much of an impact on whether r not they receive relief during these studies in these clinical studies seems they different people can have lots of different experiences and still receive benefit and that points to something deeper it points to the fact that these drugs is really what they are or rewiring natural circuitry in a common way despite a diversity of experience while on the drug and that itself is really interesting i and it takes us back to a place that we have been before in this discussion which is layer five of the quarter this area that cenemine seems to impact as well by generating rhythms of i mention one to three hurts activity in lay or five of certain areas of the quarter well the five h t on receptor is known to be enriched in layer five of the quarter and layer five of the quarter is a very interesting area because its an area which there is a lot of lateral inactivity connections between different brain areas laterally generally a is what allows us to merge different senses for instance when we hear a sound off to our right over here we turn to our right a there is a very hard wired response in typically we hear something off to our right we do not look to our left that is how hard wired some of these circuits are what appears to be happening is that the activation of the ceretonan says them in five age t on a receptor in layer five is offering up or providing and experience whereby at the lateral connections are able to engage much more broadly than they would normally now that also a could be a bad thing and i asked a mat about this can that sounds contispoky i do not know that when i hear something off to my right that i want o look off to my left that could be highly maladapted give especially of its the car coming at me from my right a that does not seem to be what is happening it is not really rewiring these deeply reflective circuits it somehow rewiring associations between events emotional events past events current events and future events in ways that a low people to get some sort of relief or distance from these narratives these depressive stories about their past and present and allow them to see new opportunity and off times in the future an really a fascinating thing if you really think about it because i would have thought that but simply by camping up laterality of connections meaning the cross associations that things could either be rewired randomly in ways that do not serve us or would perhaps just cause no effect at all as you thy can be bad or neutral but that is not really the way things are turning out again these are highly controlled studies i do one emphasize that examine culicid in these things are still illegal most all places there are some regions and cities in the united states where the y are locally decriminalized but they are not legal they are still illegal what referring to here are indeed clinical studies in which on people are taking them legally om i think it is very likely we will see a shift in the legislature around psychodelicsan in particular sylicibon in the om not too distant future a and i think that for now what we should know is what mat told me and what you will hear far more about which is that syliciben this one er in most cases nodose treatments done highly clinical setting controlled setting with patients that are carefully selected can in many cases the majority of people receive and maintain relief from their depressive symptoms simply through the experience of this psychedelic journey i did ask this about microdosing u i mean it sound as if i a never heard about it before microdosing not microdosing microdosing and his answer was interesting his answer was that the microdosing effects do not seem to be nearly as impactful as some of these om what let us just call them what they are these kind of high amplitude sessions that there are just one or two om there are some studies on going where there's more than two but that the microdosing does not seem to compare to these macrodosing om i mention the dosages before a this twenty milligrams per seventy kilograms or thirty milligrams for seventy kilograms dosages ism given couple a given several weeks apart you will hear more about microdosing another o psychedelics and their impact on a depressive states and major depression in the episode with mat but for the time being it really seems as if again were looking at neral plasticity were coming back to layer five just with redefine and pa p were hearing about lay or five or hearing about rewiring of circuitry were hearing about a dissociation or a distancing of oneself from these negative moods and affect and narratives but there is a key distinction between the redefine work and the syliciben work which is that in the redefine work it really is about dissociating from experience during the session with the psychiatrist were as jury the syliciban journey its really about immersing oneself in the experience and being fully present to that experience that does seem to be an important component and what the differences there and why they both seem to provide some relief from de major depression isn't clear i think most likely it takes us back to the fact that this thing we call major depression clearly involves serotonin dopamine and nor pan felon and in some individuals they may be more deficient in one or several of those or all of those were as another individuals it might be a different collection of chemicals and of course there are a tremendous number of other psychedelic compounds that people are exploring for treat ant of major depression but really sylicibon is the one that we have the most data on em i may has mainly been explored in the clinical realm for treatment of drama there are some trials on going for treatment of depression but the the big the big break through seem to be happening in the realm of aroma treatment the called maps group that is doing this again legally a an a clinical setting and there are other groups that are starting to do it as well an we are going to do an entire podcast episode about media ma and some related compounds it'll save that discussion for them one of the most common questions i get for this podcast is about different diets different regimes different nutritional plans things kit biogenic diet or vegan diets or intermix fasting or the almost i the can lion dit et camera a there are actually really interesting data relating nutrition and diet to major depressive disorder and think we just need to frame this by returning to something that was said earlier which is that the ingestion of carbohydrates in particular carbohydrates and some meats turkey that are rich in tripdiphan this precursor to serotonin are in many ways the self medicating version of depression treatment now to be clear ism not saying that people should use food to medicate their depression many people do that reflectively however they reach for carbohydrate rich foods to blunt their cortical that is indeed what it does a blunts sort is all when you jest my carbohydrate foods in particular starchy foods and it does increase serotonin n particular if its a if those foods rather or rich in in the monoacid tryptophan now investing food is wonderful and important and great but investing excessive foods of any kind carbohydrate or otherwise otherwise is not healthy of course there have been some explorations of whether not a vegan diet can improve symptoms of depression not a lot of data not impressive data there have been very few controlled studies looking at the a carnivore all meat diet on that i think there are now some that are starting to seen up meaning the studies their stern is seen up however the kitogenicdie has been explored for it is ability to relieve certain symptoms of depression a in particular to what is called maintain ecthyma ecthyma is the kind of state of equilibrium between manic episode and a depressive episode in a manic by polar person will return to the more in a future episode but it basically manics have hides and they have lows by polar either cycle back and forth really quickly rapid cycling by polar or slow pi some people really quickly can be dato day other people its month the month or weak to eat their going hies and lows and you here about mania and you her about dysphoria euthymiais that kind of a place in the middle where people feel neither too high nor too low and there are some interesting studies looking at the quite jogenicdiet from maintaining uthimia in manic depressives but also in people with major depressive disorder why would this work will we have to remember that the quitogenic diet was not discovered that in a self appointed a nutrition grows could talk about it on line or that people could make money selling anything related to to mitosis and here ism not disparaging of the quitogentites helped a lot of people the quite the quitogenic diet was actually shown to be medically a relevant for its use to treat epilepsy it turns out that in epilepsy or in particular pediatric epilepsy that a queitogenic diet and the shift of brain metabolism to predominantly one in which ketones are being metabolized rather than more standard glucose typemotabolism can greatly reduce the number of epileptic seizures that these children experience not always the case but its often the case and you talk to a neurologist who r a her surgeon whose specialized in a in a epilepsy in pretulapediatric empty and that they will tell you that he have the biogenic diet in many cases not all can be very effective the treatment how how is it that a biogenic diet reduces seizures well the way it reduces seizures is by increasing whats called gala transmission gala is a substance that is naturally released in our brain it is an inhibitory nor transmitter meaning that when its released into the chaps it has the tendency to reduce the firing the reduce the electrical activity of the next neon or sets of neurons their various compounds the increase gala in particular gabon the forebrain one coming example would be something alcohol drinking a alcaic drinker too will increase gala transmission will ironically will lower or social inhibitions by increasing eurnerchemical inibission it easily suppresses the a help monitoring pathways and if people drink enough it will suppress all pathways and people will urinate themselves and fall over it will eventually inhibit all sorts of pathways the gabasystem has a rich array of effects all over the brain and body but alcohol tends to activate the release of gala you might say will then why not just take call the suppress seizures without be a terrible idea because there tends to be a rebound excitability after alcohol stops having its effects on the gala receptors and then there is an excitability for which an epilepsy would be terrible the reason why the epileptic a diet is useful for epilepsy is that increases that what we call the tonic level the sort of that the tie the level of gala in the brain and that suppresses some of the hyper excitability that is the characteristic feature of epilepsy and there are other drugs for instance the benzol diazopines om and things of the canal variety value and forth those increase gabatransmission those drugs also have a lot of potential for abuse and addiction et camera and hat their problematic for other reasons but the keitogenic diet by way of increasing keystone metabolism are shifting brains metabolism over to ketones tends to modulate gala such that gala is more active and a just the called gabagludimate balance this is getting technical but glutamate as an excusatory n neurotransmitter galas in history nertransmet and their balance is vital for her plasticity for maintaining healthy levels of activity in the brain et camera and the is decent evidence that people with major depressive disorders particular the people with major depressive disorders that are refractory meaning they do not respond to classical antidopressens can benefit it seems from the keitogenic diet now this is not always the case but for those of you out there who are struggling with major depression and for which drugs have not work please talked your psychiatrist i do not know how many of them are up on the literature about a the keitogenic dieter the spies and the rest psychiatric are vary in terms of how involved in the current literature on they tend to be but there are many excellent psychiatric out there most of them in my experience are are actually quite avid learners about what is happening in what is new in this realm they call psychiatry it is really interesting that eating in a particular way lowering carbohydrates to the point where you relying on keitogenic metabolism in the brain increases gala and can provide some relief for for depressive symptoms and that in particular that seems to have plosive effects in people that are refractories do not respond to classic antidepressants and that would include things fluoxitine et camera it'll make one final point about keitogenic diets and gala and depression which is that it is also been shown that for people that respond well to these drugs that impact the pceratonan system bohemian system or nor up in offer the keitogenic diet there may improve the ability for those drugs to work at lower dosages which is reminiscent of what we saw with the epic supplementation to day we have covered what at least feels to me a tremendous amount of material this topic of depression is indeed an enormous topic to try and get our arms around we talked about the symptomatology we talked about some of the underlying nor chemistry in biology and then we talked about approaches to deal with it that are really grounded in the narrow chemistry an biology i just want to recap a few of those tools and what those things are first of all we talked about making the effort to not overwhelm the pleasure system that might seem c n a intuitive do not overly seek out pleasure or else one can find themselves in a place of depression i mention way back to the beginning of the episode a young man who i know to be really struggling with depression and it is thought and we do not know fortune but is thought that some of that depression was probably triggered by an over indulgence in video games and other highly foreman uric activities to the point where those activities of eventually were countered by the pain balance that doctor analempki described and he now has to do those activities repeatedly and for many many hours each day just to feel o say not even to derive pleasure from them and worse many other activities practically all t other activities have lost their zest they have lost their excitement and their and his sense of pleasure for them and there's are really a active campaign now to reset that system number one do not overwhelm your pleasure centers either through activities or compounds i seem counter intuitive but your setting yourself up for antedonia and depression if you do that snot just about addiction that to but it is also about setting yourself for anaconda and depression how often can you engage in these activities well that n a differ from person a person everyone slightly different but you should really mind your extreme hides and your extreme lows and be cautious about those will probably have a doctor lemon again an a future time to try and get some more specifics about that but if you do feel you need to reset that system it really does seem a third day complete detours from whatever activity your substance that is and ideally it does not continue after that thirty days specially in a conditions of drugs of abuse second of all talked aby the nor up and efferent system and how the norland efferent system is really deficient in many a forms of major depression and in depression there is now more deliberate pursuit of nor up and efferent inducing activities that are healthy that are not a a adrenalin seeking pursy things cold showers things particular patterns of breathing that engage and and tend to make us more alert things exercise that will increase our levels of noradrenalin i be remiss if i said that these activities could completely eliminate depressive symptoms an people with major depressive disorder i do not think that is the case and again i one of knowledge that people with major depressive symptoms often do not have the energy the willingness or a the capacity to engage in some of these activities but things cold showers deliberate cold showers things regular exercise they are not just feel good activities they actually engage the group an efferent system and and keep that system tuned up and allow us to increase our group an offer levels at will on a regular basis and their mood enhancing effects are real effects that at the level of nor chemistry then we talked about spies these essential fact easier ans clear that for most people am getting above a thousand telegrams and problevin closer to two thousand milligrams pray of e pes can be beneficial for mood especially in attempts to treat or offset major depressive disorder are their side effects well you need to explore those for yourself and with your doctor everyone has a different health background ah for the margins of safety for most people will probably be quite om quite large but for some people on that might not be the case defile dealing check with your physician we also talked about exercise and how e p and exercise on a regular basis can offset these inflammatory pathways i want a mention something i mention on a previous podcast but in terms of keeping the inflammitome all these molecules that creating inflammation and then the inflammation can limit the amount of saratonan through the pathways we described in order to do that it is also very very useful to in jest two to four servings of tormented foods on a daily basis are near daily basis these are dated that were published by the sonanburg habit stamford recently in the journal sell sell press journal excellent journal that ingestion of these tormented foods really keeps the got mycrobiom tuned up to speak well in order to offset these inflammatory sidakinds keeping inflammation at bag it just turns out to be a really good thing in order to keep our mood in a good place e p exercise for rented foods creatine as a potential source of of relief from depression or offsetting or keeping us away from major depression or relapse into depression and then we talked about the prescription compounds an the compounds that are being used mainly in the course of studies and of psychiatry and depression things calamine piece pie siliciben and related compounds and then lastly we talked about mitosis which may not be right for everybody but might be right for certain on individuals out there who are grappling with this if

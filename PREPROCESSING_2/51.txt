a showspanserba expressvepian you a rod history being seen and sold to advertisers no meaneither can expressly plan wright now expressly piansicom freshman last week a clouding a objectively humiliated herself before congress she's the president of hazard just a recall her performance here was some of the highlight reel i will ask you one more time thaws calling for the genocide of news violate halyard's rules of bullying and harassment despot no antibiotic rhetoric n an isantiematic retreat antisemitic rhetoric when it crosses into conduct hat amounts to collying argument intimidation that is action a conduct and we do take action the answer is yest that calling for the genocide of news violates hazard cot of conduct correct again it depends on the contact it is not to tendon the contacts the answer is yes and this is why you should resign oke that was halyard's esteemed t president again failing to simply state the calling for genocide of news was not violation of harvard' speech policies instead clouding gay supposedly clung to free speech violation of which is constants and ever present at hazard here for example is an exert from halyard's monitory title mine training session for undergraduate students it contains quit power and control wheel that helps students identify harmful conduct it says quit around the edge of the powering control wheel you will notes attitudes release an systems racism sexism misogyny ableism transfobia and seenaphobia these apparently quit contribute to an environment that perpetuates violence on recognize some of these terms sis hetero seism which is the idea that being suspender meeting a boy who knows he is a boy and hetero sexual and believing that is the norm is somehow a form of discrimination according to one of the presented scenarios in the totalling training quote address repeated using the wrong pronounce comment about loan's appearance making remarks about loan's gene identity contribute to a climate of disrespect an may also violate halyard's policy if you say a man is a man you maybe violating halyard's policies if you say death to the news well context dependents this is the same university you'll recall that ban prospective admit cilcashof the parkland high school for sending acts that included the inward in them when he was sixteen years old but clouding gay is all about free speech for the new haters again the only way to explain all this is that it is part and parcel of the equity hierarchy established by the academic left over the courts of at least two generations some groups under this rubric a more equal than other groups and closing gay is part of the privileged relent she is one of those groups that is why she is unlike list gill over at pen unlikable was my gill is white clouding gay is black that means clouding a cannot be fired this week cries ruff and errand barium and other journalists on covered vast evidence of gas alleged plagiarism from her peachy dissertation to other multiple published papers multiple professors were players eve now come forward to contaminates platrism that includes blame university professor and williamson h said quote it does look plagiarism to me if they are going to do what they did i should be coded as reference my first reaction is shock a second is puzzlement it'll shed to does give me credit cereal swain another scholar gay allegedly plage is had quote when as bothering me is not just that there is passages she did not cutin quotation marks when i look at her work i feel her whole research gender her whole career was based on my work swan actually wen a lot further she said quote she became president of hazard and got recognition as being its first black president in do not believe her record warranted ten your i believe i had to met a much higher standard than she did it is clear to me standards were lowered in the mid nineteen nineties and the leads came together and decided they were going to defend a first of action it is clear to me she was a beneficiary of that i blame her committee and i blame it white progressives equally swain who's black concluded quote white progressives have always rewarded the blacks u supported their ideas a white mail would probably already begone that of course is exactly right but not at hazard where the board has full scale defend clouding gay saying they did a for investigation into the plagues allegations as soon as they received wind of them back in october but here is the thing even that was apparently a li equity has to be upheld at all cost particularly at the cost of the truth truth i just not a value to the radical left it turns out that the university once hit with plagerofs anmalligations against gay bacon october did not investigate instead they went into full defense mode according to there post quote hazard university covered up a high level investigation into whether it is controversial president was a plagiarist and used an expensive lawfrom to threaten the post over our own probe the post contact of theuniversity and october twenty fourth asking for comment on more than two dozen instances n which gazes words appeared to closely parallel words phrases or sentences an published work by other academics when the post brought the allegations to hazard jonathan swain its senior executive director of media relations and communications asked for more times reviews gate to review games work a day later swain who is part of the biting hers transitionteam and a one time killer canton aid said he would quote get back in touch over the next couple of days but he did not two days later on o tower twenty seventh the post was instead sent a fifteen page letter by tombs claim a high powered virgin based attorney with the firm claim lock who identified himself as defamation council for hazard university and gay there is a tacit threat issued two the near post not to print a story about gazes alleged plagiarism because of defamation concerns hazard must defend the pressies gay is the perfect emblem of equity an under qualified black woman who is been elevated particularly because of that status to

university totally reliant on d e i diversity equity and inclusion principles as gave herself satin a statement after the supreme sort throughout a formative action as on constitutional quote the fundamental principle that open transformitve teaching learning and research depend upon a community comprising people of many backgrounds perspectives and lived experiences that principle is as true and important to day as it was yesterday too are the abiding values that have enabled us and every great image educational institution to pursue the high calling of educating creative thinkers and bull leaders of deepening human knowledge an of promoting progress justice in human flourishing now harder does not mean that in terms of ideas of course er like two register re publicans at the entirety of hazard it is wildly stacked to the left the entire faculty of hazard might have a dozen professors who voted republican in the last election cycle maybe what is hazard mean an terms of diversity they man in an from race this is why according to the hazard crimson in an analysis of the period nineteen ninety five to do thousand thirteen that is an eighteen you period avian america admitted to hazard earned an average just high t score of seven sixty seven across all section that is an average of fifteen thirty fore in average how means that there art in of avian students for getting a sixteen hundred which is the maximum viouliok of the charge that have put out pagans from the hazard crimson look at that red line it is far and away above every the race it is insane meanwhile white admits they were forced to earn an average of seven forty five across all sections that of course would be a fourteen ninety a very very high score hispanics however had to earn an average of seven eighteen that is a fourteen thirty six black admits come in dad last even after native america admits they had to earn an average of seven o four or a fourteen o eight on the sea t that is the average say t score remember that is not the top as t score that is not the bottom as eight score that is the average s a t score in other words the average hazard avian america had to out perform the average black admit at hazard by a hundred and twenty six points two get in i promise you by the way that the spread on avian am pelican admitted does not go clothe we down to thirteen hundred it is not as though her bunch of avian pelicans who got in with the thirteen hundred but if you have a fourteen o eight black avers an rings are a lot of blacksunes ho got in wite a thirteen hundred and some that got in with the fifteen hundred for contact a fourteen eight is below the averages a rescore for admitted at every top university in the united states it is below the average at every topic varsity lick pick university rent number twenty is below the average admit at that university the only way to justify the sort of racism is to suggest that there are other benefits that come to hazard from admitting people who are black other then difference of perspective and an essayteescore cause lowerasatscores and also not a different perspective what are those other benefits while the unspoken assumption is that a racially diverse student body or faculty or administration is self justifying now why would racial quotas be self justifying there is only one reason because meritocracy itself is supposedly in just and wrong and races your doing something good merely by putting people of versos skin colors in a room together because if you were to a indicate based on merit that would be inherently bad its not that the room that is more diverse inherently good is that the thing that that opposes the meritocracy is inherently bad and the is precisely the proposition that hazard puts forward this why minds everywhere are boggling at hazard the apace of the supposed america meritocracy right you only getinto hazard your high achiever ten i got in to hazard law it because i got one seventy six on my last it is not because i was promoting that varsity of viewpoint tin care about that this is why people are freaking out that hazard again supposed we have about about the meritocracy is now promoting thaversity equity an inclusion in the face of merit and in fact making clear that if your part of a higher athivin group this makes you in a presser who can be and should be discriminated against but of course that is what universities have been promoting for decades clouding gay is the natural consequence of that perversity this is why ceric johns of the en doubly p has now the to quote enough is enough hazard president clouding gay is a distinguished scholar in professor with decades of service in higher education the recent attacks on her leadership are nothing more than political theatrics advancing a white supremacist agenda black america is not buying into your game and we sure will not stand for your perpetuation of missacenoir missachenoir by the way is a face term that was coins in the nineties to refer to discrimination against black women according to the president of the en dublacy p pointing out the gay participated in precisely the same activity that got dismal gill fired lismagill'e white that is now races even though gay is guilty probably of plagiarism an dismal gill is not be list i got fired gay will not be why because clouding gay again is black plagiarism is just now another front for racism according to the d e i left any merit critic system any color blind system is now a front for racism if it has disproportion at effects according to the equity crowd whether it is as a scores or grade or crenel law or drug law or free speech or property rights this is the game rig the game in favor of those who under achieve pretending that under achievement is the fault of the meritocracy itself and therefore given benefits to those who under achieve is an attempt to break the races system and then when you are challenge you claim that those who are pointing out short comings and failures those people are races and representatives of the corrupt and exploitative sural meritocratic hierarchy d i is a cult philosophy it is false but utterly unfalsifiable because it is rooted in the quart belief that if you oppose d i your digit and there's no way to opposed ya that is the game that ceric johns is plan when he attacks bill adman the private equity good and harvardlam who been trying to fight antisemitism on campus adman has ben attackngantitemitism on campus at hazard an mi t at open will johns is now causing adman who is a democrat by the way of being a basis here is johns quote adman's statement on president game and acquitting adversity equity and inclusion initiatives to modern demicarthiism have nothing to do with combating antisemitism rather says johns hackman is choosing to inflame anti woke culture wars against the most visible laywoman he could target yes according to the d i friendly to bow to bill adman again a major democratic owner would be to bow to racism johns is now even calling for boycott against the business is in which adman invests business is by the lithe begin black employes quote hackman can be held to countable for his actions his hedge fun perishing square is a major investran chopotliht lot copies and burgriking among other major condom ran blackwomen have the polar topside whether these brands should continue to earn their patronage and the boards an employes of the company's conspeak up as well the d i li has to be upheld at all costs if it falls tut is the theory that america meritocracy is itself evil and that is the cops theory that is the theory that lies at the rooted of the lefts ideological revolution it under guards they're support for everything from radical trains politics to the blacklists matter movement to champs every one was unsuccessful in life is victims of a merit critic movement that is actually not about merit it is actually about racism that is the court principle of diversity equity and evolution d i is a cancer but that cancer's tumor cannot simply be removed because it is too late it is metastasized throughout our universities across our body politic it has to be hit with social hemotherapy a vast and destructive better that will in do cripple many of americastop institutions and

political pestering here i will never understand the political pestering here it does not make any sense to me ladders lens theoucranian president visited the white house on tuesday he was attempting to garner support for more funding for the crane war of course zolensk's ben over promising key and the rest of dato allies that they've been promising that an offensive against russia would end up winning back the don bass region as well as crime and none of that has happened because basically you now have world war one trench warfare accompany by lot of drones and nothing is going to change along those borders and people had an outsizes perception of what was possible in this area which means that on the bushbuck ladder paten now has a bit of an advantage now that does not mean the landerpouten has poteen absorb cripple by this war he has according to a new report from seaman national security correspondent kat bullies who is herself reporting on a newly to classified yours intelligence reportquote some pretty staggering numbers three hundred sixty thousand troops russia sentence you crane initially and then made up their entire standing ground for prior to the invasion of that three hundred sixty thousand troops three hundred and fifteen thousand were lost on the battle feel tan scan eighty seven per cent lost of russia standing ground forces before the invasion now russia has been relying on for example the wager group and a a bunch of others or private militias in order to fill that yap they have been conscripting people in large numbers the basic paten theory here is out lasts the west and it is possible that he can out lasts the west because the west number one has not make clear an offal every war where the west does not make clear an offal is a war that than up using and two it is possible he can not last the west because the democrats art art apparently more interesting political game then even in in providing the funding that is necessary to you crane there they would rather blame republicans for not getting the funding than actually get the funding that is ems to be the pattern here s a chucktium rob out there stumping for more aid to you crane he said es cutting's alensky and saying that russia is going to win here if an insolently made it is clear how he needs help but if he gets the help he can win this war and he outlines in some great detail a the find of help he needs and how will help can win evens many of our republican colleagues talked about we we are winning this war and if we get the help that if he gets the help he needs he will win on the other hand he made it clear and we all made it clear that if we lose gotten winds o can bit i do not understand what you mean by winds and loses let say the to borderstay where they are that is what you you crane is winning e united states won i gat that first all as always the united states has interest distinct from those of any other country is rat's interest are not always the united states interest you cranes interest are not always the unitedstates interest we are nation with our own national interest obviously we when it comes to the you crane war the america national interest was in crippling the russia military to prevent it from fighting of future wars against dato allies and breaking the dato a lines and for those who are sort of there there is this wear pattern that happens now that have seen in form policy which is wen an't a various power does he bad thing we then immediately blame the institution that was standing in the way when the drunk driver hit is the old lady crossing the street within blame the old lady for having been there it is really weird when compass attack is daily citizens in the goa envelopes at but why were they even that should israel even exist i don't even know when it comes to russia invading you grants well should why why do we need dato om because russia does things invade you crane now would be the reason why you need dato and georgia and easily and a bunch of other areas and any case the bottom line here is that russia has already lost heavy in terms wit is military is been crippled economically it is been crippled militarily the united states arty achieved it is goal right there what exactly is the engulf and this is where the by administration is not even articulating an engulf they are making at political and stead their well as long as it takes with whatever it takes in if you oppose it you love gotten and also were not on give you border security to even get what we want out of this that looks politic ant does not look a care very much what happens in you ran actually if you if you hold that position it is very similar to the anti global warming position that also says we we do not want new clear power well if you if you do not want carbon missions you need new clear power wellie you want you crane funding you need border funding you need changes to borer all these these two things are a package and yet the democrats e more interest in the virtue signaling than the actual funding for the thing they say they want you crane funding pellet to that momentarily

ben for the special deal o a again there is confusion that is raining at the white house on you crane policy on the one hand theta to want all the funny n one forever and now on whether hand tit into well gang give up nothing in order to achieve this john curly from the national security advisory he says we want you crane supporting what as long as it takes on then why do not you explain what exactly did you want did you mean you want to support you crane as long as it takes for russia out to invade the rest of you crane because i agree with that if what you mean is as long as it takes to free don basin crime i do not agree with that because that is the thing that is not going to happen in the absence of simply handing you crane tremendous air power it is not going to happen to change the situation on the ground here is john curly not articulating the in point when ask how long you are support feu crane will continue he says as long as it takes over and over and over again was he wrong no in fact that still his intention hill we want to be able to support you crane for as long as it takes the obviously we would all love this war to be over to morrow if it could be in terms that are acceptable to the craned people but mister mouton shows absolutely no desire in ending this war sitting down and negotiating it all in fact quite the contrary he is now attacking energy and fit structure with miles and drones trying to weapons winter and we know that his forces on the ground are trying to go on an offensive in the east there is no indication that he is slowing down if you crane stops fighting that is the end of you crane well it is on about you crane stopping the fighting it is about what exactly they are fighting over is it more territory in that on basso crime if do not see exactly what your offered hurts but again i think a lot outhit is now about pestering hoiden yesterday he was speaking about you ran music well done re publicans the ruffians love you no we need fully appreciate fully appreciate how is wrong how this is been used around the world and been used by russia russia loyal is to mascot celebrated we re when re publicans voted to block on crane a last wee the host of a scrambling on so bitterly said my cow well don republicans that is good for us and a to we said it again this host of a scrambling run shows a well done republic gs that is good for us that is e mission speaking if you been celebrated by russia proper gander might be trine to reach the what you do a or you could make a deal with the republicans who you control the house and our halftime's with you on the senate you could do that thing but you are not doing that thing and instead we now have an impasse again this makes no political sense to me mobile in one in twenty twenty at least the democratic primaries and probably the precedency because his appearance was that of ha moderate not because he ran to his hard last he did not he ran directly toward the middle that was his entire piece was mean old person and ism not going to do anything transformation then of course he went into office and he started putting equity all over the federal government he started spending on unprecedented amounts of money and he undermine our national security aby with drawing an afghanistan an all the rest that but the thing that won him election last time it was his supposed moderation and now hes running directly away from that and republicans are offering him an offeramp right here republicans by basically saying to him hey what long change border law and the we'll give you you craning they are offering him a win win he can now go back to his left to space hey less and i did not want to do anything bout the word of a re publicans force me to it and then he go to middle america say hey i did something about the border i that is something he could do but he is not doing it which means that he is held hostage by his left wing base which is a heard thing to be held hostage wagon one of the issues were dona trump is going to hammer the living crap out of him if trump is de hominy which we presume he will be given the poles of this point if trump is not nominee it does not matter of it if it is it is this answer shaley they will hammer him over the border hin being able to say i changed border policy should try to stop the flood at the border would be a smart thing it would be smart it would defray some of the cost of his crab bordepolicy far but he is not doing any of that much mac call who again is pro funding for you crane he say lo could deal is practically impossible your not in a budge on the border i a sad is craftily possible even no recoin present to crafted i i see i has the for christian that do not mean it out word and even though were been emphasizing the border i wonder remind everybody of the importance of you you can get i mean again my call once you crane funding and even he is ting there is no deal without border meanwhile speaker the house my johns he says all ere going to need the border first a mean what is the hard but i do not think it is a a radical proposition to say that if we are going to have a national security supplemental package it ought to begin with our own nations purity first and and it'll explain to him that while we understand that have made my position very clear literally since the day was hand of the naval that we have to take cure of our border firs well i mean again this is a very consents his position in the united states we do not our border being open we do not sentinel being smuggled over the border do not any of that stuff and saying sure would give you cranemore funding to prevent russia from overrunning it but also ween need to solidify our own border white the fact that this is even remotely controversial for democrats i want to know the counter argument what is the counter argument right here all they can say i meet honestly all they can say is we wish or part of a separate bill why they could reject the border aid and then they could pass thou cranage but they should just pass both and here is democratic enter remark belles from a arizona which is a border state and even he sang that we need some changes on the border but you know in image to mobile name t pretend these two things should be separated we have provided wore support for bort of petrol we need to do more the president supplement had a funding in there for sorta patrol agency asylum officers judges a these are the things we a green awe are talk to about your cranage is really maticarriang o is things a funding for into pay cob with a secure issues with chin o lame leave it t at at that a for this the being caught up in the politics of the border would be a mistake why whys car for the pout just just do the thane what the white house is making some signals at might do the things maybe reason is starting to penetrate there you always wonder according to see be news the bid administration on tuesday indicates congressional a makers would be willing to support a new border authority to expel migrants without asylum screenings as wells a dramatic expansion of emigration to mention and deportations to convince re publicans to back ad so crane for people familiar with matter told we be news the white house informed senate democrats it could back of those sweeping an hardline emigration policy changes as part of the negotiations over biding emergency funding request it roughly one hundred billion dollar package that whose military as u crane israel and ti want during a press conference at the white house on tuesday widen said that his teem is working with tenant democrats and re publicans to try to find ay by partizan compromise both in terms of changes in policy and to provide at resources we need to secure the border apparently home lent security secretary of a hunger mails has been deployed to engage with negotiators in the senate this week specifically the white house is indicated it would support a new far reaching legal authority to allow yous border officials to summarily expel migrants without processing their asylum clams that measure would effectively revive titleforty to you re member title forty to and easily citizen we got cove it here when i can a let yet in just go away i would allow officials to pause yours asylum law without a public health justification the administration would also back an nation white expansion of a process known as expected removal that allows emigration officials to aport migrants without quart hearing if they do not ask for asylum or if they failed their initial asylum interviews that program is currently limited to the border region moreover the white house would be willing to mandate the detention of certain migrant or allowed into the country pending the adjudication of their flames which by the way would mount to waive for a wedvart within cages why because it would mount to having families we are held into mention but kids are not allowed to be held intention and they would be exiled and you would end up with either kid is in cages with the families or you non a with kid separated from their parents a in the cages right the there is no easy way to do this without just closing the boarder which is the thing the the bine administration is not willing to do whit that sad these are actual concessions re publicans should obviously ratchet those concessions the way that they want and if the white house is going to sign on to it till act be a god political move for them i would not count on them making a good political move however because there politically in competent which brings us to the latest from the israel commissar yesterday jobidon stepped in the dude and then had to have his nightjars clean it up yesterday he a was speaking at pack apparently are at the home of o pack present in former papa president less rozenburg and he said that israel was losing international supportings war against compass first of all who gets a fling international support aba been who is the former yuan ambassador from israel he said that if there are you an resolution that the earth was flat and that israel had flattened it it would pass a hundred and sixty three to thirteen with twenty obsessions i mean that is was go ad happened yesterday the you an general assembly had a resolution calling for a cease fire and goa who supported one sixty three the ten votes against and thirteen abstentions who cares what yuan has at the international comma international community oh no what of the frenchgan with a woo a what why would israel stop killing the terrorist they need who kill in order to preserve their own security because because so can is use by thew's dancing one w them because the big a country that did not vote in favor of the noises fire what why would israel be like super oh gosh oh no what are we going to do if china does not support us killing terrors in the gosestrip ridiculous ridiculous kind of stud what what exactly was his warning he said that nittinyaw who quote have to change this government the government in israel is making it very difficult he said ultimately israel cannot say notes wat palistonian state which is really hardliners oppose he said what we have an opportunities begins unite the region and they still on do it but we have to make sure baby understands he got to make some moves to strengthen et cannot say not to a palistonian state that is going to be the hard part the times israel reported the widens ad putnitinaw who is a good friend but i believe he needs to change that would be referring to his colishan partners those would be betzalle ostrich star benkveer so members of the right wing block in his coalition don said what one of the things beefy understands that israel security can rest on the united states but right now it has more than the united states it has the e you it has rope has want most of the world supporting them but there starting to lose that support by indiscriminate bombing that takes place he is such he's such a dullard israel is not indiscriminately bmbangaza if israel were indiscriminately bombing gosh you would not be talking about seventeen eighteen thousand people dad in gaze a huge percents give them terrorist you would be talk about hundreds of thousands of people dead if israel were indiscriminately woman gaze israel has far drop to proximately twenty two thousand bombs a passionately seventeen thousand people have been killed ta going to come ass the statistic which means that for every boy drop point seven seven people are being killed maybe do not now ho boys work typically bombs to more than point seven seven people when they are dropped in populated areas seal's ben deliberately avoiding exactly that sit not indiscriminate it is i ridiculous language from bison and steam had to walkaback yesterday the other thin it is ridiculous is bison and the left continuing to play this game has though policy be wildly different if the government were made up of somebody that did not include but solomon rich and it is your bedcover hits a hold over from the judicial from the judicial reform nonsense in israel is that oh mi hotspur just the different government while that that government be much more conciliatory toward the terrorist piston and authority nope nope because first of all gestures in the government right now it is a unity government deny goes is part of the government guidon say impart of the government a you have to not know anything about his rally politics to suggest the right now the drivers of the boss when it comes to the war cabinet in israel are et tour hangover and besolosmot rich it is not true it is any remotely true it is i its stupid it is it it is the equivalent of saying that right now the people who have the most weight inside the by ministershar mite johns mishmcconall nope it is turns out that in this unity war time cabinet the people who have the most say right now are you benny goes who is the leader of the opposition party when tie to now it s what biting here is saying ridiculous obviously an due and again he keeps saying these stupid things in the belief that if he sort of takes a middle road position that he is on winsupportis on all sides which he is not going to just words o the wise hen you take a political position that pleases no one it tends to please no one and that is kind what jobiton is doing right now first what to green eggs your

war are very obvious and and ridiculous yesterday jobidon was talking about the israel compass war and he sail israel has not a duty to innocent palistinians just going after compass hell you know that that is tat does not mean that they get to kills it is not israel killing israel is the only party i miss conflict that gives any dams at all about the civilian which makes it much harder for israel when youknow insulting it is libido as san yesterday israel loss ten soldiers that is a lot of soldiers phrasal a israel is not a large country everybody knows everybody ay aye friends in israel are going to shivacalls which are the morning calls literally everyday for soldiers are being killed in israel a being killed right now in the gossistrip the only reason those soldiers are dating is because h israel is not using its own unbridled power in order to finish off compass israel is instead putting it is own sons and alters in harms way they are putting them in urban street to street fighting and warfare in a in a really rough and difficult attempt to distinguish comasnex from actual civilians because one o the things companies love to do is shield themselves with actual villains which is we there is plenty of video available of comas literally shooting civilians as they attempt to escape warzones it is whycomass is firing rockets from civilian designated sights wit is why they use you and denotes in order to fire rockets it is what they do while jobidon is doing this ridiculous routine about how israel be in discriminated and israel murals putting his own soldiers and harms we able to shogovido this released by the idea this is what combat actually looks in the gossistrip as israel soldiers are wounded going house to house thees an actual peace a foot age released by the idea of his body camfootage in this particular video those who cousin what you will see is an israel soldier firing at a commas terrorist the comas terrorist he killed come terra but the commas terra horse a serrated grenade most up he israel soldier is wounded he then proceeds well wounded to kill another compass terrace that point blank range he is going room to room you cannot see anything this is what action orbit combat wit i newmotr by i alter being in discriminate it is insulting to what these rely soldiers are doing right now mud be similarly insulting if we said that it the way it was insulting when borakoboma back in to thousand at you'll recall actually suggested that america was indiscriminately bombing civilians in afganistandurember he said this into thousand are was deeply insulting to america soldiers were instead going house to house risking their own lives not to kill civilians many of whom were being used as human shields by terrorists the sort of stuff is its it is it is war talk for people who literally know nothing about war that is that that is what jobidon is doing right here when jobidon says israel is being indiscriminate he is honestly he is doing humiliation to the dead is rally soldiers fare going house to house right now in the gosestrip many of them coming out wounded for life or dead anywhere here is jobidon doing this ridiculous retire the foster mussorsponsibillity going after sons to true to pop to cancan and won i do not this this entire notion that israel is not attempting to mini civilian casualties well its own people are being killed is insane it is insane israel been doing this for thirty years since sola and it is it is the roughest job counter in urgency is the roughest job in the military any military and israel been doing it for thirty years in getting again it is only eighteen nineteen twenty year old son and daughters killed by going into the areas specifically in attempt to avoidsvilling casualties then you have this old tottering fulaglebon mindescrunn meanwhile take mulligan the national security adviser he said that he would carried tolidine concerns about the duration of the conflict when he travels to israel later this we quote ti will certainly be talk in a price menicsternitinaho an the war cabinet and the senior national secure leadership about time tables not her the thing about that the subject of how they are seeing the time table of this war will certainly be on the agenda for all of my meeting out just like to point outright here that the white house position when it comes to you crane has been as long's it takes with as much tat takes without any end point knowing that the borer is not going to move in don was and crime they ben doing this in you crane since february of to those an twenty two it is now remember of twenty twenty three that is fully twenty two months twenty two months of war and the white house systolic we you'd sixty more billion dollars for you cranial an obviously man as long's it takes for all whatever as long's it takes israel has been at war since october seven is currently remember thirteenth an of thing count that is a a little over two months a littler to months and jiksones when is his think an end already won's it on end already meanwhile the united states not provided anywhere near the level of military aid the united states is provided you ran not remotely what is the different the difference is the left wing presser when it comes to israel is significantly larger then the left wing press on it comes t you crane by the way i just should point out at this point that literally the only reason why the left is supportive of you crane as supposed to russia he is because of russiageght an twenty sixteen it is the only reason when borak bomb was president the left was support of of russia when borakoboma was president he was making obsessions to russia syria in crime in the don was and the entire left was is paten a badly i do not know it women seems to want the form policy of the nineteen eighties back then in twenty sixteen there is a widespread perception on the left that hillside client could not have legitimately just lost the election it had to be russia interference and a that point bloom flanmerputtent goes from hurt do villain and suddenly the crane war is the greatest war that has ever been fought the only war that matters now some let us been pretty consistent flanerputten is a fug russia has been in oligarchic quasi terror response for state for decades really since putter to over in early two thousands nance annatto thousand some has been fully consistent across the board what is wear to me is how everybody on both sides flight when brokabamls present the rights got russia man they are terrible and then trample as present and because the left decided that russia was terrible many on the right wedlock will may be cassia's good now then no russia was always the same punt has notching but what is amazing about this to get back to the israel situation is it the same people horsing no time table an you can ever no time table keep it going forever those some people are its been two months in israel israel needs to stop i mean international pressure an all o man what or the french going to thing i don't know that be supercareful about the polish real o my gosh were really really concerned about what the netherlands is onto think about all this an it is it is just it is just ridiculous meanwhile the media doing the work of compass its is truly incredible how the medals dedication to the fundamental principle which is that if you are an unsuccessful nation if you're if you're a nation that is rife with terror if you're nation that is rife with the anti americanism somehow the must be something good about you it is truly amazing an somehow if you are a more powerful nation that has built up its military and has guaranteed writes for its on citizens that somehow you're victimizer an here is a sign an anchor bores ranch has questioning is really spokesman margrave about the number of dad in gaze now again no one has ever done this in a war before a i this was not underling the iciswar nobody's i gory got how many people regretting killed in the ices word many people are dying nobody this worth in talks about really during the afghan or the rock war but suddenly when israel hast you taken action in order to maintain its own security for the future after the worst terror attack in its history then all the student gold my god this is too many people getting killed does not matter by way how many f them a terrace according to sane here ago on the question a of titan suggesting that israel is losing global support a does that influence the thinking of the is really government in anyway think it is become clear given whit the new an security council try to push forward this week that the new as blot that the world is not o ka with the eighteen thousand plus people that have been reported killed many of them women and children in gaze does this in anyway alter what is real is trying to accomplish or at leas the way that it approaches it is war with commons well fistful ours the stare ace an is the otermati as either bars is note math e e israel majorly there at the ani mass and tho we thing a takes we very predicted e that that the to that we had the amen america to peseta protection were to predated her bistro an the es as we ne full in this it is crucial that we win this war it is crucial that we de the t cousin doing in pay we have to do everything we can to save god agasoncs to be ins than we have to do everything we can to make they get the ad the they need by the way worth noting right here that again zero people would be dying if comas just surrender compass will not surrender and people will continue to die it really is that simple meanwhile while the west continues to fascinate and the west continues to pretend that terra are not terrorists and that evil people are not evil the soothes continued to watch it up all of the problems with shipping throat the middle east according to the wallstraternal demons toothy forces have attack several commercial ships crossing through the bob elmandub straight in recent days writing a new front in the battle between israel and harass complicating efforts by the united states in in allies to secure that critical shipping lane we the rebels claim responsibility on tuesday for strike on the norwegians tanker string a day earlier off demon's coast as the eonian ally escalates attacks to destruct the love cargoes in response to fighting in gaze now can new point out here that western military power compared to toothy pirates our bunch of ill armed dolts tea why is this even in issue we have just obliterate them if they are in those waters put some ships in the water if the soothes put up a drone shoot it down and then kill the people who are firing the drone if they put a little boat in the water with bunch of terrace on it blow up the boat what what why are we pretending that this is difficult when it is clearly not particularly difficult isn't amazing amazing thing why and the ans we is because you would not want a convey to the erronians that we are militant meanwhile ran is at war with the united states it does not mean that we have to go in and do regime change does not mean that we need to go boy tavern doesn't mean towehave the allies inside the regime that be capable of handling the place if we were to boy patron what it does mean is it is proxy groups our pin pricks compared to the power of western military might and we are letting them hold up shipping and that will cost people money by the way we can pretend that none of this has any real world the fact wat the reality is that the bob eland of straight the place that the soothes are running around high jacking ships an and firing things of them that is the route by which ten present of literally all global trade passes the united states ow the western powers that is we blowing the soothes out of the water when they do tat instead there are fussing oh is it really a problem whichshoul we do of this is troublesome you notes more troublesome is when iron starts tormenting more and more conflict around the region which by the way is by the west should also be standing against cosballah being in the south of lebanon right now israel is issuing all sorts of warnings tohisballah move move north move about thirty miles north and get the hell off that border because right now you have got our entire country in rock at ranging we are not going to leave it that way the western similarly make it clear to line's government that ten balas needs to move off that border m meanwhile commasleaters are apparently fleeing cuter the cater government apparently told them that if they stayed that israel might kill them that is at least a positive no hopefully israel will killed them because at there some of the world's most evil human beings apparently they left for an unknown at destination they turned off their phones they are not exception calls now apparently a senior member of commas also left his usual residence in bout for turkey compass much on the run from aside that they o leaving countries that ta they feel arevulnitable in favor of presumably iron and turkey sing which a furnish law maker yesterday a he was preaching against israel and he started screaming about how israel will not be able to escape the wrath of god and then things went wrong for him eyes the tee o not love other teen no eye body no o no loathe thing the truth will not be silent if only you could be save from the torments of history a canna e saved from the wrath of blah som it israel salutations to a hart attack down he is in serious condition i just appoint out that the furnish government is one of the leading terresponsors in the middle east well being a dato member anti at the the uselesslesstovate of dato stoptokn mat crane say hung a turkey which is indeed a disaster area of a country meanwhile jobidon is continuing to have all sorts of trouble on the economy the new inflation report is out and it is not particularly good according to brightbart the inflation report released tuesday as unlikely to do much to support the idea that by comics has been boon for the america economy the consumer price insects climbed i zeropoint one per cent on a monthly basis an acceleration from being flat in october the annual increases at three point one per cent now remember we are supposed to be seeking a two per cent rate of increase three looks good when compared what was ten but stillotks really bad when compared t two is fully fifty per cents off the number thatyouare looking for bid supporters o mending the establishment financial media our saying that this is well below nine per cent but i letters point out that in elation fell to three point one per cent annualized in tune and then spent the next for months rising again and now is back at three point one per cent and it is all baked into cake it is not as though an inflation the rate of inflation goes to three per cent that means that the prices are going back down they're not they are going up they're just going up slower this is why join remains an unpopular president see crag center a share brown i i love that he continues to promote the idea that inflation is a result of corporate of corporate evil or something a suppose o shooting money into the america economulicors strip club here is shard brown doing his retain john stand to to the me tack he at trestle knows what that does to fruit prices and he knows what it does to farmers wagers and the same that i stand up the wall stark on stand up to trug copes and voters voters do not carryon party if your standing up for avatar scrub om that that screw over people an when when on people all go to the grocery store a there wrinkly their pang when their their grocer prices go up because their pang for exacutabonises and its stock bypass and that is pretty clear and voters voters understand that when you talk about the in well i mean act voters are not going to blame inflation on corporabibacs that that is a dog that is not going to hunt by any stretch of the imagination as he action notes over alley pad rose is your point one present nonmember as dropping gasoline price s dragged the over all insects down but while the headline dress steadily lower the carp measure is stock beneath the surface by so measures is pushing higher the index rose at a three point four per cent annualized pace over the past three months as recently as gust to as two point four per cent by that measure again the at the idea that that the fed is about ready to lower the intrestrats again that obviously is untrue and democrats are looking for somebody to blame for their own failures here is want yelling who has been a terrible treasury secretary blaming bovid for the continuing inflation and the stagnating economy why do you think there is this is connect and are you concerned about the fact the the administrations deserter an by the comic is not landing i think we have we have been through a lot everybody's the pandemic cause enormous amount to disruption in peoples lives and on we are still in the after mat of whats been serious shock and we had serious global shots and all their price is to rising at a much slower pace than they were in elation is substantially often ties the live prices of somethings that people bi and are important to them are higher everything is going amazing according want yelling in except for the votes which are not going amazing for jobidon he is in serious electoral trouble ardyfolks in just one second we will be getting to the latest in the twenty twenty fort race where the governor of new hampsure has now

seethe fair everybody is stuck with each other a it is hard to move way and ways were quitters to day we have a stay of a very different group of neighbors in a very different place the man moves in who breaks all kinds of rules and the neighbors have to figure out what to do about it and nobody backs down nerbybe as chicanes this america life a more a glass stay with us at one home home near the range s we your back tor here takes place not in a city but in a small town in ferment pall at german think rolling green hills red barns and pretty peaceful until a stranger comes to town buys up stand the neighbors are an exactly show what to make of the sky and then problem start an things escape and he pretty serious and intense way probably because this new guy not only does he not played by the rules he back he seems to feed off breaking them the strike can be the rest of our someday or put him i girlie tells what happen it all started with a gate a man named dance bonier but a wooded thirty acre property between some farmland and a slate quarry back an twenty thirteen the neighbors since he much of him for a while they know his construction vehicles rumbling up and down the road and the figure in was building a house many hurt and her husband rich on a farm next or angel's property here is many a good friend of ours uptown that property and he sold the property to him and the very first time we met him he came down to the farm and he was actually he was o cay om but the next thing renew is two weeks later he was erecting a gat on our property angel's land is actually surrounded by other people's property it is kind an island in order to access it he has the right to cross the hole's land there is a long driveway dance put a gate at his end of it but his gate was on the bullets property many in richer in their forties they have two kids the own lot of farmland an a trucking company rich grew up there his family been in the area since before the civil war rich approached him in said you do know that ye put the gate li an a ten feet on to our property and he is all but my gate wherever i want u for my gate and right join in for mot we don't we put a gate on er own property or on the proper line not on somebody ease's property and you have i think he gave him two or three weeks three move it if ye do not om tin to come remove it and he is your never ghetto getting get that o the ground he gave him two or three weeks and he did not move it i t went up with a payloater and o brought a witness for them as well and just piss it up off out of the ground and tossed it onto his property back gun to his own property the that things whereof to about start dance was a new comer to the area he was from ut state new york but other than that he was guarded about his background told one neighbor he don in the army then there was a rumor around town that he been a navy senor or federal agent or something it was not clear and just a word about the place he moved to this part of fault it is bit isolated up on a hell thereabout does households all spread out along couple of roads there are the rules john dais of the around that in his wife bow then down the hill is back to cat a former librarian in her husband ray palm ma shell to lander a grandparent moved the areal about ten years ago he were pretty private here but the help each other out this is ray and shell who was one house conferment all shall hole her next fur to me to this fit all that knows get a say yer graven emergency a me first don't call in one not but course the cops will not show but i will and that is the way were all round here most them came here for the landscape in the quiet and then one day the woods erupted with gunfire hundreds and hundreds of grounds this is bath moved to cat the former librarian i mean it was just shooting on a daily basis de e de d d de d de de de de de d i want a point out pula is not a gushy found bat told me that on fire is the sound of for mound she is a long time and away member the areas mixed politically some of the neighbors to her for from others went providing but none of them has a problem with fire ans farmers have their varment guns and hunters have their rifles d no one about an i at a neighbor doing some practice with an air of fifteen this was different we did not know what was going on the li sounds get now this is shell colander the grandmother who lives with her husband pal ye earn for it you expect to hear somebody out there poking away at their targets getting ready for turkey season or hunting season or we just keeping their their fire arms in to o we do that that is expected but not what we heard that was totally out of his own oh did you did you try reproaching the point no at that point i was to afraid to approach anybody that was firing that much weaponry because that that is just not that is not normal certainly for this area oh i do not think i would want approach anybody that was firing off you do not thousand rounds that is carry dance had ope up a gun range he john dais to be at nonfat which kept off about it by a friend on got in his trot and drove up and down the hill knocking on doors to alert everyone he told me it was pal river's ride many culet and another neighbor walk the property line around angel's place he peered through the trees and saw some silhouette targets in dirk burns mantel worried that some one would end of shooting towards the road wand the trajectory of those bullets is actually right to my brother most house and men right to the school righto in the he the neighbors did not ant a shooting range in their back yard dance had filed for a permit not t open a shooting range but for what he called a school apparently where he would do class from fire arms instruction in order to build the school on his property dance need permission to widened his driveway through the neighbor's land he asked the cults if they would give him the extraspace culet said no his neighbors on the other side said know as well dance percent application for a school was denied but he would a ready put up the building and he just kept going he also did not have the right permit to operate a shooting range on his land but of course he was doing that to but he was developing was a sprawling facility the kind that military contractors or lawnforcemen for a self styled militia might use he called at slate ridge i shout to dance he did not want to be interviewed but he laced the whole thing out in the shoo to radio slate ridge is one hundred per cent predicated on the practicing mot on filters professionals that use the firearm as at tool in the line of their employment danielis six feet tall and stouts if he bushy beard lot's how he talks not to jargon si soothe video was shot by a dude named madam my clean who associates himself with the boogaloo boys an are movement that calls for civil war his twitter hands is who jahaden this is is is range wanness is this is whats started go slate ride right i built this first and i you do not continue to frosted enough to proceed on ma drain he shows madam the friend is surprisingly fancy bunk house in two shooting ranges one with the rap round burn that intended to let people fire in multiple directionless the more closely mirror zeolite combat there is a spot where people can practice entering and clearing a building and a place where they could detonate explosives after the tour dance madam sit down for an interne your proper contractor is i hollow we bout comfort for for several years sever years s er years year in the video angel's wearing green military style cargo pans in green rap round shades he tells madam the origin story of slate ridge or he says the idea came to him on his first oversees employment as a private military contractor i remember that day he was yes yesterday a bunked up with about twelve guides that i had no idea who they were i did not know much about them i i tried out with these guys i i i made it on the team and then we get we get the right weren't of the not as ties of america and were worth and that night when we hid our bunks i watched with all do respect because some of those guys i become very good friends with some of those guides are arm abautlebodies now and some of those guys a i would leave for them but a lot of then turned into a totally different person o here we had men prying shivering and second guess in themselves and i sat there and i watched these men and i said wile what did i get myself into the problem was they were not properly train he side to start his own training facility tells madam he put one point six million hours of his own money as building the place to dance slatebridch's more than the shooting range the place for people who defined themselves by owning goes he refers to himself as a professional gun fight you do not in the military we ha the three es the miss the man in me i always tat the last ism an army guy he tells madam dance talks about his service lot at one town meeting where he made his case for the school building he described himself as a veteran whose passionate about goes he paints his work as a private contractor in patriotic terms in sort he tells state judge a a a a an to in on fore i a a e la we s in o travel for a the ta t to than the neighbors wondered if even the most basic part of his biography that he would been in the military was a lie john dais to be at nonfat was not sure he bought it he fear of vet its nothing more this reputable somebody claims to the something he is and a i have no use for people go around in act litter something they as after site ridge open at the end of twenty seventeen is face book page racked up a few thousand followers dance start referring to them as the slate ridge family he host to class is shooting and tactical training and feel for it are the neighbors would see strangers driving up and down their shredder road sometimes the shooting would go on all week the neighbors had been all that close before the started just friendly in that small town kindly but the conflict with dance brought them together they start meeting an john danishes workshop sometimes a couple does people would show up their weapon of choice was as america as the windcheater rifle theogony laws those most base look rooms for how neighbors o going to live next to one another this area was owned residential and agricultural danielwent back to the town and argued for variance in this owning laws could finally get a permit for the school building forty six peoples find competition opposing this they showed up at the town meeting in force here is ma shell yen i thought maybe de town would step in and we would go to couple board meetings we thought for sure it would be brought into control it'd say within six months there is no recording of the meeting were dance asked for theiszowning variance but there is official minutes this kind of captures the feeling of it quote marry haddock addressed aboard as an abutting rundown or an interested party mister hadtica explained that as an owner of a horse table they have a lot to lose that they do not want to live through a war and that they were there first he expressed that he wishes to stay on their property and his entitled to peace and quiet but the towns owning board decided in dance favor said he was right he could have his owning variance for the shool building the neighbors appealed for the next few years he would applied for permits they tried to stop him sometimes they want sometimes he wan and made appeal to the town or the state court eventually the town ofpolit took the neighbor's side and to the case against dance too for violating itszowning was but this kind of thing can move really slowly bat the former librarian knew the states environ mental laws and looked for a way to use them against dance she peered into his property from a neighbor's yard one day and notice what looked wetlands those are often protecting in verdant which is no small thing because the state contract down on people for even small seeming environmental problems manure they now we were farmers we are allowed to spread manure aril fifteenth we start to spread our manure and remember fifteenth is are cut off remember sixteenth comes along and you spread agency of natural resources would be quick here on a fly on why and we would be fine e that is an of our mentors she was on local conservation board at time the beautiful she contact of the states department of agriculture and the natural resources board trying to get some one to investigate there was no quicker pins nobody stepped in to stop dance and it was all falling upon death ears who'll we go to who do we tell who we talk til dance fought back in not just in the town hall on the court in the winter of twenty nineteen the neighbors got holiday cards with the slate ridge local printed on them each one had the hand written message here is shell to lander the grandmother and john dais e pal virga he ad every all of us in the neighborhood got one and some of them were pretty pretty have mine yes you the hand i got to gather with the group of these neighbors on bat's front lawn she set on a table with muffins and gunman don's coffee pay rs mine some of them are

holiday season people hate you to in beds we are fortunate you are our neighbors please feel free to move away because no one likes old o ballocks was we we have a front portion in the somewhere after at the end of the day will sit out here and have a beer but ut this is i me miss trout typical is at are all specially are all in beds we are allies did you want me to readouts at loss is disgusting the cards we in these binders the neighbor's brought them to the meeting in his huge plastic ben the kind you story close in the reach label carefully with label maker there's pallet his owning regulations and slate ridge casebook postings and odds and ends slashed unfinished business w re this was the moment i realized how much the conflict with dance had taken over the neighbors lives there is enemy twenty of these binders inside ore all the pieces of information that the neighbors had spent the last few years obsessively documenting about dance in slate ridge me shall wish is to sand inside this blinder here threats post of cards and an n also some stocking problems here oo gat all threats everything the tragic keep it compiled be i asked the neighbors were the keep the binders and they would not tell me the only say it was a remote block facility here is pal describing a fateful post the gotten one the binders it was on the slavering page weep us a picture of our house any captain did any day above ground is i just a good day these people will be leaving soon a a had you felon a open om safe and is sis john dais again ages john and his wife moved awful at

right for some one has written the words or culet trucking down it that is named one the businesses the halftone if you think you can hide in your car me think on the door from a bullet you are on many huwilid eventually got a no stalking order against dance and the slaters face wait pages down now but the neighbors say was not just threats but accusations smears and that waterage supporters would then and comment on the posts it is just a originates idle threats and it is it is just once again psychologies my or er i son if h has cockle heads it is bee going up there takes it a different way and takes it to another level yes they worried about dance supporters a few of the people training at slate ridge suggested on line that they were affiliated with the national milting groups the creeper centers or a small local outfit with the grandiose name of the remount state militia some of the neighbors did go to the police but non of the things that dance and his supporters were doing seemed likely to bring criminal charges at cut be really hard to prosecute threats these unless are very pacific dance din just go after the neighbors he may not sound the town itself was conspiring against him they were a on league with rules who he saw as his main opposition here he is at one town meeting accusing the board of treating him unfairly i bell tistemo of is t cold it the interest i suppress my i i miss is iris duty in three pass nodaniel points out that sons a board member has work for the trucking company owned by the culet family then he pivots to a different and very surprising attack further furor ti man has no tend a land you y the to the meeting he talking about is one of the ones the neighbors held to stratagize about shutting down dance slate ridge but angels calling it a clan meeting as in the culex clan he saying the neighbors are the a a cay this is part of a long running and conpletetle unsubstantiated clam of his that pole is somehow run by we

up is attacks in the town one post on the elaterite face with age included a picture of pole us town hall and said no alarm no security camera single pan windows no dead bolts thirty to forty minutes police response time dad's one for all sell service no safer people wrote in the comments that it was as soft target and noted the women on staff often were late another post urged supporters to assemble at a town meeting with weapons and tomcats though none of them actually showed up there were other problems to an two thousand eighteen angel's band from pace university were he would been studying for a masters degree in home land security he would allegedly sent a been death threats over ten message that led to a judge's orders spending his pistol permanent in new york requiring dance to surrender his fire arms when police search his house they found a handgun which sled prosecutors in new york to charge him with two felonies for criminal possession those are not resolved yet according to a prosecutor majority of angel's pistols were transferred out of state presumably to permit up on the all and poult the conflict was threaten the final a sign posted on angel's property read rest pass here die here one night two boys were beau hunting on the culet us property here is what happened next according to allegations made to police they shot a deer and tracked to angel's land as they approached panel came down and threatened them one boy called his dad things desolated when dance asked them to identify themselves they refused and then dance sad oke you want play that gan it'll shoot you nobody got hurt in an dance disputer that he threatened anyone no chargers were filed coming out what a my girly looks into angel's back round to try ti rigor at who dance really is and just how worried the neighbors should be that is in a minute chico bublicadie when to proem continues is merlin life my re last to days program do not you be my neighbor what beady must t the hour to day to the stop of polled verdant and what happened when one new person moved in this next part of the story but what a my girly this to answer the questions that last of people in town had about their new neighbor here is my i sacred writing about magician groups and civil violence last year ever since i begetting meals from people who were afraid of their neighbors there was a tenners woman who suspected that hers were getting ready for quote a blood bath a michigan man who asked me if he should report a high school friend to authorities because of his face book posts people wan me to help them figure out how dangerous was their neighbor that was how i heard about waterage and dance some one who lives in your pole sent me a message ask no if i might want to investigate you can drive yourself crazy these days wondering if everyone threatening violence as serious or only trolling when i was interviewing people in militia groups last year for example often had the feeling that was all just posturing that all their talk about civil violence was just a mask for other anxieties then some people of filial with these groups according to the the my at leas to part in the attack on the yours capital people coffee m they are not really serious until they are dance boner's neighbors do not know house cared they should be of him ti command culet said in one moment that he is probably just full of hot air but also has that no stalking order against him and she wrote a casebook post saying she wanted people to know about angel's threats in case anything never happened to her and thou all their researcher to dance in the end neighbors really do not know that much about his background i spoke on the come of than couple times but he would not let me record him and he was a five about almost every question i ask i spoke to the head of public safety in verdant the major from the state police who was their point person for dance and some one from the german intelligent center in ages he that coordinates between local and federal lonforcemen i haven't sent his you to idea with madam the boogaloogay to a recently retired agent from the of the my but in the end the person who knew them more about dance was his ex's wife denim a hard angels they met in nineteen ninety two when she was sixteen and he was nineteen at our local mall there is a petzarea called roman belike and i can was the pets o man there he you said pets mam you mean of his on ism literally the pets a man he was the guy that was making the pies xenia told me we and dance both corrupt and up

sits on his back and that he was gotinto be coming home with a medical discharge pretty much two weeks to the day that i dropped him off at the airport i was picking him up again i because he had been discharged from the army for supposedly theorists that he never did anything a bout m supposed my medical discharge i i honestly do not know if that was the truth or if that was not the truth but i he was not in the army the national personal record sent or confirmed that angel's time in the army last at all with two weeks wat ways the needing in going to military honestly h was security just strictly financial security not because he had any sort of calling to do or sense of duty or nothing that literally just o you the for rides wit the house to live in money security health an assurance that sort of thing was he patronize you i not particularly know in talking with people close to dance i got the sense that he did not believe in anything very strongly he is not an ideal to he is not really magician type those is w warn for hours about the constitution but e does to present himself a some one with a mysterious past me be even a dangerous one from the time he met went the pet's chop she told me he was a just the he was connected with the coffin when john got died d two thousand to dance said he was distract that he had to go to the funeral she says he did not go in then

in the sweetish military the two of them met and an executive protection training course denmark gainsaid at the training dance rally impressed him he said looked he had real experience did he say he to what are not he tells the worklic had it been over sees had at been in high stress in environments like anything the y i said he had a oversees contracts and a a with he was government and also bit the prosector a and again it from my background i ism prove not to and ask questions as really its if if it is not my need to know that ism really on an ask any questions the idea was that warm dynamics would do security contracting and train people in military tactics the garnwebside had seals from the department of homeland security in other government agencies on it but hen told me that the never actually work for any of them he said dance had assured him it was o kat used to logos the outside also said the company was quote established in facility by lea military and government personnel was there aging also that was a the military oversee person on his i you o a a there was only the too it i do not know how he it how he had but but spaniel o enhancing the market billy of tether company release a you mot you moly fasten ties of entry experts friends i analysts a tell is experts on the ground sources provided towns to misicessn is that else just tat marketing eyes and there is a a picture o like e this wont is not a picture of his dues in the allotter and their faces ore world ow ye i that a stock follow i think it is he unsaid guard never got any contracts never did any trainings at least when he was there eventually dance seems be getting sucked more and more into his problems up in sermon and the company died dance also register a second company that is still active but i could find only one person on plankton who see he would work there and when i messaged him about this he leave it from is profile it is hard to say for sure of dance ever did work its private military contractor or if he did whether really entail dodging bullets in a rock as he once claim to me you cannot check that kind of thing through public rector's requests and people who do private contractor work also usually have to sign on disclosure agreements the other work dance says he is done his executive protection which is the business of guarding the rich and payments we were able to confirm one aspect of this dance work for a time on a detail protecting bench a per con sedative commentator though he was ultimately fired from that job oi spoke with a few people who consider themselves part of the slate ride family they see a totally different version of dance in the neighbors to a want the shut way is one of the founders of the vrermont state militia she says their survivalist they are pretty small group about ten members they train once a month she thirty two has four kids who called dance uncle dance she told me he is not dangerous at all he just some one who wants the share is knowledge about guns he taught them all fire arm safety she and the other mulish remembers drive about two hours to get to slate ridge you have know they are much closer ranges because the facility is nice and because dance is warm and welcoming she does not believe the neighbors are really a scared as they say she thinks there exaggerating their fears because they do not want a noisy shooting range in their neighborhood and they are afraid of change they haven't even met us she told me she did think the face book threats were over the line after the he lot trucking video she in some others in the slate ride family told dance he need o stop it was all part of what she called a battle between neighbors which she did not see how command at this point but the think she was more worried about was the government taking angel's want it is a piece of him she told me in any community they are basic rules and laws we agree to live by it is how we are able to come this burin pallet dance was clearly not participating all that and the state agencies that are meant to enforce those rules do not seem to be able to do anything about it it is he is manage out maneuver them simply by creating chaos for instance with the states natural resource sport dance might be invitation of the sermon land we slaw but they need to prove that he is running of business he says he is not that everything at slate ridges free and far the natural resources board has not been able to prove otherwise and take those cases in new york one of them is a restraining order against him which required him to surrender his firearms i asked long foremen authorities an sermon about this could they informed new works order go and sees his guns it said yes they could but here is the ironing even know the neighbors have been hearing all the shooting for long even though dance talks about all the weapons he has there is no hard proof that he currently has any in his possession if you look at his face boy posts bozos movies he never appears with on for a while now some the neighbors have had this feeling that is new to them that the system is failing them that the protection that they thought it provided is not actually there i think this can create the special kind of anxiety ant led them to take things into their own hands this is my caviller last to this is this

outside but these people up the road here they all wear armor plated yes with meal metal plates in him to and the penetrating power of a hollow point is much less than a solid point s i do not like the idea of having too be prepared for this but i think we have to something did happen from neighbors recently it actual looks slate rage might get shut down and he no it did it it was not the governor or the turned general er the eight tab for the states natural resources board or the state police it was a tiny town of fault there is only case fondly worked his way through the courts and after years of delays in march a state superior court upheld the town zoning laws and ruled against dance the neighbor say the shooting his stop for the most part but they still here construction noise from time to time they think he is building another two ranges the judge ordered dance to dismantle the buildings of slate ridge and pay a hundred dollars for each day he has not fixed his owning violations which came to forty six thousand six hundred dollars and his ruling he detailed how dance has refused to comply with the town since two thousand seventy yeas he wrote quote mister banians record of compliance has been heredes dance has a peal the ruling of course this is sold on for bit and the is one thing that will not change even if the range get shut down even if the buildings get knot down dance to own that land and pal machete when everyone else upon the hill we are not moving it were not quitting agree with that for now at least they we also going to be

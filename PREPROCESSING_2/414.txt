welcome to the supermen capon o science science say to s for imandrucubermen and om our professor of neurobiology and theology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor epic parvis doctor parvises a professor at the rockofeller university in new york city and his laboratory studies the neurobiology of vocal learning language speech disorders and remarkably the relationship between language music and movement in particular dance his work stands from genomics the very genes that make up our gene and the genomes of other species that speak and have language such as song birds and parrots all the way up to nerd circuits that is the connections in the brain and body that govern our ability to learn and generate specific sounds and movements coordinated with those sounds including hand movements and all the way up to cognition that is our ability to think in specific ways based on what we are saying and the way that we comprehend what other people are saying singing and doing as you will soon see i was immediately transfixed and absolutely enchanted by doctor parvises description of his work and the ways that it impacts all the various aspects of our lives for instance i learned from doctor parvis that as we read we are generating very low level of motor activity in our throat that is we are speaking the words that we are reading at a level below the perception of sound or our own perception of those words but if one were to put an amplifier r to measure the firing of those muscles in our vocal cords we would find that as we are reading information we are actually speaking that information and as i learn and you will soon learn there is a direct link between those species in the world that have song and movement which many of us would associate with dance and our ability to learn and generate complex language for people with speech disorders shudder or for people who are interested in multiple language learning by lingual trilingual at camera and frankly for any one who is interested in how we communicate through words written or spoken i am certain to day's episode is going to be an especially interesting an important one for you doctor parvises work is pioneering that he has been awarded truly countless awards ism not going to take our time to list off all the various important awards that he is received but i should point out that in addition to being a decorated professor at the rockofeller university he is also an investigated with the toward hue's medical institute the called h h am i and for those of you that do not know a itgumi investigators are selected on an extremely competitive basis that they have to re up that is they have to recompute every five years they actually receive a grad every five years that dictates whether or not they are no longer a toward he is investigator whether or not they can advance to another five years of funding for their important research and indeed toward he's investors are selected not just for the rigor of their work but for their pioneering spirit and their ability to take on high risk high benefit work which is exactly the kind of work that doctor parvis bitten providing for decades now again i think to day's episode is one of the more unique and special episodes that we have had on the subhuman lad podcast i single it out because it really spans from the basic to the applied and doctor parvises story is in especially unique one in terms of how he arrived at becoming a narobiologist for those of their interested in personal journey and personal story doctor parvises is truly a special and important one before e begin it'd t emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar no salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes unique to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back tolectorolikte ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two undermilegrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element perusing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if i eve been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elements doctor slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor epic parvis epic great to have you here thank you very interested in learning from you about speech and language and even as i ask the question i realize that a lot of people including myself lie do not fully appreciate the distinction between speech and language my speech i think of as the motor patterns the the production of sound a that has meaning hopefully and language of course come various languages and varieties of ways of communicating but in terms of the study of speech and language and thinking about how the brain organized speech and language a water the similarities what of the differences how sh we think about speech and language ye i glad evhurmoseladto get the first question which i consider i provocative on real the reason why i been struggling what it is the difference with speech and language many years and realize why mi struggling is because there behavioral terms was calling psychologically psychology develop kind terms a that do not actually a line exactly with brain function i and the question is there i distinction between speech and language and when i look at the brain of work that other people have done work we have done also compared with animal models those who can imitate sounds parents and som birds i sought to see there really is not such ay sharp distinction to get at what i think it is going a lime tell you how some people think of it now that there is e separate language module in the brain that has all the algwithans in computations that influence the speech pathway on how to produce sounds and the auditory pathway on how to perceive and interpreted a for speech or for u knows sound that we call speech handout it turns out i do not think there is any good evidence for a separate language module instead there is a speech production pathway that is controlling out lacings controlling out on muscles that has built within it all the complex algrethans for spoken language and there's the auditory pathway that has built within it all the complex agretans for understanding speech not separate from a language module and the speech production pathway e specialized to humans and parts and som birds where is this auditory perception pathway is more ubiquitous amongst the animal kingdom and this is why dogs can understand sit seen they say come here ball boy get the ball and for dogs can understand several hundred human speechwords great its you can teach them for several thousand but they cannot say a word fascinating because you have raised a a number of animal species early on here and because i have a they seen an obsession with animals since the time walls very small have to ask a which animals have language which it animals have modes of communication that are sort of language ye a you've heard whale songs i do not what they are saying some very beautiful but they could be insulting each other for all i know am and the very well may be dolphins birds in the what do we understand about modes of communication that are language what might not be what would classically be called law it modes of communication that people would define as language morse very in a very narrow definition they would say production of sounds or speech but what about the hands digesting with the e hands what about a bird who is doing aerial displays in the year communicating information through body language i well a i gong to go back to the bring what i think it is going on is foretoken language were using the speech pathway in all the complex agamas the next to the brain regions at are controlling spoken language where the brain regions for gesturing with the hands and that hand parallel pathway has also complex agethan that we can utilize and some species or more advance in these circuits whether it sound or gesturing with hands in somewhat or less advance now we humans in a few others are the most advance for the speech sounds or the or the spoken language but a non human primate can produce gesturing in a more advance form than they could produce sounds ism not sure about that o across clearly just to say that humans are the most advance at spoken language but not necessarily as big a difference at gestural language compared to some of the species very clear and very interesting and and immediately prompts the question a have there been brain imaging or other sorts of a studies evaluating normal activity in the contexts of you cultures and languages at least that i associate with a lot of hand movement a stallion versions a i do not know make you could give us some examples of cultures where language s not a associated with with as much overt hand movement yes as you and i are talking here to day and people were listening but cannot see us we are actually gesturing with our hands as we talk a without knowing it or doing an unconsciously and if we were talking on a telephone i would have one hand here and i be gesturing with the other hand without even you seeing me it and we is that a some have argued and i would agree with base upon what we have seen is that there is an evolutionary relationship between the brain pathways that control speech production and gesturing a and in the brain regions i mention are directly adjacent to each other and this at i think that the brain pathways that control speech evolved out of the brain pathways that control body movement it and a that is a when you talk about italic french english and forth a each one of those languages come with a learned set of gestures that all you can communicate was now how is that related to other animals will coco a gorilla who is raised with humans for thirty nine years or more a learned how to do gesture communication learn how to sign language to speak it but coco could not produce this sounds coco could understand them as well by si by seeing somebody sign or hearing somebody produce speech but coco could not produce it with her voice and what is going on there is that number species not all of them number species have motor pathways in the brain we can do learned gesturing rudimentary language if you wanted save with garlands even if it is not as advance as humans but they do not have this extra brain pathway for the sound they cannot gesture with their voice in the way that they gesture with their hands i see one thing that's wondered about for very long time as whether or not a primitive emotions and primitive sounds or the early substrate of language and whether or not there is a bridge that we can draw between those in terms of just the basic respiration systems associated with different extreme feelings her hearse the way ism imagining this might work when i smell something delicious i typically inhale more and i might say or something that whereas if i smell something putrid i typically turn away i wince and i will exile it show count turn away trying to not ingest those molecules or inhale those molecules i could imagine that these are the basic dark and contrasts of the of the language system and as i say that ism saying that from the or station of a vision scientists who thinks of all visual images built up in a livery basic way of a hierarchical model of the ability see dark in light i could imagine this kind of primitive to more sophisticated a pyramid of of sound to language this is a crazy idea that we have any a do we have any evidence this is the way it works no it is not a crazy idea and in fact you hit upon one of the key distinctions in the field o reserve that i had started out in which is vocal learning research for vocal communication a you have most burderate species vocalizes but most of them are producing inmate sounds that they are born with a producing that is babies crying for example or dog's barking and only a few species have learned vocal communication the ability to imitate sounds and that is what makes spoken language special hen people think of what special about language it is the learn vocalizations it is what that is what is rare and this distinction between inaneness and learned a is more of a rigor economy when it comes to vocalizations than for other behaviors in the animal kingdom and thawed you go in the brain you see it there is well and all the things you talked about the breathing the grunting and forth a lot of that is handled by the brainstorm circuits right around the level of your neck and below a a reflex in o thing or or even some emotional aspects of your behavior in the hypothelemints and forth but for learned behavior learning how to speak learning how to play the piano teaching a dog to learn how to do tricks is using the four brain circuits and what has happened is that there is a lot of four brains circuits that are controlling learning how to move body parts in these species but not for the vocalsacions but in humans and in parts in some other species somehow we acquired circuits where the forebrain has taken over the brainstorm and now using that brains tom not only to produce the inmate behaviors or vocalbehers but the learned ones as well to we have any sense of when modern or sophisticated language evolved that thinking back to the species that we have all from and even within homosapians an has there been an evolution of language has not been a a devolution of language ye yet yet i i would say a and and to be able to answer that question it does come with the caviar that i think we humans overate ourselves when compared to other species and it makes a even sciences a go astray in trying to hypothesize when you sushi do not find fossil evidence of languages uneasily a a in out there in in terns of what happened in the past a we prop amongst the primates which we humans belong to we are the only ones that have this advance vocal learning ability a now when you it was assumed that it was only homosapits a then you can go back in time now base upon genomic data not only of us living humans but of the fossils that are been found for homosapians a theandithals of venison and individuals and discover that our ancestor our human ancestors supposedly hybridize with these other homered species and it was assumed that these other dominate species do not learn how to imitate sounds i do not know f any species to day that the vocal learner that can have children with the non vocal learning species i i do not say it does not mean it did it exists and whence look at the genetic data from these ancestral homeless that a where we can look at genes that are involved in learn vocal communication they have the same sequence as we human due first genes at function in speech circuits i think neanithols had spoken language no can to say it is as advance as what it is in humans i do not now but i think it is been there for least between five hundred thousand to a million are a that your ancestors had this ability and that we been coming more and more advanced with the culturally and pot possibly genetically a but i think it is involved some time the last five hundred thousand to milionars incredible you could talk a lot bit more about the overlap between brain circuits that control language and speech in humans and other animals a you i was weaned in the that nervous science your aware bird song and the a the ability of birds to learned their tutor song was at was not still is a prominent field a subfield of near science and then of course nor imaging of a humans o speaking and learning et camera and this notion of a critical period a time in which language is learned more easily than it is later in life and the names of the different brainareas were quite different a it one opens the text books we hear vernickiesand broke us for the humans any look at the birds of it i remember young fancy a robust a trade o many acts attrit ye et camera but a for most of our listeners hat those names will not mean a whole lot but a but in terms of homologies between areas and terms of function what we know and a how similar different a the brains a granaries controlling o speech and language and say a song bird and at an a young chop human child ye going back to the nineteen fifties or an even lot a petermoler and others who got involved in narrow ethology the study norbiolgy of behavior in the natural way a you have the start to find that behaviourling there these species of birds seabirds and parts and now we also know humming birds just three of them out of the forty something bird ribs out there in the planet orders that they can imitate sounds we do and that was dissimilarity another words they had this kind of behavior that is more similar to us than champagne see have with us or than chickens have with them their closer relatives and then they discovered even more similarities these critical periods that if you remove a child yo this unfortunately happens where a child is hero an that is not raised with human and goes to their purity face of growth becomes hard in learn a language as an adult there is dis critical period where you learned best and even later on when you are irregular society its hart to learn while the want birds undergo these same thing and then it was discovered that if they become deaf we humans become de our speed starts to deteriorate without any kind of therapy a if nonhuman primate or a or would say a chicken becomes deaf a their vocalizations do not deter very little at least awhile this happens in the vocal learning birds they were all these behavior of parallels that came along in to package and then people looked into the brain for nandonatama my former play advisor and began to discover the area ax you talked about a the robust vicious of the arcopalium and a and these brain pathways were not found in the species who cunning imitates there is a parallel here and then a jumping many years later you i started to ding down into these a brain circuits to discover that these brainscircuits have parallel functions with the brain circuits for humans even though thereby a different name broke and loringimota quarter and most recently we discovered not only the actual circuitry in a connectivity a similar but the underlying genes that are express in these brain regions in a specialized way different from the rest of the brain are also similar between humans and bombers and parts all the way down to the genes an now reminding the specific mutations or also similar not always identical but similar which indicates remarkable converges for called complex behavior in species separated by three hundred million years from e common ancestor and not only that we are discovering that mutations in these genes that caused speech deposits in humans liken foxy too a if you put those same mutations or similar type of deposits in these vocal leaning birds you gets similar details convergent of the behavior is associated with similar genetic disorders of the behavior incredible i have to ask do humming bird singer do they hum humming birds hum with their wings and sing with their lyrics in a coordinated way in e coordinated way there is some species of humming birds a that actually wo a dug ashes show this the will flap a their wings and crate a slapping sound with their wings that in unison with their song and o and you would not know it but it sounds of particular syllable in their songs a even though it is their wings and their voice at the same time humming birds are clapping to their song clapping with their their snapping their wings together a in unison with the song to to make it if ism going tot to that it it that i banged on the table except they make it almost sound their voice with their wings incredible yes it's when they got some of the smaller ta ring an to hay mine belong at i es incredible yes cud y love humming birds and i always feel it such a a special thing to get a moment to see whole as they move around fascia ay flit away sonfastenes holistic trajectories ye that when you get to see one stationary for a moment or even just hovering there it is a you feel your extracting much from there will lo bicorn cost of life but now i realize their their playing music riseactly and what is amazing o about humming birds and i can say vocal learning species in general is that for whatever reason they seem to ego multiple complex traits you have this idea that revolving language spoken language in particular comes along with a said of specializations credible when i was coming up in her science i learned that i think it was the work of peter parlor that am young birds learn song birds learn their tutor song and learn it quite quite well but that they could learn the song of a other tutor and other wars they could learn a different and for the listeners ism doing air quotes her a different language a different bird song indifferent in their own species yet but never as well as they could learn their own natural genetically like song yes genially lent meaning that they would be me being raised in a different culture and am that i would learn that the other language but not as well as i would have learned english this is is the idea yes is that true that is true yes and that and that is what i learn growing up as well and d and talk to peter roller himself about before he pass am yet this he used to call it the inmate predisposition to learn it am which would be kind of the equivalent in the linguistic community of universal grammar there is something genaticly influencing our vocal communication on top of what we learn culturally and there is this been balance between the genetic control of speech or a song in these birds and the learn a cultural control and yes if you were to take am am i mean this case we we actually tried this at rockerfeller later and take a zebrfinch and raise it with a canary it would sing a song that a sort of a higbriding between we call it a canine i a advice aversive for the canary because the something different about their vocal musculature of then or the circuitry in the brain and out is eberfinch even with a closely related species if you would take a zebefinch a young animal and in one cage next to a place its own species adult man i and in the other cage place bangaleesfinch next to it it would preferably learn the song from its own species neighbor but if you remove its neighbor it would learn that bangleesment very well fantast there is it it has something to do it also the social bonding with your own species credible that raise is a question that i base lonesome thing i also heard but i will not have any a scientific pure reviewed publication a point to which is this this idea pigeon not the bird but this idea of when multivul cultures and languages converge in a given geographic area that the children of all the different native languages will come up with their own language i think its was in island culture may be in why called pigeon which is sort of a hybrid of the various languages that their parent speak at home and that they themselves speak and that somehow pigeon again not the bird what a language called pigeon for reasons i do not know harbors certain basic elements of all language is that true is that not true i i i would i have not studied enough myself in i terms of pigeon specifically but in turns of cultural evolution of language and hybonization between different cultures and forth a even amongst birds with different dialects an you bring them together a you what is going on here is cultural evolution remarkably tracts genetic evolution of you bring people from two separate populations together the have been in their separate populations evolutionarilyleas for hundreds of generations some one speaking chines in speaking english and that child hens learning from both of them yes that child's going to be able to pick up and merge of a o funds and words together in a way that in adult wooded because why their experiencing both languages at the same time during their critical period a years in a way that a adults would not be able to experience and you get a hybrid and the lowest common denominators going to be what they share and the fun ins that they retained in each of their a languages is what is going to be i imagine use the most interesting we have got brain circuits in songbirds and inhuman that in many ways are similar perhaps not in their exact wiring what in their basic contour of wiring and genes that are expressed in both sets of normal circuits in very distinct species that are responsible for these these phenomenon recalling speech and language what sorts of things are those genes controlling what is i could imagine they were controlling the wiring of connections between brain arms and now essentially a map of of a circuit i sill an engineer which in circuit for speech and language nature designed the sir car for speech and language but presume other things to the ability to a connect to motor patterns within the throat of muscles within the throat wen the control the tongue and what at what are these genes doing you are pretty good yet you made some very good guesses there that a make sense a yes of one of the things that differ in the speech pathways of us in these son pathways of birds is some of their connections of fundamentally different grin the surrounding circuits ay om a direct cortical connection of from the areas that control vocalizations in the cartel n to motoneuron that control the lari in a humans or the hearings and birds and we actually made a prediction that since some of these connections differ were fine genes that the that control nurser connectivity in that specializing that function that differ and that is exactly what we found i the goes that control what we called acts on guiding and formencion connections and what was interesting it was for in the opposite direction than we expected that is some of these genes actually a number of them that control mirror connectivity were turned off in the speech circuit i and it did not make sense to us at first and we sorry to realize the function of these genes are to repel connections from forming repulsive molecules and when you turn them off they allow certain connections to form that normally would have not formed its by turning in off you gout o gain of function for speech i i a other genes that surprise us we genes involved in cousin buffering neuron protection a harvavemen or heat shock ratings when your brain gets hot these ratings turn on and we could not fuck out for a long time why is at the case and then the idea pop to me one days that ah e i heard the lacings is the fastest firing muscles in the body i in order to vibrate sound and and modulate sound in the way we do you have to control you have to move those muscles three to four to five times faster than just regular working a running and a when you stick electrodes in in the brain fairies that control learned vocalizations in these birds and i think in humans as well of those turns of firing at a higher rate to control these muscles and what is that going to do you gang to have lots of toxicity in those neurons unless you regulate models that take out a the extra load that is needed to control the lacings and then finally a third set of genes that a specializing these spent circuit are involved in negro plasticity negro plasticity meaning allowing the brain circuits to be more flexible a you can learn better and why is that i think learning how to produce speech is the more complex learning ability then say learning how to wolf or or learning how to do tricks and jumps and forth the dogs do it is interesting as you shay that because i i realize that many aspects of speech are sort of reflective i not thinking about each word ism when to say i did they just stor to roll out of my mouth hopefully with some for thought we both know people that a they seem to speak a think lass fewer synapses between their brain and their mouth can i its right lot of examples out there and some people are very deliberate in their speech but none the less that a much of speech is a has to be precise and a some of it less precise in terms of plasticity of speech and the city to learn multiple languages but even just one language what is going on in the critical were the called critical period ye why is it that my niece speaks punish squat all and speak punish and english incredibly well she is fourteen years olive struggle a punish my whole life my father's by languor my mother is not have tried to learn spaniels as an adult it is really challenging ism told that a i learned it when i was eight i would be better off actor am or it would be installed within me the first question is is it easier to learn multiple languages without an accent early in life and if why and then the second question is if one can already speak more than one language as a consequence of childhood learning is it easier to acquire new languages later on the answer to both of his questions is yes and that a but i but i but to to explain this i need to let actually the entire brain is undergoing a critical period developments not just to speech pathways and dos it is easier to learn how to play a piano it is easier to learn how to write to bike for the first time and forth as a young child than it is a later in life what i mean easier in terms of one you start from you start from first principles of learning something the very first time if you can learn chines as a child verses the very first time you learn cheeses in adulated or learning play piano as a child versus i adult a but the speech pathways or let us ay speech behavior i think has a stronger critical period a change to it than other circuits a an why what is going on there in general a if you why do you need a critical period to make you more stab a to make you more stubborn to speak a the reason i believe is that the brain is not for brain can only hold much information and a if you undergoing rapid learning to learn to acquire new knowledge you also have to dumpster put put in memory or information in the trash an a computer youyou only have many gigabytes of memory and therefore a put plus also for survival you do not one to keep forgetting things and the brain is designed i believe undergo this critical period and solidify the circuits with what you learn that is a child and you use that for the rest your life and we humans stay even more plastic an our brain functions control by a going called ear gap too we have an extra copy of it that leads our speech circuit in other brain regions in a more mature state throughout life compared to other animals we were more immature were still juvenile compared to other animal i knew it but we but we still go u to critical periods the all do and now the question you asked about if you learn more a language is as a child can is easier to learn as an adult and that is a common a finding out there in literature their som that argue against it but for those that supported the idea there is you you are born with a set of mane sounds you can produce e fans and you narrow that down as not all languages use all of them and you narrow down the one you use to string the phones together in words that you learn and you maintain those fondants as an adult and here comes along another language that is using those funds or different comminations you are not used to a in therefore is starting from first principles but if you ready have them in multiple languages that your using than it makes it easier to use them in another third of fourth language i i see incredible it it is not your brain has under has maintain greater plasticity is your met your brain has maintain greater ability to produce different sounds that then allows you to learn another language faster got it are the hand gestures associated with sounds or with meanings of words i think the hand gestures of associated with both the sounds and meaning a when i say sound if you are really angry right a and you are making a loud screaming noise right you may make hand gestures that are look koto beat the wall right because your making loud sounds and loud gestures right a but if you unit explain something i come over here out i just do now to you for those who cannot see me i swung my hand towards you and swing at here to me that has a meaning to it to come here just what the voice the the hand gestures are producing of a you not both qualities of soundsand for people that speak multiple languages especially those that learn those multiple languages early in development do they switch their patterns of motor movements according to let us ay i going from italic to arabia or from arabia to french in a way that matches the the precision of language that they are speaking what you just ask me a question i do not know the answer to i would imagine that would make sens because of a of switching a in terms of sometimes people mig call this coat switching even different violets of the same language could you do that with your gestures i imagine but i really do not know if that turnon i certainly do not know from my own experience because i only speak one language it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic grains athletic grains now called a one is a vehement in oral prostatic drink that covers all of your foundation a nutritional needs eve been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there in my story taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me i the probiatics that i need for got health a got is very important is populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probiatics enthetic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic runs contains a number of adaptegens fitments and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastescripe if you would to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitemend three k too again that is athletic green stock calm slash supermen to get the fie free travel packs and the year supply a vitemend three k to to go a little into the abstract but not two mar one about modes of speech and language that seem to have a depth of emotionality and meaning but for which it departs from structured language here is what i mean a poetry ai think of musicians there somebobdillan songs that to me i understand the individual words i to think there is an emotion associated with at least i experience some sort of emotion and i have a guess about what he was experiencing but if i were to just read it linearity without the music and without him singing it or somebody singing him it would not hold any meaning in other words the words that seem to have meaning but not associated with language but somehow happen to an emotionality yet absolutely we call this difference o semantic communication communication with meaning an effect if communication communication that has more f an emotional feeling consent you've been with on of the semantics and the two can be mixed up would singing words that have meaning but also have this effect of emotional you just love the sound of the singer that your hearing and a initially i ayoupsychologist sciences in general thought that these were going to be controlled by different brain circuits i and it is the case there are emotional brain centers in the hypothalamus in the singular quarters and forth that do give tongue to the sounds but i i believe base upon imaging work and work we see in birds when when birds are communicating semantic information in their sounds which as not too often but it happens verses a effect of communication sing be cause ism trying to attract the mate my courtship song or defend my territory it is the same brain circuits the e same speech or song circuits are being used in different ways a a friend of mine who is also a therapist a said to me it is possible to say i love you with intense hatred and to say i hate you with intense love i and of reminding me that it is possible to hear both of those statements in either way a i guess it is not just limited to song or poetry it also a there is something about the intention and the emotional context which something spoken that it can heavily shape the way that a we interpret what we hear that is right and and and i consider all of that actual meaning even though i defend it is a people commonly do semantic and effective communication effective communication to say i hate you but men love right is on does have a emotional meaning to it a and you once more an object kind of me your an abstract in meaning there's similar of the points here i think it is important for for the those listening out there to hear is that when i say also this effective and a semantic communication a being used by similar brain circuits it also matters a side of the brain in birds and inhuman a there is there is left right dominants a for learned a communication learned sound communication a the left in humans is more dominant for speech but the right has a more balance for singing or processing musical sounds as suppose a processing speech both get used for both reasons and when people say your right bring is your artistic brain an your left rain is your thinking brain this is what they are referring to a and that is another distinction a second a thing that is useful to know is that all vocal learning species used their learned sounds for this emotional effective kind of communication but only a few of them humans and some parts and dolphins use it for the semantic kind of communication me calling speech and and that has led a number of people to hypothesize that the evolution of spoken language of speech evolve first for singing a for this more emotional kind of made attraction the generator lopes he tricky martin kind of songs and forth a and then later on it became used for abstract communication we are doing now o interesting well that is a perfect squat for me to be able to ask you about your background a and motor control not only of the hands but of the body you have a a number of important distinctions to your name but one of them a is that you were a member of the alvenaily dance a school school of that i as w mere you are an accomplished or and quite able dancer right i tell us ego bit about your on background in the the world of dance and as how it informs your interesting hero science excuse me and perhaps even how it the late specifically to your work on speech and language yes we it is it is interesting in that this kind of history even goes before my time in my family my mother and father side they both went to the high school o music an art here in new york city a and particular my mother's family going back multiple generations there were singers and i even did my family genealogy and found out not only in a we have some relationship to some while known singers visit relationships felonious hung but going back to the plantations an the north caroling and forth my ancestors were singers in the church for the the towns and forth and this somehow got passed on multiple generations to my family i thought i was going to got up and be a famous singer right and my even me an my brothers and sister formed a band one of her kids and and forth and but it turned out that i did not inherit the singing talents of some my other family members even though yes yo say but not my brother or not my mother my aunts and my cousin put iffy whose now the talent and native america singer and a a what that then influenced me to do other things and i started a competing in dance contests acting is no rand the time on sat in my fever and i was as a tea mature d i started when winning dance contests d i thought oh i can dance and i edition for the high school performing arts and i got in here in new york city and got into a ballet dance and got in right and and thought if i learned wallet i can learn everything else it was that and if ho learn something classical you can teach you for everything else a and i was yet at alvonaily dance school comfrey wallet dance school and at the end of my senior as a concert a i was had this opportunity of addition for theavonali dance company and i had an opportunity to go to college and i also fell in love with another passion that my father had which was science and i liked science and high school and i found an overlap also between the arts and sciences both required activity hard work discipline new discovery both front boring to me and the one decision i made at that at that senior dance concert was talking to thavonali recruiter and thinking about it i have to make a decision and i thought something my mother taught me cause she was grown up in the nineteen sixty's cultural revolution do something that has a positive impact on society and i thought i can do that better as a dancer than a scientist now jump i get into college undergrad school i major and moleculabiology and mathematics i decide i want to be a biologist got in to gradual school wanted to study the the brain at you ought the rocefol universities i wont from huntecollege of arcifillg university and now i got to the brain and is and why did i choose the brain is because it controls dancing but i i there was anybody's studying dancing i wasn't study the brain something that it does that is really interesting in complex and i thought a languages what it does you could not study that in mic you could not studying non human primates but these birds do this wonderful thing that for nan a nadobon was suing at rarcefiller and that is what got me into the birds and am and then jumping now fifteen years later you knomyet that is right even after ism into now having my own lads studying vocal learning in these birds as a model for language in humans it turns out that a a no unypatel and a in others a have discovered a that a only vocal learning species can learn how to dance is all right that is right yes the i shall have seen these i just scrolling through the the files here in my in my mind i think about ever s wile someone was i love a part yet i ever smile some one will send meat one of these old in sir gammer winter videos of a part doing what looks to me dance typically to coat that is right right that is what even footstep paying to the other sound and famous one calls snowball out there but they're non they are many snowballs out therthey are all all the dancing birds are name snowball i no in in tactic ah only animals with language dance yet vocal learning in particular the ability to imitate sounds yes incredible yes and this now as bringing my lifefull circle right and i and and when that was discovered in two thousand nine a at that same time in my lab at duke we discovered that vocal learning brain pathways in som birds as well as in humans and in parts i snowball a are imbedded with in circuit she control learning how to move and that led us to a theory o call the brain pathway or motor theory of vocal learning origin where the brain pathways for vocal learning in speech evolve by a whole duplication of the surrounding motor circuits involving learning how to move now how dis that explain dance right well when when snowball the cocatunes ore dancing they are using the brain regions around their speech circuits to to do this dancing behavior and what is going on there what we what we hypothesize and now the test is that when this when when speech all in humans and the equivalent behavior in parts and bombers it require a very tight integration in the brain regions that can hear a sound with the brain regions that control your muscles from moving your lacings and tong and forth for producing sound and that sight auditory motor integration we argue than contaminate the surrounding brain regions and that contamination of the surrounding brainreince now blows us humans a particular in parts to ordinate our muscle movements of the rest of the body with sound in the same way we do for speech sounds we speaking with our bodies when we dance incredible and and i have to say that as poor as i am at speaking multiple languages ism even worse at dancing a by i guarantee your better than the a monkey but not snobolacoca may not on youth we have a vityover there some science is dancing with snowball and you will see snowballs doing better than some of the scientists et was also ism not the worst of all science and i dancing a is always in real plasticity may it save me some day you said something incredible that have i i completely believe even though i have a minimum to lech's a minimum dancing ability i can get by at a part your wending without complete embarrassment but i do not have any structure training is the body clearly can communicate with movement as a train dancer and knowing other train dancers i always think of dance and bodily movement and communication through bodily moment as a form of a word listless a stance of worthlessness in fact that the few times wen i think that maybe i mash dancing modestly well for the context that ism in were i see other people dancing they seem to just be very much in the movement it is almost a state of non language a non spoken language m and and yet what you are telling me is that there is a a direct bridge at some level between the the movement of the body and and language is there a language of the body that is distinct from the language of speech and if or if not how do those map on to one another was that even diagram look ye ye let me defend first dance in this context of vocal learning species this is the kind of dancing that we are specialized in doing and other the boy learning species of specialize in doing is syncuinizing body movements of muscles to the rhythmic beat of music and for some reason we doing that we synchronizing to sounds and doing it together as a group of people and that kind of communication among ourselves is more the effect of kind of communication i mentioned earlier unlike the semantic kind we humans are using our voice is more for the semantic abstract communication by reusing learned dance for the effective emotional bonding kind of communication it does not mean we cannot communicate semantic information in dance and we do it but it is not as popular a ballet that in the nutcracker it is popular now where they are communicating o the caravan my comes out which i was the avian guying balling not crack as i am o you've for the weschester ballet company when i was a than ago a retrying to communicate meeting in our valley dancing it can go on with a whole story and forth and but people do not interpret that is clearly a speech there seeing the ballet with semantic communication with a lot of emotional content where is you go out to a club yet you are you are not coming communicating use a how you feeling to day tell me about your day and forth you are trying to synchronize with other people in an effective way and i think that is because the the dance brain circuit inherited the more ancient part of the speech circuit which was for singing i was had the feeling that with certain forms of music a e particular opera but any kind of a music where there is some long notes a some that at some level there was a a literal resonance created between the singer and the listener that om er i think it the deep voice of a abajohnny cash or where at some level you can almost feel the voice in your own body and in ferry that could be the the vibration of the the or the firing of the frantic her of controlling the diagram for all i know is the any evidence that there is a coordination between performer an audience at the at the level of mind and body i ism gin to say possibly yes and the reason whys means i just came back from a conference on the nurobilegy of dance a on the clearly ism going to the wrong a a cole yo sin side might e working yes one of my colleagues to comps o fitch and the jonathan forts they were organize a particular section on on this conference in virgin and this is a first time i was in the room the many hero scientist studying the nrobilgif dance it is a new field now in the last five years and a there was one a a lab where they were putting e g electron on a the dancers on two different dancers parting with each other as well as a the audience a seeing the dance and and some are you not ate your listening to the music as well how you responding was yore you are ask a question about music and of giving yo an answer about dance and what they found is that a the dancers when they resinated with each other during the dance are the audience listening to the dancers and the music there is some residence going on there that they scores higher residence the brain activity with these wireless e g signals are showing something different and that is why they possibly at it it needs it needs more vigorous study and you know this is some sup they publish but it is not prying time yet but they are trying to figure the out of it at least am if i cannot dance well maybe i can hear and feel what it is to dance in a certain way that that is right and and and this will be some people wot think that they even songs that they hear and they can c almost sing to themselves in their own head and they know what they wanted to sound you know one really sounds good what it sounds but they cannot get their voice to do it i raisin f those listening raising my hand i know no musical ability others in my household have tremendous musical ability with instruments and with voice but not me of what and and this is one in my one of my a selfish goals of trying to find the genetics awhile can some people sing really well and some not is there is some genetic pretisphysician to that and then can i modify my own muscles of rain circuits to sing better here still after otherthe sing is is what happens when siblings are a vary an proficiency is that they competitiveness among a brothers and sisters never goes away have been trying to be as good as my brother mark and victor enough for a the beth of the hope my entire life i watch out my an i try coming for you with nominee i o take and earlier you said that you discovered that you could dance that that caught my ear am it sells you did not actually have to i not suggesting you did not work hard at it at at the moment where you discovered it a its just sort of was a a skill that you had that up until that point you did not forget a a life in in the world of dance but the fact that you qotincle discovered that you could dance rely fella an went to this incredible school of cancan and did well a tells me that perhaps there is a a ability that was built up in childhood under that perhaps we do all have a different genetic leanings for for different a motor function ye we the for me there could be both explanations could be possible for the first om yet i grew up in its family listening to to town songs no dancing at a parties and for family parties and an african america family basically and a u i grew up dancing a from a young child but this this the cover may be dancing even more a ain terms of of a talent it could the genetic component if it really exists i do not know you know it my twenty three in me a results you know says i have a the genetic a substitutions that associated with the high intensity ask leads and fast twist muscles and who knows maybe that could have something to do with me being able to sincranize of my body a a to rhythmic towns maybe maybe better than some others a it turns out that my genetics also show that i have a genetic substitute that does it that makes it hard for me to sing on pitch and that that is correlate with my even though i can sing onspitchvessily if i hear a piano a or you no complying it but the you maybe that is why my smiling you who did not have that genetic predisposition in his twenty three we results ut can go along with the genetic a compounded as well of imagining family gatherings it twenty three and day an an intense arguments about it ya an a an hear ability yes on a love to the can attendant ism not inviting myself to your things getting in o i i suppose i am you are welcome to thank you a it'll bring my twenty three and me dit a at love to chat a moment about facial expression as that is a form of motor pattern that you n i think for most people out there a just think about smiling and frowning but there of course you a thousands if not millions of micro expressions and things of that sort many of which are subconscious a and we are we are all familiar with the fact that when what somebody says does not match some specific feature of the facial expression that it can a call up you know that is match can cut our attention especially among people that know each other very well ye you s somebody will said when you said that but you your right eyed which to the a little it in a way that tells me that you generally mean that this these kinds of things or when a n opposite example when the emotionality and the content of our speech is match to a facial expression there is something that is just am at wonderful about that because it seems everything's a find yet how does ye motor circuitry that controls facial expression map on to the the bring circuits the control language speech and even bodily in hand move yes ut you it you ask a great question because we both now some colleagues mini rival that the rockopel university who study facial expression in the neurology behind it and know we boy share some students that were mentoring and talk about the same question that you brought up and what ism learning a lot is that non human primates have a lot of diversity in their facial expression we humans do and what we know about the ne r biology of brain regions controlling those muscles of the face is that these nonhuman primates and some other species that do not learn how to imitate vacations they have strong connections from the cortical regions to the tutor neurons that control facial expressions but absent connections or we connections to the motornerns hat control the voice i think our diverse facial expression even though it is more diversities non man primates there are ready are existing diversity of communication whether it is intentional or unconscious through facial expression in our ancestors and on top of that we humans now and the voice along with those facial expressions i see the and in terms of language learning when we're kids of it out children fortunately are not told to fake their expressions or to smile when they say ism happy o such some point everybody learns for better for worse how to untangle these different components of hand movement bothebody posture speech and facial expression yes but in it in their best form i would say a assuming that the best form is always i guess the are instinct is were in of for safety reasons one might need to vein some of these a some of these aspects of language but in most cases when those are alined a it seems that could reflect that all the different circuitry's are operating in parallel but that h the ability to missilineese is also a a powerful aspect to our maturation i i then think of there for instance where deliberate disentangling of of these areas is important but also we know when an actor when it feels real you and when it looks at when bad acting is oftentimes when the facial expression or body possergest does not quite match whet were hearing at are these skills that that people that learn and acquire according to adaptability in profession or do you think that all children and all adults eventually learn how to couple and uncouple these circuits a little bit yet i i think it is it is the the similar argument in mention earlier about the inmate and the learn for the vocalizations and by the way when i say we humans have facial expressions associated without vocalizations in he different way than primates nonhuman primates it is the learn vocalizations on talking about there is a common view out there that facial expressions and nonhuman species on human primates or you can have them in birds to are on innate i and there there their reflects in control i do not believe that i think there is some learned component it and i think we have more learning component it as well but we also have an innate component and if you try to put your hands behind your back and an hold your fits or even does not and try to pe and try to communicate it is actually harder to do you have to force itself or put it by by your side this comes naturally fatal expressions comes naturally be there is an innate component and yes you have to learn how to dissociate the too communicate something angry with your hands oath your face but ism i politely with your voice it is very hard to t that to separate at this to because there is that innate component that brings them together i it is an male to your your emailing and one says something by males going can interpret that angrily or or gently i and i it becomes ambiguous the fateful expressions get rid of that ambiguity ism glad you brought that out because my next question was and is about written language a the first question it'll ask is when you write either type or write things out by hand do you hear the content of what you want to write in your had you just you personally yes i do i i i and i know that i do because i was trying to figure out a debt about this issue and try to resolve the bate with my own we experimentation on me i sat because a a quite well known collogue of ours carl desire at stamford who is been on this podcast ants you optoganec fame and sychietary fame et camera and i i know him you he sends his remarks i i told me that a his practise for writing and for thinking involves a quite painful a process of forcing himself to sit completely still and think in complete sentences to force thinking and complete sentence is it when he told me that i decide to try this exercise and it is quite difficult first all it is difficult for the reason that you mention while is that with many thoughts i want to look around and i start to gesticulate with my hands it's there it is again the connection between language and hand movement even if one is not speaking the and the other part is that i that is challenging is i realize that while we write in complete sentences most of the time will talk about how that is changing now and testing et camera that we do not often think in complete sentences and specifically in simple declarative sentences that a lot of our thoughts would be if were if they were written out on to a page would look pretty much passive language that a good copy editor or a good editor would say like we want to cross is out make the simple and declarative what ism getting at here is what is the process of going from a thought to language to written word and i also want to touch on handwritten versus typed but thought to language to written word what is going on there what we know about the marry circuitry and i as could ask while it hard but now i want to ask why is this even possible it is we fuck of very challenging nauru computation of problem ya ye and and from coming from the linguistic world o didn't even just the rag wen your bilge world going back to coming a said before s about a separate language module in the brain non there is is thought or hypothesis that this language model has all these complex altgratems to them and there signaling to the speech circuit how to produce the sounds the hand circuit how to write them or gesture a the visual pathway on how to interpret them from reading a in the auditory pathway for listening i do not think that is the are i and that this thinking the where there is internal speech going on what i think it is going on is to explain which you asking is about a gan to take it from the perspective reading something you read something on a paper the signal from the paper goes through your eyes it goes to the back your brain to your visual cortical regions eventually and then you now got to interpret that signal in your visual pathway what you reading how r you gan undo that from speech that visual signal then goes to your speech pathway in the motor quortsexs in front here in broke aria and you sign atlas speak what you read in your brain without moving your muscles sometimes actually if you put electrons e e g a e m g electrons on you loo l loringal muscles even on burning and do this you will see activity there while reading or or or trying to speak silently even though no sounds coming out and you are speech pathway is now speaking what you are reading now to finish it off that signal is sent to your auditory pathways you can hear which yare speaking in your own head that is incredible and this is why it is complicated because you using three different pathways the visual the speaking motor one in the auditory to read oh and then you got a it i i c here comes a fourth one now the hand airy is next you speech pathway is got to take that auditory signal or even the adjacent motor signals for speaking and translated into a visual signal in paper you using at least four brain creates a which includes the speech production in the speech perception pathways to writes credible and finally explain to me why when i i was weird teaching undergraduates graduatsune to medical students and have observed that when ism teaching i have to stop speaking if ism going to write something on the board i did have to stop all speaking completely fry turns out this is an advantage to catch because it allows me to catch my voice it allows me to slow down a bit ism you breathe an an handsome oxygen and on because i tend to speak quickly if ism not writing something out there is a brake in the circuitry for me or at least they are distinct enough that i have to stop and then write something yes that that that that as imply competing brain circuits for you are conscious attention we have colleagues i up at colombia met who are known at least an hour circles for dictate voicdictating their papers not writing them out but just speaking into a voice reporter have written papers that way it does not feel quite as natural for me as writing things out but not because i can go quickly from thought to language to typing i type reasonably fast i can touch type now i do not think i ever taught my i i think i taught myself i never to a touch type on horse which sort of happen now it him my motor system seems to know where the keys are with enough i i enough accuracy that it works that this is remarkable to me that any of us can do this but when it comes to writing what have found is that if my write of thought and my rate of writing are a line nicely things go well at however if ism thinking much faster than i can write that is a problem and certainly if ism thinking more slowly than i want to write that is also a problemand the solution for me has been to write with a pen ism in love with these i have no relationship to the company least not now although if they want to come nigh they want i work with us i love these pilot we five sevens because not necessarily because of the nor the the feel although i that as well but because of the rate that allows me to write they write very well slowly and they write very well quickly and have have dis theory supported only by my own panic data no pure reviewed study that writing by hand is fundamentally different than typing out information is there any evidence that is motor pathway for writing is better ere somehow different than the motor pathway for for typing yet that that is interesting ism and i do not know of any studies i have my own personal experiences well but trying to put this into the contacts if i had to no designing experiment to test the hypothesis here thou to explain your experience in mind is that writing by hand ism i would argue i requires a different sat of we less skills with the fingers then typing you hat you have the coordinate your fingers more in opposite directions and forth of a typing i but also writing by hand requires more arm movement and therefore i would argue that the i the the difficulty there could be in the types and muscles and the fine motor control you need of those muscles along with speaking in your brain at the same time basically ism course on a brute ma sense that i a a promote primitive writing device would work that is right yes but but let me let me as wo this in turns of the i my own personal experience a but i find is i can write i can write something fat sir by hand am for short period of time compared to typing that is because i think i i run out of the energy in my arm movements a faster than i run out of muscle energy my finger movements a and i think it takes a longer time for us to write words without fingers a because and in turns of the speech i think your writing whether is my hand or typing and your speech the only will line very well if you can time as fast as you can speech or write as fast as you can speak in your head i love it what you have done if i understand correctly is created a bridge between fought and writing and that bridge is speech that bridge is speech that is right that is right when your writing something out your speaking it to yourself and if your speaking faster than you can type you got a problem you see i a i do a number of podcast episodes that are not with last at solo episodes and as listeners nor these are very long episodes often two or more hours and we joke around the podcastudio that i will get locked into a mode of speech were some of it is more elaborative and anecdotal and then it'll and then it'll punch out simple declarative sentences i find it very hard to switch from one modal to the next the thing that i have done in order to make that transition more fluid and prep for those podcast episodes is actually to read the lyrics of songs and to sing them in my head as a way of warming up my vocal chords but um luckily for those around me a when i do that ism not actually singing and this a what you are telling me supports this idea that even when we are imagining singing or writing in our mind we are exercising our local orders your action getting little lo potentials of electrical currents reaching your muscles there which also means your exercising your speech brain circuits to without actually going with the fullobone activity in the muscles credible ye and this this idea of singing helps you as well a am even with parkinson's patience and formally when to say something sing or listening to music helps the movement and the idea there is that the brain circuits for singing or let say the function of the bring circuits for speech being used for singing first is the more ancestral trait and that is why it is easier to do things with singing sometimes in it is with speaking of it stutter is a a particularly interesting case and and one that every once in a while i it'll get questions about this from our audience am stutter is its complicated and in the number of ways but culturally a mi understanding from these females that i receive is that a stutter can often a cause people to hide and speak less because it can be embarrassing and were we are often not patient with with stutter we also have the assumption that if somebody stuttering that they are thinking a slow but it turns out there many examples historically of people who could not speak well but where brilliant thinkers a i do not know how well they could write but a they found other modes of communication a i realize that you are not a a speech pathologist or therapist but a what it is the current nerbiological understanding of stutter and or a what is being developed in terms of treatments for stutter yes we actually a accidentally came across stuttering in seabirds and we be public several papers on this to try to figureoup the nerobiological basis the first study we had was a brainaria a call the base ganglia with the the stratum part of the was of ganglia involved in coordinating movements learning how to make movements when it was damaged in these in the in the speech pathway in these birds it refound is that they started to stutter as the brain region recover and unlike humans they actually recovered after three or four months and why is that the case because bird brains undergoes new nurgenisis in a way that human or camel brains stones and it was the new neurons that were coming in into the circuit but not quite with the right proper activity was resulting in the stuttering in these birds and after is repaired not exactly the old song came back as a a the repair but still i recovered a lot better and it is now known they call this bourgeon near genius a stuttering in humans i would be damage to the brass ganglia or some type of disruption to the based angle at a young age also causes stuttering in humans and even those who were born with stuttering a it is it is often the based ganglia that is disrupted in some of the brain circuit and we think the speech part of the was of angle can adults who maintain a stutter from childhood a repair that stutter they can repaired with a therapy with learning how to speak slower a learning how to tap out a rhythm sure is the and yet ism not a speech pathologist by story reading the literature an talking to others hat o callings who actually studies study stuttering y es that there there are ways to overcome the muttering through a through a in behavioral therapy a and i think all of the o tools out there have something to do with sensory moterintogration a controlling with you here with what is you output in the of thoughtful controlled way helps reduce the story they couple examples from real life that i want a touch on and a one is somewhat facetious but a but now i realize as it is a serious anerobiological issue serious meaning i think interesting which is that every once in a while i will have a conversation with somebody who says the last word of the sentence along with me and it seems annoying in some instances a but ism guessing this is just a break through of the motor pattern that they are hearing what ism saying very well common interpret this it kindly and think they are hearing what i saying they are literally hearing it in their mine and they are getting that low level electrical activity to their throat and there just joining me in the a in the denunciation of what ism saying probably without realizing it can we assume that that might be the case i i i would not be surprised of ya mother theory of speech perception where this idea originally came to here is going through your space circle and then also activating those muscles slightly a yes a one might argue aka is that speech circuit now interpreting what that person is speaking now you listening to me and is going to finish it off because it is already going through their train and they can predicted that would be one one theory i do not think the verdict out there is now that is one the other is asycrinizing turn taking in in the cop the a conversation where you are acknowledging that we understand each other a by finishing off what i say ain it is almost a social binding kind of thing the other could be i want the person is shut out i can speak as well and take that turn and and eats pair of people have a rhythm to their conversation and if you have somebody who is overtalkative verses untotalkativ a verse verse have rhythm can be lost in them finishing ideas and going back and forth but i i think having something to do with turntaking as well makes a lot of since i have a college at stamford who is a that interruption is a sign of interest ism not show that everyone agrees i think it is timely can textured yes but there is this form of a a verbal nod i saying or things of that sort and they're many of these a and ism often told by my audience that at interrupt my guests an things that sort oftentimes it'll just get caught in the natural flow of the conversation i a but i think we have have pretty good turn taking here i hope that is o far good y i away ism glad on yum thruway because especially in the contacts of a discussion about language it seems important a testing is a very very interesting evolution of language because what you have told us is that we have a thought it is translated into language it might not be complete sentences but testing i have to imagine this is the first time in human evolution where we have written with our thumbs seems more primitive to me than timing with thinkers or i and but hey who m whom i to judge the evolution of our species in one direction or the other but the short hand grammatically often grammatically deficient incomplete sentence form of testing is an incredible thing to see a early in relationships romantic relationships people will often evaluate the others text in their ability to use proper grammar and spelling et camera dis often quickly degrades and there is an acceptance that we are just trying to communicate through shorthand almost a military shorthand but with internally consistent between people but there is no general consensus of what things me but a w t is and big and oh m gs and all sorts of writings i wonder sometimes whether or not we are getting less proficient at speech because we are not required to write and think in complete sentences i ism not been judge mental here i see this in my colleagues i see this in myself this is not a a judgment of the younger generation a i also know that slang has existed for decades if not hundreds of years but i also know that i do not speak the same way that i did when i was a teen age because have suppressed a lot of that slang not because it is in appropriate a or offensive although some of it was frankly a but because it is out of context what o you thinks happening to language are we getting better at speaking worse at speaking and what do you thing the role of things testing and tweeting and shorthand communication hash tagging a what is that doing to the way that our brains work i i think that the one in terms of a measuring your level of sophistication intelligence than you say om g i i think that also could be a cultural thing that a you belong to the next generation if you are you are being cold if your older person the using undo other things at the then younger generation with yous but i really think about a clearly a a testing actually has a low for more rapid communication amongst people i i i think with without the invention of the phone before then or a taxing back and forth he had to wait days for a letter to up you could not call somebody in the phone and talk as well you known this rapid communication but in turns of the rapid communication of writing in this case a i think actually it is it is more a use it or lose it kind of a a thing with the brain the more you use a particular brain region or circuit the more enhance it is a muscle a the more you exercise it the more healthier it is the bigger becomes in the more space it takes in the were you lose something else i think taxing i my is not decreasing o the the the speech prowess of the intellectual prowess of speech it is converting it and using at a lot in a different way ain a way that may not be as rich in in regular writing because a you can only communicate much new once in short wrist term writing but on whatever that it whatever is being done you got people taxing hours and hours and hours on the fine whatever your thumb circuit is going to get pretty big actually i i do wonder whether your many people have lost their jobs based on tweets a the short latency between thought and action and distribution of one's thoughts is is incredible yes and n what ism not just talking about people who have a who apparently would have poor prefrontal top down control this is beak speak by the way for people that lack impulse control but high level academics on i can appoint an fingers an any one but examples of in where you see these treating what were they thinking yet a presomenly there is an optimal a strategy between the the thought speech motor at motor pathway shin when the motor pathway engages communication with hundreds of thousands of people and retreats and particular in the cotton pace function and the screen shot function are often the reason why speech profligates yet to me it is it is a little are that a the just that the normal circuitry can do this and that we are catching up a little bit more slowly to the technology and you got these casualties of of that mismatch i i think that is a good a adjectives use the casualties of what is going on because yes it is the case would taxing which a really losing the is not less debility to write the more the ability to internet what is being written and you can over underterpit something o that somebody means a on the lopsided that when if somebody is writing something very quick they could be writing instinctual more instinctual their true meaning and they do not have time to modify an color code what their trying o say and that is what they really feel is suppose to saying a more new one's way i i think both sides of that casualty are our present and that is a down turn unintended a negative consequence of a short commuter i m can short word communication i agree that a this whole phenomena could be netting people that a normally would only say these things out loud once inside the door of their own home a not at all i that is a it is an interesting time that wherein let of speech and language an more and motor pattern the part of the human evolution for language i i i think this is all part of our evolution not sit as over those of you thinking terrible thoughts please put them in the world and be a casualty and for those of you that are not please be very careful with how proficient your thought to language to motor action yes i maybe that is the technology company should install some buffers ism some a i based buffers right that that is taking some e g signals from your brain while your taxing to say o a this this is a this is not a great thought slow down it no this does not reflect your bestyastate that brings me to that what was going to be the next question anyway which is we are quickly moving toward a time where there will be a even faster transition from thought to speech to motor output and maybe will not require motor out but what ism referring to hear some of the incredible work of our collect at change at you see a safe and others who are taking a paralyzed human beings am and learning to translate the electrical signals of neurons in veriusarries including speech and language various to computer screens that type out what these people are thinking anotherwords paralyzed people can put their thoughts on in into writing that is a pretty extreme and wonderful example of recovery of function that is sure to continue to evolve but i think we are headed toward a time not too long from now where my thoughts can be translated into words on a page if i allow that to happen yes and any thing's work i which i admire quite a bit in stein my papers i think he is really one of those at the leading edge a try o i understand within humans a the the nurvilgio speech and he may not say it directly that i i taunting about this that supports this idea that the speech circuit in the separate language model i do not really a think that there is a separation there with with that knowledge yet of putting electrodes in the human brain and then translating those electrical signals to speaks a occurrence yet we can start to tell what is that person thinking why because we often think in terms of speech and don without saying words and that is a carry a thought and now imagine if you can now translate this into a signal that transmit something tirelessly and on from some distant part of the planing is hearing your speech from a wireless signal i without you speaking a probably that will not be done at in a ethical way who knows tut the i mean the ethics of doing that probably might not happen but who knows we have these bombers we imply the same techno to them we can start to hear what their singing in their dreams or whatever i even though they do not produce sounds o we can find out by testing on them it is coming no where notion omen for those listening who are interested in getting better at speaking and understanding languages are there any tools that you recommend and here again i t i rules you are not a speech therapist but here ism not thinking about ameliorating any kind of i speech deficiency i thinking for instance do you recommend that people read different types of writing i would you recommend the people learn how to dance in order to become better at expressing themselves verbally i it and you will free to have some some degrees of a freedom in this dancer this see are obviously not a pure viewed studies that were referring to or although there may be i but ism struck by the number of things that you do exceedingly well and i cannot help but ask a well the the singing which i realize it made your brother did pay me i say this may not be quite as good as your brothers yet by is getting you will surpass him made madam guessing it any point the yeti is not exactly there a you do not should kids learn how to dance and read hard books and simple books a what you recommend should adults learn how to do that you everyone wants to know how to keep their brain working better to speak but also i think people want to be able to speak well and people want to be able to understand well ye but have discovered personally your it is that when i with from pursuing a career in science from a career in dance i i thought one day i would stop dancing i but i have not because i find it fulfilling for me i just as a life experience ever since i ante started college my a lateens in early twenties i i kept dancing even till this day and they have tempura a time during the pandemic where i slow down on dancing and for i and and when you do that you realize loo cay the the parts of your body where you muscletone decreases list it in some on an or you and start to gainsay or i somehow do not than wait that easier i think it is related to my dance if that is that that is meaningful to your audience but but i found is in in in science we to think of a separation between movement and action and cognition and there is a separation from you between perception and production cognition being perception production being moving right but if the speech pathways is next in the movement pathways what i discover is by dancing it is helping me think it is helping keeping my brain fresh it is not just moving my muscles ism moving ore using the the circuitry in my brains in to control a whole big body you need a lot of brain tissue to do that and i argue if you want to say cognitively in tact into your old age you better be moving and you better be doing it consistently whether f it is dancing walking running and also practising speech oratory speech and far for singing is controlling the brains circuits that are moving your facial musculature and it is going keep your cognitive circuits also into and ism ism convinced of that for my own personal experience for me a long slow runs a a wonderful way to kind of loosen the joints for long podcast especially the solo podcast which can take many hours to record and a without those long slow runs at least the day before or even the morning of i do not think i could do it least not as well a right well you are your experiencing something similar that is an end of to a do not you ism i tempted to learn how to dance because they're lot of reasons to learn how to people cannot use their imagination i evilly wanting get the opportunity talk about some of the newer work that you are into right now a about genomes of animals a as you perhaps can tell from my quite authentic facial expressions i i adore the animal kingdom i just find in amazing and it is what the reason i went into neurobiology in part a many animals many different patterns of movement many body plans many spec specializations what is the value of learning the genome of all these animals it i can think of conservation base schemes of trying to preserve these pressing a critters am but what are you doing with the genomes of these animals what do you not understand about their brain circuits and how does this relate to some of the discussion we have have been having up i have got very heavily involved in genome am your not just to get at an individual gene involved in the trade of interests spoken language am but i realize that nature has done natural experiments for us am but all these species out there with these various traits and the one that ism study boa learning has evolved multiple times among the animal king them even if its rare it is multiple times and a ti similar genetic change as occurred in the species but to find out what those genetic changes that are associated with the trad of interests and not some other trait flying in birds is supposed to a singing a you have to do what call comparative genomics even in the contacts of studying the brain and you need their genome to compare tho genome and do a was to gene wide associations study not just with in a species humans but a cross species and you need a go genes to do that plus i discovered ism also interested in evolution and origins how did these species come about similar trait and a in last me three hundred million years or sixty million years the pending you talking about a and you need a good biogenetic tree to do that and to get a good biogenetic tree you also need their genes and because of this i got involved in large scale contortions to produce genome of many different species including my vocal learners in my their closest relatives that ism fans of but i could not convince the funding agencies to give me the money to to do that just for my own project but when you get a whole bunch of people together who want to study various traits a heart disease or what or losing gain flight and forth suddenly we all need lots of guenons to do this and now that got me into a project to lead on the call a vertical tenon's project to eventually sequence all seventy thousand species on the planet and a earth vilogeno project all new patriotic species all two million of them a and and to no longer being a situation where i wish i had this gene now we have the genetic code of all life on the planet create data base of all their traits and find the genetic association with everything out there that makes a difference from one species to another a one more piece of a of the equation to add to this story is out i did it realizes a neuroscientist were that these genes or not only in complete abutter have lots of errors in them false gene duplications were mother and father cromistones were different from each other that the gene malar than assemiliograthems treated them as two different genes in this part of the crimson also there a lot of these false duplicated genes that people were thought were real but were not were missing parts of the gene because the engine us to sequence the gean could not get through this regular try region that folded up on itself and made it hard to sequence and i an up in in these consortiums pulling in the venom sequence in companies developing the technology to work with us to improve it further in the computer science guides who then take that data in the technology and try to make the complete genes and make the algardans better to produce what we now just did recently and led by an effort by adman philipy is the first human tell merited agent with no errors all complete no missing sequence and now ere trying to do the same thing with vertebrates in other species actually we improve that but before we got to what we call telamerdotelamer from one end of from us om to another and what were discovery is in this dark matter of the gene that was missing before turns out to be some regulatory regions that are specialized vocal leaning species and we think are involved in in developing spent circuits incredible a what to learn and that that we can learn from this information early aught in these xenon projects in connection projects i confess i was a little but cycle t s would be at but ten fifteen years ago i i thouglooking necessary but not sufficient for anything a we need it that is not clear what is can o happen but you just gave a very clear example of what we stand to learn from this kind of information and a and i know from the conservationside there is a huge interest in this because even though we would prefer to keep all these species alive rather than come them their these sorts of projects do offer the possibility of potentially recreating species that were lost i due to our own ignorance or a mishap or what have you yes and and along those lines a because no we got involved in genomics some of the first species that we start working on are critically endangered species and i doing that not only for a for under yo prospective to understand their brains in the genes involved in the brain function but i feel its a moral duty the fact that now i become more involved in gene biology and have help developed these tools from wore complements let us capture er their geneticode now before they are gone and could we use that information a to resurrect the species that some future time if not in my lifetime in some time in the future in generations ahead of us and on in do in anticipation of that we created date base we called the gene mark ain in no unintended now's ark a meant to store the genetic code as complete venom assemblies as possible for all species on the planet a to be used for basic since but also some point in the future and because of that finding ageneses o private foundations that are intersect an conservation have been reaching out to meow a aura sciences a to help them out in producing high quality gene data of endangered species that they can use revive in restore who one o resurrect o passenger pigeon were colossal who wants the resurrect the fully mamas and were producing high quality genes for these groups for their consolation projects what terrific and important initiative and i think for those listing to day they now certainly e understand the value of under deeply understanding the brain structures and genomes of different species because i confess even though i knew a bit of the song bird literature and i certainly understand that humans have speech and language it'd no idea that there was much convergence of function structure and genomes and to me you no feel a lot more a a are not than i do a song bird i and yet here we are with the understanding that there is a lot more similarity between song birds and human and i certainly ever thought before a something very close to home for us humans i can give you an example of is evolution of skin color a in in skin color we use it unfortunately for racism and for we use it also for good things to let in more light or let out less light depending on the part of the planed our population evolve than and most people think dark skin people all evolve in the same dark skin person in lightship people will evolve in the same lightship person but that is not the case dark skin and light skin amongst humans has evolved independently multiple times like the pacific lands verses africa and an it is just depending on the angle of light hitting the earth as to whether you need more protection from the sun or less protection a to that is also located winvimin decenteces a in the skin and and each time a where a darker or lighter skin evolved independently hit the same gene you know a yo the melton of plan tell an interceptors that is right yes ye a genes that are involved a melanin formation a and a those genes evolve some of the same stations even in different species it is not just humans in equatorial regions the darker skinned animals than going away from the equator cot i thing of arctic fox in s i players and a and some of the same genes are use ininevolusionary prospected to evolve in the similar way within and across species incredible yo and that is the same thing happening in the bring to languages no exception will have to say somebody who is a career nor scientist but as i mention several times i to also adores the animal kingdom wat is e also obsessed with speech and language and am at a distance not as a as a practitioner of a music and dance o this been an incredible conversation and opportunity for me to learn a i know i speak for tremendous number of people wen distrealy one say thank you for joining us to day you are incredibly busy it is clear from your description of your sides and your knowledge may that you are involved in a huge number of things m very busy to thank you for taking the time to speak to all of us thank you f the work that you are doing both on speech and language but also this important work on genomes in conservation of the angered species and far more and i have to say if you would agree to come back and because again sometime ism certain that if we were to sit down even six months or a year from now there can be lot more tom you we have some things cook in and think you for invited me here to get the word out to the community of what is going on in the sins world we are honored and very grateful tor thank you thank you for joining me to day for my discussion with doctor epic parvis if you to learn more about his laboratory's work you can go to parvis slab spell j a r v i s lab all one word parvis lab dot net and there you can learn about all the various studies taking place in his laboratory as well as some of the larger overarching themes that are driving those studies including studies on human genomics and animal genomics that surely are going to lead to the next stage discoveries of how we learn

computer at his kitchen table and fume but he is also got to deal with his children during the workday cool weeks ago he is a college professor and his preparing a lecture for classic is anxious about that he wants to be good and then at three o'clock he as to go run get his kids and bring them home and he and his kids get back to the building at three twenty and hes trying to move quickly because his class starts at three thirty and he and his two kids get on the elevator to head up to the apartment and then all sudden i feel the albite hurt to drop it is a half sick and feeling when you are

what is the big deal a he was not rattle an all in facts she starts to get up that he starts to tell her that she is over reacting and that makes her more upset and i to calm her down and and tell him to stop teasing her and and then we took a couple sales and we i tried to make it a hunting organ a remember and look back on and laugh on and that kind of changed the mood in the elevator a little but least breetsli kid's momentarily oke ja gets back to the other urgent matter that is on his mind his class savor three hundred students this big intern psychology class which still has not started

hour and et besides he is going to try to teach the class on his for from the elevator which takes a little technical dangling e pesto downward fume to his one with billy one barrow service bobby get his part his buying but after a while i can no video vow on way he is in and i join the fume class and ism trying to talk to them and i can hear their voices and the studentstrall chit chatting with

hundrickites from his kitchen which of course is also totally weird but after months of doing that it feels totally normal it did you consider t not doing the class did you consider cancelling it is funny because that night i when i told my partner about this she is wanting he just cancel shes a professor but it is one of those things where it did not cross my mind when i was in the situation my mind early in that day had been focus on being able to navigate this complex situation hit was going to be stressful you not getting my kids and getting home and then getting the lecture ready which it'd been wrapping all day and that had determined each little step i made and i never really stops to think that i just do it that is plus right now or lives is here or strange and the just do next task and the next one after that and the next on after that and we do not think about how weird things have gotten each little step nap surly led to the next step and then it was not until i left the

first time and the same shandileer comes crashing down in the same spot on the stage i have seen the archaist remembers were sand archers wo pull back the same bow with the same motion until they de i talk to a trump of player name well hereby long's been at the shoots day one and everyone says he is the same as person in the pet and a kind of drives you nuts for the first few weeks and then after that your mind deals with it and just flushes it out when you are not there you do not think about it do the words to the songs at your play a no a thou not entirely where any work there any fondly whatever i mat i remember once at one time after a show had been running for a while it is somebody asked me to play a little bit of a tone from the shell and i could not even do it i could not even think of one had submerge ti but you brays the laser just rejected being counts under the music is going on ti think that is typical of people do to shows w thin the right have of personality as the can handle is shop ism descended from a long lying of sir's and pe of yo ow people who are use tell papering in the feels for for hardly any money and and are relatively happy with that the wanna players are not exactly sir's they are well paid they play a beloved show and they get the playing small orchestras on the side but the is are highly trained musicians who went to the fanciest music schools in the world drew loins waver on at the best of the best for final which means a pit will always sound good though it also create some creative and spiritual problems for the players who have to get through the score night after night after night ism a violent operator thathav you describe that is that is how you describe o ye fun's it is it is very technical i have i have no emotional connection with it that is a violinist named her cool he is a composer his dream has always to write scores for chordophones he is now been at wanna for twenty two years long enough to see three people in hi section die t ism playing the show nobody's interested in my creative in put have often compared it to working in a hospital no it is just we just keep the show alive as long as we can here they all are and this heard social experiment trap together for decades twenty seven musicians crammed into this tiny space a trumpet player told me it is playing in a summer have been down there and you can barely turn round without knocking into something in the pit you notice everything e way your neighbor blows out as pit vow way someone brags about their kids the smell of some one's perfume every little annoyance every receives slight accumulates one of my favorite stories with should drive anyone who has ever played in a band crazy here is his desire player who has sat next of the same clarinet player since nineteen eighty eight she is convinced he plays half in o flat on every note he is ever place he denies this the person i talk to the us in the pit was meany the oboist she is one of the rare people you meet who has no real filter i was complaining about something which i imagine was that it was really cold it is always really cold and then o some one else from the orchestra said just tired of the sound of your voice wand ism tired o the some of my boys goosy i count i sympathized with her then i was a violet as tat ma because i a i used round up in my garden she she would not speak to me for i a o weeks during most of our talks melody was making reeds it is an extraordinarily meticulous process there is all sorts of medieval looking tools an tiny bits of wood everywhere oh most a the most onanistic people in the world because overtime try agree they think that it my work f usually do not tat anyway this part i on i isms getting the most i wat i you made to pick your color of thread and it just makes all then ever tat i never know what collude he i just as always find that mi have that got awful noise meany studied it dullard she dreamed of being the principal obsess in the metropon opera o the philharmonic but she kept bobbing her editions her nerves got the bass of her every time she was up for a big seat and then life and bills in her even fandom in that way is a very good job in a feel where there are not a lot of good cops anymore e put maladies kids through college peter mortgage and provided security while the music indiscreet classed around her but at the end of thirty years sitting just inches away from your coworkers you lose all sense of proportion your enemies turn into monsters for malady the monster in the pit was always ha trumpet player named francs bonny everything he did proof melody nuts from the black biking shorts he wore in the pit to always eating his dinner in the lockeroom with his pack turned to her francs was the miserable sone of ice and at a tern point he is turn o worn bit ye put this black slip shade on the side of his glances he's where those is cause he does one to see me writ that is why hes where is i really truly boy i wanted to run this all by francs it just seems unreasonable france is the only person i had talk to who had actually escaped from the pit he got in a rock and drove out to the middle of nowhere in colorado he says he is much happier now you's pelham melody oh ye her i i undergo that you too did not have the best relationship one of things that she told us was that that yo basically made an eye patch that you would not have to look at hers is this a true story that outselling us i did do that some boy but elbowsn't just because a million oh she is taken too crucial it was actually anybody that was on my rights she told us for a long time that you sat in the lockeroom and that you re turn your back to everybody because you did not want to look at them yell fellas in a locker room i came there i my dinner looked at the white wall minivan play the show and then left the theatre left the premises as fast as i could and o it worked beautifully can you compare that relationships that you have with other relationships it is family its asses you did did in a putting up with people did you just don't want to hear their voice again you sit there thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of hours this is a court of a life time the musicians in the pet do not play the whole time which means there a thousands of hours where they are not actually doing anything and during those last they read books spy thrillers and mysteries and do the cross word with their neighbors the trumpet player has taught himself three languages another musician ran a wood shot business on his laptop during the show and socially it is a bit middle school there are the loaners the jocks and the french horns they are the boys in the back of the bus they bring in fart machines and run the same practical jogs over and over sometimes t even mass of the audience the front row is right up against the pet close that their feet sometimes dangle next of the musicians heads occasionally one of the french horn players would take out a bottle of white out and writ little messages on the souls of the audiences shoes those guys there is sinningwhere behind me there always chattering and laughing i being me if i play badly i think i o their saying how terrible an oh god i do not want you retaliate myself this more than anything malady told me is one makes her not a sound good every night she is worried the french horn guides will make fun of her ism not playing for the audience case he audient does not and ism playing for those french workplace i do wane to say o one of the complete have got n over the years is som i do due to play well when you have just been doing phantom for all those years it is it is a choice that i fat my choice is to play this music its any other music full i ply and and make it beautiful can you rishi can either really hard won if it is really battle i beg you now nobody is in the phantom pit right now the show temporarily close and march because of coat nineteen the unstoppable show had finally been put on paws i recently checked in with malady again she was not doing very well her mother had died in he nursing home in new jerry presume covet positive she was not getting pay by the show any more and she miss phantom this is surprising tom me telling and all the other musicians had told me about their fancies of finally leaving the show and had believe them but now that it it actually happened she miss a route fan to mi miss the comradeship the re petition of the sign jokes and watching everyone eat and i do not know the routine i count of routine in my life this of course is the office of which she said in the past before covet it was always easier to complain that it was boring and to complain about driving into the city and wasting all that time in the carat playing the same music and going home again an and i just thought i knew i with work back then but it becomes very real now i mean what can i fay now i really now what is not having this job i it is much fun to complain about things that do not matter oh the women in the bath from they are just always talking about their expensive hair and make up and limit's the women in the bar and i y it'd be happy to complain about that again before the pandemic every time i talk to melody i would ask how she was doing grands are always depended on parking it is hard to park in mid tow manhattan the good parking spot was a good day the bad parking spot was a bad day this is how she made sense of her life i think about this all the time most of our lives are spent finding parking for the job we do not want to do melody's not alone in that and after any number of years those routines accumulate d that is more or less your life of all the people i talk to in the pet one musician dealt with the mandarin inevitable repetition of life in a way that really stock with me for the past two decades in the pet cart the musicianwho described himself as a violin operator has been dreaming up the most elaborate and metaphorically perfect coping mechanism it is a ban made up entirely of automatons i met these robot musicians in a warehouse in yorkers the pagan stands for partially artificial musicians card's automatons are made up of scraps of medicine string all wired up to a soundboard that kirkman program to crate whatever sounds he wants there is magnet an electric corn organ a creep the base guitar and then there is rosy the garment this is jam a solid body electric violin using be ex skeleton design this is what how o alleviate the word of of the redundancy of phantom o ism constantly thinking about this project and how i can cruel the ought himation and the kind o music that i would the createwhat why did you decide to do this oh if i ever see a therapist maybe they will help me under someolive than i there i was a part of it where you are man i am playing in this orchestra ism not excreting a it is not the expressiveness that i want i also a kind of feel an automaton and may be just make an automaton a short violins i ma i can i can see exploring that am i looking for some kind of soul heeling from this dehumanization of being in a violent section possibly i ask cart if the pagan could play the music of the night or all i ask of you or any of the phantom classics he was not into that at all this band was not design to play aneroid opera but something inside him just couldn't get away from phantom of the opera back when he was sitting in the pet he can pas just in his head both the people an the sequel to than both which involve india a ones type characters in years ago he got a copy of the nineteen twenty five silent film version of peanut and wrote an entire score he wanted to play it for me he turned out the lights in the warehouse and projected the film on to the wall the pagan started to play the score features him curt as the slow violent is from the star of the show the automatons all play the same thing the curd always improvises not of his show forever the say gasping an can s making a documentary about the phantom pit and his cohost to the pod

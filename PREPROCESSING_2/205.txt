kitchen was in his twenties when he waking that his mam was getting on a blaster train twice a week and going to a place they would stick a needle in her arm and take a pin of blood and they wold keep the plasma and give her back everything else and pay her twenty five or thirty five dollars per pint in gan show do this twice a week an she need e the cash of course that is not the kind of thing anybody wants to here their mam has to do and it tookhim a few years but soon as ye had the money to step in and help her out kitchen told dismal do not do it any more you n it'll just give you the money ad she turned him down do not worry about it i do not need you to jumping don't take care of myself even if it is humorous at least ism not asking for anything a she loves that sing an when she say we do for to day what we cannot do for graver butts i mean is is i is i i guess a personal proverb that she uses to trick herself in to enduring a crucible i can do it to day we made this specially her t was mitchell is in new york his mama was on the other side the country and organ when he grew up and recall sometimes and her fun would be turned off and you pul have to reach in to his brothers to find out what's happening an she needed help and then organize the help but talking other about the blood donations hand they ad a bunch of conversations about it let mitchell torn everything about it about the mufti building dollar companies that by plasma from people his mam about the black doctor charges drew invented a way of separating plasma from blood and set of some of america first bloodbaths at the start of word or too and because we were still in him crow they would not let black people do not at good how symbolic is that that the black guy that veins this process that helps the hundreds of thousands if not millions of people cannot even do not at good mitchells a writer hes born a show before mitchellece jacks man's written about these conversations with his mam and the places that they let him to for instance one day he got a talking about blood and patriotism his mams take patriotism by the way is that anybody says my country it around at what ugly thing happens here is basically just a mam she is the best in her kid n a math what terrible thing they do and e may doing that conversation she sprite mitchell but describing her blood donations as the most patriotic thing she does given the shed sit for the money i guess if we if we kind of think about patriotism in is best it is looking out for the next person she yous just thinking ism giving a part of me which is sacred to finish it some one else but i think it is also too my mother is one of those people she really is the mother who will do anything shes the mother that has a hundred dollars in her account to last her the month and my brothers does not have food ins a frigeriner in she gives him city i in this is not a hypothetical this is a literal this is another way of giving in a mitchell as you talk that i just struck with all the things that a bundled up in in those little pints of plasma when you tell the story it is simultaneously your feeling of protectiveness about her and how she is doing in ta she doing o k and her wanting to be independent of you and the also feeling she is taking care of other people tare also getting money she needs it is and they also it is blood musical think that the all compressed in this little plastic bag then it is both symbolic and literal i think h it's always that way may ti us good is of fundamental geeing us alive something we all share what of our insides that we all have actually seen with the regent color of a stop fine takes on many other meanings a ways that other things in er body do not there is blood ties what feuds and bad blood between people and the blood of the lamb and jess blood turned wine the the idea people who are cold blooded people are hot blooded and now discredited notion of how much of this creep's blood or that in blood yuan running through your veins to can our frog e we dive to do all kinds of stories about blood picture please if you will right now an those a i waited does in the shining opening of u see a blood pouring out right here on the radio but do not touch tat bile there is much to say the you be easy chico wits this america life on for glass bloody stay with us at one started from fulbottom now were here we begin to day with a story about girl actual blood and this joke and by thewy ho was all the seven year old in her audience why did the nurse bring a red pen to work in case she had to draw blood look at anyway somebody wrote into our show last summer saying they'd a story to tell about being a flabotomist a person who job it is to draw blood for latest or durations using by the way a needle not a red pan her name is a dellevine an she said she was the worst fubottomist in her whole hospital what a producers dial we found that intriguing naturally called her up and it turns but she was a perfectly fine folbottomist but she did get thrown into the job from a different job without a lot of preparation it some of the most extreme circumstances imaginable a coalfish out of water here is ti am i liked talking to a dell about drawing blood because as a newbie she saw everything with began her his eyes she was into it she talked about veins in this way that id never heard before just ardently ye just the vein and should fill bouncy you just it by touching it with you ye have i touched and ice sort of bounce an now by bouncing veins so know my own veins wen now i on er hi it'll do it on the back your hand where yet the tens in the in the front of the the thereat her not for us come that don't know did not got o flabotamys they just tell me that not for us a dell did not ever study flabotamy because she is actually a physical fairest she had no plans to ever be sticking people with needles an drawing their blood but when bovid hit last spring the hospital she worked at cancelled all of her physical fair ape appointment and started a signing people to new jobs i really wanted to work on the loading dock that was what i really wanted to de a wanted to drive one those big things around lift palliates of supplies but they did not need her there she ended up in flabatamy one of the departments of the hospital whose work did not slow down it became a total newly drafted to dry blood for the very first time in the middle of a pandemic by the way she did not ronestoname her hospital because they did not give her permission to do in interview a dell spent her first few days following different to motorists around the hospital watching closely as they worked she was imprest to watch as they performed even the most basic tasks with incredible elegance this one flabotamis i just was always mes memorized by the way she put tape on the back of her hand precisely always exactly the exact size piece of tap another one she would hold the butterfly needle not by the wings but actually by the little betel with just can if a harder way to hold it but she was just real mental just the way they could draw blood from the craziest places because hospital patience the sit there and organ failure there really swollen other fans ere shod and these flebloodo sister doing crazy stuff just skimming the surface as some one's forearm an just getting this tiny little spider vain or there getting blood from the back as some ones thumbnuckle i think they're total artist then suddenly it was her turn to try a dell flipped around her hospital badge no one could see she was he physical her past then went in did her first sticks that is plabotamous long gofer blood draws in the maternity word on healthy young mothers who had big easily visible pains she made a lot of working mistakes i would keep the to on in till it completely filled with blood and then when i would retract the need the blood that was left over in the tubing would spill all over the bed and make a big man everyone was always yelling at me the to retract the needle retract it do it do id it is ready it is ready an but it is only half way all just do it i my ay after about two weeks of this sort of haphazard see to the pans training her manager decided she was ready to go in alone on her first day of working slow a dell walked in and saw that her assignment was in the icy you which at that point in aril was full of covet patients i got panic completely panic i mean i i was nervous just i meant even just going into a bovid room just would fill me wit fear terror it was not incredibly challenging assignment i see you patients where among the sickest in the hospital often with multiple ivies and swollen limbs an tilbodamy was only called in after the nurses there had already tried twice to get blood but culling a top of that all the bovid stuff the peep that made at hard to move an see not being able to bring a full cart of supplies in the pressure to work quickly and minim's exposure a all was terrified and overwhelmed but she did her best to figure out her own little routine the beginning i always used to talk to the patience you man tell i would say mi good morning good morning this is a dell an from phlabotamiam here to dross blood you no but there sedated or i called on to days tuesday it is aril twentieth it is a nice day outside i tell them what is on the news or what was going on and i always tell them that they look great the they were that they were gotten better i could tell how often was that actually true i hardly ever but i just felt i heard that people when there is the dated they con sill canna her us i always felt i should say something uplifting i mean a few one a chelating section i mean physical therapies wherein is that man we are imagistic as a group the dell was not doing great actually getting the blood though she was missing something half of her sticks she would get ell suited up and prepared to go in the room try and try and try for ten or fifteen minutes fail then she would have to go down stairs and mark on the white board the patients that sheen mist a more experienced labotamist could be sent up to try again she felt a disappointment bumbling things up in one of the most serious and urgent parts of the hospital when they would send me to do blood cultures i would almost always botched a blood culture is a test for an infection in the blood my first blood culture that i got called to do when i got to the room the patient was in a full cod and they were all in their doing sleepy are chest can or fashions they were shocking him i flipped out i was all my god i was about to love and they are no out they you stay they you stay as if he lives we need those blood cultures i stood there i was waiting and standing next to ma e new we are wholly dressed up in all this year was one of the hospital chaplains oh standing next to each other she was there because if the patient died she would need to go in and do last its and i got completely wigged out by that a sort of feeling we were the the angel in the devil just standing side by side and the patient live and the hospital chaplain just flew out there you now and then i had a go in i was rattled by like what happened then i had to do these blood cultures just like you i did not get it i did not get it remember a dells a physical harpist nobody was dying in front of her at her old job the chaplain never hovered near by this was a totally different gave e all's first week in the icy wo was is trustful that she thought about quitting but she did not she kept going she watched vidiowas about phlabodamy in her free time practised getting her sticks over and over lining up her tubes in the order of the drop folding gods into quarters with one hand readjusting the needle to keep the blood flowing she started to be able to see vain she could not before to do blood from her challenging places the first time i got blood off the skies them nut call ow it just could not believe it all proud of myself ore from a really skinny little vain and ism just trying i just knew would i could just get a centime er blood into the tore that would be good enough for the lab but even being able to drop their blood well did not change her patient outcomes lots died it got to her she says she stopped looking at their faces when she went in the room stopped chatting as when with them to and as she was leaving instead of telling him they looked good and she could tell they were doing better she used to she just told them good by he dell told me that dropping into this tunnel vision bod just going straight for the vain not looking around it actually made her better at drawing blood more gentle it in the middle of the summer here money after a dell began drawing blood the first wave finally started to recent at her hospital then she got a ten from her physical their by boss telling her it was time to come back i was really furious i did not want to go back o rely that ye caustic a bit of of i guess they could not believe it i said i was not going to come back i was surprised to hear this given how she would felt completely inadequate for long when she was there but it felt whit blame to her she would been thrown from her old job into this one finally felt she knew what she was doing she was not prepared to be yanked back out just as quickly it is been eight months now since a delswich back to physical thereby she still notice his people's vans specially the ones on the back of their fingers those ones she told me when summoned really say those ones will stay bounds there the last to go than well is one o the bruises of show i to blood tie we turn out in this blood episode to blood relatives n the importance of family rmaybthe stories about the unimportance of thaw and the meaning lessens of blood ties the sender the story or thirty postcards and one of our producers gave it messed about i wont to start by saying i am one of the people who has never cared it all about family trees who as related to whom genealogy stuff that the only family that felt important growing up with people i saw every day my parents and sister and then can at one circle out grand parents cousins the relatives we would visit with some regularity beyond that they just seems people i did not know and i think this is the scientist in me i comics felt lake thewhole idea of being related by blood who cares if they have some dona that i have it altos seem kind of dumb this was a problem when some one would ask me when my family came to the united states my great grand parents i think from austria poland some from russia the various points hats felt a thing i should know just i could not look an idiot when that question came out it'd asked my parents whole tell me but therefore a lot of details no one felt real in it and whatever my parents would tell me it'd promptly forget then a couple summers go we were visiting my aunt an uncle my kids ware running round lunatics a sitting on the couch my aunt handed me the stack of papers they were photocopies

blood in the history of fake blood also fixing a human blood pomp and if i good speaks in english that is in a minute cicada bubble radio wen our program continues is merit an lie from our last to day's program bloody feelings stories about blood in all its liquid meanings blood is metaphor blood is the actual staff moving through our veins we arrived at at through ocher at three stage right this is condition it is called veto bagel sinkage is basically fainting in re action to certain stimuli triggered by all kinds things exposure heat stress and the side of blood i turns out that the blood he does not even need to be real blood to get that response one of our producers been out of wine remembers one bloody shakespeare production that at its height had scores of people fainting night after night here is been i can see thousand in sakes i was a year out of university trying very haunt to be write and working at a bookshelf in central onion i was also almost alwaysburg bark in fact that i do not think i could afford more than one visit to see a western show the entire year what i did do a rule of the was a ready theater reviews two thousand in sakes was the year of michael sheen and franklangella in from ninon it was ha year avenue cue came to the west en the year of wicker's onion dare and all i could do was dream of going to see them naturally the review page was the first place i read about a play that was getting ray reviews that was apparently grisly bloody audience members were fainting the play was one of shakespeare's least loved plays tights angeronicas three hours of muscular bloody theater that as one audience member quoted in the paper put it had people dropping flies it was thrilled at the idea of theater being powerful enough to fell even sturdy onion theatergoers i was jealous i wanted to go i wanted to see if i could withstand it in the fifteen years since have often thought about the source of that production's power about the blood and they at wont what we had forty three people once o forty three people wanted forty three that was our lax all these years later i was thrilled to talk to the director lucky bailey because i wanted to understand how she done something extraordinary once i came at the auditoria land the uses all a school girls came and they all fainted and thee all in this box we put them all up there loo to the you no always the very pale gars all city i i fainted all taken out i surface the ushers when i came a we shower and and how many people to day just to be clear no one fell and hit their head or got seriously injured they were simply overwhelmed lucky just had not foreseen the fainting to give you a picture the globe is an open air theatre a mostly faithful recreation of shakespeare's original which is under half of its audience standing close to the action on the stage and the globes used to painters combination of standing and the sun probably during titers when a person fainted the ushers would wine through the crowd with an unfolded filcher and then take them out of the arena later in the run there was a saint john's ambulance park near by it is not surprising the blood in contacts and quantity is inescapable and it is supposed to be tits santeronicas is one of shakespeare's earliest plays and there's a lot of young man's swagger mixed in with the poetry of the writing set in ancient come the play was written to speak to some of the fascinations of the elizabethan era it is about war and revenge and an over the top grief that clouds good sense and moderation innocence get plan brutes revel in their savagery blood is shed in really horrible ways rictal sacrifice slit throats mutilations sexual assault glossa memorable cannibalistic pie it is ta play that trenched in blood and it often gets written off as a flurry of unsubstantial blood lettings because of that true lucky knew the blood matted to the play one of the first things she had to figure out was had to make the blood look real in an ironic twist to make the blood look the real thing they had to fake it if you see a lot of stage blood it it often does not feel very really even if it is quite accurate the color of blood but blood is quite right and somehow that bright blood in in theater terms makes go o yea yer that is just such a sea tor blood a said look how we would make it unreal in order to make it or real and other was we graced the blood lucky also had to figure out how to make the blood move it would deliver the most impact she turned to another expert the fight director you talk to here about if your wounded in this way hordes blot the have thus were toes the blood her whys it coming out o the callow tears why is it maria those what is what is a learned if the blood for camera who the audience love to hays there is a very careful spurt of blood when she gets a giant fork in the goods when tights loses a hand there was more than one source of blood a spurt from a syringe and then a slower ooze out of his arm to make the intense experience more immercive lucky and her designer build dude focused on the space itself they wanted to make it feel oppressive make the audience part irate in the blood sport the achieve this by giving the globe a temporary velarium roof which reduced the sunlight and created shadows and then they feel to the space with incense they moves some of the action off the stage and into the crowd to create a sort of theatre of chance the idea was to make it feel a temple of death they have to strike a delicate balance too little blood an atmosphere and you do not bring the audience along too much and it feels a parade yet i a huge contract as yet between the audience ans he play and the players that the audience given any charts want to believe as long as you do everything to suspend there their disbelief then you you yo you keep that contract but as soon as you break that contract and do something that shows them were the panic or overacts overplays your cards overeggsit too much blood or or uni sit to little blood at the moment where they going sorry i do not believe that and one of the places they decided to under play happens in the very first blood letting in the play when titers sacrifices alarms it happened very quickly wit how we did it we who and it war fast and then they saw that a the blood and they then then were pudding him they do not have tile to dwell he did a very deliberate sail we really was shocking with it the audience sees a flash of red and then he is gone almost immediately maybe the blood made them faint but it was not just the fact of it that cause them to fall it was what was happening between the people on stage the feelings they were experiencing one of the most shattering moment in the play comes after linear attacked and mutilated is brought to her father and unravel the dark viscera blood seeps through the bandages at her stumps and pause slowly from her mouth even titers a warhardand general whose don his own share of killing is reduced in that moment to an anguished and helpless father his precious daughters still bleeds and he cannot stop that that bleeding to have your lives blood bleed or your kill or the blood that is your blood and to see it bleeding ants to understand how those wilds were may is is luscious the brain to point or madness as titers himself says in that scene it was my dear and he that wounded her have hurt me more than had he killed me dead theta o o a girl who still alive but bleeding and that an causes much internal bleeding to her father both o the heart and the bray in a way he suffers a king o bray an bleed the entire play is tie together by that ribbon of grief pareve lose children brothers turn on each other innocent bystanders are collateral damage and all the blood is in the service of that sure feeling the language is hysterical and violent and it goes on for five long acts the audience gets pulled into the hysteria because they have little choice by the half way point intact three they far gone that they drop at the idea or violence we use to have people fainting on a word whenever caiman said that he wanted want of them to chop off they had you could always guarantees tat somebody would faint when he said chop when errand says the word here adheres no actual chopping happening he is just saying it but it was enough you could see the audience to the gird themselves and then he say chop and one somebody would go one of the things i is c curious to to to lucky about was how wit felt to be the architect of all this feeling what was it to do this to an audience again and again have to be honest was completely filling we we have not expected the response or is tend not to be vocal this kind of fainting was a sort of sign of audience involve them testing i think the whole effect to see the astonishing effect o had on people to the extent of people was sick they fainted that even urinated the lost control of the the whole body was to do it this cumulative feeling combination of thins wot just one thing it was such a i formation that something about the play was northing eight years after that this production and two thousand and fourteen lucky revive tits andronicus at the globe it was a different cost and once again audiences flocks to see this difficult bloody play this time the the orders did not faint as much i mean they really did not and yet everything we did was i think palpably the same if not better e and i think that was because people came psychologically prepared it was very much harder to get that that the contracts going that your involved o s see youaregoing to face motel theatre is mostly a quiet affair polite applause gentle chuckles usually when people leave a play in the middle of the performance is because it is bad they not feeling will they suppose to be feeling wet times that were checking out because they were feeling too much be mater wen me is one soersho that for there is no us in debris o we about thirty million america have libraries and if you soft now what this is libraries are these muscular tumors that grow nor in the debris we soft knowhow causes them why they flick people of color at higher rates specially black people he fact we know little about them that vice present at come a arris introduced the tenant library research and education act i saw guess back when she was still senator i must always libraries of benign li they do not turn into chance her but they cost problems pain discomfort and then this the blood which of course is what our primus that to day libraries can make periods heavier a longer or more erratic factors can be dismissive surgery's expensive an carries is and even after surgery libraries can come back new ones ten a attack went back and forth about getting surgery her library did not bather he at first but of a time it grew bigger and cause mortimore discomfort and she began to think about her library cars partner making her life miserable she even imagine confronting the library andyou know the relative safety of a therapist offs with the question should we stay together she made this into a won act pray starring three characters women f library and therapist and we present now the world premier of her play well then let us get

casting out from garrison ten bet en apart wrote this play in part at the third coast radio residency at radar n by the way in real life decided haver food remove you doing fin i five in break my heart for our later about blood to day we go right to the source the machine that keeps blood pumping and flowing inside of us and to somebody ustrobat istimature that machine works well producer john call talk to this man and also watched i work winning if you are squeamish about he was insides the stop has a lot of that my favorite fun fact about blood is that it has a protein it that is also found in eggs albumen something about that just strikes me as poetic the complex machine of the human body and a thing it eats for breakfast sharing the same ingredient i learned about this fact from the heart surgeon doctor john elefteriotis or doctor e about five years ago i drove up to male newhavan hospital and talked with him about this one technique employs tall deep hypothermic circulatory arrest a k a the deep freeze often he has to do such radical plumbing work on the heart and its arteries that his teem cools the patient's body down to sixty four degrees fairing height and then warms them back up again afterwards he compares it in one way to making egg lemon soup you do not want the egg to curdle and at curdles when the cook is in a hurry it has to simmer at a very low level in order not to curdle well that is because of the albioman in the egg and the bloodstream is full of albumen that if we warm too fast we will basically yet scrambled eggs n the bloodstain grow that is catestrapic warming takes one hour we have to warm very slowly that is long as a meeting bet is no more than ten decrees warmer than the blood the blood wall curdle we wall catch scrambled eggs doctor es an expert on the steep frees method he is been described is one of the best doctors in the country a giant of cardie thoracic surgery when we met in two thousand fifteen he would been at male for more than thirty years and in about seven thousand open hard operations to that point who may be three hundred transplants he dramatically length in the lives of the was musician day bruwbeck and the writer robot lulu for long time he did one major operation and then may be one smaller procedure almost every week day he offered to let me watch him perform the deep frees watch him take a patient and literally suspend their animation it is what cooling them down does there not dead but they show no signs of life any mark that he could reach into their body dis connect the crucial organ and fix it with his hands it is he is a m aster illusionist fooling death with this highstakes version of misdirection i was ya given i was thinking what we we a the sounded open in a breastbone i i e a interesting for the procedure i observed was a three hour aortic graft and valve replacement itstretchd i got to the or early about seven thirty in the morning on a thirsty all gowned up with a mask and scrub hat the team was already creeping the patient for sedation doctor e and i stood several yards away in the corner he could go over the case with mat the patient had an aortic arisen you may know i did not the word is the largest artery in the body and shaped a candycane chest an aneurism just means the part of it with a curved part at the top in this case had become swollen it stretched a balloon filling with air it the wall of it was tooth unlike many other diseases does not have any symptoms until it rapturous a first symptom as usually rupture or death to tat seems its more than a symptom yes it is it ta conclusion o its a conclusion that is for wall state of yet the patient was still awake at this point eyes wide open listening to one of the anasteseologist he had a brown mustache and a burnt looked nervous leaning toward afraid within minutes he was unconscious and they were painting his naked body all over with an iodine base hated his eyes shut then they swaddled him completely in plastic and blue surgical sheets which made the whole thing feel much more impersonal doctor e seems to care a lot about his patients but this is when i began to understand how automotive his work is managing the proper function of this motor with its valves and chambers and sparks propelling a person's blood finally they made the first incision her opening him up eyes opening a general artery down i the loves l let an doctor he was right the sound of them sawing open the breastbone was i guess we can go with lari then they inserted the chest separator like a reverse vice instead of squeezing things together it spreads them apart while i watched on a walmonider the circulating nurse pay laphond came over and explained to me that they were slicing open the para calcium wit as kind of protective sack around the heart and it came at that extract of packaging and is that is that the liver no that big a that is the long wile almost get expand in contract with breath she was right i watch the lungs expand and contract with this placid rhythm that made me think of onion waves rolling in and out it was earthly and it was familiar and then things get a lot more intense owe crew owe oldy looks e boy timing tissue cutting tissue a en a sort of a pushing along to the let o o i broken true to the heart which is meeting it sort o jumping a fish and his chest an angry fish trying violently to escape but even that is too terrestrial a description for what this looked it looked alien a creature an a sight move with no familial relationship to humanity it was startling almost frightening and i will never forget it to think that same thing e ventilate is also in sight of me and doctor e and all of you and everyone but when you see it be think that thing is not to be trusted just then doctor e asked me if i wanted to come up top yes an and on to the stool just behind the blue drape that separates the sterile area where they were operating from the rest of the when i was standing almost exactly above the patient's body looking down into it and being that close this fellow i was looking at something fundamental an ancient and i felt this is not something irregular stuck me is supposed to see if your got are exposed and ism there it usually means something is gone really wrong tan realize that hearts were big o her i try to convey in the different origins for the general public as the beauty the bod the control ho you the be i just take my breath o way every single ta many i do not think idea is to first word i would a shot a in ta a this is not the most beautiful a they hook the patient up to something called the heart lung machine the big part of these procedures is outsourcing the work of the heart in the lungs to this big boxy kind of robot with rotating drums in it this is how thy pull off the grain illusion tricking the body into operating without the heart they send the patient's blood to the machine it oxygen nates and pressurizes the blood and so cools it and then sends a back to the kidneys and the liver and the lungs all the organs and you concede we ma picul we a o fall bubbles e bubbles e was a strop bubbles from the blood yet bubble o ere and the blood we re move om all very careful are you see now on at the heart is collapsed be carse we have taken all the blood out doctor et clamps off the horde of right above the an yours of you are a try that takes the heart out of the circuit they also send a super cold er paralyzing fluid to i t called retro brad for retro for short the heart is not even trying to contract any more now the patients vital signs of most totally seized no pulse of course because his heart is not beating very little brain activity but looks this particular patient is not as bat off as others they do not end up having to cool them all the way down to sixty four degrees when they do that it means zero brain activity no signs of life whatsoever and when the patients that cold they actually turn off the heart lung machine which means no blood float to the brain no oxygen under those conditions it is a race against time they have forty five minutes to an hour to operate for the brain starts to die meanwhile this patient's heart it has been beating for more than sixty two years and before he was born is still most of us when our heart stop it will mean there never going to start again and that all happen to this my eventually too of course but this is just a time out for the heart a break to think of it as a many vacation after a lifetime of constant labor in the pump house of open theeorder you are looking inside so a you conceive ta cavernous dimensions are vary order there we could give it a spot now they set about the actual mechanical work there in their demo first they replaced the aortic love is all falsify and then they swop out the ugly part of the aorta with the synthetic tube and after about two and a half hours they are pretty mu done and it is time to bring the patient back to life doctor e calls for the official d arming maneuvers that is evacuating any excess air out of the heart before they let it fill back up again with old and suddenly it is hes a move director on set complete with lots of industry terms i did not understand let a little blood fly through the heart run for retro for wearing and will take a had ta n a stash valsalvas are deep breaths the anasteseologist can actually control the motion of the patient's lungs next doctor e needs to in clampthe award to put the heart back in the circuit lo fly for the clamp we are a ran and back up so we asap down retro of all the fly to you red on green are warmhaleway retro again as that paralyzing fluid they turn out off red and green are both drainage tubes less us wet color they are and warm all the way means back to the world of ninety eight point six degrees no scrambled alpine another hart o starting the it a a she to ovation at this point the patient's heart the violent thing i was afraid of in the beginning is much more docile whit is more a big chicken breast to me now doctor e says the probably means ism getting hungry which i was ism not some one who tends to seek out intense experience was not really adventurous i don dream about travelling the faraway places but looking inside of another human being that watching a group of people panama this what is wrong and clothes him again felt as unusual and unlikely as visiting the moon it is ha place it'll probably never visit again and i did not even know the on did not even meet him or say

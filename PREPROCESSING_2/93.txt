i know the past few days have been really hard to watch i know the show has been really difficult to watch and to listen to online a moment to explain why ism showing you all this video and plagal the audio and showing you'll the pictures of the atrocities that the terror run comas has taken and released we ism showing you the abduction of raped women the catnapping of families and the murder and burning of children s there is a reason ism doing this because there is an intellectual self centredness the predominates among a lot of us in the west we think everybody things us we see somebody do something truly evil we thing tours of what that is terrible but the only reason i would do something that is of something truly awful happen to me after all people are generally reasonable generally peaceable generally decent everyone i know is what awful circumstance could force someone into such terrible evil behavior we think while if only someone had just made a few concessions dismantled a few settlements offered a little more land after a we all want the same thing right well no no we do not that is the point we can all tell ourselves these comforting little lives before you see the pictures of what true evil does but you cannot tell those list yourself after you see the pictures after you see the videos after you listen to the audio because here is the thing nothing anyone has ever done try you or whatever do to you would cause you to do these things no territorial dispute would cause you to butcher babies no squabble over territory would cause you to rape and abduct women no called occupation would cause you to kidnap entire families or burn them alive in their homes the only type of person who would do something that is a person who is not you a person who thinks differently then you do a person who does not value life or children or decency the same way that you do a person who might proclaim for example that they love death you love life is comas leader hammed deep to day you is really our fighting those who love death for all you love life and who comped among themselves for martyrdom you flee from death a person who might say we love martyrdom mas leader is aphonia we love death our enemies love life we love martyrdom the wan which camps leaders died the kind of person who might call for killing their own children to wipe out the news a commas spoke person from the also larva bribing got of the palcinian people shall never extinguish the right of return the palsinion people shall liberate its land with blood with martyrs with women with children s i share turns liberators on our heads are high and carrying the banner of there is no god but all and hammed is his messenger see contrary to the peculiar narsysm of many westerners they are lots of people around the world who do not think we do who do not actually care about their children the way we do which is why they hide rocket launchers behind their own kids who will willingly murder jewfish babies just because they are jewfish babies the have been indoctrinated call since youth in a system of cancerous hatred strong they rewiring to commit the worst atrocities since the notes and then post them on line and celebrate them commas is not you those who celebrate comas are not you and here is the thing they exploit that fact they murder your children and they hide behind their own they are lie on your cultural narcissism to make you believe the death of the kids they are hiding behind to somehow your fault you see if they care about their kids way you do his must be your fault when they children die in air strikes they provoke well hiding behind their own children they expect you to care more about their kids than they do themselves but what is more important they expect you to believe that they care about their own children when they manifestly care more about other things about destroying the take of israel about murdering every do in their bed they cannot be reason with and they cannot be negotiated with not listen all this is awkward for those who believe in a supposed universal human liberalism in which we all seek the same thing we all seek freedom we all seek a decent way of life here is the thing not all human beings think the same way we do not i know this is hard to believe about any human beings but it happens to be true even if it is a seriously hideous truth perhaps most hideous truth commas does not think you we do not all seek the same thing we do not share the same values nay know i know we do not not just because camps says it and proclaims it because of what they do and then what they broadcast and celebrate doing the not sees that was try to hide their genius it'd come moss cheers it they hand up candies two children to celebrate the murder of babies and the rape of women have seen the pictures and have seen the figure and have watched the tapes that tapes they release that tapes they celebrates you have seen them too on the show the with that every one is westerner underneath has to end or the west is going to end because car system is the preserve of the safe and the fat and they happy but reality comes with shocking and brutal violence unless we wake up and the only thing that wakes us up the only thing is looking the ugly reality of evil directly in its evil face and that we ism showing you this ugly reality that hideous reality i do not want to do it but we have to do it because we have to wake up because we do not the west we will sleep walk our way right in to our own extermination ism a sow you more stuff to day that is going to shake up your sleep ism sure you more stuff to day that is can remind you of the people that the west faces down the people that is rallies are facing down right now in the gossips trip ism show you more of what they do what they say what they celebrate ism to show you more of that because this peculiar auto sophisticated idea about foreign policy well it is all just about negotiations that you can negotiate your way into magic with people who wish to murder you and your children that is not just foolishness it is it is dangerous foolishness truly dangerous foolishness have been combing through all of the video and audio it is flowing out in extraordinary rate from comas idiots posted on various websites from people on the ground first responders ho are taking pictures of what is happening these are pictures of the entrance to gumboots berry that is one of the sights where over a hundred news were found murdered o these are civilians who are tempting to drive out of gumboots berry hams stop them and then burned them alive ism and i these are polices levelumages r just that that is what it is these are pictures of lar aka car aka is the sit o and this sure many people of hard by now apparently forty babies were murdered there and some where beheaded according to media sources lar aka is also where the had family was burned alive you see in these pictures that the house is burned down they set the house on fire and then you had two choices to stay in the house and be burn alive or drown out an be shot onside by mamas derris a they found grenades found burning wreckage saw you can see in those pictures a of the charred skeleton you can see another charred skeleton outside of truck an see the the burned bodies o mum of news murdered by murdered by the mamas terrorists you can see people burned alive in this is this is a picture of a child's blood soaked bed in another gumboots arum shalom that is a child's bad that is the sizes of the bed of my of my three year old and that is a blood soaked bad that seen morons outfitters saying a stage staged conspiracy theories where ad the kids go then where are they where are the women where are the elderly did they just magically disappear what happened to them whose their blood on this bed is that grapes the unbelievable willingness of people to believe nearly anything continues to inspire awe the a again bit there video that is now emerged of people in one of these villages who are a coming through the village after after dark there they are there come after dark after all this is ended and finding the burned bodies of their friends this is a unwatchable again all of our shows last few days are shows that are not appropriate for any one who is not n adult they are not appropriate for adults either but there is something insults need to watch his is a is rally stumbling on the free we've blurred out the genitals of this particular young woman i she is obviously been murdered she is been burned in this this is the kind of stuff the she she was just in a village that is all she was chooses living and that is and that is that is that is what we are saying here can hear her friends crying out in here i can see baby seats baby seats covered in blood baby seats covered an blood they came to murder every one children the there these are your child's cares in my child's carpets my children careers you see there they are covered in no in blood is that all mythical wet would word cause you to do something that tot to murder a baby is there anything this occasion murder a baby if your answer is no that is because you think look a westerner it is because you think a decent person but there are people who do not think that there are people who believe the that have done the world he service by murdering jewfish babies there there is no shame for these folks it is not as though they are em it is not as though their hiding the fact again they took a lot of these videos themselves people were burned alive their trucks with bodies in them of people burned alive and see the charred remain fearsome it is been blurred out toys have had by the way who is the source of some of this material i is not israel arm who who is been covering some of this from israel according to build which is the german newspaper one of the treats had a two year old child with him beat him and throw on the porch the child cried i want my daddy the boy tried to run away i was afraid that thy would shoot him and prevent him from running ways bolksto the child come stay with us i said this according to one witness other cupid is residents were brought to the sight by the terrace including in eight year old child and wounded mother shed gun shot when in her stomach who having trouble breathing her hound was swollen she said she was shot she told me her husband had been shot an her baby was dead and i asked her are you sure the baby is dead she said yes they shot him in the head this is em is what they do the seen an has confirmed the atrocities in far ora again lot of pathetic rumor mongering around yesterday because israel ushered in the for press into some of the areas that count see the sight before the before twas cleared people can see the atrocities that had taken place and multiple members the press con firm forty babies dead in this in this village then that is not particular shock because israel an incredibly young country with a lot of children israel values its children no country on earth truly the secular people in israel have three kind piece i it is it is the only country lest have discussed many times i that actually has not above replacement rate demography people love kids in in israel they butchered if they're if they are members commons and em and it was can from my multiple new sources forty babies did some beheaded i her a mean an what going eh ho a does is old or get we sou gee men an ore bike make magic goo aocepaeoru try and kid babies magenta have very from these sea in military er o me some when you wen in the ha what ti yoga o ten picture e o the had a we scuba in the cue ecu babies ueocte pe an thancuspan tecupen and eon babies we begin began the and the a family cursor him cut cut remote pope n just them absolute atrocities obviously the m what is amazing to watch is also parsing on lone am loving the parsing on one when the din bead forty babies the image is to beheaded somebate what clearly then these are these are people who thing just you and and negotiation should take place and probably seaside should e declared obviously am the videos that have emerged of families being held captive we now know that in this particular video the daughters are missing pictures of them have been found in gaze this is the family being held captive this is visit those put out by mamas who a am is and we are in at halos is a casebook live stream the comas group as here can see the terrace in he background this is a a father and mother and they have to very young daughters here we are here at the girls have son as well terrified helpless and inbred that is their saying by the end of the city of their forcing the son who a appears to be a mid midterm age to go to other house is in the area and try and a and trying force people out of their homes try to drop you all their homes to rommascan kill them the dong in a gunpoint obviously agannis is camps produce the dies not is rally truvitio is comas producevidio the girls are still missing at this air er gain at gunpoint here forcing this boy to draw other people out the streaming stopped it at ten o'clock in the morning y those those kids their pictures of them that have now emerged from gaze apparently what is happening to the people in gas wale we know that their missing children not six come six month old babies not month old babies this a compendium of pictures of the small children who have been stolen and taken to the gassipstrep by comas monsters and now what is happening to them while we now have video that has emerged of one of the comas derris who is captured alive being interrogated by israel authorities i and admitting what it is the day re are doing to these women and children who they're who there who they are taking back to the fossa strip here is avid of that interrogation in de read you the translation i no what d they want to do with them the tears is to have their way with them as what as that mean have your way with them is they do not want to talk they say talk he says what they want to do with them dirty them to rape them and thence said about what about the kids he said to rape them that is what ta that is what come of does they said to dirty them of course to sully them that is that is the idea now they lot people out there who are then calling for for some sort of sympathy for what is going on in fossa now we can all be sympathetic to the civilians who are stuck in fossa obviously we should also remember that the only people who seem to give any show at all about palisinian life in fossa in this conflict are these daily troops those a the only people who seem to be perturbed at all about the civilian casualties in fact palsinian civilians have told and be s that israel is telling them to evacuate in terms of howisrael goes about reducing civilian casualty is they say that they use very precise intelligence before they strike any specific location have been inside gaze when is real has been bang and you me palistinians who say that their phoning and on the other end of the in was an as daily military officer telling them an arable we are going to strike your apartment building because there is hamate for struck sure but were want you to go door by door firsts and make sure that there is nobody inside the building before we strike and by the way there is been substantiate on every score israel it was putting out publicly mediate yesterday in arabia telling civilians we are to evacuate from and where to evacuate two here is some of that a translated for e translations been provided by an arabia speaker my the at then one of the mot the be to bisisin his real clingers eking arabia the operations of terrorist organizations force the ideating to act against them in your place of residents may piece be upon you residents of the shirk area all show a neighborhood specifically these go to the shelter or to the center of gods a city and then there is a map showing where you need to evacuate from and we e need to evacuate too we are talking about these instructions for your purpose protection and ascites in distinguition between terrorist organizations and citizens the citizens in order to help us in this you must follow our preparations i thing the hat is s re literally providing mas twos civilians on the other side of the border my at the an idea commander yesterday when i the the explaining how they are working to minimize civilian casualties here he was a here he was yesterday what we have been down from the er o the laorsato the entirely o striking hams targets with great power and severity we have been striking all the different targets the military takes belonging to mamas how you may have seen for this on the her media and yo may see a building sanding an then glasses and then the building classes that you sat your set well that looks very much are toviliandindy what i want to tell you is that now that is not they sevilinabuility it is ay legitimate military target and wise that because mamas uses all up locates all of their offices headquarters the reset an development and all their other military assets if it is about ground they lot themselves in civilian buildings and mamas be the cowards that they are they never cut sins of their building say welcome to the mamas head quarters for et play tares thetivitheinisro welcome to the resect in development enter for groans and projectiles you will never see that because mamas once to disguise itself as civilians and they use civilian building nonmilitary purposes with makes it a legitimate military forget and those are the gets that we are striking with tremendous force over the last this and that those are the images that you see coming out of got israel attempting to promise the plan casualties on the mamas side on coma side of the wine what is comasdoing they're literally telling their own people not to evacuathe're telling the citizens that they are not member they are the legitimate government of gosh they are begun mac government they were elected into than sex they enjoy broad popular support inside the gasastrip a poll from tune fifteenth twenty twenty one found that three quarters three quarters of palistinians of viewed the atomic millions is victors in the last battle against israel a scientific be by the palisinians entire fresh policy an survey research found fifty three percent of all palisinians believed commas was the most deserving of representing and leading the palistinian people fifty three per cent that in two thousand and twenty one ay israel is trying to save the civilians and meanwhile palisinian is lofty hot and mamas have put out audio telling people not to leave t message an air began heres what it was quote we will renew the call to the citizens not to deal with the recorded voice messages that the occupation rankly sens that through the citizens ones asking them to leave their home which aims to pass panic to cause panic and fear as part of the psychological warfare accompanying the occupations aggression against our people he toward stay and be murdered for the cameras stay and be killed for the camera that is what we want you to do murdered by us because we are telling you to stay there is a reason there is a reason they put there their head quarters underneath a hospital there is a reason that they load hate there armaments in a university there is a reason they use schools in order to shield terror activity this is what they do these again they are playing on your sense of cultural sarcasm you would not do that why would we accuse them of doing that because they do they know what you are thinking they know how you think but you do not know how they thing that is why we show the atrocities again a thing to hiding the ball us to be wilfully blind at this pointed for antiseptic or just u hating y you not care about the truth in order to not see what is going on here here is a flash acting a couple of years ago this is tape of the idea telling a homos person to get people out of a building this an idea phone call to goa to evacuate building with civilians before bombing this sis a couple of years ago and here is he the conversation went e i cannot get all if per plod i need at least two hours cop mount y and the is rally says it listen er on the building you want to on boy what ever you once is no brother we needs to everything we can son we do not die on s we want to die and the new says but you have responsibility for children lives n ommossoper says if the children need to dive them they will die and the jaw says god forbid god forbid what you want a titis this is how we reveal your cruelty bet reveal your cruelty is we refuse to move our children from bobbing sights after a hiding munitions in the sights to those that are those people who a who think you s again much of less is builds around this presupposition that you can negotiate magically can diplomacy or way out of a clash of civilizations which is what this really is is typipoint of spear for a serious clash of civilizations and do and toy can see it just written in how the media cover the sort of stuff because if there is one group of people on planet earth for culturally narcissistic it is members of the legacy media in the west they truly believe i ready things them they think don everything from pronouns to taxes and they certainly think that when it comes to international conflict get to more on that just one second i have been reading adds during the show but there is one organization that advertises with the show that totally deserves your support that of course is the international fellowship of christian and news their on the ground right now the providing critical essentials food medicine and other emergency supplies for vulnerable news who need immediate help obviously the need is massive ism getting calls every day from people asking how they can help this i one way you can help to donate please go to i f c oh dot or give as generously as you can write down this i f c j dot or and all the durations are going right now to critical essentials food and medicine and other emergency supplies in preparation for more conflict to do not a go to i f c j dot or an the super sophisticates in the west refuse to see the truth or they simply do not want to to see the truth sot some honesty some of this is just astonishing the o m the level of support that is that that is enjoyed by compass is very real this is a mass of rally last night in unborn michigan for comes forkmassko the size of this rally for compass an on re re we tell you the atrocities echoing it ally leave the size o the that lie all these people waving palistinian flags and class flags is in deurborn michigan again this right here in the united states we have out reporters already lamenting the death told in gaze we all ought to lament the death on gaze and every ounce of blood that is spilled in gaze every ounce of blood spilled in gaze is the result of humans every single ounce every ounce but there is going to be an attempt tic in arty see at starring the media its moral equivalent you see when people break into your home and murder your children in front of view and then you go and you attempt to kill the people who did that and they hide behind their children that is that that is moral equivalent you attempting protect your children and them killing your children and then hiding behind their own to protect themselves moral equivalence that is the direction this is going you can hear how some is relies are rather unsympathetic to this point of view in is rely man whose kind were taken by humans was that was pressed on this by by anuria micelle and i got to say this is this is just astonishing sort of stuff from pemican be see what are you feelings about the the the attacks against gaze right now a how a not the say en we or he loo inter in for the metrical situation and on most say it is not am if you retailing when a a war who is between two countries contras don take children hostages ism thoria is thin gas the lots of war it is against the humanity is against anything that we all believing every time we have mesons a so at out i is to say my children an theshent be sympathetic to wards the children is gone because they refer o orphan pa you am not sure i believing now and i mot say the on worry i have now to e the bombings in gone is the fact o me children a ten anis to to be in o any more i can me sympathetic to and a more human been were they are not really human be wo cannot my house to everything stall everything to my children from sedating and to ton to the gastric is yo never doubts and will never do there is nosing ism sorry but but they want the symmetry the media want people on left particularly are looking for the symmetry because again all cultures are created equal this is this is the premise of much let wing thought ah a a full smile moral idiot lesson piker i he is an emissary of this yesterday the as ranting and raving on his twitch stream about this and suggesting of course why would you that the only reason the only reason that you might murderer wish baby is because obviously years o victimization that that is clearly the problem israel it israel skirt was you short you see that is why you walk into a village and you rape women and and drag them back to the gosastrip that is why you do this here is a moral moral exam play lesson piker they did not deserve it you idiot myall is solutions your gold is the continuation of violets you want way more than two ordered an sixty people dive you want every single palistinian to be executed ruthlessly of the streets that you can build another thin park an goa you bang pig you below o thirsty violent pig got suck mi how do you think this happens you think it happened that have nowhere you think see people are just all we are violet because we want to be violent you think ga'swor violence culminates from or do you think it is because you have in trap them you have bullbat them you have subjugated them you have humiliated these people you milia people live inside of goa have they are not even people and the is of sac that is that is presumable going mason piker why you would murder baby that's why you that is why you would murder baby and burn entire families in their homes in peaceful villages that is why you that is why you would do that ism now ism going to attribute this to again the peculiar narcissism of people mason piker believe that everybody thinks they do and i i i would ask people mason pike a o say if that is the case if you really believe the victimization is what causes people to murder babies in their beds for the crime of being jewfish and breathing then what would cause you to do something that isothere any level of victimization you could undergo that would cause you to o something that because i i do not i do not think rashly i think highly enough even of of people li think are are intellectual cretins got lesson piker that i do not actually think that that he thinks that there is nothing the can make him do something thati'll give him at least that much credit but the peculiar narsisos them hat drives you to believe that everybody thinks you do and then two immediately jump to israel is i attempting to wipe out the israel has not had a presents in the gosstripts in two thousand and five since two thousand and five the last thing israel wants to do is send its own sons and daughters into the streets of goa that is the last thing they want to do i know many of the people who are going to be going into goa i know some the people one dow who we will die and goa trying to protect their brothers and sisters in israel you think they want to be there they try to hand the entire gossipstript to egypt you don't egypt said hello we don't want any piece of it this believed it that israel is land hungry for goa is the most bazar piece of propagantistic trash and ignorance have ever heard it is its bazar and s range that is what this is really all about according toad again i can i can strike to one or two things either either they are only two possible reasons ignorant are hates this the only to possible realm shall a tribute to ignorance speaking of ignorance and hating news crossing streams black lives matter which up i member a lot o people were were strangely perturbed when black love's matter in its earliest iterations had much of statements on it is website in support of the palistinians and against israel ink what is that a to d with black lives maker the answer is the interjectional anti western coalition that suggests that freedoms and liberties our essentially a tool of of white supremacist patriarchy they cross streams they cross streams in taking on institutions and values of the west black he's matopatographic esterdates that i stand with palestine and it is a picture of a person in a ganglier with a palisinian flag on top now our palsinian tans for their hangglaiting is that a cultural thing a just big on hanggliting ore is the reason there using the hangglider in this in this graphic because palestinian terrorist comasterroris took hanggliders tweak medium festival and murdered to hundred sixty people gun them down murdered them in cold blood and bealemon supports that that is what that graphic is they literally put on the graphic a terrorist an a hangglider another said i stand with palestine first of all for all the people who a blaming that the palistinians do not support this sort of stuff i feel you think they do i mean that is it if why would standing with palestine in tail standing with commons ism just confused i only it has to but have noticed an enormous number of cross streams here from you is then they put out a statement perfectly agreed just as usual for black lives matter and for all you fools who gave the money under the species of you are trying to help you are just trying help because your ignorant and stupid you gave them money and you marched with them believing that they were on your side on the side of broader human rights and liberalism and it turns out their just interjectional trash the black lives matter organization they put out a statement black lives mater grassed stands in salivary with our palestonian family where currently resisting fifty seven years of settler colonialism and a partied hell i just would to point out this point the fifty seven years of t settler colonialism and a partied supposedly which includes twenty per cent again of israel is arab out just point out this porlicanat number fifty seven the state of israel is not fifty seven years old the umber fifty seven is related to the nineteen sixty seven war where these villages were not inside day an maria the called occupied territories they were outside there butts artisan don does matter as black people continue to fight to and militarism an massing incarceration our own communities let us understand the resistance in palestine as an attempt to tear open the gates of the world's largest open or prison as radical black organization grounds an abolitionist ideals we see clear parallels between black and palisinian people man america bet hope that is not true a that that is om astonishing stuff there we two understand what it means to be survey does humanized proper sees family separate our people criminalized and slaughter with i purity locked up and droves when we resist they call us terrorist we two dream of a world where our people may live freely on d colonized lane withe colonization means by caymans murdering babies in the in there in their homes means riding women an means burning entire families alive and then filming in putting onion that is what de colonization means they say it not me they say it they say it either again this is ignorance for are you asking to be lumped in with the people who are lumping yourself in with because if that says some things that is at some pretty awful and terrible things o ti this this s on the left a lot of this boils down to the sort of bazar de colonization narrative where by murdering news is fine because news are white people and because news are white people by the way most just israel are not thachall group there savory but put that aside because the news are supposedly white people this means that it is en act of to d colonial resistance to murder news wherever they are in the state of israel that seems to be the the line from from many people on the left these days the elected student president of the ennui you lot chat bar association sent out a message for example refusing to condemn compasses manslaughter and sure leading it quote israel terms full responsibility for this tremendous loss of life this resume of state sanction violent creates the conditions that made resistance necessary ill you see talk territorials but got it is all territorials eefvonly israel had just conceived the gosstrippind gotten out in two thousand five which they did if only they done that clearly piece would have been on the horizon it is all the israily's fault that do that news were murdered by most vicious antisemite of our euros i will say that a there is a great irony to this this person who is the why you lot school bar position president lost her her job at ta shows going to come out and and work at a big wafer for for big corporation the corporal after and a they preemptively fired her a yet ism not a fan of cancel culture generally but have said before that there isn't overtone window it seems to me that when you openly support end terror sari murdering babies and ripping women at that point i feel a i feel at that point is though you probably do not have to be hired by wafer call it call come crazy call it due call what ever you ant once you start supporting the murder of of babies i feel at that point fair game fore you t loose your job that seems that one is pretty obvious meanwhile compasses are plotting a day of resistance sport o compasses to be the students for justice and palestine they're not for justice many them are not students and a palestine as as a state does not exist specifically because the palestonian leadership the p a is lomicyhot and compass have rejected every single piece steal ever offer to them in the history in the history of this entire conflict they are putting out a m presents on college camps across the country by way it's noticing that all the micro egression folks all the folks ore saying rally's offensive and micra egression for you would use the wrong pronoun that is a microgression for her for you to to say things ism color line all the some people are peculiarly silent when it comes to mass rallies across the united states on to legs compasses support of a terrorist group suddenly they look all the microgression heather silent just quiet very weird very weird our people chose resistance over negotiated cages on our home land the group states in a day of resistance toolkit fearlessly our people struggle for complete liberation and return quote national liberation is near glory to our resistance to a mates an toarsteadfast people is according to students for justice in palestine we have an unshakable responsibility join the all for masmoblizationmedlith is nothing new i mean when i was a you see ala there's there is a student newspaper those put up by the muslinstunisociation s called all talked an just before the issue before nine eleven they literally joked about changing the name of the magazine to all talisman and they tempted to put out publications that acted as fundraisers for terror groups this is nothing new meanwhile left wingers who are undoubtedly be thrown from buildings where the actually living in the gosistrupim but one one my favorite the elements of the left is the interjectional coalition that calls calls themselvesons queers for palestine with u quick quick note of irony if you are a queer person in palestine you are dead that is how that works they throw you off a long building but i but no but ism ism glad that ism glad the you got have your interjectional coalition of of to terra support a labor union champion by burniystanders and represent f oleander comic or was and other liberals express solidarity with commosterrists according to the washington are beacon starbock workers unified and if idiot of the service hat poisons for national union express solidarity with palestine into leaded social medioposts union chapters an kiwi chico an boson promoted rallies in support of palestinian attacks including a long live palistonian resistance rally to be held in boson on money that warlock union represents nine malison breast does and join t other america liberal groups in siding with palistonians over there is daily targets the d say the democratic socialist of america which counts sixthalstimocrats o members held rallies in several america cities calling for support for the palistinians the original organizer of the union has a brick has praised at palstonian terrace mama odd is a freedom fighter and has chance from the river to the sea palestine shall be free and the middle of this tweeted quote there is no two sides to a partied free palestine meanwhile one individual union member coo of the stardom's workers united freeing palestine was never going to be flowers and baby animals what the felt did you expect that is a that is what the visit t the lettings is wat the left tings and then there the seudosophisticates on the rights let me first say right up fronts america does not have coincident interest with israel always there two separate countries there sovereign countries trial sometimes wants to do things that are not an america interest andamerica frequently wants to do things that are not in israel interests for example cut deals with erannian terraces terrain's that is for enough happens all the time because sovereign countries are sovereign also worth noting you can be a realist on form palsy without being immoral there is a segment of the republican party that has basically desk ted that if the if the bad idea in form policy for years was there is a moral conflict lets jump in then the reverse of that ad what we need is there is a moral conflict let us but out take no sides down play now there is a happy medium the happy medium is sometimes it actually is an america interest to back people where fighting dunno monstrous terra to bead babies sometimes that is an america interest actually not always there times where you can make the case that america should not sacrifice blood and treasure even for a moral good o you make that case but being realist does not mean being a foolhardy isolationist who is somehow morally puzzled by all of this and this is some of the stuff that ism seeing on the right let me make clear israel has not called on the united states to attackaron no one wants a full shall worth on including israel is you not many news would die in fullskale worth run lot no one wants that iron has used comose is a proxy here and even then israel not striking iron you maybe notice norms israel calling on the united states to strike iron and yet there is been this attempt by some on the sudosophis to get right to say while no blood and treasure what who is called for good an treasure exactly who ism him ism wondering dissuading cusballah from attacking the north of israel is an attempt to prevent regional and then global warfare that is what it is if cusballagets and let explain this to you in small short sentences you understand cusbalize a terogroup cusblize back by iron cusbalah has one hundred and fifty thousand rockets pointed at the north of israel if calla tabs israel with those rockets israel will be stretched to the breaking point if israel stretch to the breaking point it is not going to worry about the niceties of war it is going to eviscerate the entire southern border of lebanon if israel eviscerates the entire southern border of lebanon and also has to then hit all the supply chain roads into the southernborder of lebanon syria will get involved if syria gets involved israel have to hit basis in syria if base in syria get hit iron will get involved and ronwill drag in its clot its prints its client state or its orts its sponsor state russia remember arenas is it is a state that is joined with russia russia basically run syria at this point and russia already signalling support for all of this if you wish to prevent this cascading israel war in which the united states nevertall be drawn you no be good some threats no be good arming israel to the teeth they can act ion prevent this from escalating into a broader regional war if if the idea in the warn crane is that most of the goes been achieve you crane has been protected reeve is not going to fall but the angel's not clear the legal is pretty on clear right now for israel torose come of control the violence in the goes trip that is the engage that is the only engage providing support necessary to do that seems pretty contain and pretty durable and yet you are seeing this can a need turn anti morality on the part of some on the right es of to stroke your chin and pretend that it sophisticated perspective to take up a sort of morally ambiguous view a all this ism sing the from some people who i people whose work have enjoyed in the past and this got to say it is either ignorance about form policy or cowardice or something darker and worse to take an example of just morally moral embryo with for no reason an all mason hillock for some odd reason who again i mason i know mason i lot of his work mason has decided that it is important sound off to me generally and say well what you have to understand why people are why people are are not exercised about about babies being killed in their age in the room i mean after all they're been a lot of ther'rebe a lot conspiracy theories out there ye i know what is the conspiracy theory to which you are referring right now the people should give credent what is it there is he loexpell it out for me i yoursblle out what istle conspiracy theory there leads people to somehow draw a amorally ambiguous line here explain it to me in short words were been fate much bad information about historic events that we have a what what the time of to day is were conspiracy weary were conspiracy leery weyeyou got the thing i thought about watching ben supernal get up set with antrutate and others as have was been twittered and he seem he is very outraged and justifiably but he seems very of set that everybody does it have the same level of outrage the same level of emotion about this event that he does have seen a lot of this were people are policing other people's thoughts any motions about what is going on in israel between israel and homes israel and i ran israel and palistinians people are to this is how you should feel and were getting all these images of the atrocities the happen in israel and everybody's comment and how canyon not the outrage and this is the face of evil and and there is a lot of stomping of feet of this is it this is the install be all and and everybody must feel the exact same way that i do about this situanyou notes tempting to say he you cause there ouen'nough to feel the exacting way that i do but i would recommend that you at least acknowledge that this is in fact the face of evil that seems a pretty base line decent thing to do is he at great pretty base line he reference is there a bit of a twitter spat that i got into with with drew take drew take of he treated out in the middle of all this there is no there is but one certainty in this mess there is no god but attach and doomed is the messenger o the li is that really the the one sure certainty on that that is that is an interesting certainty main that comes out literally he treated that in the middle of all this while the while the invasion was going on and a and then he says the freethinkers on the america right are scrimping for genocide without giving questions as to how made could fail on such monumental level of fraction of thought ushered into another of they will cooked for copy just the same pussy it must have bee the israel brought on it self an actually wanted this happen that is that is really that is ray what this says cay he responded to at treat that son in the middle of all f this the you and special reporter for human rights in palestine said we are horrified by what is happening and we call for truce a they called for a truce by the way the day after the massacre which is absurd it is absurd and s oi tweeted they can far right off because that is exactly right it turns out that when people murder your kids you have no obligation to call for invactuofe moral obligation not to callitruse this drove and relate who is a who is a a very important person because he fluxes his muscles a lot and does not wear shirts and does a lot of curls the hight of human moral and a intellectual achievement is of course that you used to punch people on the face you do curls now and om and you openly bragged about trafficking women on webcast that is that that is we ought take you incredibly seriously as as turkey because of that there very tough he wrote mister tufty let me assure you as some one who does his own fighting i suppose to excitedly incurring others to do it for him while sitting at home on a comfy chair piece is always worth a conversation and i wrote back to him let me assure you as someone who is not pimped women in bragged about it the morality requires that those who rape women and cannapchildren must be eradicated not negotiated with gan ten tistutosophisticate bull nonsense ism sorry this it what else would you call it when you have terrace murder kids in their beds for gods sake and your immediate response is what pieces always for the conversation i gain either your ignorant or you do not give a chaw this are the only two there is no third option and do not give includes you do not jaws that is what is in that conversation and sad to say but that this can of judo sophisticate point of view has alcove been mirror by tucker craws an tucker sets up stamen and then burns them to the ground a plateclip of nickel hale nickel was talking presidential can nicgaley she is talking bout israel has every duty to eviscerate commons she is not called for an invasion iron she is called for removing six billion dollars in funding that america has cleared for on she is called for more sanctions on iron she is not call far ground invasion or america troops to be used againsteron but watch as tucker spins this into while the only reasonable point of view is to basically go hands off on this whole thing even morally yetsurt's bad but is it is it as bad as things happening in the united states here here is a tucker find me morally ambiguous line here somehow tit is not just an attack on israel that is is an attack on amebic because they hate us just as much and what we have to understand it this ti therein that we have to unite around making for our enemy do not her our friend america can never be to right ta think we do not ne friends just we needed m on on eleven that is why you cry a ta on rush is down ta that is why its don't a tachyon halothane kronor down ta and it'll fit as the t have prongs turn at now o finish that finish that heathen ten you knoaron behind at finish that they should have he ta pay for what they just that this was an attack on america she says when in fact it was not and for that reason we must quote finish iron a nation of nearly ninety million people what are we nowhowsho wot this is not to paraphrase a wrong paraphrasis a child and this is the tantrum of a child ignorant cocksure blood thirsty yet no one in washington splundersler nicgahaly in fact they aped her hysteria they a eristic is hysteria now all she said is that nit is in ya who should finish of compass and he calls that bloodthirsty prop agonistic nonsense here from locker he is better than this and and it is pathetic that he that he engage in this or nonsense truly truly he is a smart person and either he thinks you're stupid or he is engaging in stupidity i do notknow which it is it tucker by the way then continued along these lines he did not interview wit the van romisuamy and he likened what just happened in israel the the kidnapping of women and there ray by me hes showing video of this happening as he is talking about this he compared that to drug over those debts in the united states now i i believe we should fully care about the hundred cousin drug lover of deaths that happening reunite says heitheare to completely to reissues to to go this airfield to link the issues you the only rest onuyour doing this because you wished to down play the atrocity the just happened in israel you are not up playing the atrocity f what is happening on america streets those are too different types of atrocities people who are diced to sentinel sticking needles in their arms and overdosing is a is a is a moral blight it is a moral atrocity and a moral evil for people to kidnap women rape them and drag them back to the gosoborder there not the same thing and tucker knows that but his a cheap way of of telling you not to look do not look stop carrying but es after all what is it matter what istle matter now again i don't know who thinks that tisophisticget point of new specially when nobody is calling for america to go to war with round the entire purpose having an aircraft carrying mediterraneas sites is to avoid that but here it hear is tucker playing i onto know the gamesplane is just a due it is a dumb game but you do not have to look far in the united states for moral outrages also on video wen there is not a city in this country unit the big cities but cities of ten thousand people was an one yesterday the does not have some constellation of drug adit tod young people living outside we call in the homeless their dramatics and they are addicted to drugs that were imported across an what does that help it about ps sorting in china i do not understand more than a hundred thousand a year now you can call it genocide you call whatever you want but it is the death of over a hundred thousand america a year and the living death of killing we cannot call it john i sin to notion inside i do not underside tin who are diced to drugs and living on tide his real and again i want to add my voice to that was ism human being blow shared of the spermary outrage among republican presidential candidates was much more in town when took to a burn an star yelling about it i get it but no one would think to do that about the hundred thousand america young people murdered every year and the comes who are you yelling at for young but first shall people are on bullhorn telling about drug overdose says and the open border all the time all the time what is even talking about what he attempting to his minimize what happened in israel he is not thing to matzos what happen in the united states he is attempted to minimize as o america cannot walk and to gum ut morally speaking at the same time which is absurd am those who things are nothing alike ism sir that is not alike it is not alike for drug smugglers to smuggle drugs over the board which some one then takes and shoves into their arm and n they dive in overdo that is not the same thing i promise you it is not the same thing as a terrorist breaking into your home and murdering your showering in their beds in front to of view and dragging your wife off to be raped in gaze that is not the same thing pretending that it is is i moral it is a moral like it is idiocy it is just moral stupidity at the highest level of course we should care about what happens with sentinel of course we should care about all we should close our border have i been on clear about this of course america shave closed borders when it comes to the sort of stuff ism on the samesidt is tucker on that i s do not understand why he is not on my side when it comes to come okas to be wiped off the face the earth what exactly is the counter argument it in any case that this sort of moral sophistication is predicated on on only one of a few possible hypotheses the most dark and and terrible is the possibility people just do not give a damn when news get killed by terra ism not accusing tucker of that ism not causing hillock of that in fact ism not even accusing the to sees the world of that although think she is closer to the border concerning the only tweet she has sent in this entire ridiculous situation is a tweet finding one new in new york saying a bad thing that the is really government does not even carry forth that is the demon thing she sin to tweet about as ism the ism not accusing all the people of that what i am accusing them of is a moral blindness that must be caused by a complete flattening of the cultural landscape a flat in which everybody thinks the same way that they that we do and that every problem can be solved in the same way and and that it is it is of no consequence whether evil walks the earth because all problem are base that is what realism truly is that that is not realistic that stupid the er not the same thing it you one comes to policy questions about what be done in the middle east that is a question of prudence it is question of pragmatism it is question of america interest which again are not always identical with his really interest when it comes to comparing the the the holopost level evil we just saw in far aka with people overdosing on the streets of philadelphia ism i have some i have some moral questions i do ow as i set earlier on the show if you are interested in helping out people who are in a massive need in israel i recommend the check out the international fellowship of christian and news tear on the gun right now providing critical essentials food medicine and other emergencies supplies for vulnerable else who need a meed it help the need is massive an urgent this organization eat your helpwright now to do not it please head on over to i a see jabot or give is generously as you can write it down that is i f c j dot or go and give money and and give whatever help you feel is is morally appropriate a case rare rare turn of events jobidon he is been sending a few mic signals the white house yesterday put out o statement suggesting that that israel these to engage proportionally with commons and to sure a proportion is what would we talk about a hundred to one ten to one one what how many dead dead comose terrace account for one dead dead jewfish baby man u just wondering how that works proportionality is a mush word that means nothing in international relations it is stupid in fact if you not men further conflict what you want is dis proportionality you knows rather dis proportionate what is rather dis proportion is when allkida took out three thousand america on not eleven and we took down two countries you knows count i dis proportionate pro harbor killed several thous an america and we watched eight et two front world war against japan i germany just proportionate bad no no it turns out the the best way to deal with people where murdering you is to a just proportionately white them off the face the earth that is that is actually the the best thing to do with people o comas terrace well that was a stupid note put out by a join yesterday but jobidon then gave a press conference and he gave a speech now he is got in some flack on the speech from some people on the right because he did not mention iron in the speech now i actually understantactically speaking why he is not mentioning iron the reason presumably there there is good reason an batteries the batderiason is because this ad ministration continues to idiotically support a deal with the on which i impossible iron his run by the same kinds of people as commons they they they continued to sponsor and subsidize them to ten billions dogs that is one reason why the'renot mentioning around the other reason is because if you mention iron in this contact then presumably you are creating an intensive ferrontascalad i kind to hear that but the speech that widen gave yesterday was in a rare shocking exactly honestly you shock by this he speech that actually had some moral clarity to it a lot of moral clarity actually here was jobidon yesterday talking about the atrocities in israel moils lie es the pure on do love isles is m people of is e the wan is o t speaking body the tertersisnmas go who stated purpose tor be kill us son i to sheer evil he continued along these lines he points out the history of the jewfish people in the state of israel tack i brought to the serves painful memos scars get by mlanymani feminism get idea go people this moron we must be crystal clear we stand with israel we stand with israel we will make sure you has wat needs to take care of its citizens defend it respondious attack he then distinguishes the commas cause from the palstinian cause which again is perfectly fine allege admit and then he says that me the that israel basically has free rain to take the gloves of do what it needs to do to stop the terrorism i here he was talking about this is clipped for make every nation otherworld is e has the right t respond indeed has a duty to respond hes vision attacks es get off the for the fer don't pimps an ow i told do non state experiences experience in our response to be swift desiteomen overwhelming am well that is exactly correct and then he did i think the most important thin in the secure was actually a policy policy thing you points out that america has strengthened its defense poster in the idealist which is important be again if you not want a regional war you you have to threaten one you you have to say to or ronlisson if you got get in is not congo how you think it scan about because people take advantage of situations and here is bide a gan credit t the president for saying this i state is also in handed our military force posturing the reaction tostrenthen hard turns thepartmenn face is move you asses tall our for try striker heron metitrain in bolted our fighter air back present we stand ready to move in additional sits as needed army say gain any country any organization any one thinking of taking hangs situation i one word do not do not that dome that is right that is not interventionist by the way that is the hat that is the opposite interventions to be going to striking iron right now that is not what he is talking about he is saying guys stay out is it contain conflict let a remain a contained conflict that israel has to win eccestentialy by way israel does have to win this conflict if if does not then the the sense of military superiority that has allowed a tiny state of nine million people seven million jewels to survive in the most hostile region on earth historically that reception military superiority is israel asset that is been punctured by what just happen with compass is do host restore that and tag's restore in spades right now by destroying commossole sale we unfortunately the democratic party is is also plagued by i am a bunch of commons caucus members rociditaly bleeding among them here is that you oversionitsly gesterdations asked about ti sheeny comment on come asses human atrocities including the beheading of babies and i she literally just keeps walking because why would not ship by say the easiest thing to do in the world here is say come ass committed acts of evil there cause not the palsinou close easiest thing in the work is will not say that she will not say that i wonder why her t a er m all war real and note ay es ergo sin very walking to e just ten several times just keeps walking again the s this thing for to do right there is to say that last question is the easiest one for her she just as i do not back i comossta by back the palstinian self determination it she canna say that which leads to some questions what exactly is it that she backs well the a the white house for the first time actually came out and condemned el hin oar and rechutitsly yesterday correct than pierce who musthaveben shocked to the message coming down from the top from top bubble here they riled into oar and to leave for their lack of morality here what is the e mate we mar e cars i thin to be me loss cere c the an the a rs we a bis raelhere is a thing and with which which congressional members er er makes cars he ha can her the fire an the not to a firs ain be try caller carers real to i think some of those statements this week gan and we are going a continue to be very clear we believe they're wrong we believe there repugnant and we belie they are disgraceful are er condemnation belong squarely with terrors who have brutally murdered raped kidnapped hundreds hundreds of sales there can be no equivocation about that there are not two sides here there are not two sides ism that done goo good for them for saying that now u maybeyou ought to think about whether those people och men semen members yourcaucas there is a a lot of talk all the time about re publicans expelling certain members f the caucus seems you publishing promote them is the squad and then have them on the cover of magazines with a with nancy close seems that might be a good start and meanwhile it is one's concluded few stories from from israel here because ism getting up dates as i say by the minute from friends in in israel or living there seeing with no dozens people a day from a while variety of perspectives in israel but there is extraordinary unity in the state of israel this just one example one of the people who is murdered at this a electronictans music festival a was a brazilin is r daily woman hen a call went out she was there by herself a call went out fore people to come to her funeral they are trying get ten men because in jewishlaw ten men allows you to pray with u called minor an we certain special prayers her only family in israel was for nominee sister they called for ten men to show up and here is what showed up thousands of people thousands of people showed up the same thing happened there's a lone soldier meaning e a jewfish america who ad gone and en join these rally military and a and who was killed in israel lines miles long formed to get to to the funeral this is a a pretty extraordinary to of bedouin is her mole i give soldiers who are members of the israel army fighting for israel singing in arabia as they approach the front lines they by the way have to our masks and on of the reasons they have to our mass some the other is rally soldiers i is because i if they are identified by by commas and their allies i then they will be treated even worse than usually news would be if they were captured or or a or trapped by by comassmembers because they are seen as traitors for defending the state of israel i got a note that i wont to conclude with here from mam a friend mine in jerusalem her husband is a rabbi in jerusalem she wrote me this did i tell you about the wedding my husband formed on sundae remember the attacks were still on going as of sturdy night sundae evening we travelled up north on relatively empty roads passing many road blocks police cars and army trucks along the way my husband could perform a wedding for a couple who is supposed to get married a few days later the caftan that is the groom called up and he told them who is supposed to have a wedding in two days the commander gave him another day a could not give i more they wants get married before he left for war they called my husband he immediately agreed friends o the family heard the wedding had to be moved ups they kindly open their home to alow the couple to get married on the roof who is a small intimate ceremony just family in close friends superbitter suite very moving there are men who are being called up right now from their families remember the front lines in israel are essentially where people live i mean the there is that there is no distance it is not the united states where people get called up thin to get shipped off to some foreign country in israel when you get called u you are serving a couple miles from where you live you are leaving your family at home knowing full well that they are morevolnorl becauseyou are not home and you they are going to servant and people are are people are coming together in extraordinary ways in the state of israel because that is what social fabric is all about the west needs to come together in that same way america came together that after non eleven for very brief moment in time but america came to a for brief women in time because we are very very secure in the united states thank god america is the most secure bless by god in extraordinary ride of ways including our geography we are boarded on the north by canadians the south by pelicans another exercise by ocean as that tit is an extraordinarily lucky geography plus we an enormous country and were very very lucky but that very luck allows us to be morally foolhardy it allows us not to look evil in the face and to pretend that everybody thinks the way we do because the consequence of that sort of thought rarely arrive at our front door that is not the case with many of our allies and many people living around the world and as the forces of evil gains strength and to ordinate it is incumbent on any person who has any shred of moral decency to at least recognize the the evil that they are staring down and to recognize on broad policy level that negotiation with evil is not a strategy its surrender

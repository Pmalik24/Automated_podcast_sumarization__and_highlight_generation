ones beach where he worked for forty years there are dozens of guys teachers fireman police he saved with it into the sixties life reading at ye ones beech is such a thing the a former life guard ma to film about it it is called ones beech boys royal sister i watch it i did it was also here is my favorite song from it glow the wen diss t ten we we are going for the rescue and getting to the victim it never really appreciated how thrilling life guarding is until boy talked about rescues we were sitting in his law office the exploration of the good rescue is unlike anything you have ever head and you do not get that i sit here and i shell parish i would cold exciting i would cold rewarding but this is you actually accomplishing something your up there all the shun you going out the water and the rest world is beyond is nesting else except between you getting from your stand to that victim that is the only thing and it is it is it is great it is a great fun o apery people i you restating a crater overt tat hows in yet o you have ton number the would times we would have forty reaction an hour what is what what why because you have people that come down to ones beach you really do not know aboutswomen the youespecially when you have a current and you you can get a very strong currents at jonspeech a thousand rescues that is way more rescues than avid hosselhofted on bay watch figure two rescues per episode ten years on the air boy would still beat i by five hundred and sixty rescues which is to say boy is one of the life hardiest life guards there is he had two winds at the national lie guard competition he served as an expert life guard witness in court cases and all was well in his happy life guarding world until the speed mishap gospygan in two thousand seven here is what happened if your life guarded tones be you have to to to physical thinness test every year to prove that you are still able to do the job it includes this see test an a poor you have to swim a hundred yards in a minute twenty which is actually pretty fast et of these guys train all year for it for fifteen years boy took the win test in his preferred win say a pair of hammers they look bike shorts without the but cushion if your watching the olympics right now all the malswimmers a rang em er tight and they go down to just above the a ut when boy show up for the test an two thousand seven he was told no hammers his bosses at the office of parks in recreation said you can only do the test in one of the official ones beach life guard swims sues which means you have three choices word shorts trunks or speed for shorts and trunks are loose nobody rally takes a win test in them because they create more drag and you down an effect state officials were saying to room you have to take the test in a speed boy said no way i will not do it and he has not been a lifeguard ones beech since it was one of those feelings am i making the like decision ism trowing away of forty year career over principal it was a difficult decision a very difficult decision howling did it take you to decide a second holy need to point out he would only ice to where the beet for the test which last a minute in twenty seconds on the job he where word shorts most of the life guards do young candor why not just put it to for the test o why did not to o pot just go to the back at the buss they will plenty of she of course what boy was fighting for is quite different from what rosaparks was fighting for but to boy is the principle of the this standing up to age discrimination when i read about all this in the new york times i really did not understand what is the connection between a sped and age discrimination i certainly seen older dudes and speeds i went out met boy on a beach not far from his house in long island it was six forty five in the morning he was about to go for a mile swim before work boy can you can you describe what you warn ray now well it wet she it she shut sly let she and i migjammis on under beet boy brought one of his official one's speech speeds to the beach to show me just describe it for me it is an i in exaggerated song the let us o theft worked but it is full coverage in the back it is not quite a thong ay on not quite a fine right but to boy lots of guise it might as well be a thong which is why the speed as earn to stable of nicknames the weeny bekeeny the dangling slang the speed do not the benanahammock the grape smuggler the many meet tent the san trope truffle ruffle the scrota that the sees in the jammer is preferred by older life guards is it your saying it is for discreet modest more modest yes than the speed out yes cause it covers your sizes i i i do not want to get corresfit but your the word begins with be is it the sill yo hanging out with the with the speed i get it now i think you will really twit the jammed sit is not that is a little bit more of a roof over your a house yes yes this is the nut of his argument roc says once he passed fifty he felt self conscious in a sprout and nobody should have to feel self conscious to get a job boy refuses to put on the grape smuggler to take the swim test a few weeks later there is another chance to take the test he shows up and this time he is wearing the official speedboat he just got it on over his hammers he showed me a video of a conversation he recorded on the pool that that day his a little windy the sound is a great but he standing in front of so julioni who was the director of ones beech state park at the time and there he is in his stammers plumped outfit challenging her to turn him away i no o a o one o n be o n on no i o a a to a a an an e i o a o a o o a n o o a o oi o o rein lose goes the direct or of water safety for the state beaches cuts in i ant win do not obi an mi e a i i i o we won i wan i we at i no that i ye just go hometown bacienctly oblige state around and i i you know much dive e body take the test an them were there other people taking t testa hammers nohow nobody wish allowed to take the test in gems show everybody else see the upon speed upon the bod shot something that a once was he could have worn word short or trunks and still pass the test he says he could have worked dungarees an past the guys in ridiculous shape he does travel on now such as the swim in twenty twelve he hat a hipperplace and seven weeks later he came in first in his age group and perm to round the sound swim was i one point two mile or wen water swim she was still using a keen to w all the easy thing for boy to do would be just take the test an board shorts are speed and keep the job he loved let bureaucrats be bearcats just get on with it that is not boy boy does not back down from a fight he said he said the new york state office of parks re creation and historic preservation for five million dollars now the easy thing for the state would have been to just let ones beach life guards wear hammers presumably if they are good enough for the olympic swim team they are good enough for new work's life guards but that is not new york state it decided to fight the lost suit has worked its way through the lower court which dismissed it to the pellet court which ruled an may that it should go to trial this has been going on for seven years seven years boy sent me a p my of of his exhibits in the case it was thirteen hundred pages long and the thing i really one to now because i live in new york o pay taxes in new york is why's the state us in tartar dollars to fight the speed of suit just could all have been resolve very easily years ago if they just change the rule allowed the hammers where boy in the state fighting each other when they should unite against the real enemy jelly fish officials from the state of new york would not talk to me for the story the attorney general's office would not talk neither would parson rack but they did send me the affidavit of a guy named gorge german he oversees all the parks along island and it leave out their side of the story around two thousand six some of the ones beach life guards started taking the swim test in full body swim suits management became concerned that those guys were only passing because they were wearing the full body swim suits they decided to change the rules starting in two thousand seven life cards could only take the test in one of the three official ones beach uniform swim suits no more full body suits and also no hammers because hammers are part of the uniform in his deposition gorge german said quote we determined it was best that the life guards wear the uniforms that there are signed to wear while they are on duty seems reasonable boy not of your boy he points out if hammers really our significantly faster would not you want your life guards to wear a faster suit get them out to drowning victim sooner and as it happens new york parks and reck flow's life guards to take their qualifying test in hammers in the rest of the state up state i went up state to take the test and i won my hammers you knot you took the test up state yes and i won my hammers and people wad the damage and i have pictures of that and i that is worded the exhibit oblige taking the test in the jammed up state yes this shame employer new york state department of recreation the shame employer a lase the hammers it your scary about this is that there targeting long island because why because nine deep percent of the older the old the fifty life gods work on long island it is the biggest group of oldie life gods anyway for what its worth the state told me that the rules are different on long island because it is a more strenuous job life guarding on the oceanlwil way up state it is all leaves an pools why do you think it is that they do not want older life guards well i i think they do not the fact that old de life gods you have t influence of at the young gouge and when you are a member of management you do not want anybody having influence of the your employs except you and when you have to deal with the union and you have to deal with the ofttimes of the unions who o all old deluge and they know the beach you do not want that yep there is a lifeguard union boy was the president of the union for years and at that point in two thou s in seven when he refused to where the speed he was the union's chief negotiator when sudualli on he tells him to follow the rules a a she knows him he is the guy the union sends to argue it side and these guys telling him we cannot wear is hammers they are management is this the canal he cloud labor dispute i asked some other older life guards about this and three out of the four of them agreed this is about the union which actually has a history of fighting each discrimination in nineteen sixty six they went on strike because the state trade to impose in age women of thirty five for jonespeech life guards they walked off the beach a week later the state eat knowing this that the suits in the swimsates have a history with each other i hope me understand what boy's fight was really about boy told me one reason he took us stand was the management was supposed to tell the union if they wanted to change rule this and this time they den boys got we cannot now at a private beech club but it is not the same i was working now i really do but you get one rescue a year if he a lucky and then it is o what is called the puddle jump what is a puddle number tell jump for his way you really do not even need to get you head wit and you yet phone speech in the old days we would have these tremendous rescues just these great rescues his friends from ones beach cheese him that he is in exile now how often d you go visit them that often i keep in touch with them constantly but i do not go down there that often to be honest it does hurt it hurts to go down there that was my beach it was my home for many years if boy's theory is true then the state is trying to get rid of the older life guards on long island by forcing them into speeds by that is true as far as i can tell the only life guard they have managed to get rid of is one the to us is one of the produces of our programmed since the first broadcast this story boy is back at jonespeech after twelve years of fighting him over his right not to wore speed of new york state has granted him an exception bass is was is back working as a life guard he is seventy years old mum is to each doctor one ye ism here now hey ale lo lite bay we hi other till but is

californium an go see kayaking they really kind of in the middle nowhere the others little on beech communities and and some little tourist sinners but mostly what we were doing was finding deserted open beeches an camping there was nobody round for most of the time a see just the es you in there a comments at seven there was six or seven and some people might go fishing some people might play

pay community on on a beach pretty close to where we were camping these folks who had done were living in tamperers and had set up little a canteens which are really just sort of stakes with a tarp over them and they would serve bears or in our case they showed us how to clam and the they they made us a clam feast we went back to the guys that it has shown us how to do that to his his camper on the beach and i said there is not a there is not any cairn tractors anywhere near by and which was just a ridiculous question cause there was nothing year by and he she man this really this is where it kind of gets apocraphle but is actually true cause he gets this sort of wistful looking his eye and he says no there is no cairn tractor but there is an amateur ciao tractor who help some of the local people and his name is johnny to keel and he lives on a boat to coves over from where you're staying and if you if you go to this man you he may help you he's very miss a and and you're it well

one tit is the it is got a cabin am but there is a the the mast is up no sailors up and as i get closer and closer i can see around the mast am find up our empty quervol gold to keelabadles but but kind of orderly that is the weird thing usually do not associate empty to keel a bottles with order but these had pin meticulously kind of find up ringing the mast ringing the mast and again ism paddling up on a boat in the mild of nowhere with no one else around and i do not really know how to even start and from some deep place the word that comes to me is ahoy which have certainly never used a informal conversation i say ill hoy and am from out of the cabin comes a completely naked woman am she looks america and am blond hair and deeply it is the tan that goes to your liver it is just and all the way through really a mustily should her shoulders look she was probably a rafting guide in colorado she is completely naked and completely enface about being completely naked just greets me and talks to me as if she were wearing clothes and she is above me just looking up at our being napkin from my canal coming under the side of their boat and am ism in my witness an m is johnny to kill here and she is very nice and because no he went to town for supplies am but ho be back shortly wanting should wait in till he comes back o and then eventually johnny to keel we see him on the beach am near us and he is got a little rowboat and he rows back to us and he looks exactly her he men he is got in shorts but he is got that tan he looks con a muscly and his shoulders and chest and they both have cot a wild bleached out blond hair and we'll scruffy then thirties of a the unmakes are on the under of he now in am and i tell him my story and he is et of course all blah

everybody who is far from the beach for everybody who is avoiding the beach because of correnivirus to everybody who needs the beach we take you there with stories about the beach we have arrived it at four act four now we are five i us of your beach family you go tote beach every year good years bad years whatever happens in your family that year just what you do avid sitar says this story about is family heading to the beach together one year this is first published in the new york a a few years back and hear at our program we all really loved it hers haven in late may of last year a few weeks she ever fiftieth birthday my youngest sister tifphany committed suicide she was living in a room an a beat up you on the hard side if sommerville massachusetts and had been dead the corner guest for at least five days before door was battered down i was given the news over a white courtesy one not the dallies a port then because my plain to bat rose was boring and i was not show what else to do i got on it the following morning i border another plain this one to it manta and the day after that i flew her natural thinking all the while about my ever shrinking family a person expects as parents to die but i silly i felt it'd loss the identity it'd enjoyed since nineteen sixty eight when my brother was born six kids people would say how do your poor folks manage there were lot of big families in the neighborhood i grew up in every other house was a feeftim i never gave it much thought until i became an adult and my friends started having children one or two seemed to reasonable but anything beyond that struck me as outrageous i couple high and i knew enormity would occasionally come to dinner with their wrecking crew of three when they leave several hours later every last hart of me would feel violated take those kids double them and subtract the cable nova that is what my parents had to deal with now though there were not six only five you cannot really say that used to be six and told my sisterlesa it just makes people on comfortable we called a father and san ad met in californium few years back other other children there are the man said three who are living and a daughter whole who died before she was born eighteen years ago that is not fair i remember thinking because i mean what is a person supposed to do with that compared to most forty nine year old or even most forty nine month old tiny did not have much she did leave a will though in it she decreed that we her family could not have her body or attend her memorial service put that in your pipe and smoke it er mother would have said a few days after getting the news my sister my drove to summerville with a friend and collect ted two bock's of things from tiffany's room family photos many of which had been ripped into pieces comment carried from a neighborhood grocery store not books were cedis the bed a mattress on the floor had been taken away and a large an dust rial fan had been set up my snaps and pictures while she was there an individually end in groups those of us left studied them for clues paper played on a dresser that had several drawers missing a phone number would non a wall a collection of mop handles each one a different color a ranged cat tails in a barrel painted green six months before our sister killed herself i had made plans for us all to gather at a beech house on emerald dial off the coast of north caroling my family used to vacation there every summer but after my mother died we stopped going not because we lost interest but because it was she who always made the arrangements and more importantly paid for it the place i found with the help of my sister in lock catchy had six bedrooms in a small swimming pool our week long rented period began on sturdy tune eight and we arrived to find the a livery woman standing in the driveway with seven pounds of seafood a sympathy gift sent by friends trace lawn there too she said handing overall bad in the past when my family rent at a cottage my sisters and i would crowd the door poppies around a food dish our father would unlock it and wed tare through the house claiming rooms i always pick the biggest one facing the ocean just as it'd start unpack my parents would enter and tell me that this was there i mean just who the hell do you think you are my father would ask he had my mother would move in and i would get booted to what was called the maids room who was always on the ground level a kind of dank shed next to where the car was car there was never an interior stairway leading to the upper floor instead i had to take the outside steps and more often than not knock on the locked front door a beggar hoping to be invited in what do you want my sisters ask i want to come inside that is funny less the eldest would say to the others who were gathered disciples around her did you hear something a whining sound what is it that makes an noises that a hermit cram a little sea slug normally there was a social divide between the three oldest and three youngest children on my family less crutches and i treated the others servants and did very well for ourself at the beach though all best were off and it was just upstairs against downstairs meaning everyone against me this time because i was paying i got to choose the best room my moved in next door and my brother pal his wife and the ten year old daughter matte took the spot next to her that was it for ocean front the others arrived later and had to take the left overs leases room faced the street as did my fathers gretchen's faced the street and was intended for someone who was paralyzed hanging from the ceiling were electric bullies designed to lift a harnessed body into and out of bed unlike the cottages of our youth this when did not have a maids room it was too new and fancy for that as were the homes it surrounded it traditionally all the island houses were on stilts but more and more often now the ground floors are filled in they all have beech names an our pain to beech colors the most of those built after her cane ran hit the coast in nineteen ninety six our three stories tall and look almost suburban this place was vast and air kitchen table sat twelve and it was not one but two dishwashers all the pictures were ocean related seascapes and lighthouses all with the carbon vs hat our shorthand for season the sampler on the living room wall red old shelters never die they simply conk out on the round clock beside it the numbers lay in an indecipherable heap as if they had come on glued just above them were printed the words who cares this was what we found ourselves saying whenever anyone ask d the time who here d the day before we arrived at the tees titan's obituary random the rally news and observer it was admitted by wretched who stated that our sister had passed away peacefully at her home this made it sound as if she were very old and had a house but what else could you do people were leaving responses on the papers website and one fellow wrote that tipanyves to come into the video store when he worked in summerville when his glasses broke she offered him a pair she had found while forging for art supplies in somebody is trashcan he said she also gave him a playboy magazine from the nineteen sixties that included a photo spread titled the ass menagerie this was fascinating as we did not really know our sister very well each of us had pulled away from the family at some point in our lives we would had to in order to forge our own identities to go from being a did airs to our own specific sanders tiny though stayed away she might promise to come home for christian but at the last minute that always be some excuse she is her playing she had to work the same would happen with our summer vacations the rest of us managed to make it on aware of how old and guilt trip sounded all of us would be disappointed by her absence though for different reasons even if ye were not getting along with timpani at the time the could not deny the show she put on the dramatic entrances the non stop professional grand insults the chaos she would inevitably leave in her wake one day shed throw a dish at you and the next she would created mosaic made of the shards when allegiances with one brother or sister flamed out she would take up with some one else the no time did she get along with everybody there was always some one she was an contact win toward the end it was less but before that we would all had our turn the last time she joined us on emerald lie was nineteen eighty six and even then she left after three days wretched reminded us it is kids we spent our peacetime swimming then we became teen ages and devoted ourselves to tanning there is a certain kind of talk that takes place when your lying days in the sun and have always been partial to it on he first afternoon if our most recent trip we laid out one of the bedspreads we had his children it'd arranged ourselves side by side on it trading stories about tiffin what about the hollowed she spent on that army base and the time she shot up at dads birthday party with a black eye i remember this girls she met years ago at a party i began when my turn came she ben talking about facial scars and how terrible it would be to have one tiny said i have a little scar on my face and think it awful well the girl said you would if you were pretty my laughed and rolled over on to her stomach oh that is a lit lo i rearranged the towel i was using as a fellow didn't it the coming from someone else the story might have been upsetting but not being pretty who never on tiffany's problem especially when she was in her twenties and thirties and men tumbled helpless before her funny i said but i do not remember a scar on her face i stayed in the sun too long that day and got a burn on my forehead that was basically it for me in the beech blanket i made brief appearances for the rest of the week stopping to dry off after a swim but mainly i spent my days on a bike sibling up and down the coast and thinking about what it happy went where the rest of a scene to get along effortlessly wit tiffin it always felt that work she and i usually made up after arguing but our last fight took it out of me not the time of her death we had not spoken in eight years during that period i regularly found myself near sumerville ad though it'd always toy with the idea of contacting her i never did despite my father's encouragement meanwhile it'd get we ports from him in lees tiffin had lost her a apartment had gone on disability had moved into a room found for her by a social service agency perhaps she was more forth coming with her friends but her family got things only in bits in pieces she did not talk with us much as at us great blocks of speech that were in turns funny a state and contradictory it was hard to connect the sentence you were hearing to the one that preceded it before we stopped speaking i can always tell when she was on the phone it'd walking to the house an hear high say in addition to the two boxes that my had filled in sumerville she also brought down our sisters nineteen seventy eight ninth great year book among the messages and cried by her classmates was a following written by some one who had drawn a marijuana leaf beside her name tiffin you are one of a kind girl stay that way you unique ass ism only sorry we could not a partied more together this school sucks to hell stay cool stoned drunk top check your ass later then there is tiffin ism looking for to get in high with you the summer and tiffin call me sometime this summer and we will go out get bits a she weeks after these messages were written tiffin ran away and was subsequently sent to was disciplinary institution in main called a lawn according to what she told us later was a horrible place she we turned home and nineteen eighty having spent two years there and from that point on none of us can recall a conversation in which she did not mention it she blamed the family for sending her off but we her siblings had nothing to do with it pal for instance pal was ten when she left i was twenty one for a year i sent her monthly letters then she wrote and told me to stop as for my parents there ere only many times i could apologize we had other kids they said in their defense you think we could let the world stop on account of any one of you t the we were at the beach for three days before less and our father who was now ninety joined us being on the island met missing the spinning classes he takes and rarely i found a fitness that er not far from the rental cottage and every afternoon he and i would spend some time there on her way over we talked to each other but as soon as we mounted our stationary bikes we would each retreat into our own thoughts it was a small place not very lively a mute tell a vision oversaw the room tune to the weather channel and reminding us that there is always a catastrophe somewhere or other always some one flooded from his home or running for his life from a funnel shaped cloud toward the end of the week i came upon my father and army's room sifting through the photos at tiffin had destroyed in his hand was the fragment of my mother's head with a patch of blue sky behind her under what circumstances had this spleen ripped up i wondered it seemed such a melodramatic gesture throwing a glass against a wall something someone in a move would do just awful my father whispered a person's life reduced to one lousy box i put my hand on his shoulder actually there are two of them he corrected himself two lousy boxes one afternoon on emerald die we all rod to the food lion for groceries i was in the produce department looking at red onions when my brother sneezed up from behind and let use with a loud i who this while whipping a bouquet of wet party for the ear i felt the spray on the back of my neck and froze thinking a very sick stranger had u needed on it it is any trick but he also dowsed india woman who was standing to my net she was wearing a blood colored sorry got it on her bare arm as well as her neck in the lower part of her back so man pal said when she turned around or a got i just blind joked on my brother the woman had many thin bracelets on and the jangled as she brushed her hand against the back of her head you called her mayhem i said to him after she woke for weal her my mimicdim perfectly for weal over the phone my brother me as often mistaken for a woman as we continued chopping he told us that his van had recently broken on and that when he called for a to rock the dispatcher said well we brought out speedy he lowered a water merlin to the card and turned to his daughter nanny's got a dandy do not the lady u she do not care the she giggling she bunched him in his stomach and i was struck by how comfortable the two of the a with each other our father was he figure of authority our fathers more a claiming and we went to the beeches children on er about the fourth day our father would say would not it be mice to buy a cottage down here we would get our hopes up and then he would bring practical concerns into it there were not petty buying a house that will eventually get blown away by a hurricane probably is not the best way to spend your money but still we wanted one desperately i told myself when i was young that one day i would buy a beach house and then it would be every ones as long as i followed my draconian rules and never stop thanking me for it thus it was n wednesday morning midway through a vacation he and i contact a real estate agent named pills who took us around to look at available properties i fridge afternoon we made an offer on an ocean front cottage not far from the one we were renting before sunset our bid was excepted i made the announcement at the dinner table and got the reaction i had expected now wet a minute my father said you need to think clearly here already have i told him okay then how old is the roof how many times is it been we place on the passed years when can we move in bechonased leas to ban to now if she could bring her dogs and my asked what the house was named right now it is called fantastic place i told her but were going a change i used to think the ideal name for a beech house was the ship shape now though i had a better idea we are going to call it the sea section my father put down his chamber girl now you are not but it is perfect i argued the names suppose to be beech and if it is a on all the better i brought up a cottage we would seen earlier in the day called dune or than anomy father winced what about naming it tiffin he said our silent's translated to was pretend we did not hear that he picked his hamburger back up i think it is a great idea the perfect way to pay our respects but that is the case we could name in after mom i told him or half after mom and half after given but it is a house not a limestone and it would not fitting with he names to the other house is all ball loan my father said fitting and that is not who we are that is not what we are about pal into rust id to nominate the cocksucker army's suggestion had the word seeming in it and gretchans was even dirtier bat's wrong with the name it already hassles i asked no no no my father said forgetting i think this was not his decision a few days later after the buyer's remorse to kidding it'd wonder if i had not bought the house is a way of saying seen it is just that easy no hemming and hauling no asking to look at the septictank rather you make your family happy and iron out the details later the cottage we bought is two stories tall and was built in nineteen seventy eight it is on proper stilts and has two rear decks one above the other overlooking the motion it was rent to vacationers until late september but chilis allowed us to drop by and show it o the family the following morning after we checked out of the house we would been standing a place always looks different worse most often after you have made the commitment to buy it all the others raced up and down the stairs claiming their future bedroom i held my nose to event and caught a whiff of mild the sail included the furniture i also made an infantry of the barkaloungers and massive t yes i would eventually be getting rid of along with the shell pattern bedspreads and cushions with archers on them for our beech house i want to have a train theme i announced trains on the curtains trains on the tows we are going to go all out oh or rather my father moans wo we sketch to plan to return for thanksgiving and after saying good by to one another my family splintered into groups and had it off to our respective homes there would been a breeze at the beech house but once we left the island the air grew still as the heat intensified to the general feeling of depression throughout the sixties and seventies the road back to rarely took is passsmithfield and a bill board on the outskirts of town that red welcome to clan country this time we took a different rout won my brother recommend it high drove and my father sat beside him i stepped down in the back seat next to my and every time i raised my head it'd see the same sway bean field or low slung singer block building we seemingly pass twenty minutes earlier we been on the road for a little more than an hour when we stopped at a farmers market inside and open air pavilion a woman offered complimentary plates of homes served with the corn and black bean said we each accept end one and took seats on a bench twenty years earlier the most h place this might have offered was fried okra now there was organic coffee and our seasonal goat cheese above our heads hung a side that red whispering dog ranch it just as i thought that we might be anywhere i noticed that the music quite ton the speakers was christian the new coming which says that jess is also high brought my father a plastic cop of water yoocala my my father answered why do you think she did it i asked as we stepped back into the sunlight for that is all any of us were thinking had been thinking since we got the news wasn't tiny of hope that would ever pills she taken would not be strong enough and that her failed attempt would lead her back into our fold how could anyone purposely leave us us of all people this is how i thought of it for though have often lost faith in myself have never lost faith in my family in my certainty that we are fundamentally better than everyone else it is an arctic belief one i have not seriously we considered since my late teens but still i hold it ours is the only club it'd ever wanted to be a member of i could not imagine quitting backing off for a year or two was understandable but to want out badly that you would take your own life i do not know that it had anything to do with us my father said but how could it have nought does not the blood of every suicide splashed back on our faces at the far end of the parking rot was a standselling wreptoels in giant tanks wit two pythons each is big around as a firehouse the heat seemed to suit them and i watched as they raised their heads testing the screen ceilings beside the snake was a low pen crawling an alligator with its mouth bandage shut it was not full grown but perhaps an adolescent around three feet long and grumpy looking a girl had sucker on through the wire and we stroking wit things back while it glared seething it'd to buy everything here just i could kill it i said my father mopped his forehead with cleanings ism with yet brother when we were long and wed set off for the beach i look out the window at all the landmarks we drove by the purine slow on the outside of rarely but clan bill board knowing that when we passed this we later it'd be miserable our vacation over now there would be nothing to live for until christian my life is much fuller than it was backhand yet this return felt no different what time is it i asked my in instead of saying who care she said you tell me here the mom with ta watch on at the air port a few hours later i pick sand from my pockets thought of our final moments at the beach house i bought i was on the front porch with pills who would just locked the door an we turned to see the others in the drawn years is that one of your sisters she ask pointing you region it is i said and are the two women standing on either side of her then you have got

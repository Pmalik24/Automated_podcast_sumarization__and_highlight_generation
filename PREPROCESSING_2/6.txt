on sundae and active duty are force member set himself on fire in front of the is daily embassy in washington d c to protest the war in gaze and this of course has unlocked all of the worst words of the internal who have decided that apparently this member of the a force was a disturbed anarchist was some sort of hero and that has some really bad implications for politics and for morality and for virtue let us start with the simple facts in this particular case the person's name was ran bushwa are fusional was twenty five years old and he was in fact a disturbed anarchist how do we know that he was an anarchist well because he said first of all this should raise some serious questions about how we actually screened for the america military in the simple fact of the matter is s that the standards for the america military hade been dropping pretty radically this crus in it specialist and he been i the military for several years and he was in fact an active anarchist now that the military has been targeting called white so primacy in the military if you are conservative in the military your open about it that may call into question you are loyalty to the us military apparently you can be a radical anarchist publicly and that has no implications whatsoever for your military service apparently yo can also be a disturbed person bags it turns out ye have to be kind of disturbed who set yourself literally on fire in front of these daily embassy to protesting non existing genocide which is what this person did according to the washington post quote less than two weeks before grand bushel walk toward the gates of these really embassy on sundae he in a friend talk by phone about their shared identities as anarchist and what kinds of risks and sacrifices were needed to be effective bush mention nothing violent or self sacrificial then on sundae pushball tested that friend who describe the exchange on the condition of anonymity to protect his safety quote i hope you will understand i love you this does not even make sente but i feel ism going to miss you and the he sent a friend a copy of his will on sundae in which he gave his cap to his neighbor and a prideful of rule bears to his friend and then twelve minutes later he down himself with liquid and set himself on erewhile shouting free palestine he died seven hours later at a hospital now what is amazing about all of this and we we know his passed we know that he was raised apparently on a cult religious compound we we know that he fell all of that cult apparently and then he immediately went into the military and started associating with radical groups radical anarchist groups according again to the washington post be pay not bozo thirty two ranch he meat bushel and san anionic in twenty twenty two ad an even for a socialist organization she said the bonded over their politics and started working together to deliver clothing and food to people experiencing homelessness he was outrage he knew no one who as in charges listening to the protestors out the every week balboa said he knows that he has a privilege as a white man and a member of the military and in fact in the public statements that he released to the media before committing suicide by burning himself to death this person included for example his pronouns in his suicide note the final post of grand bushel said quit many of us to ask ourselves what would i do if i was alive during slavery or the gimcrosouth or a partied what would i do of my country was committing j suicide the answer is your doing it right now big anarchist symbol as this person is a a far leftist when not just a far left us but a disturbed far left is because there lots people are far left to do not set themselves on fire actually and when he says in his suicide nothing is final note that he was cone can complicit in genocide the question would be exactly how considering the united states air force is not even involved in the war in the gossip strip not only that there is not a genocide in the gossips trip i know that he is become common place for morons in the media to suggest that a targeted operation by thesraelies in the gossip strip that has killed according to the relies upwards of ten thousand members of commons ware hiding among civilians the that is somehow in example of a genocide but i can assure you that is definitional wrong israel has complete air superiority for the one thousandth time in the gossip strip if israel wish to kill hundreds of thousands of people israel certainly has the air power to do israel has not done that in fact i know multiple members of the military who been injured in ihram going dor to dor in order to prevent civilian casualties in highly populated areas in which derris are extremely popular bushel sent a note too one of these ante violent extremest propagandicides called crime think and that note sad quote to day i am planning to engage inn extreme act of protest against the genocide of the palistonian people the below links should take you to a live stream and recording recorded footage of that even which will be highly disturbing i asked the you make sure the footage is preserved and reported on and apparently that group then said that they consulted his twitch account the user name displayed was lily and kiddy which again sounds that totally aspirational person the sure i con was the circle a which of course is the anarchist movement and in the video errand begins by introducing himself when my name is there in bushel ism an active duty member of you as airborne i will no longer be complicit an genocide about to engage in an extreme active protest but compared to what people had been experiencing in palestine at the hands of their colonizers it is not extreme at all while to actually turns out that setting yourself on fire in themiddle of the united states is pretty extreme says this is what our ruling class has decided will be normal while know again that is a lie and then he says if your heart is broke by the hours in gossip and you're prepared to bear significant consequences to try to stop them we urge you to do everything in you power to find comrades o make plans collectively lay the foundations for full life of resistance to colonialism in all forms of oppression that is what the the group says and then they acknowledge that the person sent he him in his byline on all of this the left has decided that this person is not a disturbed anarchist this person is actually a hero many people on left have decided that he is in fact hero for for foolishly and tragically telling himself in the most terrific possible lay predicated on a complete lie that actually helps a genital terrorist group as it turns out the left has decided that this is an act of true heroism and and this is major names who are doing this sort of stuff for example jill time put out a tweet saying rest in power errand bushel may his sacrifice deep in our commitment to stop genocide now just personally you should not celebrate disturb people burning themselves alive on the street in order to protest a non existent genocide you should not do that that is a terrible thing to do coral lest doing the same thing by the way i notice that if they think this o the highest from of virtue they are to setting themselves on fire they're getting disturb people to set themselves on fire apparently coral let tweeted out let us never forget the extraordinary courage and commitments a brother array bushel who died for truth and justice by pray for his precious loved ones let us rededicate ourselves to genuine solidarity with palistinians undergoing genital attacks in real time and then burned sanders put out a statement of course burned sanders of course who who likes to sit his his birth as a jo as some sort of excuse for his idiocy but he he put out a statement suggesting solidarity he said it is obviously a terrible tragedy but i think it speaks to the depths of despair that many people are feeling now about the terrific humanitarian is aster taking place in gas eye share those deep concerns the united states has got to stand e u u u o baba a they are a couple of things that that all this reveals they the first thing that all this reveals is that there is in fact a tendency among radicals in politics to suggest that the real problem with radical and terrible action burning yourself alive is a radical and terrible act i is a bad thing to do just on a raw level disturb people burning themselves alive terrible thing to do but there is a suggestion than this extends to all sorts of crime against your self and others because i do not think that you actually have a right to kill yourself the the basic idea is that radical acts suddenly become good if you agree with the motivation that really is just over zealousness thong people root and they burn things that is truly an overzealous commitment to the cause and that is the language that yore hearing here hell ran bushel may have been over zealous but he was speaking on behalf of a good cause that of course suggests the what they are doing is actually quite virtuous because they are overzelse they are passionate about it that they have to do this terrible thing which of course incentivize is peoplewho are disturbed to do terrible things that is not a good thing tat is a very bad thing in any coherent and cohere of society you do not want to incentivize people to take terrible acts or praise people for participating in terrible acts because they were just set thy were very he was too good h as too use too over zealous too too virtuous guess that is number one number too victimizing yourself is not insurance against being called foolish it is foolish to burn yourself alive on behalf of a cause that is terrible that is a foolish and bad thing to do it is they are too problems here one is the burnt teethe actedself which is inherently terrible horrible for his family horrible for his friends have the horrible for him that is awful and tragic and then the celebration of people who are mentally ill doing this sort of stuff disturb doing the sort of stuffier beyond big that sympathy that is compassion how explain but that is that is om outnumber too there is the tendency among people who are defenders of what happened here to suggest that if you point out that grin bushel happened to be wrong on the merits that this is somehow being disrespectful to to ran bushel are not not acknowledging the tragedy of his death self victimization is a treachery no question it is also a tragedy as the name might suggest that is directed against yourself it is terrible and it is bad and it does not relieve you of the moral culpability for engaging in a bad act on behalf of a terrible cause and let us be clear right now when it comes to the gas strip israel is engaged in an attempt to extirpate in actual honest to god horrific terror group that committed the worst terrorist atrocity since world war too effectively speaking if you are talking about percenteng to the population in certainly since nine eleven in the west the attempt to extirpate that group in a highly populous area with heavy levels of civilian sympathy for the cause of the terrorists means that israel is putting people in harm's way on a regular basis going street to street and house to house the fact that many people on the left our committed to the belief obviously this sort of fries phantom belief that any sort of violent radical action is justified in pursuit of quote decolonialization and that therefore any response to that is an act of genocide me evil that is a lie and it is wrong and somebody doing something terrible to himself based on that we does not mean that the lie is not the lie it is still a lie and it is still in act of foolishness the tragedy of ran bushel does not obscure the fact that he happened to be wrong on the merits andtht sort of defense mechanism that you see out the o magic that o what how could you say that no he was he was wrong and the fact that he was wrong means that we should not in fact glorify his actions for why variety of reasons which shouldn't glorify the cause that he was speaking on behalf of cause it happens to be morally in imbecilic and then you also should not glorify the act itself because the act itself is a bad act burning yourself alive is a bad thing too the fact that our society fails to see this is is amazing it also speaks to a a society that is deeply in need of some god because as we see the this sort of attempt to create heroism out of foolishness is amazing vulture has a piece today about a personated victor cowards who apparently is a playwright and ism on remember want first instead of taking the daily dose of the hive medications evade you nor this is going as soon as you say their dildos north's is going the playwright victor was a is films an instrogram that yo of the pill's funeral they burned the small white tablet on a miniature air instead a geode their grand parents had brought from slap achy a mountain in gorilla mexico across the

is a more tend the themesong their favorite tellonovella growing up played as the sound track they are planning to do a final city in which their last for pills get kidnap by pilgrim baby and turned to dust it has been almost three months since hazards last took their mess a strike the say will continue until the nor theatre worship workshop calls for a cease fire in gap is the sort of per formed of idiocy that we now s on parts to the radical left that if this i get's non brine are h i v positive person don't take his hive pills until the local theatre group condemns what is going on in gaze somehow this is going to make the world they better place foolishness remains foolish no matter how dedicated you are to the foolishness the fact that this stuff is being given widespread media credibility speaks to why many people engage in t by the way mean why not your doing it for the attention you are doing it for the credit you are doing it because you have engage in this far left judo sacrifice if you are talking about hazards in case of bushel you was sacrificing something it just happens to be a sacrifice on behalf of a terrible cause and i and a sacrifice that actually is in act of wrong it is a wrong to burn herself alive again a what why this has to be see over and over is beyond me but that is what we are a civilization yes it is wrong to burn yourself alive to promote a lie that is a wrong thing to do it is tragic and also wrong but an order to understand all this what you really have to understand is the intensive structure that has now been created and that is that the media will cover you the way you want to be covered if you happen have the right political precepts if you are on the far left the media will cover you as though you are a hero if you are silly rabbit an america military veteran who gets shot to death in the capital building well protesting slash rioting over the election then the media will treat you as though totally deserved to get shop you what you in fact our fool you are fool and it is your fault that you got shop and you are engage in a violent act and your stupid and you deserved it that is according to the media if you are rashly rabbit if you are errand bushel you are you are icon of military service who is a matter too correct causes because again that is the media narrative and the media narrative rules above all and should understand that right now the media is not rule by people horror main stream main line democrat liberals from forty years ago those people all got asked an destroyed the legacy media that size the narrative in cases this that legacy media is dedicated to absolute radicalism he's an amazing piece by a person in time rubenstine who worked at the new york times over at the aplanatic and he talks about how he was hired to work at the oped page and then he was basically destroyed for it the beginning of his story tells you what you need to know about the political culture that has been created in our media and our media of course then create the intensive structure for people in the public here is what he says in the aslant duo on one of my first days at the you are t ones i went to an orientation with more than a dozen other new his we had to do an ice breaker pick a star burst out of a warn then answer a question my stardust was pink i believe an i had to answer the pink prompt which had me responds my favorite sandwich rob and daughters super heater came to mine but i figured mentioning a nineteen dollar sand which was not a great way town new friends i bloated out the spicy chicken sandwich from chick flag and considered the ice broken the h i representative leading the orientation chided me we do not do that here they hate gat people people started snapping their fingers in acclamation i had not been thinking about the fact that chick filly was transgressive and liberal circles for it is chairman's opposition to a marriage not the politics the chicken i quickly said but it was too late i sat down ashamed and that is the environment in news rooms all across america first of all it there is many layers to this particular idiocy onion hand's an onion of ticket you remove on lay this another water starlit the fact that chick flat is a chicken sandwich company and that the founders perspectives have no bearing on whether chick fillet wool for example sure gay people who walk and shit flay spoiler alert they will never mind the fact that saying that you a sandwich from a company with whose founder you disagree says nothing about your feelings about the founder of that company i lots of products from companies where i wildly disagree with the founder i is nan apple computer does that mean i agree with steeve jobs politically tats ridiculous and then ad on to that the fact that everybody in the newsroom starts with the silly snappy fingers thing pa that is a college me can no one in the real world even knows what the hell your doing if you are in a room anywhere in america and people started snapping their fingers in approval an acclamation no one one know what you were doing unless they were all gender studies majors a around but that is your taffy armenia and because they staff armenia they create the narrative and because they create the narrative they create the inventor structures see wonder why people are getting more radical you wonder why people are suddenly finding it interesting to treat as a martyr disturb people burning themselves alive for far left causes say comose that would be the reason because than sense of structure has been promoted by the biggest institutions in our society now meanwhile speaking of the conflict in the gossip strip the bine administration as always wants to have it both ways the biggest prove t bin administrationmen comes to form policy is always and for ever jobidon cannot make up his mind mobile's pathologically incapable of taking clear positions on any issue anywhere this is true from new crane or he as not made clear exactly what his engulf is or whetheri'sgin a slow walk the aid or a in ovate i once to give he is not made clear what the war is for says its four democracy but that sort of will son and language is almost always empty it's explain in real politic terms why exactly it is in americasentra interest to be involved by the way i think there very strong real politic reasons that have articulated on the so repeatedly why america ought to be finding you crane to prevent to take over of reeve by the ruffians but bison is never articulated those reasons he does not find it necessary when it comes to israel tidings doing the same things trying t split the baby and the reason he is trying to split the baby is because he understands that overwhelmingly the america public does not compass and is pro israel and on the other and he has a radical wing particularly the young people in his party the snappy fingers crowd or very into people burning themselves alive in front of the israel embassy an washington do see and jobidon is trying to split the baby here by trying to get to an offal that does not exist that a from is some set of negotiated settlement with commas israel of course has no interest in a negotiated settlement with compass what bison is trying to do is he is trying to cram down some form of seas fire that he hopes will turn into a permanent sees fire between israel encompass and the don't but end the war whole muskomass is wiling to surrender and go into exile for example that is not going to happen what is even more making is that jobiton reveals the internals of the actual foreign policy negotiations while eating ice cream with southers you won right join is unpopular this would be one of the reasons he is an incompetent boob who spills the internal negotiations of complex foreign policy decisions involving literal human hostages including america citizens sitting in captivity well eating ice remount south mires who does that that is insane n encroaching senility it is encroach the little's much here he was hanging out with a very old looking south mires here i eating ice cream men talking about the goa war that he is not out o touch at all folks i el i ho y the van to we o panels my mi are i tell me there we corse r come not on my hope we i the for is is far a first rule of negotiations shut the fog up in seriously that is the first rule of negotiations be quiet why are you broadcasting out loud the conversation especially when it is not true now again he wants to play to both ways because on the one hand he wants to show that he is support of israek's the america public is support of of israel and is by the we the majority the democratic party and he also wants to so that he heres the concerns of his wild left wing basin what he is attempting to do is also miscast s the two wish casts that jobidon does when it comes to the mitdaeleast whish cast number one is to suggest that the war on israel part is somehow the reflection of the don't quit extreme governments that is a lie they have a war time a cabinets says he goes on southers and he says well i do not now israel might be losing the credibility the moral icitimis because o an extreme on o heros that south air's trying blame israel government for the ongoing war and saying that it is extreme it is a war t me government benny grunts is not a right winger benny grunts is in the war cabinets is he unity government i said this a thousand times yet to be either ignorance about the workings of his daily government or deliberately lying in order to come to the conclusion that it's your ben gave who is the interior minister was very little aport in its real right now that he is for bingo ere is in charge of the levers of power in this war not true but he do it say that anyway because again he is trying to establish moral equivalenttine israel ins enemies and in the mean time their twomininisent people that are being killed and an israel so down attacks on sofa they have to and that math comment to father ana we to that there o vileevacuate significant portions of sofa before they got take out the reminder mass but but it is a process and look israel has had the overcome i support of of astmajoritanations if it keeps usurp without this incredibly conservative government they have and bengavier another motive non every major for policy leader an israel since coom a her there going to lose support from around the world and that is not an israel interest i get again the attempt to blame israel worst strategy and it is your bengavier is totally crazy is real is currently governed by a war cabinet bengavier is not a member of the war cabinet the war cabinet is beeping is ting now o the elected prime minister of israel roof gowan the minister of defense and benisons the leader of the opposition there are two other observers one is gotta risen cot whose a member of benningonses party and whose son was killed in gas already and on dormer whose a long time form policy expert who works with baby he just lying a minus its it is a who but against there two lies they're being told by number one is that the war is a reflection in israel of a right winged view that is not true there is widespread support in israel for extracting compass because no one in israel is going to live underground two weeks a year awaiting the next burst through the border in which twelve hundred is rally citizens are murdered in two hundred forty are taken captive i in the gosestrip a li number two that that baton has been promoting is the lie that the palistonian people are are are completely non support of a camass and that therefore all is real has to do is grant some sort of legitimacy to a palistonian government in magically peaceful bloom that is a lie it is a total and complete we not only is there notated to support it the all the data is the other way seventy five to eighty per cent to palistonians in west bank support compass and in excess of that support the october seventh terrace attacks in the gosistrup a majority still support compass despite the fact that they have been boy out of the places that they live because of commas is activity an comas instilling their humanitarian aid commas is still the most popular party more than the palistonian authority what baton is trying to do now is wish cast into existence in end to this conflict and he single were really really close well are they because according to the frailly officials who involved in the negotiations there saying that there is not necessarily a cause foroptimism apparently the delegation says there a telephone calls all the time but compass has been rejecting pretty much every proposal put on the table because every proposal says youguise see to surrender and leave again there is a pop ability of a sense fire butt even if israel were to sign off on a sense fire israel is not going to leave compass in place what exactly is bidet's plan bidet's plan is to li and that that is the plan for large parts the west is to my about the nature of the new palistinian governments wat they are going to say it is amazing that they can can get away with thus or that israelwill go along with it normal my government the goes along with us left right or center is going to be the government for very long over the cops of the last couple of days the government of the palistinian authority resigned nomachmudbas the actual dictator but the rest the palistonin authority government there fate legislature in such i say fake because they have not had an e lection since to than sect in any case the palisinia authority government resigned and the alstrgernal called this in early step toward the over hauls the san midileastern papers as a condition for the body to take charge of gaze after the worse again this has been a stick the bid as been pushing is the idea that post war the palistinian authority will govern gaze there's only one problem the palsinian authority is unpopular and has no power and has no ability to govern gaze what exactly will that mean well it turns out that the lastergernal let us the cat out of the bag what exactly is happening here it turns out that what is actually happening here is that the palistinian authority government resigned as to make way for a new palistinian authority government what exactly would that new government look well apparently abacas told arabanuus officials he is working on forming a new government with mahatma wasstapa former palistinian economy minister and world bank executive as the likely candidate form prime minister but what would happen in reality compass would simply quoin quit dis band and form the new governments all the top members of compass would simply call themselves not comas any more and then just enter the government quote one plan for postwar gaze being formulated by five arab states could see the is lamas come movement being folded in too the widely secular niello ending the years long split build tween palistnian factions apparently compass said that it is political leader is malhonea met with the cater amen gamma been hamal afghani in down money to discuss roots to end the war in gaze and the organization of palistinian affairs senor members of path the ruling party of the palistinian authority are still seeking re conciliation with karma another words jobiden's plan for israel to quoin quit to feat comas involves comas becoming the new government matches of the gasastrip but also of the west bank outhit israel can go along with that that have to be out of their mind is to go along with that not only that apparently as really officials believe the they are very close to finding killing yahyasinoir who is the leader of compass who's still hiding in these tunnels beneath gaze there is still trying to to find him but apparently they are closing in on him and should israel stop that is can be a problem for them one of the most astonishing things about the current discussions with regard to the sense fire is that the america and the grabs are suggesting that what has to happen here as the sense fire before roman because after all israel has to have respect for the salami holiday o roman the month long roman holiday because wish holidays have routinely been respected by his on i terrogroups for example som cot torah which is the exact eight of the october seven massacre or say jump minor which was the want of the yum killer war astonishing how religious respect only supposed to the only apparently applies one way p and all of this confusion from cordon these mixed signals that israel should be able to defend itself but also can we have come of sip part of the new government and also that really be means o the civilians and also all of that sort of confusion is just one reason why jobidon remains deeply unpopular as precedent no one knows what the he any that this guy stands for except that they do not it and all attempts to rehabilitate him our failing will get to that in just one

this means that all attempts to rehab him on the basis of personality are very likely to fail he does not have the charisma of say a hero mama that's in painful display on south dyers last night south dyers is doing his best to try to midsize jordan back into some form of life behavior and he is failing dramatically last night for example mess had him doing the dark brands and mean by wearing sun glasses ism sorry an old man eating ice crewman wearing son glasses just looks we can at burner's you legit wit with the sunglasses he now looks e non animated corpse being wheeled around on comedy shows it is it is pretty incredible hero i the very it just faxes to the air we liven now there is the dark brand and conspiracy me and this that something you seem that have lot of only love color we have collected dark brand an this is a a yard sin and o do you enjoy plater with the dark free in a me no resent the hello nooilof that that he cannot even do the joke right has put on the glasses twice hes is nor his eyeballs are any more i prison tot of it o is mid wit this on glasses o come come back around oh and then he lost the grand god the middle of the interview which of course is pure job an that dude is no longer with us and but i think everything everything wee got done es just friendly state he wants to do way w to select an i really think his view son we are to think a maria are older than anywhere i to and the crowd lasts because the trying to bail him out and gowns it any of that english well man i can place some that was it english there is another clip of join yesterday in which he lapses into some sort of are historic earl language not legitimately no clue what he is attempting to say here but he is bucking all conventions of traditional language i guess that he perhaps there are aliens who one day in the future will show up and realize what he saying but they they do not live among us now o stand er cool this porter the man behind mere ye he said an wen we are i get the cortexactry right he said w the better after we said we must address counsel an just the better es of our nature we down we do well to remember wheels he say we not inky but retrains we middle in the port of the civil war es a were not any ran we must not be enemies folks i o i no o look tat e an on we the i me is i sud we got palter is got throw bitter ah h a well i think that things may be becoming to a crashing hall for join i do not mean that he is not con be president to morrow in we all pray for the health of the presidents of the united states because he still the presidents of the united states an we wants anything bad to happen to him i will say that the knives are out for him on his own side of the isle jolt abrasion is a former executive ever of the hearties and i story the really is not very important but is kind of she is now basically suggesting that jobidonis to blame for the behavior of of his dogs there's at an entire piece at the washington posttitle do not blame biding dogs for the blood on the white house floor and entire piece about how the bids are responsible for the fact that they have a bunch of dogs that bi people the reason that this is important is only because if you have any sense of of political history a few election cycles to go twenty twelve the democrats made the claim the it army was a very bad man because he had put a dog crate on top of his car when he was traveling an hots mean to his dogs and this became one of the means of the campaign was the it army was a bad evil mean man and that is the theme is that is a chariot this is a character floor in it away the it army the most milk those human being ever to walk the earth dull is ditch water it it army that that i was somehow a cruelty to animals torturing puppies in his back yard my we wen democrats start saying that sorts about jobidon that is an indicator they do not actually him as a person that is a bag problem for jobidon stanch has this entire this entire piece in which he says the relatively spotless record of pats in the white house was stained last wee by shocking details in for r than four hundred pages of your secrete service documents detailing a spate of violent attacks one of which left enough blood on the floor a white house tour had to be interrupted well is cleaned off who is responsible for the savagery commander the german heard owned by president bison and is family the dog was responsible for at least two dozen separate biting attacks on secrete service agents over the course of your ending last october when commander was finally exiled from the white house and she goes through all of the details and she talks about how terrible the dogs were behaving and she says ism a credential dog lover and first approach these documents with empathy's for the bisons in deep sympathy for the bitten agent however she says i cannot really keep up that empathy she says as i waited through the gory details of all these biting in since my empathy for the bison's fated put plainly these documents are a herring narrative the petownership in a high place is run dangerously a muck at some point the trouble is not the animals it is the owners pagan you might think that that's a silly example i frankly think it might be a silly example but i will say that when you struts have the left turn on you as a manner of character your bad to your dogs that speaks to the lack of enthusiasm for jobidon if jobidon has a mas of enthusiasm gap the selections hostile called locked bike twenty sixteen and that is exactly what you are seeing right now by the way according to tebrannuw hazard hers cap's pull donate trumps approval rating is now in positive territory jobidons approval rang is now under water by eleven points these pull numbers are disastrous for jobidon according to the hazard hers pole fifty eight per cent of america say that the economy is weak only forty two per cents a strong seventy and ten voters say the use will be in a recession now or is already in era hessian bison's approval is under water in a major major way his approval rating right now is stuck at forty five per cents his perception of handling on key issues is under water that is particularly true with regard to immigration or he has a thirty five per cent approval rating on the israel commossmatteries of thirty eight per cent approval rating seven and ten voters say that inflation is here to say a majority of voters now say that they approve of the job that trump did as president not just a majority a large majority in fact thirty seven per cent of america according t this play they strongly approve of the job trumped is president and twenty per cent somewhat approve that is fifty seven per cent of america who believe that including by the way forty per cent of black america fifty seven per cents of his tannic america fifty seven per cent of suburban america these are red flashing warning signs to the bison administration and to the biding campaign s a full scaled disasterarea among the depot donate trump currently has a net favorable rating of three per cent in this poll as i say jobidnis eleven points under water on the issues jobidin is failing dramatically he is barely beating trump among young voters according to a new actions generation a survey voters between eighteen and thirty for began has fifty to per cent compared to forty eight percent for trump if it is a close election with our young voters biding his toast not just that the latest polls honey legal i migration so that over all sixty one per cent of america believe in legal emigration is very serious problem and a majority of america now believes important to finish the trump wall jordan has a massive problem on his hands which presumably is again they think that there can be able to fix this problem not by changing their policy but by putting obsidian in different places that is not going to work this has been a a myth that democrats of propagated since brokoboma was president that it was not a failure of policy that made them in popular he is a failure of communication if only we did but atom he says all the time he's to say it is not that obomicaric it self as a policy is in popular we we have not communicated it right we it got talk better that you butter drop talking but first of all why not true but second of all even assume that is true the person who asked to do a better chop talking is hoiden that's the guy you are counting on to turn this ship around with his absolutely virtuosic command of rhetoric and the english language good luck to you but that is gonging o try correct jump here sis the join is now heading down to the southern word to try to slim republicans for the situation which is weird because he is constantly saying now that his going a sign executive orders to shore up the border which is it that is then issue that the america eel e townee er e pe cere about a h i the e e ta e eyes ta go on he the i hes going the go o the words t is to the o i ta sword e ta e e o o and hes going the her tenrec e we for e one es t the e chisel o i e i ta e t i n the

seriously he is going to goes directly to in to the prosit tactics s she exactly wits going on her directly to the border pertroiens whoso are doing no wore e et in the best way that the a wit he we i as that thy popery or absolutely amazing absolute sis she says he is going to take action and they what action he is going to the border that is not an action by that is a function i five the boarder i went there who wo ho that truly five the problem not the way that actually executive action works again this issue is not going away for hoiden doctor hill who is becoming a lot more openly political man know doctor fill him is on the view the other day and a he pointed out that the border patrol is saying that the human trafficking problem is worse than ever the view as was just a got that doctor oil would say such things miner sanding is he went to the southern border and a an in we get to give people o facts what did you take away from that expiring o what kind of purports n get o ben man a tat expand wot toy fact that to way a to to the head of all the border guards over er that the union i ask him straight ut kids are coming over the border with numbers i non of to numbers an dresses do we check this tutus to what we call them is it possible that were sending him in to noinposstitution rings or set shops he said its not possible it is absolutely are using a medical tax dollars to ship children in to now prostitution a a wanyshobsunco what who knows o we know no a ta are you what find of check i to they ti o they a n a number if they dounobout tho child the a yes we receive em when the come yes said is it possible tour the prostitution ring he said we we know enough to know that it didn't a number of cases it is turned out to be absolute searing a again this sort of stuff is stuff than america do care about and job does not have a cure for its can republicans snatch defeat from the jaws o victory i mean of course they cans there is lot of talk about a government shut down this week and have a question what would be the purpose of such a thing i know these are impolitic questions to ask some time among conservatives because the question for me is always is this performative or is the substantive there is a difference sometimes performed of politics is quite useful because actually changing the narrative on a subject for example it is performance of politics to ship illegal emigrants up to earth's inward that is obviously performative it is not solution o the problem it is an attempt to shame democrats for not having solved the problem an making them own the problem the government shut down are we talking about something performeatofe my what are you getting out often shut town in terms a p a or is it substantive meaning this is such an important thing can we need a fundamental restructuring and we are willing to shut down the government over it and it seems republicans are doing neither performative nor substantive things with regard to the possibility of government shut down this weekend america by pulling get it typically do not government shut towns another do not understand what they are about if your going to actually create a even a partial government shut down people just count of do not one think about the gunmen is the truth hey cannot want the government just run and the don't want to think about it and the more the think about the more avoid they are with whoever is the person they believe is creating the hold up let us be real first of all about government spending overtime there is government shut down there is lot o talk about government spending and we are going to fix the government spending withe government shut town marginal changes that an't got into it when you do these government shut downs and what you end up with his cutting ten billion bucks from the budget twenty billion a hundred billion dollars from the budget if you could get that t which they will not if you if you could actually do that that would not even remotely solved the underlying problem in the america economy which is not spending a hundred billion dollars it spending a hundred trivial hollers on things social security medical and medicate unless you are willing to actually step into the fray and fix the underlying problem all this is performative and then the question becomes performing for whom if the idea is that the republican basis desperate for another government shut i i i do not see it two you think dona trump as part of his relict prospect wants another government shut i you think that he wants people redirecting their i away from jobidon and porter re publican congress it seems to mean not just a politically performative matter it does not make a lot of sent and again ism more in favor of cutting spending then bestially anybody who took about cutting spending right names i think we actually ought to restructure entitlements because that is the serious strive of america national debt not the post office in hooked but in any case according to the her times an grussional leaders have now failed to reach a deal on legislation to keep federal fund in going past fridge republicans are insisting on policy dictates to the spending bill chucksumers and on sundae that despite in tense discussions republican recalcitrant was raising the prospect of a destructive shut down at midnight on fridge jobidon has now summon congressional leaders to the whorehouse on tuesday to discuss at that spending legislation as well as the ninety five billion dollar fore ad package for can in israel the tenant past earlier this month the speaker of the house has refused to take that up at this point three can second o times over the last six months congress has re light on those short turn stop gap spending bills pass by by partisan position of lawmakers you'll remember that actually the bestial was negotier by kevmac earthy who is then summarily busted in an idiotic coo that achieved nothing ism sorry whatever you think of caveman earthy the idea that that was strategic victory for conservatism it'd but let at some point the evidence would be great i what do we need evidence for propositions any more we just sort of say them apparently a lot of the re publican members want johns to sure major cuts and policy changes that have no chance of enactment with democrats and control of the senate and the white house and again those major cuts whenever the near times describes major cuts understand their not tucknment major guts the real cut would be the restructuring all f the major entitlement programs in the united states and no one is willing to touch that i mean don trump is not wiling to touch that one of the reasons the out flanked his compatriots in the republican party an to that not sixteen is because many of them were saying we need to restructure an entitlements in troubles nocking at touch it that a keep em that ice and that actually was a popular position with america who when it comes to government spending are always of to mines one is yes we should definitely cut the government spending the government spends way to much money and the other mind is no not that i dine mean that thing a bottom line is is this a smart political move for congress to make in the middle of the presidential year i think not ay meanwhile the rants of the day these stupid ran of the day goes to jroyry because it is nearly everyday but that jroyreed decided to sound off on invited fertilization the other day because obviously albata has now declared we o the supreme court that embryos have the status of protected humans which raises questions about how give yet is to be performed and the preservation of frozen embryos for example the our complex moral issues no question about it but leaves o do read to have the stupidostake of the day here was tat here's joy reed stalking about it i have a couple of questions question number one who is the wean i mean your federal officer euros united states senator are you saying the federal government needs more kids because y was not aware that there was a federal mandate for the government of the united states to demand and increase in population where does that mandate come from who is the we the federal government needs more kids for what the united states has a population of north of three hundred and twenty seven million people why do not we mean more kids i mean your party senator tupberville is the one screaming that ten million emigrants which i do not even know that that number even makes any sens cause it does not o have streamed into the country since jo bison has been president and your claiming than that is too many people that if more people come into the southern border this is some sort of crisis because we wee got too many people and we have got in more space and we cannot afford more people but now your sing we need more kids in the same the sate of albata needs more kids why does ta take of alabamide more kids more kids for what there was a time when the state of albata absolutely needed more kids because albata was a slavesate and the mandate of the planter class at albata was for black women to produce more kids because those kids were property and they could work more kids and make more money on their plantations what the f a a few things number i m that sat that is a very special ran there from from dried manse s she's just chis whipper snapper smart this she is bright what let us begin wit the migration point the reason the republicans very often oppose emigration is not because they do not believe that the population of the united states notes to increase is because it matters where people are from and what their culture is in what they think about things i know the his tougher drop red actually understand but not all humans think the same things when you say that america ease more yes america does see more kids in fact virtually all major countries of this point need more children especially to pay for all the programs the drop red much second when you say that we need more kids we do not mean that we want to enslave our children we are saying that kids are innately good it is good for people to have kids i know this a feared idea for many people in let but actually kids are wonderful kids are they're give pan in the cousin they are absolutely wonderful there is that just on a pure human level more human souls good also when you talk about the economics of the situation not ti met enslaving the kids you are talking about the fact that those people are going to produce more innovations more goods and services that make life better for every one but y again leave dried to give the dumps to take in the land meanwhile gavenusum giving his own due take it it's it is incredible that you see this very conflicting position on see from from democrats one is if is really important because we need to let people have kids and the other is people should kill kids and the the these two positions are simultaneously held the question with regard to i ten for many conservatives in terms of how it is done is o case you are you are now giving an embryo a shot at life but you are doing by perhaps discarding other embryos which is to create a human life to dispose of it and s that is a real problem and what you are trying to wait is the upside of creating a new human life with you downside of killing other human lives an that is a really complex moral problem that has real ramifications on left you've the simultaneous idea that if in is an unbridled good because it creates a human life agree but also if you wish to kill it no problem which is i guess solves your way out of the i the aftolema but gets you in some pretty murky waters elsewhere here is gavenusum saying he sorts on restricted abortion do you think there is the week that acted to abortion should be pan emmet i i think we have established that firmly in the contacts of what states are doing californium where we established e constitutional right the access abort in the end of the day i think that is of determination for women at an lockers as a relates to the issues in californium we have established that firmly in the state constitution as a relates to getting into the debate around late ternabortion that is a complete coward amazing amazing stutter from gavenusum but again this the party that has some real promise of the definition of basic concepts ranging from men and women to human life itself arereadyo coming up we will get to the situation in crane and russia conflicting reports over exactly what killed leeway nanny will get into that momentarily first if you are not a member become member used

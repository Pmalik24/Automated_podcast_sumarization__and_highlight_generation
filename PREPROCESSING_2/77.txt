the showsponser express we pinnas time to stand up against biota protector dada expressing piantacam flash men this week the metropolitan police in onion presidio take removing posters with pictures of hostages taken by camps the posters were being removed from colomore chemist in edgewise the chemists s yo banana can recently retreated post branding israel and the idea filthy animals and encouraging iron an rasbora to attack israel this naturally caused some properly earned ones after all the removal of such posters has become the main of antisanits across the world what was the police's excuse froremoving the posters they explained quote most people who reported the posters to us were concerned that would escalate an already tense situation officers went to the shop and acting in good faith they remove the posters in an effort to prevent any such escalation we do not wish to limit the rights of anyone to protest or to raise awareness of the plant of those kidnap and the terrible impact on their families but we do have responsibility to take reasonable steps to stop issues escalating and to avoid any further increase in community attention stopped the escalation prevent the community attention that is the important thing well yesterday the metropolitan police reportedly arrested a man for posting a video criticizing people for putting up palisinian flags around his neighborhood here is the vino n let is the vanish ais on and on passing in fa colon flags a all around his neighborhood en o o he n an o oonaliterally every flag on palcoonlabea e a this guy was then arrested here is the video of his arrest well that e o yo o the an e en o o o ton rest o o i i to tie ti i any tetter we o thiol you thou es the thing to a a never ta re an also a do to o o ain e ta o take disgusting i a disgusting the like o i a i i a e tie she show ti hear ti a o ta i i i i a a a ai a a e oi o o in oil yo it he a e all o then flag an back finger a e o to e oi i o a o what they arrested him for saying why are these people in our country meaning people who are posing palisinian flags in the middle of giant relies for comas now the police did not remove the palicinian flags for the sake of community mention in the current moment those flags are clearly meant to support come after all there were no relies with palicinian flags prior to october seventh happening tin great brain if there are true separation in cause between the called pro palicinian protestors we see on the streets and the procomas protestors one might imagine that propalistinian protestors would call for cases ouster and surrender says to make way for a peace process not one moment of that has materialized none at all zeros built but the brutish policeman touch the flags in the name of relieving community tension or anything instead they arrested the man who wondered why brain would import the kinds of people would post paliscinian flags on street poles welcomes is holding human babies hostage remember the tensions must be reduced now there are two ways to produce tension in a community the first is to cave to those who are the most radical and the most dangerous in this case the ma supporters criminalize anyone would ask just why a community in the less should be expected to contain people who support comas take them to jail for asking that question tape the second way to lower community tensions is to recognize that those very people who defend comas are a danger to you community that the problem is not community quiescence but the constituency of the community itself that there cannot be community with people who root for comas this should be obvious but it is not it is not because less simply refuses to look reality in the face better to arrest people who speak that reality than to look reality in the face because reality is ugly and reality is in pleasant and reality might require you to recognize that the importation of millions of people who hate the west was an awful terrible idea and that means should be taken to reverse that process and instead away has to be found to pretend away the threat play it on israel jabber about the two state solution talk about is lamaphobia whatever you do to not look the realities of mufti culturalisms dramatic failure directly the face do not do it this of course place to erectly into the hands of comas they know understand that they can say in to literally anything and that much of the west will cover for them in order to maintain the fiction that multiple culturalism works there in bother to hide the ball they know that you are stupid and or week the will say it to erectly out to your face they understand they you will just pretend they did say it they you'll pretend to misunderstand them they you will in fact grant credibility to people who cheer for them in the streets here is comas official those coma speaking just one we could go on ebonies to the calling for a acts on jewfish civilians until israel is extrapacees will repeat other seventh over and over and over so you t the you o was israel is a country that has no place on our handle must re move that countryetaus a consultuty security militaryand political catastrophe it but o to the agrarian is nomination and must be finishthe are not shame to say this with ill force more must teach israel lessen and we will do this again and again we she all its of flood is just the first time they'll be a second a third fort because we have the determination l resolved that cap abilities suffice one will we have to play a price ass in we are ready to hand said the we are call the nation of martyrs is were proud of sacrifice matters s we did not want a harm cotillions we as a lie obviously ut there ware complications on the ground the hand now we wan there is a party in the area with savillian population father's a large aria cross forty kilometers lei mete occupation must come to an annoy occupation were in the gosistrip know ism talking about all the palistinian land jamming the a to finish an isrelshes yes of course existence of israel is illogical it existence israel is what causes all that pain into hers decor yes it ex israel lot us we are the victims of the occupation period they murder fourteen hundred news they burn babies in ovens and then they tell you that they want to do it again and again and again operation all ox flood is the name of what they did that is literally the name of what they did another saying they want do it over and over and over again and by the way there are polls showing that there is wide and broad support for this in muslin countries across the world pretending that you can import a bunch of peoplepw'll gree with compass and this is not somehow one to have some on back on your community is simply insane it is totally crazy in every available was totally totally nuts for example there is a recent pole showing one in three in lebanon currently favor war with israel the pull found broad support for commons terror organize that the commons her operation o called operation all ox flood of the four hundred individuals pole in lebanon eighty per cent supported what composted eighty per cent in lebanon eighty per cent and by the way if yolk an other countries very similar numbers the group wishing to condemn israel comprise of it ninety seven per cent of share respondence eighty four percent of son respondence fifty five per cent of christian ebony's respondence in seventy five per cent of dress respondence and just one second we will get to more of commostras saying it all out loud because they know that you will not look how in the face they know it they know that you will just ignore what they did on other seventh they will ignore what they say they are going to do in the future including kill you and you children you will ignore it because in comfortable better than if somebody says it we arrest that we have to a rest that key for the sake of community piece we get to that momentarily first pure talk recently announce they would alleviate ten million dollars in veteran debt by veteran's day thanks your support last week they are seventy four per cent of the waste that call with two weeks to go think about this the us militaries made up of one hundred per cent volunteers the are men and women who willingly

to day again that is pure talk do come slash schipuro to day go check them out right now again commas we will say it right to your face we will say right your face cause they know that you are weak or stupid her of comas official abumarzu telling a the the commas as no interest in protecting civilians all the entire west caterwauls about israel and what israel is doing to the the hour of the the horrible crimes there committing against talstinean civilians the literal governing power is saying they have no interest in protecting their civilians and in fact than want their own civilians to die here is again a member of compass explaining abumarzuk saying this baby at the t report as many people are asking amusing you've built five hundred bolometers of tunnels that why have you big bomshaltos we wercivilains can hide during bombardment says we have built the tunnels because we have no other way of protecting ourselves from eintargeted and killed on the thin these tunnels are men to protect us from the airplane owe are fighting from inside the tunnels everybody knows that seventy five per cent of the people in the goes for a refugees come sorting and it is the responsibility of the united nations to protect them according to the geneva conventions it is the responsibility of the occupation tits provide them with all services as long as the are under occupation they say it all out loud on camera over and over and over again they do not stop saying it they shouted from the roof tops but the west will not look compass in the face because i it did it might have to look commands supporters in the face and whellcomases an gaze commas supporters are everywhere working our schooners they go to our schools they staff our press and are academic institutions that is too ugly and it is too frightening we have to look away an the name of relieving community mention of course this is how the west dies by looking away by refusing to acknowledge reality all that community mention they are two ways they can go ways i said one is the u silent everybody in the name of the we and the other is that you maybe look at the forces that are tearing away at the community on to the later and we will end up doing the former and again the the peoplewho are standing for n the people her actively rooting for comas i do not has to say the members the me a quince they are they are rooting for israel to lose to a terrors grouped the the heads at try workers and and ten calls dads i explain how amazing it is what there doing it is it is all over the world i measure is a top yon official yesterday the top yuan official hit is get in pray molkaber he refined from the men and he told we an end who is asked did come a the genocide he refuses to answer the question because of course if he answers the question you might notice it his can refuse to answer the question a do you arrive at the assessment based on you and convention a definition of landside that israel is carrying out at landside right now w a right that based upon a you an convention the binding international legal treaty that defines what genic ideas what its elements are and we know that genocide is a term that is often politicized its often missing its offer use titis the charge of abuse by one side or the other chilling on a large scale a expulsions creating conditions on that i determined to bring about a affectively the destruction of a population this case the population in gassy all of these have been very well documented and add up to a crime of genocide israel continues to say it is going after harass is harass that is keeping at civilians where it is it is using them innocent palitonan as human shields why label that genocide of course we sense what tot we semis claims before a repeated by the as daily authorities in previous at lard scale attacks on civilian populations first claiming self defense under international law gives no state the right to commit the kinds atrocities that it is carrying out now been has never come asses fault is never comemosses fault there just in obscure it they're just going to say that israel is fault because again if you notice that one of these groups come of is an actual evil medicinal dating organization a the say it out loud and they brag about using human shields we then mi change your opinion a word word were not allowed to change our opinions on these things because that might have some consequences for the rest of the west and the entire allowed has come round this here is a former buningstandrers spoke's person while led shag itsplaining this is israel fault of course of course we have a government in an israel in a partner in israel that has never empowered the palistinan leadership in the west bank to actually reach a settlement the final sat is settle settlement about what to do with the two states solution we a cave a a right is really government that opposes pakistan in state of very openly and you the united states must use its diplomatic and financial evert with our all the ally we fund militarily to to put pressure on them to in power the secular authorities in the west bank who have been the leadership of the palistinian people but have never been impower to actually be at the thing table in negotiate in recent years with these rallies o israel are for are not imposing palistinians to make peace by by what deposing the placing an authority an putting in place a moderate palisonian which you youthen complain about as an act of partied and genocide an all the rest of it it is ridiculous but this is huge segments of our media it is huge segments of academia and its huge segments of people in positions of authority we it is more on that just one second first on

great you will of it go to on charge dot come slashed usecoben to save at fifteen per cent o case our media ore full scale on the side of come a ma i do not know how is to put it they want israel to loose over the last couple of days israel had to hit a target and our balsa which is a quonquot refuge cap bi always say qonquo because people do not understand a refute camp is they think that a refuge camp in the middle east books how you would con sidearm like much of feta trailers by a river somewhere the just flooded that is not what is happening in the gozestript its are full scale cities that have been there for fifty years with giant buildings they are called by the international comitia refuge camps to maintain the false claim that people living in gibalya somehow of a right to live in height which is absolute shut nonsense it is ridiculous there as never been a situation in human history where a country a sovereign country is forced to open its own borders two people far outside those bordersthat it is not a thing that happens in international law ever seriously name o time this as ever happened in human history does not work that way a but put that aside the idea that israel hits this this target inside the gerbalya refuge camp it is a military target how you note to military try because the ground underneath it collapses you know it does not tend tend to happen very often if if you hit a building from above and here is nothing underneath it you do not ten get a giant sink hole why there is a giant single because secondary explosions and because tunnels underneath it collapsed and a bunch of compass new bunch of come ass members were killed because they were underneath her including top commanders and coss thrust of the world saw pictures though of a boom a boom went there is a big boom and people were killed in the big boom it does not matter the israel has distributed at this point tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of beef lets above gaze telling people get the hell out of the areal where you are into military aria and when non had to hit it come ass told people to stay in clouding many young men it told them to stay they con be used this human shield that is the entire point and the media immediately rush they were eager they are eager they would set up the in her predict for this have en told about this for weeks at this point the they were setting up the predict for when israel did what it had to do claiming that israel is now the offending party the predict was it malt prongs s all one thing they would says to take what we have to warn its try if to warn them to you to you we we join a ranges we need to warn israel they've to be very careful about villain lefts who have warned them to be veryisrael is more careful about civilian lives than the united states and of story is really sacrifice far more of its lives proportionally of its soldiers in ordinal house to house than the united states did in places a rock or of gannistan which is why their hundreds of thousands of dead civilians in a rock an a gangsta a but put that aside the idea really really does it but does not matter point number one propaganistic point of one is if it want for of the west tugging on israel hotels telling them not to murder of the children tan they would be in there just opening heads and and bashing children in the head really silly now again that is the non sensual israel had complete air superiority there is no air force for commas thank god if israel one to liberate the entire area kill two million people it has the power to do that it is not doing that because the would be terrible and a moral an is raising an to do that part one of the my was we have to tell his real notes violate human rites if we do not tell them than they certainly will and then part two lies well it might be just proportionate if israel had to military target an terete some civilians there that might be just that is not with this proportion it means this proportional does not mean the israel some house to measure the proportion between the number of is rally dead and the umber of rosin dead that isn't how that works if that wore way that worked then the allies we are morally wrong and worldwar tubes way more germansdied than britstide in world for to what proportionality means is is the end shut proportional to the means taken you are the giant commons head quarters and it is underneath the civilian area is a proportionate to hit that when they're literally aiming rockets you from that area and the answer is clearly us but the me you pretend the o and the stuff now either the unbelievably ignorant of the rules of ware the laws warn how our works or they re liars there are note there there is no this choice there i the ignorant or they are liars i think their liars i thing a lot of them are liars i think they certainly no better and they are avoiding the knowing better because to do might offend it might offend you do not want o offend it all the radicals out there whorl agree with commas and you have to pretend to moral equivalents was that moral equivalence is you are warm buff man it is look warm and it is really dirty butt it is a warm bath whereas if you've to take a side might be left out in the cold by somebody that into the media's responds to the gobolyabomming

responded to the bombing of a commas military target ingurbalya that israel warn people repeatedly to get out of the way of in brimmer who is ben on the show i in nice guy he is unbelievably wrong axeman attribute this ignorance because again i think he ins a nice person but i do not understand wat the hell's talking bet the the blast hits jabot he treats out this is a war crime period know the war crime is when you hide your military targets underneath civilians that is an actual war crime under the geneva conventions a target is transformed into a military target when it is military and you hide it beneath the civilianaria you cannot protect yourself thruway in fact if you were the contrary every military on earthbound hide beneath civilians men imagine the logicyure it is absolutely insane the logic its being used here is that if common we are to go and murder bunch of is rally civilians and then go on to a field some whore than israel can go welling rally hollow on them but if they commit the double atrocity of murdering a munch was rally civilians another hiding but beneath their own civilians now they're amen now there a run the magicalleamiun what do you think that incentivize that incentivize is every one to hide behind civilians if the way you gain defensive immunity is by hiding behind women and children then every single terrine is going to hide behind women and children which is precisely the reverse of the called laws of war the entire r purpose of the laws of war for those who are not complete faring morons is to get military members in military uniform away from civilians if you generates and entire linens of structure that tells people to get out of uniform and among civilians what do you think you are doling you are incentivizing that behavior of course members the media again i have to assume the they are not complete morons but maybe they are you are not a good situation when the catch twenty to the the the better moral solution is that the members of the media are far stupid that they do not understand the stuff as oppose to they are unbelievably a moral and evil an here is the you times nicholas crista who is been garbage on this as well joining joy read who's a probably comfortablwith many antisemmies on emisenbisy and his take is the real prove heres that israel bombing is radicalizing people you know they will not radicalize before over there in gozlstand now under under the tootalage of compass they wasn't radicalize there a bunch of nice western people but now israel bombing them that is what is really radicalizing them of a thank you for that magical catch twenty two you have now created either israel gets to defend itself in it citizens by you know killing the people who are among rockets at it and keeping two hundred thirty three people under ground and also is murdered fifteen hundred of their citizens or if they if the or they can presumably just wait to die they can wait to die as not offend here is necholas crista urging solution too wait to die sons not to offend people youwould not want people who hate israel tho hate be israel even more you you certainly don't want that thou be bad you'll not want a radicalize radical population radical they elect the commons austere i bunderguar your extinction war and not know your cure next i has been in to completely staggering i think it that it is also i radical is the west bank one of the things that i worried thou is that there will be pasta question west bank as sat people in all people are talking about is what is happening in cosset and and there is also a wide street conviction among people in the west bank that the i explosion at the hospital we go on it get that was not only cops by israel bet it tact which u do the great strike on a hospital by israel point tat at my best guest is tot do is probably a i someecehod rocket they wet astray but it that is not the perception in the west bank by well that is not e perception west bank coming even they'll never forgive is real for not getting that hospital because hat would have provided them with their favorite talking point obviously i love that so nicholas crstopumen and that segno by bang there being radicalized by things israel did not even do is of would stop doing the things that is doing and also s is should definitely stop dong the things it is not doing which things is israel allowed to do then they cannot do the things that they are doing an they cannot do the things that they are not doing ut again all that is his excuse making it is excuse making you just people seem to not mind very much when news just absorbed death that is when you i have seen many tweets over the last several weeks going although the world opinion is turning against the news now it is really turn in if they if they retaliate the world opinion turns against the news guess what if have a choice between breathing and defending myself i am going to keep breathing ism addicted to it am not can stop doing it for your viewing pleasure ism not going to commit suicide in orders thy you feel better about yourself it is absurd there is of blitz are doing the same disgusting routine on siannand they senor ha lost official that a claims was the leader in the october seven terrorist attack pagans facial we do not yet do how civilians we are killed it that a strike to that refuge cap but the is takin to what a lost leader or maybe two a lost leaders who may have been there worth the death of som very civilian what the port a israel effort to defend itself it has not us the right to defend itself or the responsibility a told it citizens in it sovereignty in the face of a brutal horrific attack that took place on october seven and for the good of israel for the good of the reason for the good of america the free world and for the good of the palathinian people in gosh a we meed to make sure that mamas is defeated that that is the right ans we my ha can jefferes but will not bits are doing the that theythey took out two moss manners can that justify is let me be clear israel right now by doing this they know that there are hostages down there they know that there are hostages down there good this immediately come ass by surrendering any one calling for colossus to surrender no one in the mediates calling for compass surrender none of them the same people hoar weeping crocodile tears over the situation and goa refuse to actually engage in the one conversation thy would actually force comose to surrender which is come ass you have two choices you neither be completely destroyed or pecan surrender i swear if if these members the media hand been completely dominant during the world for to there is no way that the allege could have wan the war not one way in hell the alive would wan the war every act the allies took we an second gest everything that the allies did motor to win that war whup give entreated to human rice violation and the german certainly out have one this is the media are disgusting i men truly gross and meanwhile this of course is translating into some public opinion you some of this public opinion is being at manufactured there is a liberal group a progressive policy and pulling organization called data for progress and they ask the following question to america quote the u s should call for sense firer and de escalation of violence and goa the us should leverage is close diplomatic relationship with israel to prevent further violence and civilian deaths agree or disagree it'll get where i mean if your gan a stacked that way i agree r amen i if the idea wit o of disease fire is that the sense fire will stop all death civilian violent all and but of course that is not the case we know that if there is sense fire commons will grow stronger and the commons will do this again and tat comosswill put its own civilians in the line fire again but when you phrase it that way which is the medias entire phraseology you remove all the contact and just say bad things are happening would you the bad things to stop ye no much bad things but what sometimes got to do the bad thing to prevent the worst thing especially when the group already did the worst thing and they have pledged that they are going to do the worst thing again and again and again and again until there are no just left but the media have to do that they have to do that because again that allows them to live their favorite lie and that favorite lie is that in our magical mullite cultural spot sent for world we are all the same the only thing that truly divides us is whether we humus or whether we crept that is the only thing that really divides us whether we brushed or whether we philopho otherwise we are all the same we think the same things we can import hundreds of thousands of you into western cultural center s while you scream for our deaths and there the is a video that we going around those somewhat telling in terms of the cultural differentiation between certain ares of the world and other areas of the world and it showed the status of women in a variety of muslin countries before the take over by radical museums an showed video of what cranial women dress for example before or the shall there dress western women and look at them to day and they're all stuffed into berks take a look at women in afghanistan the nineteen fifties when the united states had a heavy presence in afgannisan here dress western women to day they are stuffed into berks pretending this cultural difference does not exist is insanity it suicidal insanity pretending that you can import one set of values into an completely different set of values that is no impact what soever another maintaining that lie at the cost of the free speech of your own citizens is totally crazy but that is exactly what everybody has been engaging and predictably predictably this is generating a new way of antisemitism of course because why would not it becauseyou are making effectively two seproclams one is then your blind to the antisemitism of raticalislum it does not exist there just you totally normal for the sake of community piece we have to let them do what there on to do and we have to take down the stuff that offends them because they are just us that is lie number one and my number to is becauseyou have tenormalis cousin it supporters you have to pretend hanactually israel brought the upon itself an if israel brought thespondece up that men israel the badly and if israel the badly than every who supports israel is the bad guy you knows sportisrael the news that is that is why antisemitism has fight you cannot dis connect with the media are doing in terms of they are assault and lies about the current conflict from the spike and antisemitism the media camel lament the spiking antisemitism and simultaneously closet which is precisely what they are doing right now at this minute we'll get to

daily wired come slash sub scribe right now start trimming the next generation of kids entertainment o cane meanwhile i do not o give a shat to linsygram senator gram has come in for some criticism on this show over time but he was asked on seamen by abbey fillip about civilian death in gaze and she asked what i believe to be in ancriible due question the due question is is thermal limits to the number of civilians dying in a conflict beyond which you are just n to allowed to go when of course the answer to this is no the answers this is is there is not in actual numerical limit the reason there's not an actual numerical limit that we have rules of war right those rules of war that you supposed to minim civilian casualties but you cannot have a sliding the scale in terms of human life where if you kill ten thousand civilians that is a caybutif you will ten thousand and one civilians well then we really have to tell it t call of the duck the reason you cannot have that particularly in this contact is because if you articulate such a limit what do you think comosseis it intense of structure is colossi sense of structure is then to kill ten thousand and one civilians to put civilians all over the can place if you say to themlisson we will kill eight thousand of your civilians but if we go any further in that e raglan have to stop whose interest is it in for these civilians to die at that point the party trying to stop is to from take our comose moss that is what graham is saying rebury all you craft for be sorely right on us is there a threshold for you and they think there should be what for the united states cofermat and which think you at cult say let let us hold our fir bacon a terms to civilian catch there as there pi at well wo it start to cuastceal iris somebody ask us after war to her limit what you would do to make sure the japan and germany do not conquer the world is there any limit what is for should do to the people for trying to slaughter the just transfers no there is no limit but here is what you a do be smart less try the limits of thing casual leas best wo can let put you mandarin a an er is the for neck thenisthant om all for that to graham is saying exactly the right thing which is who should try tominimy spilling casualties by join put in number on this peeks that only benefits compass and meanwhile it'll be fellas is there doing the well i m can that there are a lot of people it is amazing again ignorant wore terrible those are the only two choices all this they say is fomenting antisemite is can unsurprisingly we are seeing a radical increasing antisemitism which is kind of an amazing thing it really is we what we are watching right now is the worst attack on jaws since the holiest and in the wake of that more attack is on news now in the west i cannot imagine many other groups to which the supplies let us say tat the are white to promised t attack on a black church if the immediate response for everybody word be white to premises are awful people who sympathize with them are awful and we have no tolerance for people committing what he federal govern would call hate crimes against black people first part you on you need a shooting for that on need is a viral video for that but when it comes to the news oddly enough a bunch of news get killed an the rest of the world's seems it is the news fault and we should probably harm them maybe that is because the media a driving a narrative that is the jet's fault and maybe to cate a harm them that is what happens when you when you actively mobilize in favor of a group that seeks to harm news accomplishes that and then claims i unity in surprisingly and emetic incidents across the glove of spit according to the jerusalem post a shocking sorgenantismetic incidents including an astonishing one thousand one hand eighty per cents increase in antisemitic discourse has swept across the globe during the on going swords of iron war according to a comprehensive report released by israel national institutions and government the reports a joint effort of the diaspora affairs in combating anti semitisof the ministry the worldliest organization and the jewfish agency the report thetailes an alarming almost twelvefold increase in artistic discourse tan includes calls for violence against israel iris and news almost all of it is in arabia seventy one per cent in english twenty eight per sent one in three of the antistatic events are the united states there's been a three used thirty per cent in create in violent antiseptic incidents seventy one per cent originated from arab and his comic groups are one not a giant shock in any of those statistics an cries ray the had of the area he saying the same he says camasses successes gain cause violence at home since the terrific derris attack committed by mamas against innocent people in israel a few weeks ago wee been working you the clack to support our partners there and to protect america here at home wears that the actions of mamas and its allies will serve as an inspiration the of which we have not seen since i shows launch it called califate several years ago in just the past few weeks multiple foreign territoranizations have called for attack against america and the west i mean he is right about that of course but you know t say a factor that is cuttigvery much in favor of that is when the entire wan see media rush to the defense of compass and you are if you are calling on israel to stop the killing of commons terrace re now i it that benefits other than compass it is literally their goal here is the be i director saying that anti feminism is reaching record levels well yah obviously i will say that this is a threat that is a reaching in some way sort of historic levels a in part because as all too well the jewfish community a is targeted by derris really across the spectrum how groan extremes foreign derris organizations both sun and she a domestic fa extremes and in fact a statistics would indicate that for a group that represents only about to point four per cent of the america public they account for something sixty per cent of all religious pace hate crimes one mean i wonder by that would be mean it could not be anything systemic could it at all he re out e steal races on could be anything about the systemic antisemitism of media that constantly finds excuses to blame open hatred of news and in fact murder of news on other causes meanwhile at our universities things continued be finding games of promos man was bullying an jewfish study at hazard s here is that looked he can see here there is jewfish student the prokomas man surrounds the jewfish the sister at to pushing him around i o ma suffice it to say that if this were a bunch of which you premises student surrounding blackstone in doing this this would be the from page story in every major newspaper for a year entire democratic party would run on this systemic racism of the america people this is happening this kind oft off is happening demands of time to day across the united states ran now on major university compasses and tum i guess this justify that happens man i guess that is just at just the way that it goes meanwhile over in france thinks are going even better a french women had her house spray painted with jewfish stars which is not if locative at all the holocoss or anything you o i as again is in all going to s the hatred i saw as a child o and i do not understand you seen the background her house has been spray painted with a stars of avid now again one of the reasons for the wild growth of the antisemitism is also because its being spurred by social made s a tie to which is a garbage outlet that ought to be band tie took the views of pro palestine posts our far out weighing the views of pro israel posts according to axis if you look at the the period october sixteenth through twenty three you see that there kind of even hashshak stand with palestine hash tan with israel kind of even in terms of the number of views and then if you fast ford one week ticktock changes changes their algorithm obviously and the stand with palestine dashikis now getting two hundred eighty five million views compared with sixty four million for stand with israel wo below there been two hundred ten thousand posts using the hash stand with palestine in seventeen thous in using the hash stand with israel since october sixteen ticktock is is not just the proctor for understanding how many museums are around the worlds were using it it is also because again tiptoe is own by the government f china another govermentof china has been actively oriented in a comes favor meanwhile russia is orienting in a

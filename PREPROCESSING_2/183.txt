mississippi is one of a small number of stats with something a robbery conviction can costume your right to vote even after you get out of prison even after you come let your pearl pay a your fines all that you still cannot vote missippi is unusual in that regard states do not permanently take away a person's right to vote non if they do it is usually just for crimes rape or murder but in mississippi there is one wake one long winding path that people can take that it'll let them both again this a path that most states do not offer johnnycoffman explains when i first learned about this i was a little baffled to get your voting rights back you have to get your own personal bill pass by the state legislature these bills there called suffrage bills are just one page with your name your conviction and a line about being a quote honorable citizen conning your own personal law giving you permission to vote the bills have to go through committees and pass the house and sent all that stuff and we will get to that but the thing to know in general about this is it is pretty hard to pass any bill ever about anything this is pretty hard and the people that try they tend to really care about voting this man herald lard one of the mean reasons he really once to be able to vote again the thing that drives him kind of crazy they consolidated to schools local schoolyard he talked for almost ten minutes about it how they close the high school and they move the high school tobaaspeel penis habit he bet o facilities and the signboard members he says o at o have could entrance but no real experience with education only come me i degree is a psychology but that does not mane out what make a great teacher herald lives an hour south of jacks mississippi's capital were he helps men the family business a funeral he herald told me he is an introvert but he also said he is the person at church who'll stand up and tell the demon to get closer to the microphone gelds the guy who kids in the back and records the service he is pretty open about well pretty much everything including he he lost his right to volt he robbed a bank i can two thousand to he told me he was grappling with druggadiction relapsed and bocce cane from a guy went was that gigs idea he wrote a note you say go midis to the teller and she gave me the money and tell you how dumb ma was instead of running out i casually walked out he was not wearing a mask he did not even know what was on a i mas sol me it say give me the money that is what mas silken they got caught the same day know at first he was charged for the armed robbery ut then the prosecutor looked at the security face and realized he did not have a weapon and they were li to o a you guilty of a lot of things and been dome is the most prevalent n that is what my lord you told me these days herald watch his after his mam his uncle he wants the funeral home he is been out of geld for sixteen years he does not see any reason why he shouldn't be able to tell herald started on this long strange journeying to get back his right to to one day in church a friend told him about the suffrage bills meeting your he decided to try he filled out of foreboding r an non profit in jacks passed it on to a state representative who introduced his bill grand had not actually seen it when we met but i had a copy with me it was wild for him to see it and how spill one seven to one and act to restore the right of suffrage to herald lard ofgefferson dais county mississippi be it infected by the legislature of the state of mississippi station or the it of suffrage is hereby filly and completely restore to feral lar gefferson day was county mississippi i was to be clear i still had not has but just to see what could happened there on the page the right is hereby fully and completely restored this makes me happy this makes me really really happy why jest mango fully and completely what o you think about this line at the and i an legislature as informed e assist himself as on law biding an honorable citizen and the good and lawful manner are i except frospeeding i have a problem with speedy frena ism getting better o o this would be u amaze of it has to do is ps an i have a copy is you can keep that do not can why this were herald was one of twenty three people who got bills introduced hoping to get the right to vote back i tried to talk to his many as i could it was a pretty determined group the dad and tool factory worker who had been on a union board an older man who was sick in bed used to be a county super wiser and a got who worked it a mental hospital he showed me a newsclipping about how his father was shot and nearly killed trying to register people to vote there's something forty four thousand people in mississippi who cant woke because of a conviction a dis proportional per senate sixty per sent are black in h state that thirty eight present black errand is black is a show lamplight hangs she is the person who took the form errand filled out and gave it to a legislator who introduced the bill she helps a lot of people do this when i first learned about the process ta art a that people did not take advantage of it and i tat hay this is a way for us to really get in there and i was excited about it until i lar it it was a joke a spoke because a bill can die with no explanation there is nothing on any government website telling you how to get your vote back even finding out when the bills are discussed how do you find out when the when the committees a happening ow would just take some of the committee members to see you do not have you heard anything about the suffrage committee oh you the chairman say will probably gong to meet next wednesday but it is never on the calender then that next wars they will come are you guys going to meet to day ye we are going to meet it for today is just stalking people basically fortunately when ta show stock's people they her she is fun a talk to they answer her texts the show be was head of the mississippi a sit you for nearly a debate i shall lease an non profit called one voice the office is in an old masonic building that the civil ritesack to miss medlar avers use to work out of the show be seems busy all the time a friend gave her this mug once this says fucking it'll do it and this is one of those things she is got lots of other stuff but she makes time for these bills then doing it for over delicate the lifetime voting ban is enshrined in the mississippi constitution and the history of how ended up there is pretty well documented and revealing it starts after the civil worm black people could finally vote and there were putting people in office including the first black you ask senator hilum rods revels but there was back lash in eighteen ninety white leaders senator names gorge said the state needed to hold a convention to write a new constitution verge said the new senses was going a show there were more black people than whites and missis and the goal of the convention should be to make sure whites controlled the government the president of the convention was a man named solomon callous who said quote negro suffrage is an evil and an evil to both races in his opening speech of the convention he said the voting scheme should be arranged to keep white people and power that decided on a few things there was a poleax and this really vague test called the understanding class the said a voter had to be able to interpret part of the constitution one newspaper called it a gigantic fraud then there was the part in the new constitution about crime and voting the constitution says that they are eleven crimes that take your voting rights away in tools are big a me timber latrine arson i stealing wood or something stealing tease talk to to historians who said the list was clearly meant to target black people crimes delegates to the convention thought black people would be more likely to commit and the novel idea that you could get your rites back if you get a bill throw the legislature with your name on it that was also in the eighteen ninety constitution he stories do not know much about how it ended up and there maybe they were trying to keep the governor from gaining too much power or maybe they wanted a way to help their white friends and family if they happened to commit one of the crimes on the list whatever it was this last chance is still there for any one who wants to try but most people do not even know about it errands journey began where all epic journeys begin the sub committee of the house do to harry b committee herald wanted to be there when they discussed his bill which it turns out is difficult to do because you do not know when the hack their meeting even the legislators do not know sometimes i managed to get the phone number of the lawmaker who chairs the committee but it was not until the day before that he let me know when it was can o happen herald was not going to be able to make it he cannot find any one to cover for him at the funeral home i visited him the right before we sat in his living room is cant of emotional for me because this is something that i would really really really to see happen en left up to a bunch of people that do not know me form a chain o pan i do not know what my chances a if i were able to be there as say i would at least have a seventy five permit chance if i could meet them and talk with them are you nervous about how it is gong to go to morrow yes extremely i had a job but is about a appropriate but yet very you can tell me the jog as nervous as a two dollar ho first sundae it seem errands bill stood a chance of passing sometimes the bill fails because the person has an unpaid fine they do not know about or because they only recently finished their sentence those were not problems for errand i told him it'd let him know how it went i went to the hearing the next day six state representatives all but one of them white sat around a couple going tables and a big committee room that was mostly empty off to the side a red plastic coffee to spencer was store from cups the legislators had background checks in front of them for every one with the suffrage bill t only three other people were in the room that is all i set a microphone on the table san you ready a we'll start the meeting this is represented tie know a landlord they went through suffrage bills the first bill passed i the next one there was not really any discussion seething thirty then errands came up

my pa bra and nnnnext step the senate that started the following week just on the house side girls bill had to be passed by a committee before i could go to the full senate he had been trying on his

not we here e i e a e gan it on gum he youth get at ring for fifty times you stayed on that lo i dead ye i wat to call him my nan item at would appreciate any in he again if he you give my help be tat i a get my boring i ay the senate committee met a few days later again we only learned about it the night before and last time gelled bingo because of work he had to watch it on you to from the funeral home this committee room was slightly baker fancier than the first one it was the end of the session and only six of the committees fifteen members showed up all of the once who did were wite here senator fill gave sir friends from the house here here this morning an we have three suffrage bills that a before us and the an how let for down the hall we cold enough to come down and sit with is they were ninety considering just three suffrage bills the first bill came out of i was not errands the sponsor from the house talked about it and the committee passed it then another representative came to the microphone she was there to talk about two other bills at the morning committee and making a charming surround to present on bezant on land mar and is grand neither bill was errands his did not even come out it was dead e looked into it and this is how it goes a lot to the time the house will pass the suffrage bill but then fillingane blocksand i put in a request to talk to him world call me the day after his bill and i get a how yo yet you day be get or bet what it a a will be i a will yo know i you what it it could be right er what do you mean by that just say i know well i mean it by way e eat i a silly i you ay it ay at a herald had no idea why filing gave killed his bill why these other people made it and not him filing gain got back to me and was happy to talk i met him it his law office he is a real estate her when he is not at the capital i just finish my twenty third year in the legislature i combined how sense in it in next year we the end of the six term i mean have been done it for a little while now i brought a copy of herald's bill with me his did pass out of the house ism and than i do not think that sent committee even brought it up for discussion it i do not recall us bringing that one up in probably because his distant frenchiseind prime was that of robbery which just considered a violent offense robbery is classified as a violent offense in mississippi law it does not mean the crime itself was necessarily violent but filing gan as a general rule does not consider any suffrage bills for violent crimes he said that with the lieutenant governor who put him on the committed told him to no that is why grand's bill a but ultimately it is up to filing game he can do what he once and he said he does sometimes away information that swayed him one way or another but there is no part of this possess set aside for people to come talk to him in the committee introduced themselves tell their story i told him that herald's crime was almost twenty years ago and that he did not have a gun at the bank filingane said yes those of the times of things that could persuade him in the committee but he said he look at o the things too filling insider might hurt some one herald if the police had been called to their home or if they would been convicted of another crime i wondered how fphillin gave felt about enforcing this particular part of mississippi's constitution given how it disproportionally effects black people and given its history the historians that have talk to about this to try tat learn more about it said that it was us eighteen ninety constitutional convention that met and that the goal of that convention was to keep black people from voting and that that these criminal disenfranchisement these laws were part of that that plan i do not know if that is the case or not i was not there have have not studied the history of the eighteen in constitution and certainly mississippi has a very achecuerd pass when it comes to i race relations we treated afternomericans very poorly in in a some parts of our history and ism certainly not et as at herring define that a even trot to i would not want to but if your asking me is the suffrage right being treated differently base on your race in twenty twenty two as it relates to suffrage bills that we considering the legislature absolutely not i do not know e o the race of the person ism sure i could probably try to find out be asking to part wetcorrections to print me as social history and of the prisons age and i in a rail background and all that if i wanted to have never done that i do not intend to start but i mean is not obvious to me just bi looking at ha bill what racial background someones is a part of i asked him about this rule more broadly if some one does their time their out of prison off parole years have passed why shouldn't they be allowed to vote what is the reasoning behind that well i think and not certainly what i would think the it we ain but ism curious about what you think i me i think at somepoin personal responsibility has to come into it and you have to realize if ism going to break the social contract and commit a violent crime or mist of these are talent crime that lead to ism just from front rousing an your right to the here there a price es to pay for that there has not been a grand swell of public support to change this particular aspect of our state constitution and not to say that there will not be in the future but certainly there has not been as of twenty twenty two of course the thing about public support is that the people directly affected by this provision in the eighteen ninety constitution they cannot vote this here just five people got the right to to back which is pretty typical this here it is four women in one man i do not know much about them because this can create them just what is on their suffrage bills two were convicted of forgery two of them vesselment and one burglary most of them finish their sentence is before herald did some of them hadn't been able to vote for databases there is a low suit in the federal courts trying to argue that this whole process for getting the right to go back as arbitrary and therefore on constitutional was in the you ask constitution but its the early stages and any ruling cold take years the show be the woman who helps get a lot of these bills introduced told me she is basically stock trying to get his many of them through the house in senate as she can one by one using the very process she does not thing she exist in the first place herald told me for sure he was going to try again he still has the copy of his bill that did not pass i e mi bet will ago berate i er e pa to ma serer weer i om pot poi to charter likely putty e a to e be ben marge why do you put it on your me but what e i h a e parry he angry e pay a it made that to a hope i ma e be have way there a few months later we talked again and he told me he been arrested for cocaine possession he did not have to tell me about it but he did just volunteered it he said he was driving a friend what they got pull over jerid says his friend had the cocaine the police reports has both of them did in any case jerid was angry himself for having gotten into that situation drug possession is not a crime that is on the list of things that will cost to your right to vote he was not in the eighteen ninety constitution but base on what i learned from senator fill and gain grand's arrest might be enough reason to kill his bill if the point of putting this in the constitution was to make it a long journey for people herald it is working johnnicoffman is it seem to producer a campsite mania coming out i try that speeding down a californium highway with one hundred thousand passengers inside that is in a minute chico o radio went our programmed continues is amebic an life f my glass to day's program the longest distance between two points stress people have to take the long and sometimes absurd way to arrive somewhere that you be straight forward to get to we have arrived at act to of i shall at to all communication in the fact we turn to a stray of somebody who starts at home and then and up at home with ay long time consuming journey in the middle this all thing happens in china i guys you propyhood just how different and free basically aggressive china's response to covet is bend from the start the shut down entire cities ink it result best estimates are the china had fewer than twenty thousand people dead from covet fires as a million here and when o ma crown arrived shiny treated with the same severity is the earlier variance even the ninety per cent of the population is now vaccinated lock down all of shanghai in aril and lock down an scape means really lock down ever twenty five million people could not leave their apartments home grocer stores and food livery was shut down lots of people can get food or medicine as pretty offal this tested for two months and is town got much of it going of what it was to live through that s i was excited to talk to danger about this thing that happened t him and his boy friend during that period yang is a podcast producer in china was in shanghai and one day early in lock down he did his daily required self task as usual tut that morning i saw to lies to lines yes the covet ye i think well that is bat and i tell my boy friend johnny and he ten and is positive to anybody in china who tests positives required to reported to the government pecan johnny an nose case means calling one of their neighbors very kind record who is the person in their apartment building designated to deal with government on all matters getting elevators installed dealing with a box suer whatever to the caller and then they figure within a couple hours the governments on a send somebody to take en to a quarantine center that is parted china zero tolerance policy unhealthy people are separated from the rest of the population and then the next very urgent order of business they run on how much time for this is figuring out we're to send their dog waltzer in quarantine just e poppy a five bobble snows her they had seen him this vision line there has been passed grown of a core being killed supposedly cause its owner had coveted and have been sent to a quarantine center there's no way for dog to go with them and i just i just cry i just i just i do not t houses just crash because i i do not know what is next then is such om predictable and the do sing is e very clear sings we have to off hin several hours is equally harder thanyou might think as the whole city is closed out johnny calls lots of places before he finally finds an animal hospital that can take their snows er then they've to find somebody who is author to drive a car in shanghai with all the street shut down a friend knows some professional freight drivers and they help with that and then they have to find somebody who is allow to walk from their apartment building to the car to hand the dog to the driver it takes a government official to arrange that finally the dog is livened into the car he and johnny can start packing being somebody's on to come for the many minute to take them to the quarantine center but see was it that simple the trusts no one cam to us at first day or the second or the third some one calls from the shanghai see the see to follow up but did not send anybody other officials call or day's pass finally on the eighth day they do the daily half tass and they learn they do not have covet any more then that night before dinner they get the fungal the full car ye i forme us that it is time to go other the quarantine center yes in to hours we should go to the curb with our luggage for the us and that was what take us to the quarter center o no do you tell them that is fine we are cured we do not need to come yes is of course i i say it'll we self basis active to day there is no need for it and they say o you guys have to go what if you do not go no i have no idea really they decided t smart to go is now they have this buricratic thing that the action need to fix china has these car coats everybody has one under down red you have covet green if you do not have covet now there is were red meeting get would be able to go into any building store officers anywhere when lock down ended that is the thing without the corning center could cure for them and at that point s my salt is we will not a house social identity a not a house body exactly even if your bodies do not have covet your car coat has covet and and they can take carry at that it es after a week a you finally go to the quinine center what is it actually it is a his school chimnesium you you owe tat and this is sone i recited for my down pot cast and this corny centers for people with very you do not mind symptoms or no symptom taw most do not even need ha doctor

experience they had tony however noway at three the dog is travelled that he is germy perhaps you remember the creative offered by a ten year old at thebeginning today program about the way we spell the name of a certain fish yes ay o ammo wan it would be pronounce seller but its seem why fair point this ta story is about seven doing something about as logical as that spelling taking a ridiculous route to get where they need to go and by that i man at ridiculous rule that is different from the normal kind of ridiculous rule they usually take jam well went to californium to see it for herself i have not above average attachment to summon and obsession that began in college when i took a class with sammangoroo peter moll he is famous and summon circles trust me i think i was attracted to their epic migration and the major nature of their lives they are born wiggle round in a cold stream make their way to the motion then instinctual a install odds return to the place of their birth hurling their bodies of our water falls flesh voting dodging bare class simultaneously the can as their pushing towards their exact new an their exact port strip to lay legs and let the cycle begin again it is their dying to live i mean there is this whole industry of nature dacumanaris canard on dramatizing the species in their o to see films which feature the sound of reeling water in the background while a serious narrator to scribes their majesty it is aga listen ennoble we town mum to going her disown to push i strong be neon e it is a staple of nature word but the world as changed the climate has changed there is been increasingly hat temperatures fires drowned pollution at many of the rivers summon use for their migration have run dry we've been blocked by days that is why to day and californium many summon follow a article different course they make their way to the than not through rivers but inside a fleet of tinker trucks with human drivers of the hell when i first heard about trucking summon it seem to stomach a cold mechanical process the idea of summon stuck in traffic just made me feel sad nature had been highjack but i was also kind of curious i really wanted to see thus rude golfer tin cans and rubber bans and hormonal hack and person i decided to follow five silver trucks transporting about half a million adolescent summon on a hundred and twenty mile drives to the sammonsesco bay a migration that no longer starts with the sound of babbling water it is gall a different sound we one teasday afternoon i found myself at the mogalumny river fishatchry standing in front of a gas powered machine that looked it would be more at home on a construction site the hatchery is about an hour north east of majesty in the central valley it is girl and isolated and hot the sun immediately barns even in may mocalumnes sits next to a river that was one known for thriving summon and trout runs but was damned an the sixties to offset the lost wild populations the state built o hatchery and a parking look close to the old stream bed i should say hatches are controversial the fish raised in them are nod as prepared to survive in nature and when there release they breed with native summon compromising the jeans pool therefore people who think we should not have hatcheries at all but californium had them for decades to this point a really long time mocolumny is not a massive operation just a few bungalow and twenty concrete trenches packed with adolescent fish when i pull up i meet the guy responsible for getting the summon to the onions billet the hatchery manage greets me then walks me over to the s machine that snow critical toe summon migration we try to talk over its roar but an the e roiabills a big beard belly guy and is suspenders are not just forth they hold up genes which are tucked in the water proof boots he is introverted seems a little gruff but there is a tenderness in the way he talks about the fish in fact he tells me when these fish wore just born babies the size of finger nails giggling in the water he would sometimes sleep at the hatchery over night he wanted to make sure their water was the right temperature that the electricity stayed on he wanted to make sure they were okay it is comforting to know some one who cares is at the heart of this operation bill grew up in the area a fisherman his life revolves around raising these animals for harvest but he rarely by salmon in the store says he cannot afford at he only eats what he catches he mounted the moving platform of the crowded and started on on his job the crowded has a metal great that that below the water pushes the fish each the size of a hot dog to one end of the raceway then there sucked up into a to that connect at to the top of he top the two was translucent and i could see all these salmon pushing by like documents being transported and a pneumatic to i wonder how they felt if they felt what did they think of this sudden rush of movement the dramatic shift in their environment one minute shining in the sun the next drop in a big dark tanker there was no way to really now after bill filled each truck with brackish water and fish and bags of ice to maintain the temperature we pulled out of the hatchery goo baba we are on the road me end five hundred thousand fish and it is bier bills driving ahead in a pickup i follow behind the caravan the five trucks look any other feel tankers you would see on the highway they blunder seam essay you would never know how many lives were speed and by in the la next do it's amazing is that even though the fish are travelling by truck bill still be able to trace their way back to their birthplace the hat cherry the fish are imprinted with hatchery water bill told ma if they survive long enough at sea to reach spawning age they can use their sense of smell to re turn to him swimming up rivers till the hat the stream bed by the hatcher it takes two and a half hours till the trucks finally pulling to their destination fort baker nothing can happen until the get of night because of the summon release when it is light out sea rolls pelicans and cormorant will circle dive and swallow as many of the five hundred thousand fishes they can in front of us the golden gate bridge frames the sammonto so bay which glimmers against the sky line they cannot get very close to the water because the piers e historic lumbar bills says up a shoot which extends about a hundred feet e cane a truck to the edge of the pier then there is a twenty foot drop from the pier to the bay darkness finally closes en and bills signals that it is time as oblivious teenagers make out at the end of the pier a slow trickle of water drips down into the bay then a steady stream flows with a few of the small fish then a cascade a rush all at once crowded and alive the summon are falling in a flurry to the bay below crashing against the water then making small waves of thereon it is chaotic and beautiful but everything about that ti backup it feels crew and kind of rood to the animals i feel we do not even deserve salmon if this is the world we have made but at the same time and i hate that ism sang the it is not bad i blood summon and i want then to survive an a for and i have summoning californium this might be the only way bell repeats the process with each track four more

national hero do he treated and he did not just treat he treated something unsalable now there are certain things that's been deemed unstable by every society usually those things cut at the very route of that society incitement murder for example under mines the rule of law expressing support for enemies during time of war for example undermines the ability of the government to win victories see can tell lot about a society by the kind of speech it actually seeks to ban in ireland that speech amounts to criticism of open immigration on thirsty three cads and woman were stab in a life attack outside to school in ireland allegedly by n aljurian emigrant in his fifties with mental illness bystanders tackle the man but many iris citizens were fighting mat about the incident which they saw as indicative of the governments looseness about migrants entering the country from aril twenty twenty two to aril twenty twenty three ireland si sixteen year high of a hundred forty one thousand six hundred immigrants including forty thousand new cranial increasing economic and security combine with that highlevel of migration put ireland on the path to conflagration riders clashed with the police they set vehicles on fire they looted was the largest riot in ireland in decades thirty four people were arrested one police officer was seriously injured the prime minister the overadcar condemned the riots and quote waves of ignorance and criminality and see quote those involved have brought shame on dubbin brought shaman ireland and brought shame on their families and themselves this is not who we are this is not who we want to be and this is not who we will ever be what exactly did cinema greggerdo well he spent the past few days eating about the iris governments absurdly lacks in migration policies when the primeminister urged migrants to register to vote in ireland mac greggor twee t quote imagine a mega power nation allowing this absolute foolishness imagine the united states this is the most preposterous ridiculous scheming attempt tat gaining votes this government has attempted yet a real showing of the lack of care they have for the common iris citizen as it stands they do not have my vote shame on them before the stabbing attacks my greggor the to quote ireland we are at war after the attacks in response to the iris hard commission or claiming that quote hooligan faction driven by far right ideologies behind the riot my greggor twee to quote innocent children ruthlessly stab by a mentally deranged non national and blind ireland to day our chief of police had this to say on the riots in the aftermath true not good enough there is grave danger among us in ireland that should never be here in the first place and there has been zero action done to support the public in any way shape or form with this frightening fact not good enough make change or gateway ireland for he vice try god bless those attack to day we pray he then added you reap what you my rigor also treated that the stablish to be punished with torture and death he said quote any update on the well being of those stab to day absolutely terrific scenes all day my stomach is terming with no action being taken at all during these ever more frequent events literally zero action taken whatsoever how to we expect an end to this we need reform we need action my greggor did but a compliment for the brazilin immigrant would stop the life attacks dating quote the working man is the real hero bravo to our brazilin brother in ireland working hard burning a living contributing finish society this is it we love appreciate and respect greatly thank you much ciobinecio your forever free to eat and my establishment then he said quote we are not losing any more of our women and children to sick and twisted people who should not even be in ireland in the first place call it what you want we do not care he stated that violence by the way hand quite achieve nothing toward fixing the issues we face he continued i do understand frustrations however and i do understand o move must be made to ensure the change we need is ushered in and fast and he added ism in the process of arranging believe me i am anymore tactical and i have backing there will be changed in ireland mark by words the change needed now all this is passionate but it is standard anti mask migration rhetoric et it true rebuke from island's deputy priminister mac chat martin who called my rigor's statements wrote absolutely disgraceful and explain quote isolated voices that and voices that are essentially inciting heat and to it agree to some extent incitement are unacceptable what is happening now whole the iris police are now investigating economy rigor for supposed dissemination of online hatespeech what is that mean mi means that for the left in the west the unsalable thing also happens to be obviously true mask migration often presents a real threat to the cultural cohesion of nation and combined with generous welfare payments can endanger the social economic status of an entire country this is the unsalable thing it is unable and canada and some of rope and in these places it cannot be prosecutable because it is dangerous but why should those comments be unable why should they be dangerous because according to the left the world is made up of oppressors and oppressed there are no cultural differences they do not exist are not important only class differences exist and class differences our reflections of economic exploitation that can only be cured by artist redistribution's materialism diversity is our strength says the old saw never mind that according to hazard left wing sociologist sober butonum quote the only two things that go up as the diversity of your senses tract goes up our protest marches an television watching no no no diversity is our strength because the more migrants who arrive in your country a rich welfare state the more pressure there will be for class based change this is why we see the left wing nostrum the when a culture war takes place that cultures actually take it is cried by the bleat the real solidarity should be class based solidarity any other prospective must be outlawed the precious diversity is our strength must be protected it should be no surprise therefore that prime minis er f radar spent the week en calling for more hate speech was and at the same time also saying that the is rally hostages taken back miss had been quote lost not kidnapped lost he literally treated this is a a of enormous joy and relief for emilyhan that is one of the released hostages an ionized child who was lost has now been found in return we breath the massive give relief our prayers have been answered lost you do not you lose a puppy because four her radar to label compass what it is would be to acknowledge precisely the sorts of cultural difference the left cannot be allowed to acknowledge but here is the thing everybody knows those cultural differences exist and they're a problem westerners are beginning to openly acknowledge precisely those cultural differences and they should as i unhersialee has pointed out from two thousand nine to two thousand twenty one some three million immigrants have come to rope mostly from the idealist in africa two thirds were mail eighty per cent under the age of thirty five in surprisingly sexual coercion has become far more common place a cross rope in two thousand seventeen in germany for example sexual coercion and rape jumped forty one per cents between nineteen ninety seven and two thousand thirteen some one thousand four hundred children were sexually abused and other him in the aka the media refuse to even report the story because they believe that doing might causal quote spike in racism according to professor plexus jades report on the story quote several councillors interviewed believe that by opening up these issues they could be giving oxygen to resist perspectives that might in turn attract excrement political groups and threaten community cohesion remember noticing is what threatens community cohesion in the netherlands which ion hersalley had to leave thanks to threats from radical muscles of exactly the same milk who murder her fill making partner theovango into thousand four muscles represent at least five per cent of the population according to lent winter of the telegraph as of twenty seventeen non western emigrants in the netherlands and their children are quote half of welfare recipient but only eleven per cent of the total population among recent small refuge hes granted aside eighty per cents a on welfare no wonder then that overtime began girt wilder of the party for freedom finish first in last weeks parliamentary elections in the netherlands wilder has been a long time icon of the right in the netherlands he spent decades warning about the aslamicisation of the netherlands wilder was caught on tape this week and here is what he had to say the then i loco bots a algal sneevenr as rap up i have a message for ate muscles in the netherlands as memos you do not respect our freedom our democracy an our corvalues teeters one the find the rules of carbon more importance than our secular laws the benefit say there are many more of thanks research by professor humans shows their seven hundred thousand moans eves and my message them is get out is li furnaslonic country gilders as an anti mas migration advocate also once next it a netherlands eat from the heavy hand of the pro mass migration european union he wants reduction in the oversees aid budget slashing to e funding curbing entry to fore students he wants more police officers and hero tolerance of crime is not just gird gilders in the netherlands from gorge amazonian italy t victor organ and hungry to the fin's party in finding to the sweden democrats rope is bucking against mufti culturalism and rope should molt culturalism without assimilation to western values is a dramatic failure oddly though the media seems to continue to press the idea that opposing mass migration from cultures that actually cannaheat the west well that just means generalized the unifobia it is all about racism or is lamafobia whatever that is not true many of the same parties pushing against mass muscle migration our incredibly projewish for example and back israel in its turn conflict with come it certainly true a gilders who is an israel supporter as gorge many as victor organ as it turns out radicalmoslems do not news they are not antisemitic and it turns out being promalti culturalism while promoting mass migration of radical muscles very often links up with antisemitism while opposing mass migration very often amounts you fighting antisemitism when the mass migration is coming from countries where people generally hate news but again reporting the truth on these issues means undercutting he left wing li the culture is not the problem class is and that is the unstable forbidden thing but silencing is not can work for long as mogreggor is showing europeans are not going quietly into the mufti cultural light an attempts to ram europeans who want to protect or culture back into the diversity is our strength box are doomed to fail and meanwhile over in brain there ware more procomas protests over the weekend as always there is a giant pro israel protests over the be get it was mainly ignored by the media tat a hundred thousand people showed up it was perfectly calm is perfectly quiet no media coverage there was however a a wat of vile horseman taking place at the procomas protests here some the footage from the rooms protest at which again monuments were defaced people were climbing up on them e were slapping cameras out of the hands of cameraman here some the astral footage and then we will get to even the reporters recognizing had thesis mana er course mass pase trellis terrace era a a i the pipped whiles are assign out and in here come some of the a there is such comes on procomasnects or slapping cameras out of their and meanwhile releasing smoke boys in the center of onion is every week end in onion now one brutish reporter explained what i was to actually cover the procomas rallies it turns out that the people at these rallies are not vertically nice in the lastaurl i we the cameraman abauasaitici ti barely quit an a pagan experian an a gay on a caraway shouting ut as on is n a pro costing from he would not go way a titian vans civil atropin e just i county what eat but it was evil faces a mascara a grew of people a ran is it sharing as i have to say it was very intimidating i was she by the end of am now one of the things that is amazing about this is that triton right now is caving so these protestors as we saw just overtime last coup of leeks reck sumac laid off swell a brakeman who is the home secretary for mentioning the same sort of stuff than many other members of the populous right are mentioning from france to germany to sweden to finland to italy to hungry he later off because of course the populace cannot be allowed to save the unsalable thing heard baker points the out of er the waster journal he says the culture were in the cape between the people and the establishment and which the people for a heady moment seized control over matters emigration national sovereignty criminal justice and the right not to be ashamed of their race or cultural heritage has ended the establishment appears to have one last week to formal surrender papers were signed first reck sumac became prim minister a year ago after a pantsomin per romance by his ruling conservative party had asked to two predecessors in quick succession brought back into government avid cameroon the man who inadvertently fired the first shot in the populous revolt by calling the rough friend on brevet seven years ago if you wanted a caricature of the english establishment there is none better than mister cameroon mister cameroon is not just the man who in sister the finish people and worst membership in the on the pan of economic punishment he also busted of having inaugurated a golden age of relations between the up and the peoples republic of china now he is foreign secretary charge with leading brains international relations this of course coincided with soon getting rid of brakeman brakeman is a much less polls figure than than is mister cameroon after the political was of last earshot merge as the most outspoken advocate of a tougher approached emigration crime and the woke mine victors in the public set sectors staunchly proisrael she is also been extremely critical of the brush police force as tolerance of the offal violent procomost demonstrators on the streets in triton you can be arrested for silently saying a prayer within a few hundred yards of anabortionclinic be can call for the destruction of this real and praise it o filter and the boys in blue will insure that you are allowed to screamer bile unimpeded well she was fired and instead cameroon was elevated is that going to last is that going to be a thing that the right is going to withstand in brain i really really doubted because as it turns out polling dated tends to show that the rise of populism that is happening all over the world actually has less to do with the metric and much more to do wit the actual policies that is particularly true when it comes to emigration the vast majority of people in western countries are not particularly interested in importing vast numbers people who do not their country it is one thing to say as many people say that if people want a common to the united states for example for the economic opportunity assimilate to america values love the flag love the constitution great were were glad to have you in fact that trade you for a bunch people on the other side the political i on harpy but when it comes to people who are coming here and despise the country who openly hate the country or who are just here for the welfare benefits we exactly should those people be allowed in if the west ignores that there an get more of what they are being electorally the conservative party in brain is on efface the same fate that many of the art wing parties or seniority parties in threat of rope hate which is cooption by elements there are more wright wing than they are particularly on the emigration issue because here is the thing you can pretend the cultural differences do not exist but they do there is an entire european mine sat that suggests of course that cultural differences as we have suggested our a figment of the imagination that underneath everybody is exactly the thin they think the same way they all think westerners they all think western liberals to be more exact and that really if they evince sins antisemitism or or hatred of women or hatred of rights really that is because of their economic dispossession in the infamous words of brake mama at one point talking about terrorism what people really need is jobs if we were just able to get them some sort of economic growth this would magically cure the cultural differentiation better welfare benefits would make everything all better except that is not true and have ready knows that is not true not only is not it true it happens to be a recipe for both economic down turns as well as cultural decay people increasingly across rope are recognizing this and people had better recognize this because otherwise the badguides are going to win now the media are fully dedicated to this narrative of course the my are going to continued to press that narrative over and over and over that to point out that cultures are not immediately cognizable as the same is two be basis or horrifying but that that that simply cannot stand it simply can stand to camp with stand way and what what is to actually happening is as the media continue to promote that line as they continue to claim a moral equivalentbin everybody on earth in order to degrade the west more and more people are seen to erectly through it more more people recognize exactly what is the game that they are playing there becoming more more discredited and then they wine about hove they're being discredited to take the latest example over the we end there been the series of massive hostage exchanges between a compass and israel o this weak end salcomossreleas some of the two hundred forty hostages hat the terra group took during its mass killing sprain onoctober seventh there least thirteen is really hostages the first day that fridge thirteen more hostages on sturdy seventeen hostages on sundae bringing the currentotal to forty three hostages under the cur in brigand operations commons of sets release fifty total hostages the deal could be extended by one day for every ten more hostages released why did the deal happen in the first place lawn israel side the reason is pretty obvious israel values the life of it citizens in a way the compass simply does not in fact israel is willing to put its own soldiers that additional risk in order to achieve the return of civilians and by the way even in order to protect palistinian civilians many of whom participated in the octoberseve of the tat because again reminder israel has complete irosuperiority over gaze they could bomb the place into total submission if israel wanted to do for israel the deal was painful but clear try to get out as many hostages as possible even if compass would be temporarily strengthen meanwhile what is comose looking f ort whole they are looking for a breather compass has ben absolutely pummelled it is leadership class has been largely eliminated it is operations in northern goes have been devastated compass wants a few benefits from the temporary seas fire first a break to regroup possibly plane to operations second more fuel to enhance the possibility of their survival and this is the most important one they want time to try to convince the world the israel ought to leave them in tact that israel campaign against compass ought to stop i gain that last point is the most crucial commas once the rest of the world to buy the narrative that compass is in fact a reasonable actor or as we have said the left wing notion that compass israel there no different underneath all the same it is just exploitation it just colonization all the rest now that is a city hard cell after you hang glide into israel and murderrly three hundred people at a music festival go house to house to burn babies their ribs and raped their sons and slaughter civilians at well because here is at that commas did not even just engage in murder of civilians they engaged in some of the worst atrocities in modern history according to one his rally reserve combat dramatic is report by the washington post he found the corpses of two than age girls in their bedrooms quote one was on a bad her arm was dangling from that the bed frame her legs were bare with bruises sh he a bullet hole in the chest neck area the other was lying on the floor on her stomach her legs spread her hands pulled down toward her knees there is a liquid on her back that look seamen so shot in the back of the head according to a volunteer at the sura military morgue which was analyzing the bodies of the slain quote we saw many women with bloody underwear broken bones broken legs broken pelvises another witness described the gang rape at the novel race followed by the murder of victim quote he did not pick up his hands he shot her well inside her ya is tuff to turn commas into israel moral equivalent but the goodness for commas they never have to do their unsealing as always their fellow travellers in the coalition of the oppressed including their cheer leaders in the legacy me dead to it for them the legacy media have no regrets in their procomas coverage over the course tore last yew weeks in fact they admit as much here for example was the baby sees international editor blaming that the baby we is bee doing a stellar job despite provoking inter national riots on behalf of compass thanks to lies and false reporting about supposed is rally human rides violations there is the baby see international letters and we have done an amazing job a gotmusky about the hospital i sense to sit was ye the baby see was criticized heavily fits reporting a that thing tells what happen that night and in a bluntly we cut getting your information undo you regret anything that you said that night a broken i spot mid evening he dons e question how i did regret one thing a imposing because i think i thing as mason the did not rise dustmen but you said that building a been flagons oh ye i a ta wrong because is looking at the pictures i li but i count we was a square that a pip to be flaming anal s ones and there is a w o avoid in the middle and it was i think it as a pity thing from a ran and y we have to piece together what we see the media are not backing down from their procomase of propaganda not one iota to even as this hostage deal when through for example one el be sea reporter again brutish reporter asked in is really spokes person whether the unevenness of the exchange remember here is the exchange israel supposed to get back fifty of its own hostages and their releasing one hundred and fifty terrorists such a three one ratio of israel releasing three terrors for every innocent is daily this reporter literally asked he is really spokes person whether that exchange rate represented israel disregard for palistinian life because it was a three for one rate i was thinking to a hostage negotiation this morning he made the comparison between the fifty hostachsis hostages the mamas has promised am promised to release i supposed to the hundred and fifty prisoners that a politicians that israel has said that it will release and he made the comparison between the numbers and the fact that just this a not think that politician lives aboliitis highly as is radios that is an astonishing accusation if we could release that ones presonough for every one hostage we would obviously do that we are operating in horrific circumstances we e not choosing to release these prisoner tho have blood on the hands we are talking about people who have been convicted of stopping and shooting attacks notice the question of proportionality does not interest polestinian support is when they are able to get more of that prisoners out but really it is outrageous to suggests that the fact that we are willing to release prisoners in the convicted of terrorism stances more of them than we are getting our own into sent children back some you suggest that we do not care about politician life really that is a disgusting accusation it is a particularly stupid question but the most common idiotic massage of the week was actually parroted all over the legacy media that somehow there is moral equivalent between israel releasing terrorists and comossraleasing show is is something legacy media are actively promoting let us start with the actual fact every single person compass is releasing is an innocent person every single person israel is releasing is a criminal here is a chart of the palistonian released prisoners grouped by their actions fifteen per cent through stones at is daily soldiers eight per cent were involved in staying attacks ten per cent were involved in shooting attacks six point four per dentin other violence terrorist contact eleven per cent s terrorist attempt fourteen point four per cent twelve point four percent male of hotels ten points on percent explosives only eleven per cent others but even those people were associated with terrorism any the it is made a case who exactly are these convects again are not to just tell you from the chart here is the video of some of these terrorist who release what they actually did here is one woman a show release she is an innocent woman right an scent one being held hostage by israel om except for she actively stabs this police o watch the tape she goes after with the knife here is another here is another woman she is carrying a knife above her head trying to stab a police officer here are two terra chasing police officer it knives here is the police officer here is a passing in just stabbing round o person there is one of the terrace literally taking his man crashing into a police officer and then trying to stab him a car attack jumps out wit the knife a knife attack if these these are the people that the media are portraying as equivalents to these rally hostages being released again these r people who are literally attempting to stab and murder people that is who is in is rally prisons now those terrors far being released are immediately being greeted with walks cheering by commossuporters not in the gosh stripe in sudan marry the west bank this was tape from kamala this weekend there literally firing fireworks and celebration at terror being released back into their community because these are heroes in the palsinian community people who attempt to murder news not just police us lie random news in fact how innocent were the people where release well the released prisoners themselves immediately dawn comas head gear and they pledged to renew their terrain efforts again they're literal they literally put on the compass head bands and and then swore that they would rejoin the fight whose our terrorists where an comasgier mas celebration f prerelease of terrorists i get and here are am here is one of the persons who was released calling forbore jewfish blood a state this lady who is a terrace she is an we are the sword of hammed at dive he is the a military leader of compass s that is on the one side meanwhile here is some tape of his rally children being released to their parents if those parent survived some of these kids have no parents because come ass actively murdered them can seems are kids being delivered back into the arms of their family after being held hostage for fifty days exactly the same exact moral equivalents comedian exactly the same the is cycled violence in all that it is ridiculous in sick to make any sort of equation here but of course that the entire game n the media or playing by the way some these hostages for example want one of these one of these hostages she was told upon her release that her father is still being held by comas can wonder there is a four year old child in america who's released both her parents a dad and there both murdered by compass she she had to be told that upon release ism sure that her parents are did now can you see the difference between the two sides by the way eve in mass release the hostages they still play games families were supper there stilling separated the international red cross was originally to night agreed upon access the remaining hostages hostage release has been decade into the very last minute hostages were told to pose for the cameras by compass terrorists there's some of that footage we he can see in this idea an literally say keep wave keep waving their telling them to keep waving and smiling for the cameras gay believe were not comes propagandist spent the pecan trying to argue that this footing right here of the little girl being released was it actually evidence that comas had treated these prisoners decently that they were really really happy with their captors wo mean except for them being held at gun point for fifty days and i an essentially queasy starved and essentially a in one o themes easily died here is one of the hostages she is an eighty four your old woman in such worship should be met of act immediately she is currently in the icy you an ten an a threaten stay resin at that she a sheen are condition i the coaster f their very nice people how did the media play the obvious moral and balance against part of the broader a tamest morally equivocate between the last and his enemies how i they do this well they tempted to claim that israel was also holding innocent people rather than terrace now's who have shown that is not true but here is a sky news reporter making just that claim then you would agree that to day was given the circumstances a success we sol the these five kicking at seven o'clock and that we sol the hostages release lace re the often and of course you have now release thirty nine holistenan women and children to o we ai don't the a a o a as to all to n to i and tot that thing because it is they release children an we release children an say done except that the we have a two year old a a a a four year old a give order an on yearly how can we compare that with a mind who is sixteen or seventeen years old who is involved in this stewing at that or o or a throwing a picture bold or the other acts of violence you can say women and mines but to compare that to the shady two year old i think it is the bridge too far that is the bridge so farts sick but unfortunately this is what the media do and your times headline for example obscured that a woman in this particular picture is actually a terrorist o was the headline is a disfigured woman whose cases become well known is among the palicinians released wile disfigured who dis wow that terrible disfigured woman being he by the rallies terrible well ism there is only one problem the reason that she is disfigured is because she attempted to blow up a carbon and the battery said hid her that is the reason she she disfigured herself she dis figured herself she is arrested after her car exploded at a check point did it did just did just mainly explode there randomly explode or was it a carbon here is a seen anjournalis similarly claiming moral parity between small children released by commas thanks to israel military pressure and palcinians released by israel in order to free those children a is made authorities blastoff roads corralled the media into one location an brought to the palesthinians in a through the actor when they received them and than only allowed family makes to come in very limited single file and individual cause and as a reason for that because unlike a the images of celebration where you which she might have seen from royal an the west bank here in was tereslem is radio authorities were better able to indorse the dictate o the far right national security minister who has who has gleamed the prisoners release to day as taxis when not just it he sad any pale them in who celebrates will themselves be change says taxis i mean just to break dot break break that down a little bit there is no grounds to call the taxis because by israel own reckoning those thirty in prisoners we a fifteen miners ten of whom were only charge in twenty four women twenty three what sight were dean not charge and ten of the miners with his handful shot u the for for terrorism that is why there were detained for stabbed attacks and throwing mols of curtail of course the asinine graded did the same thing using as her model a victim when ached a mansard accusing israel of taking children is pe a double use engaging abduction rape humiliation torture murder of palceanans she treated out israel the only country in the world that keeps children is prisoners of war it that children is prisoners for abduction rape humiliation torture murder of past insane years in years before october seven achmadale monster abducted by the rally occupation the age of twelve has en cured solitary confinement hundreds of paining children remain detained suffering this daily tails i here is an natural the doe of what echoed did that would be echoed chasing news told a am tordagasstation running into the station with the knife looking for somebody to stab and then them settling eventually on a they the eventual is settled in the other personnel with settled on the murder of a a thirteen year old boy that is the game its always the same game you pretend moral parity between israel and its enemies to ignore all evidence in order to accomplish this this allows for the continuation of that egregiously false narrative that israel elimination is legitimacy goal or the israel ought to be forced to make concessions to terrorist grows which are by the way the only governing powers in the west bank and the gaze strip fat for example is the military wing of the palstinian authority it run by manhood abas that is suppose to be israel peace pardner that is the person jobidon wants to see running at gas after commas well over the weaken the secretary general of fatality central committee she burajub stated that october seventh was quote in act in the context of the defensive war are people are waging and thatcquote commas is part of our political and social fabric and of our struggle there involvement is important rub also said that commas is onset quote awarded the goal of the israel right to integrate israel into the region without resolving the palstinian issue chased on the principle of peace in exchange for peace those are the moderates the non moderates spend the week and murdering and mutilating the bodies of two supposed collaborators with israel there are some of the images of that a atrocity is literally palistinians they they executed two men and mutilated their bodies in front of giant crowds mutilated them and they hand them ut people shouting cheering notice the telephones on notice the cheering and here and again lies the problem if there is no moral parity there can be no two states solution under these circumstances not remotely not with comas now at the p now i palsinian is loncihad now with any of the parties on the table and that is not likely to change any time soon what are the legasymediate to do will thy eve a few options left when the narrative that comas is kind to the old women in kids they have kidnaped don't fly a fares they can argue the commas has no agency after all their realize victims of circumstance in fact as it turns out israel is to blame for commas after all only the news have agency thus according to steefhendrics and pajama blush of the washington post by ways it than all that is disgrace itself beyond measure as a commas propaganda wallet during this conflict they say the real false here is wait for it benjamin it tinamous the scaly priminister according to the washington post nittinahuan commasquote found each other useful for their own purposes nintinaho pursuit o strategy that did not disrupt the status duo of divided palstinian population leaving comas to ruling gaze and the rival palistinian authority in the west bank weave aside the fact that had israel moved to depose comas over the pastwenty years the world would have condemned them fort in fact overtime israel went in to clean out commas actors the world cons embed them leave aside the fact that the palstinian authority currently allies with commas in is also a terrorist group the insane bigotry of suggesting that the news are responsible for radical mule atrocities because they did not defend those radical muzhiks while you are currently arguing by the way that israel ought not tolan comas is totally mine bowling just to get the logic straight be is bad because he did not oppose compass be therefore must not oppose compass right now can then well that argument does not work you can argue as the pressmen doing for weeks that israel we obligation against compass its just as evil as compass is original attacks thus we seen story after story condemning israel for not having magic weapons that only hiterrus even wheelers terrace hide among civilians pushing this idiotic argument it center of chrismurphy of connecticut here hit was over the pecan on stated the union we i stand by what i said i do believe that the level of civilian harm inside gaze has been a unacceptable and is unsustainable i think there is both a moral cost to this many civilians innocent civilians children often losing their life but i think there is a strategic cost ultimately hamoswell get stronger not weaker in the long run if all of this civilian death a allows them to a recruit more effectively finally a inside gaze well i mean obviously obviously he is an expert on this sort of stop and an if israel does not use its magic weapon well then israel really really bad naturally murphy then connects this idiotic argument with the argument that israel ought o make concessions the palstinans after all which is what they did in goa and are now being blamed by the washington post for doing here is murphy saying all the only way out of this is for israel to give more after they had all their citizens slaughter the only future that guarantee the survival of a jewistate in the mittaleast and that is a palistinian state a benjamin anna believed that you could ignore the palstinians that you could try to squash their desires for estate and ultimately that would bring piece to the region in israel that is just not the case ultimately a the next government is going to have to put us back on a path to have a palstinin state that is not easy but it is the only way fort for israel is the only way forward for long turn piece y give questionmhen he says it is not easy the reason it is not easy is because no palistinian govern mental body has ever accepted a piesteal ever in history slow was a framework for the development of a piecemeal and it was then reject id by the palisinian's multltimes now the passed smelt's but it does not have to again it is all merely the predict to a more subtle argument that israel should be pressure to stop now if israel does stopped to be perfectly clear about this the hostage feel becomes awful in ref respect israel cannot stop israel has to wipe out compass if comas emerges in take israel will be seen as weak in decisive absolutely incapable of defending their own citizens israel has retinal destroyed a lot of the military power of terror syrups in surrounding areas but long as those groups revive the immediately claim victory and then they regrow israel cannot allow that what is more israel s to the beginning at not the end of this battle nit is now who set over the week and quiet we have three goals for this war t limit any compass returning our hostages ensuring gas dis not become a that to the stay of israel again the conflict in gosh is not over but it is not just in gaze is i is going to have to over the coming years take on and destroy yes ballad on its northern border their currently thirty thousand is rallies the have left their homes in northern israel because the are under the umbrella of a terrors threat created by has ball that is the baronial back teragroup that has right now to hundred thousand rockets minimum pointed it israel perhaps fifty thousand with have actual sophisticated targeting systems cause ballad cannot be left to stoop for that long especially given the randan development of a nuclear weapon iron develops t nuclear weapon they simply handed over the was ballad and then is ball has the ability do pretty much what they want and then there is the called west bank where the palicinan authority remember israel supposed car partner the p a is pathetically weak israel is going to have to engage in continuing counter in surgeons e tactics both gaze and the west bank in definitely in order to insure safety and security willie west allow is real to do what it have to do to protect its own security that is the big question moving forward and that question is gain connected to the broader question that many people are asking now in the west will the west t do what it has to do to protect itself and its own security from the threat of radical is lam particularly in the form of mass migration this is it it is your final day to save on

fridge meanwhile the question is to whether west is going to stand up for itself again that remains in open one not just internally but with regard to foreign policy for example when it comes to foreign policy the a sumption of weakness by the west is what drives america enemies to becomes stronger and more militant this is why presumably over the week and china's military said it had driven locusts worship from waters it claims in the south chivaree and accuse the united states of quote being the biggest destroyer of piece and stability in the region so that means that that meting between shuchianpang and jrobidon went absolutely swimmingly in san francisco it was not seen his weakness by he chines at all to put out a som rambutan president of the united states a barely sentient person a table cloth to to actually talk to the chines dictator china stater people's daily quoted senior cereal tiara sunset he spokes person for the people's liberation army southern theater command as saying the guided missile destroyer yeas hopper had entered china territorial waters legally on sturdy it said the incident occurred near the parasol islands which china all the ssh islands ten sharply criticized the united states claiming tho us had violated chines sovereignty tensions camping up with china that of course is no surprise meanwhile america sailors did do something amazing over the week end the the tanker that was seize by remind rebels last week s not is daily tanker but it does have investment from in is daily billion that tanker as seemed by the soothes last week will now apparently it was freed by us worship and now it is safe that is good base if the international waterways are impinged upon by pirates and terrorist all of your constrain go up pretty dramatically at home again in unstable world is a dramatically worse world for america citizens and america being the global hedgehog is the only party at is capable of providing safety in stability all over the world for economic trade lanes for example but the thing that under cuts that is continuing silly sallying over things shudcomas survives to democrats continue radical democrats continue to push joining into pressuring israel encompass according to the washington post earlier this month a group about twenty distrust white house staffers requested a meeting with present bidnstop advisers as his rills warren fossa entered at six week the diverse group of staffers divers had it is three man issues they wanted to discuss with white house chief of staff tons former advisor needed done and deputy national security viserjohn finer they wanted to know the administrations strategy for curbing civilian deaths the message plans sent on the conflict and its postwar vision for the region sense done and finer listen respectfully but foreparts to spend the felt they fell back on familiar talking points ait a white house official familiar with a meeting again what this is is an attempt to drive bidneanso the arms of comas that is the and biding is susceptible to the sort of stuff he is apparently there was a m there is a private meeting that he held with prominent muscle america and a he apologize to members of the muscle community why ell because at one point he would been asked about the numbers coming out of gaze with regard to civilian death and he is had in believe the numbers coming from moss which is the proper answer giving the comose routinely lives about said numbers and apparently began apologize for those commons quote ism sorry ism disappointed in myself i will do better a this pathetic it is pathetic it remains pathetic but again this is a way for the radical left inside the by administrations pushedubi that is can have significant ramifications for the america people because a weak america on the world stage is a real problem for america security this by the way you just another reason why jobidons poles you getting worse and worse according to politico president incident poll numbers keep getting worse among the latest service this month from thirteen supper posters bidonsposition is worse then their previous poles in all but two of those poles ad while poles suggest most of the to movement comes from voters abandoning biding the dona trump is also start to gain seem trumps vote share in the national polling averages hirer now that at any point in the last year the state level data are just as striking in addition to new york times manta poles within last wee can halve other serves have shown trumpahad by eight in arizona and five in michigan again he he is losing sum young voters right now trump according to the enbusenews poll is shall leading bison among voters younger than thirty five forty six to forty two that is within the margin of error for that group but bottom line is that jobidon is losing approval why because he feels the world is on fire if feels the worlds on firebirds jobidon is week and when weakness is evidence by the world ill turns out that people do really bad things meanwhile ye you can see the writing on the wall a little but here apparently they are a huge car thirty nine members of congress who have already said they are planning to leave their seats twenty five of those members of congress are democrats lot of democrats are seeing the writing on the wall in the next house election especially if jordan has reverse coattails mean if he is the guide the top the ballot and he under performs that is a massive massive problem for democrats meanwhile donate trump went to south caroling an attempt to blunt the momentum that like hale has beenattempting to build and tom he went t this college write boat in south caroling and he was widely cheese who is funny to watch as people on twitter tried to treat this as dona trumping good ah ism not sure you are watching the same take the restpusor o novercal lot of of there and in south caroling downs trump is a pretty popular guy if dona triumph as runs this campaign he literally walks out and stands there he will win really that is a the us to do just be quiet walk out stand there leave if he does that he will win because the truth is the electric is treating trump believe ore not they are treating trump luck generic republican surely that that is the real answer here yes trump as hi negatives with democrats does every generic republican pretty much everybody is treating trump because they have seen him before and they know what he is and they know he says wild stuff and the also know he is can of a generic republican politician in turns of his actual policy despite all the wild statements and the public is treating him that generic republican against jobidon wins the next election cycle and everybody starting to realize that pretty quickly here o gat in just one second we will be getting to this insane story ceric shove who is the person convicted for the killing of gorge flood was

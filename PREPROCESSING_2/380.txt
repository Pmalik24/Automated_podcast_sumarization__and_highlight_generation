welcome to the hubermanlaponces of science science pay to e for i m inter supermen and o you professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor gene to doctor gene pop is a professor in the department of integrated biology and physiology at the university of californium loss evangelists her laboratory an research focuses on the relationship between sleep and learning in particular how specific patterns of brain activity that are present during specific phases of sleep impact our ability to learn and remember specific types of information for instance procedural information that is how to perform specific cognitive or physical tasks as well as in coding of emotional memories and discarding emotional memories indeed her research focuses on how specific phases of sleep can act as its own form of tomato there be discarding the emotional tones of memories in addition her laboratory focuses on how specific phases of sleep impact things the release of growth hormone growthormon of course plays critical rolls in metabolism and tissue repair including brain tissue repair and therefore has critical rolls in vitality and longevity today you will learn many things about the relationship between sleep learning emotionality and growthormon one basic but very important take away that you will learn about to day which was news to me is that it is not just the duration and depth of your sleep that matter but actually getting to sleep at relatively the same time each night insures that you get adequate growthormon release in the first hours of sleep in fact if you require let say eight hours of sleep overnight but you go to sleep two hours later than your typical bedtime on any given night you actually miss the window for growthormon release that is right getting growthomon release in sleep which is absolutely critical to our immediate and longturm health is not a prerequisite of getting sleep even if we are getting enough sleep as doctor to explains their critical brain circuits and indignant that is hormone circuits that regulate not just the duration and depths and quality in timing of sleep but when we place are bout of sleep that is when we go to sleep each night plessermine is about a half hour or strongly dictates weather not we will experience all the health promoting including mind promoting benefits of sleep today's episode covers that and a lot more in substantial detail you will learn for incense how to use sleep in order to optimize learning as well as forgetting for those things that you would to forget during today's episode doctor genome shares critical information about not just negro science but physiology and the hormone systems of the brain and body that strongly inform mental health physical health and performance by the end of to day's episode you will be far more informed about sleep and how it works the different rolls it performs and you will have several new actionable steps that you can take in order to improve your mental health physical health and performance before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electorolike drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar w salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called grants in fact in order for your grants to function properly all three electrolihts need to be present in the properties and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits and cognitive and physical performance element contains a science bactrlectrolike ratio of one thousand milligrams that one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that drink element elements doctor slash huberment and now for my discussion with doctor gene to doctor gene to welcome thank you have really been looking forward to this conversation because ism familiar with your work and i know that many people are going to be excited to learn about your work as it relates to sleep as it relates to problem solving creativity addiction and craving relapse and a number of other important topics to start things off i would love for you to educate us a bit about this sling that we are all familiar with and yet very few of us under stand which is sleep and if you would could you describe the various phases of sleep that exist what distinguish them and perhaps shameless within the contact of what would a perfect nights sleep look calla how long would it last more o less and what would the biology look but what is a perfect night sleep a ye that is a great question i sleep is really different from waveform us and in fact cannot be replaced by any state of wakeful this that we have been able to come up with far am our train chemistry is completely different and in the different stages of sleep which there are is non ragman ram are the two major states of sleep and every animal we studied far seems to have both of the states a anyway those two states are entirely different from one another two and even within non ram there are three states stage one which is which you sleep in to when you first falling a sleeps dosing there is kind of an interesting rhythm that goes on in the rain is and of a fast game them and then the stage too which is a really lo state we sort of use to ignore sleep resets because it is a transient state we seen wakefulness in the deep stage three slave sleep which is the most impressively different and then a and between that and red sleep stage to it'll talk a lit habit more about and then the deep slave sleep state which is when big slave sleep through our brain and now we realize that it cleans our brain a one of the things that those big slaves do as cleans are rain and does other really important things to restore us a from the day of wakefulness and then red sleep which is the most popular because when we have the most active dreams and a when you wake up someone out of red sleep though almost always report having dreams something really bazaar that is called remsleep rap and i movement sleep those are the for stars of sleep of human sleep and we cycle through them every ninety minutes or when we go to sleep say ten ten thirty eleven o'clock a our first red sleep period comes about a hundred and five minutes after we fall asleep and a last about twenty minutes actually it comes about ninety five minutes and last ten or fifteen minutes and then a we start over again and we have about five of those per night for perfect night sleep four or five something that a perfect night sleep is seven a half eight hours there was a really great study that a put people in at semi darkened room with nothing but the bed for twelve hours every day for a month and what people did inishaley is because because we are in a sleep deprived nation is that they slept a lot more than usual ten or eleven hours of the twelve and then they leveled off after week or two to about eight hours in fifteen minutes of sleep you actually cannot over sleep and we had nothing else to do but sleep and they would round off to on average eight hours in fifteen minutes an night and then spend the rest e time twitting their thus humming tunes juster day dreaming i will not get back to the contra o perfect nights sleep but ism entreat by this idea that people cannot over sleep ism often asked whether or not we can get too much sleep and whether not sleeping too long long excuse me can make us groggy the next to day a is there anything too that and how does one determine how long they should sleep a on average on average yet well at that is interesting because different people need seem to need different amounts of sleep but we do not really even know exactly what sleep is for what they need is kind of it is mercy mercy am we do know a lot of things that sleep i does and out for us but we do not know how long those things take how long we need to sleep is also just a big question mark but some people do not feel rested until they have slept nine hours since some people do not feel rested after three or four and a half a but most people if they consistently deprive themselves of sleep that they are only sleeping four four and half hours and night build up a cognitive deaf as it that just builds up over time them more nights you have with sleep to deprivation the more cognitive deaf as that you have and you need sleep again to sleep more to recover now the question you had about am you over and you always the i sleep to the point where it is too much that we i growing up am when i was an high school a mi grolfrend's dad hand this belief that no one should sleep in pass six i am he would wake all the there were two children in that home he would wake up the kids in that house yet to sing against over see n regardless of when people when who sleep an i w sought that was am an interesting mentality m at terrible actually be as what that will do as it will put you make you sleep yer the next night to get to bed on time it will builds up your homeostatic need if you wake up too early but am i do not think you can over sleep but people who sleep a lot people sleep over nine hours it is probably indicative of some other problem because in fact if you have a a lot of different conditions this will cause you to sleep a lot more probably because what it does as t interferes with your efficient sleep the efficiency of your sleep if you find yourself sleeping consistently nine hours less every night then you might want a consult the doctor about maybe what else it might be it could be cancer it could be am sleep apnea that is effects a lot of people it could be that your sleep is super inefficient because your snoring a lot more than or your waking up a lot more than every night see you might want to sleep study just to see how you sleep is and then see what else might be causing you to sleep much and that would not be if somebody is sleeping nine or ten hours it every once in a while you mean if they are consistently sleeping from more than nine a always feel they needed in order function cognitively the next day if it might be that your sleep is just not efficient and you might one look into why that that is the case interesting forgive me for the anecdote but i cannot resist years ago i went to an act punctures and you gave me these red pills of which i do not know what they contain a but i took them because you told me they would help with my sleep and i would fall asleep about thirty minutes after taking them and i would have incest incredibly souse me vivid dreams and it'd wake up for r five hours after having gone to sleep feeling completely rested something the never really experience injustice on consistent basis i want to do aspect on these pills i all have no idea what was in them what errand if you aspect o the el exact somepinl thought am that perhaps they had go b gamahidrocs and beuterane which is by the w any legal drug it can kill you it is not it not something you want m but anyway if if ever someone can figure out what the red pills were a the very y am till and this is not a red pill of the of the other sort red pill this is just the red sleep pills don sing a could have been even a plociba effect a placebos extremely strong o although i do not know there was really something to these red i we e i shot out to you punctures and the eastern medicine am but to return the sight to this idea of the architecture of a perfect night sleep you said am we fall asleep the first ninety minutes of sleep red sleep rapid i movement sleep will arrive at about ninety five minutes in yeses that mean that the rest of that ninety minutes is consumed with slow wave sleep at non men sleep and what about the sleep where we are lightly a sleep and we might have a dream that has us somehow thinking about movement or that we jolt our sans awake that often happens early in the night it yet that is the first stage stage one and stage to sleep and stage two sleep is really cold because that has something called sleep spindles and cate complexes and what sleep spindles are er a a little of activity that is ten to fifteen hurts in frequency it is a conversation between the alums in the quarter the fallen as is the gateway to consciousness and the no cartel sing processes all our cognition and am it is it is these spindles the called sleep spindles and if you wake up out of that state you will often report a dream a hallucination style dream it will not be a long dream report you have out of red sleep but it will be some hallucination state and during while we are falling asleep whence the reason we call it falling asleep is because in stage on in state to our muscles are relaxing and if there's part of our brain that is conscious of enough to sort of recognize that relaxation will feel we are falling and will jerk awake often that hallucination s called hypnicachic hallucination will feel ill e include some falling aspect pet will wake up out of that is really interesting o wait not long felt that sensation of almost la dropping back into my head am much that if i elevate my feet just slightly an it tilt my head back just slightly ism in order to go to sleep y find ti fall asleep must much faster interest it does feel as even men a fall almost in to do backwards summers all was you really the the sensation and usually because it proceeds falling deeply us ye that is really interesting a some body has to do a study of elevated feet and tether there is a little bit on a body position and sleep and some of the wash out that will talk about early in the night am yet these lighter stages of sleep less japan eye movement sleep what can we say about the dreams that occur during the say first and second am youknow ninety minutes cycles sleep are they quite different thin the patterns of sleep and dreaming that occur later in the night or toward morning well look hae that is an interesting question there is a lot of fascist to it a there is me evidence that the first four hours of sleep are very important for memory processing a and in fact if you have learned something knew that day or have experienced a new a sensory motors experience then your early sleep dreams will incorporate that experience much more than the later sleep dreams a later is that memory gets consolidated from the early structures which are the hippocampus deep in the temporal lobe to the quarter in a distributed fashion that memory seems to move from that hippocampus to the quarter and also the dreams that incorporate that memory also move later in the night a nobody knows why but it does there was a great study by cedar bebeeru who studied the consolidation of memories from the cartel from the hippocampus to the quarter in a rat across the period of a full day sleep because rat sleep in the daytime and he found that each subsequent rem's sleep period moved that memory from the hippocampus to the fir first aria that protects tit in the second aria than the third aria and you can see the memory moving a through that throughout the sleep cool period very wools i aver read that study am there is number of different forms a social with the different stages of sleep we know the megaton and is a hormone of the night time of night time an makes a sleepy a what about grothormon release when does that occur during sleep grothoman release happens all day long and all night long but the deep slowesleep that you get the very first sleep cycle a is when you get a big bolts of grothomon release and in men and women equally and if you miss that first deep slow sleep period you also miss that big bolts of grothomon release and you might get ultimately across the day just as much over all grothomon release but androchonologists will tell you that big bolides do different things than a little bit eked out over time that is when we know there is also a big push to synthesize protein prolines a that is when the proline synthesis part that builds memories for example in our brain happens in that first cycle of sleep you do not want to miss that especially if you have learned something really big and needs needs more synaptic space to income it how would somebody miss that first nitid driving themselves yes do let say i normally go to sleep at am ten him a and then from ten to eleven thirty would be this first pase of sleep in that is when the grotto big boys of grothromon would be released does that mean that if i go to sleep instead at eleven thirty or midnight that i miss that first pase of sleep yet why is not the case that i get that first have of sleep just simply starting later it is a beautiful clock that we have in our bad that knows when thing should happen and it is everycell in our body has a clock and all those clocks ore normally synchronized and the circa circadian clocks i synchronized and ourselves are ready respond to that growthorma release at a particular time and if we miss it and it is a time in relation to the marmelotonean also if you miss it ye you might get some growtharman release but it is occurring at a time when that your clock has already move to the next phase and it is it is just a clocking i do not think em we can overstate the importance of what you just describe and to be honest despite knowing a bit about the sleep research in circadian biology this is the very first time that give ever heard this that if you normally go to sleep it a particular time and growthhormon is released in that first phase of sleep that you cannot simply initiate your sleep bout later and expect a capture that first phase of sleep ye that is incredible and i think important and as many listeners are probably realizing also highly actionable what this means is that we should have fairly consistent bed times in addition to fairly consistent wake time yes out right exactly and in fact one of the best markers of good nor logical health when we get older is consistent bedtimes well of i do not want a back track but i did write down something that i think is a important for me to resolve or for you to resolve man asked this people that sleep nine hours or more perhaps that reflecting an issue a some under lying issue perhaps is am being a tea major or an adolescent and undergoing a stage of of a development where there is a lot of bodily in brain growth in exception to that because yes i do not recall sleeping ton when i was a teen air had a ton of energy but i know a feu teen agora and they sleep playa i dell just sleep and sleep and sleep and should we let them sleep an slay and sleep i ant sleep o so that is the one exception what about a babies o ka it when when you are developing something in your brain are the rest of your body you really need sleep to help organize that an mean sleep is doing really hard work in organizing our brains and and making it develop right and if we deprive ourselves of sleep we will actually also just i i said we have a daily clock we also have a developmental clock and we can miss a developmental window if we do not let ourselves sleep extra we need to what other things inhibit growth someone release or other components of this first stage of sleep in other words if i go to sleep religiously every night at ten p m are the things that i perhaps do in the preceding hours the preceding day invest coffin or alcohol that can make that first stage of sleep less effective even if ism going to sleep at this same time alcohol d finitely will do that because alcohol is a red sleep suppressed and even suppresses some of that stage two transition to red with those sleep spindles and those sleep spindles we did not talk about their function yet but they're really important for moving memories a to our quarter it is a unique time when our hippocampus the sort of the ram of our brains a writes it to a hard disk and which is the quarter and there it is a unique time when they are connected if you do not want a miss that you do not want miss remsleep when is also o part of the consolidation process and a scheme a changing process and alcohol in the minnow before we go to sleep we will do that and tell we have metabolized alcohol and put it out of our bodies it will effect our sleep badly probably fair to say no ingestion of alcohol within the for to six hours proceeding sleep given the half life given her at all r at all would be better but i are some people refuse to go that want maybe a little bit of o k i do not know what the dose response is that a there a studies out that you can look at it we are still in the first stage of sleep and i pall dies for slowing town but it sounds i gets in incredibly importantfirst has of sleep what about the second and third ninety minute blocks of sleep is or anything that makes those am uniquewhat what is their signature a besides the fact that they come second and third and the night there is more and more red sleep the later the night we get a there is also a change in harmony in o the grothorman and a monotone and levels are string to decline but other harmony are picking up it is a really different stage that you also do not want to short change ourself in and i think that is the stage many studies are showing that those of the times in sleep when the most creativity can happen that is when our dreams can incorporate and put together old and new things together into a new way and am and our scheme a built during that time so that we can change our minds best during those faces of sleep could you lateral it more on schema a yet no one i do not think any one on this sarcasm as ever discuss schema ism a little but familiar with scheme o from mi am courses on psychology but it is been a while if you just a refresh can every well it it is still a a conjecture o scheme out is as how do you a lad or i think of scheme as am we have a scheme of christian right we t we we have all kinds of ideas that we together and call christian a holiday season in the northern hemispheres cold we have santaclas and reindeer and jingle bells and even things that are false that but we normally associate with christian presents family gathering when it is all of the stuff it is sown together into one there is a threat linking them all and we can just give ourselves a list of words and i and none of them contain the word christian and then ask people later i give hem another list of words and include the word christian and they will say o yah that word was there because in their minds they brought up that word christian because it is part of that hole scheme us that is what it is sort of it related lot of related concepts i guess thing about sort o the death top of my computer i would scare some people but it is just ton a folders but each of the folder names means something very clear and specific to me i an inside of those folders are collections of things that the make sense in terms of how their batch as at don't one way exactly now that is a great way to think of it and and when you're in red sleep in the later parts of the night and that transition to red that is when your computer of your brain is opening folders and comparing document seeing if is there anything the same if these two documents look very much the same but there is a little bit of difference and it can it can link those conventionally that that is probably one of the origins of creativity is finding things that a related may be just linked a little bit and you can find that length and strengthen it if it they no makes your she mat interesting and different very interesting i many people including myself tend to wake up be once during mill the night to use the rester i tried to drink less fluid before going to sleep but have heard also that i the impulse to urinate i forgive the topic when the lot people deal with this the impulse to urinate is also decay by how quickly you drink fluid and not just the total volumes is which you ism sipping fluids more slowly from my last beverage of the day which seems to help but the point here is a thing a lot of people wake up once in there the in oftentimes to use the rest room but sometimes just around three a m and might be up for a few minutes hopefully not on their phone or viewing any bright volume which can cause more wakefulness but then go back to sleep is there any known detriment to this middle of the night waking or should we consider it a normal feature for some people's sleep a a i think we should not worry about it actually i think sleep is really incredibly well home aesthetically regulated and really do not worry about how much your sleeping as long as you are not intentionally depriving yourself of sleep by doing something really rewarding and exciting because even that is stressful to your body and deprives you a lot of things for talking about do not worry about it am it is absorb normal to wake up at least once in themiddle the night to go to the bath room and as long as you can get back to sleep in a reasonable mount of time i or even if it takes you an hour do not worry about it as long as you have a life style that allows you to then make up that sleep either the next morning or the next night ism going to bed a little earlier find i cant directly there is a little bit of a symmetry to sleep that catching that first phase of sleep it is o either editor you do not and you have to get at by going to sleep yes i shall the same time way i may be plusher in is fifteen minutes yet ye a but then if i wake up in mill the night and go back to sleep i can not catch up but i can gather all the sleep that i would have gotta had i just slept the whole way through the night we ya and and we do not know actually the answer to whether not the sleep in the middle between that early sleep in the late sleep is in fact different for another reason and whether depriving yourself of sleep from say one the to thirty in the morning is bad in a different way we do not know well i suppose i i the experiment in that case because i do tend to wake up once ornis den one a have come to am recognize as part of my normal sleep a want entire i do not obsess over it i do notice that when i go back to sleep and especially toward morning that my sleep is incredibly deep my dreams are incredibly vivid ill do not always remember them but what is unique perhaps about the architecture of dreams and sleep in the but see the last third of the night we or the second half of the night yet yet the second half the night we have longer red sleep periods and those are consider the deepest sleep even though slave sleep big slaves considered deep it is deep that a all slave sleep deep sleep an red sleep rapid to me but now your telling me that red sleep as i shul than door sleep o we there needs to be ne nominal er servers youreation solid deeper not let the real mig call slave sleep deep sleep is because it difficult to arouse people out of that state i and when you do arouse them out of that state there must must often confused and just want to go back into sleep and can go back pretty easier if you arouse some one out of red sleep there more likely to report something that is really kind of almost wakefulness that is vivid but in fact if you give some one an non threatening kind of stimulation somebody dropping keys or am a ping or something that instead of waking that same volume well wake some one up out of non rent sleep but at of from sleep in instead lengthen the amount of time or make it even more dense were rapid i movements more dense and often people will incorporate that sound into their dreams the body in brain are somehow conscious of the am of the sound and have heard also smells can even make it into our o dreams and in red sleep but that we it does not rouse us it days arouse us as often ye and may be one of the reasons why remsleep is deeper is specially in a adults and older people that deep slave sleep goes away it is not as deep it is not as big the slowwaves are not is large which is probably problematic that we are not sure and then red sleep it becomes the deepest stage actually in children it is kind of a coset because they it is really hard to wake them up out of that deep slave sleep and in fact am fire alarm arms do not wake them up even really loud firelarmsoute of that state of sleep that is why they are trying to change firearms that instead of something that the keystone associate with anything the whatever they do not associate it says their name or something else that maybe u less loud that more sailing to them landfill wake them i now having carried sleeping children in from the car i do not know that i want children to start waking up from sleep an that one o best things ta at home and that kids are a sleep in backs it literally throw them over our shoulder gently of course yes and put them to sleep in and they are clearly out ye twas e it is wonderful one one of nature's gifts it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a item in mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have ben taking athletic green since two thousand an twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the podcast there is mi story taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the robotics that i need for got health our got is very important its populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the mean system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those robotics not lentic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions fitments and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it take crime if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of item and the c too again that is athletic greenstone cam slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply of item and three c to this a enhanced volume or or proportion of of raping movement sleep in the second half for the night a relates to more elaborate dreams a we are paralyzed ernes crept yes n marmalade paralyzed in that is really get because that is the time when where actively dreaming story lying dreams and we cud a heard ourselves we are actually really cut off from the outside world in terms of you know a responding to say this table or window or door an different from sleep walking which is out of slowly sleep an that of slow sleep that sleep walking is a mixture between sleep in wakefulness e you actually will respond to the door you can cook o folmeala drive your car while you are in deep slow sleep at carry because you never know what you are kind to do you do not have voluntary voluntary control over it you have no conscious control over it but you can actually safely navigate some situations in sleep walking and actually have a conversation although it may not make much sense when your sleep talking in red sleep you are not processing the outside world and instead a when you are acting out your dreams you could be doing things like walking through a late class window or falling off of u know down the stairs am things that you really want your muscles to be inactivated during ram sleep otherwise you will act out those dreams and really hurt yourself or your bed partner what about sleep talking we are talking in sleep i i do not know how many relationships have i been saved by sleep talking but ism guessing a few have i been destroyed and ism guessing that i talking in sleep could have meaning or perhaps has no meaning just as dreams i could have meaning or no mean as we recall them ya do not take sleep talking seriously a no matter what people say it does not necessarily reflect truth it is not your being more truthful when your sleep talking that saved a number of relatives u ism not directing the san any one in particular by i i guarantee you just end no did as people start to approach morning or the time when they normally would wake up have heard that it is important to if possible complete one of these nine minute cycles prior to waking up that is if you set your alarm for half way through one of these nine minute cycles that come la in the night of sleep that it can lead to rather groggy patterns of waking it'll just ass you directly to yours an alarm la i do not a think my i in a mine of work that does not require me normally to do anything at any particular time i dry but when i do it i unless have to catch a plain and then i always set my arm just in case well as a fellow academic i can tell you their plenty of punishing features about being anadem it's that i that offset the fact that i you do not have to use alarm clock but it is nice you can often sat own casual ye would you recommend that if possible that people not use an aware clock yet absolutely if you can just listen to your body and wake up when you need to wake up that would be great but am one of the reasons why we have such a grogginess is called sleep in extra when we wake up out of the wrong state which is am deep slave sleep is because i liken it to i a washing machine cycle this ninety minute cycles like washing machine cycle and and a the first part is to add water right and am then your clothes are soaking wet you do not want to open the washing machine and try and function put them on and wear them around while they soaking wet and full of soap you have to wait until the cycle is throne before you can well actually butts put in the drier to i before you want a wear them an ye you can function it just takes a little while for those clothes that brain to dry outlay you can actually function well am but it is better to wake through the whole cycle is complete and that is why you want to set that nine ninety minute alarm clock and again that is around ninety minutes because the first stage of sleep the first cycle of sleep is of actually a little longer more a hundred and five hundred and ten minutes put then the second ones in third ones they get sort of shorter and shorter is the night goes on and in the last few cycles you are just doing then and to red sleep cycle which takes last time and if you wake up at of red sleep es usually no problem cognitively you fare you are good to go are you fan of of sleep trackers i sure ye do you use one i have one an i do not take i do not i do not a live my life by them because they are the best ones right hour about seventy per cent effective it staging your sleep seventy persists i can into can a a take it with a grain of salt is what anything ye tried serious ones and i compare the mattresspaced one to mas you word on my uncle instead of my wrist but and i do find it in formative but e colugo mind at stamford ally drum an works on mine said in belief of facts touch me about a study they did where people often will buy us there sense of daytime wakefulness based on their sleep score more than their subjective ye score y in other words if they were told they got a poor night sleep even if they got a great night sleep in in and this was of course measured in the sleep lag a they are able to compare people report feeling more groggy and the opposite is all true and if it says a hundred per cent or ninety per cent on your sleep score the people all feel graduate they might not have slept well this speaks to the i do not say placable office wit the sort belief effects en a woven in with a score ye mans it seems to me that combining subjective and objective data yes probably yean i do believe that you should trust your own physiology and the way that your body is telling you to feel i because in fact it used to be that people with insomnia were not often not believed because you put them in a sleep lab and they look they slept great and you wake them up in the morning they say i i did not sleep very well at all and that is because probably we we just came out with a paper that shows that sub cortical structures can be in a completely different sleep state than cortical structures as which is what we measure in the sleep lab a what the cortexes doing it might be that people who say i did not sleep all night long even though the quarter is saying oh no you ha great sleep u was because they are there monitoring their some article hypothalamus hypicampus a thalamus other other structures that the sleep lab just cannot access unless you have depth elector an which nobody really wants rid as that requires holes in the skullells as aliens yous i does that mean that the last fifty plus years of sleep on it am it is potentially food in some way because they are only e recording from am i guesses would be the anal you be it is recording from on the surface of the ocean ya i suppose to the depths of the ocean and trying to ascertain the life moving down deep in thedepth the race yourselves a colleagues that stamford sleep land elsewhere but please just tell us as i think scientist want to know the truth ye i mean it is not for nothing that you want know what the cortex's doing a in cortex's really important for a lot of things but it does not necessarily tell you what a lot of other really important parts the brain are doing in terms of sleep and am but there is hope a because in fact it would be great i think that is possible from the paper if you look at it it is in piano as this year that you could detect settle changes in the cortical e e g that might be able to tell you what the sort sub capital structures are doing things the absolute power of in that sleep spindle band that sigma band would change if the hip the campus is in remsleep in t e cortexes in that sleep spinal state and advice over are there is some hope and that we can gain from people with depth elected ere animals and with depth theloctreds that we could backwards a machine learn what the cartels might be able to tell us about sure critical structures from the cortical egg interesting the as it a stimuli astatic as you be a stimulus for development of new technology which is always going to a assist in scientific discovery am there one more thing i want to ask about the architecture of the night see am interns of early part of the night earlier you mention the wash out of debris and the call glenphatic system i think is what you are referring to you tell sol a bit more about the wash out that occurs in the branguring sleep what what that is and what roles it is thought to sir and perhaps if there any ways to insure that it happens or to insure that it does not happen obviously we want this to happen ye ye a it great question we talked about the circadian clock and tow certain things happen at certain times while one of the things that happens when we are wake and talking to each other is that there is a lot of plasticity er something that i am learning from you to day and you are learning from me and that changes our synapses and it changes the way are prolines a going to be folded and and changed during sleep am it unfolds this process actually uses a lot of big t p the power a structure the fuel of the brain and it unfolds also prolines while we are doing this while we are using them and during that first part of the night e when we first fall asleep in the first twenty minutes or we are building that a medicine back into eh t p and that is a probably we parents are called paweranats because i we are actually rebuilding the power and then am were also cleaning out through the deep slow waves of slave sleep cleaning out all those misfiled prolines unfolded prolines and other things that get broken down and a you now need to be rebuilt when we are a sleep because of its us staring wakefulness i liken that too know having a big party during wakefulness and you need all those party goers to leave in order to do the clean up and what i think the mechanism is and this is still something be tested is actually slow waves themselves which is bad news for us as we get older and those slowwaves get smaller and a slowysleep goes away what happens when a neuron is firing is that it expanse the membrane expands a little bed becomes more translucent that is how we know one of the rays we know that naans expand when they fire and every action potential the membrane expands a little bit as sodium brings water into this am and then when they are silent they contract and in during slowwaves the cool thing is that the reason why you can measure them is hat all the anurans at the same time not all of them but a good portion of them are firing at the same time and silent at the same time and you think about that as contracting and expanding all at the same time it is kind of a bilge pump of the brains that can pump out clear are also really important for this a in n terns of cleaning up debris and transferring it to where it needs to go ism i think of it actually as a bilge pump a cleaning out our brain interesting have heard about the lymphatic system in emphatic wash out have never thought about the mechanical aspects of it before always thought that for some reason that now it is obvious to me there had to be something mechanical but only know that you educate me about this i thou that for some reason that the tree respond flu starts washing through but here your talking about virally an expansion and a contraction of the grants in unison and pushing the fluid through cleaning out any misfiled prolines or to breathe it might occur y on the bass of these metabolic pathways and the consequence of that is to up to what to leave the brain in a state of a i more pristine action for for the next day year ye you think of it again a party and if yo do not clean up after that party you try and hold another when the next day it is going to get more plugged it us people have a harder time moving around and enjoying themselves and am if that bills of day after day and it is going to be cognition that would be the party goers moving around a becomes pard and this in build pump that you describe s a sorry with the s big slow waves of of deep well of o slow wave sleep ye a this going to cur more less than the first third of the night yes at right that is right and am are there things that inhibit this process and are the things that facilitate this process ya while on thing tod in habit its not to get it that right and here to a sorry et in trouble am but it and is this similar to the case with growthormon where if you go to sleep later than you would normally you miss the wash out ye i doit is not you do not delay it a miss you miss the wash a right that is right if you go to sleep at one or two in the morning you sleep is still going to be dominated by and two and red sleep not by slow wave sleep you need to you need to get that for it sleep would a copy out to that be if somebody normally goes to sleep at one or two a m and wakes up at ten a m that if that is their normal sleep cycle ye am that i should be it should be a a m you would probably want to to somebody would want to do a sleep study with people who do that normally and see if also the melanoma release is later and the craticosteran rise that happens normally in the morning also happens later if everything shifted got ye the there a few studies i am come across that really do argue for the fact that waking up sick u sunrise that does not mean at sunrise but within an hour or two may be three hours of sunrise and going to sleep within four hours after sunset or its am is actually better for the health of all human beings then is being a night owl and the night owl is almost a night owl pussy out there this for show social media they get very upset when you say that you should see morning sunlight that after to a m you can a miss the boat an they get very upset because i think there are about twenty or thirty per cent of people perhaps who a who really feel the function better staying up late and waking up late i function much less well waking up early in going to bed early but the dato on health metrics suggest that sorry night owls that they are wrong yet sorry me cause ism the night oo we a her not a really early morning person ism gonging more tip if i wake up naturally round six thirty somewhere between six thirty and seven thirty a m go to sleep somewhere between ten and eleven y m ye these are averages am but i do notice that when i force myself to get up earlier and go to sleep a little earlier that my mood and alertness and just over all productivity is much higher then there can be other variables asleep right ism a night o i love staying up late at night doing winnow writing grants writing paper is watching moms whatever it is i love it that i i you ad every human b being on earth old do better if i go to bed earlier and wake up earlier one good thing for a night out is to have a child because they will wake up their circa and rhythms are strong they will wake up and even if you deprive them of sleep in the first half of the night they will still wake up clock work because the are circadian them are strong at six a m an what you you have not done anything good for your kid you have not move their cycle to later and be more in line with yours in fact you have just sleep deprive them and made them miss a window and made them cranky the next day and made your life more miserable go to bed a soon after your kids go to bed and wake up with them that is the way to do it great the child alarm clock there as at children yes a i got a dog a puppy an then that became a dog specifically well for many reasons but one reason was i want to be one this early morning losing a five thirty a m every morning but i are not up getting a bull dog that would literally sleep sixteen hour ye if he could a new clear balm could go of and he would not wake up but what i strange to learn was that bulldogs a she o sleep a neither there is a it is far i know the the only species that has a genetically a there is something in bred am sleep my far and i she do not encourage people to get bull dogs because it is a kind of a cruel breed they suffer a lot in that body thither morning to anyway am a dog can accomplish some some of this would get the get the a the breed of dog that they going to wake up early another do not gin a but dramas well interestingly all a predatory animals dogs and cats and lands and us am well more dogs cats and lions then as will can sleep you know sixteen hours a day i ferrets are predatory they d a that fir is to than a sadly also used to work on first ratio number labors i ad a lawful animals ya and great because you can study development it is really cool an because they are born very altricial we are its brains that are not very well developed and seep and see what happens through development and how important these different phases of development really are but yes am ya maybe we are not as predator as much predators as we thank because in fact we are sleep is somewhere between the pray and the predators a interns the amount of sleep that we usually need a night a but those predators can sleep sixteen hours a napping all day long and and the more corpuscular perhaps their prey are most a dawn and ask a if had don in us active am ye but anyway yes a children and dogs actually in if there was a pull done by the national sleep foundation to see what the number one thing is that wakes people up at night and number too is going to the bathroom a number three is children because a you are when your children are young but that only lasts a few years the wake you up a when their babies m that the number one things pets and pats needing to go out or cats wanting to curl up with you or whatever it is pats needs will wake you up more in the middle of the night than anything else another reason don not get a nocturnal pets people get hamsters pretty quickly realize that they are nocturnal man on a run on the wheel an a i et pe n the living room away from where you sleep i vote fish ten folks can fresh waterish to that will wot the reasons to not get us artwork ink fresh waterish to am or a child em i appreciate that vote and i appreciate you mentioning ferrets and by the way folks they are carnivores they are not romance and they are they have very elaborate brain structures we either very smart ye em in the same family as the honey badgers an the other musculits ay we will id should not i weak out too much on on the mussels or else i take the the remainder of all our time a love for you to tell us about red sleep in the sleep later in the night as it relates to dreams an emotionality and this is probably on the appropriate time for you to introduce us to this incredible structure in the brain which is the locust serious difficult structure to spell but a beautiful a beautifully named structure em i find locust release to be just fascinating and i know i you know a small fraction of what it does and ism hoping you are going to educate me in an our audience about more bout what it does and hopefully tell us a little bit about its relationship to epaneferan a a adrenalin ye i glad you brought this out because i can totally get out on the locus resist es to locus meaning pot or place and smells being blush could just call the blue spot am that is the easiest every em animal with ha brain has a be spot and em ye and i mean every other ma with the brain because chis there are animals with nervous systems that are not centralized jellyfish m bat anyway were were digressing there am the locust resist is filled with means that have in them group in effing which is the brains version of pan ran or a adrenalin is also called north adrenalin and what it does is it just a adrenalin and the rest of our bodies it helps prim us to respond to ore environment when locus relies means fire and fir in a burst we can with our attention m and they will fire in a burst if for example a loud noise happens in the middle of your concentrating on something you can it helps it fires and it helps you sit your attention to that thing and then learn quickly from it it is really important in a stress response it helps us do quick one trial learning and a man then tonic activity during the day when you are just doing u normal going about your normal concentration kind of activity activities is really good for am sustained attention am it it works with the colanargic system of our b sail for brain m which is really important for learning an memory also to help us learn about things and put things together am but subtonic level levels are signature of wakefulness and alertness too much is panic with he locusrilis activity a burst is switching attention and then tonic levels a sustained constant attention and then when we go to sleep the locustrialis slows and come goes from about on average a to hurts to bout one hurts one cycle for second anionically a and then when we going to remsleep it is the only time when it shuts off completely and it appears at that complete silence is really really important for a number of things and the main thing that i think it is important for is the ability to race and break downsenapses that are no longer working for us o and cod things that are false now or they are in coming things that we a learned in the novelty and coming pathway s of a of our brain that have now been consolidated other pathways and we need to nowerace them from the novelty and coming pathway and that is really really important for being able to continue to learn am things all of our lives racing that ram e or that you don't know what he call us disks that you stick into computers that's a for draw anoa tum bodies tawdry you are rasing your thumb drives y that thumbdrives what you carry around all day long and then during sleep you write that thumb drive to the vortex to the longer memory structures and you need to refresh that them drive and that is what happens during remsleep when the locustrilis is off because whenever it is on and nor gentleman is there it helps us to put things together it helps us to learn and strengthen synapses but it doesn't allow us to actually weaken synapses that are also really important part for life a portent part of lifelong learning a ye i much more i could say about that yo you'll just rules o fascinating it is connected to the basil for francolin ergo sister a the neurons locus rules for not mistaken release nor on enough for perhaps up enough for is will well no the brains version of eponeffon is norapeneffren m the other thing it also the precursor t norpeneffron is dopamine and the source of dopamine and e hippocampus seems to be the locustrialis and its still a mystery is under what conditions the locustrials also releases opening but it is really important when we are learning something new to also release opening or to at least activate the doormen argil receptors in our hippocampi is ye dopamine norpeneffren a and then there is also a gallant which is important for release won stressed and at helped also with out rapid learning am it works in concert with nor an effed and in doing what it needs to do to strengthen synapses that we learn rarely quickly i i love am that there multiple molecules involved because that signals us to a principle which is that even if people cannot remember our all the names that rarely in biology is something handled by just one molecular pathway that we nancy is the rule pig because signaling attention to specific events i important that many use that is a just story awe say i was not consulted of the design face but it makes sense to me as to we redundant see what exist in that a gently and in fact when we form hypotheses about the brain we are always wrong and the reason why we are always wrong is cause its more complicated than we to think and because in our brains from reforming hypotheses its we fail to account for all of the factors that are involved in of the plea the neropeptides in our transmitters the physical structure synapses and when i was going through grad school thirty five years ago i we the doggones that every neon contains one her transmitter and releases one her transmitter and you had excitetorave your transmitters and inhibitory narc transmitters and r modulatory her transmits but that is at complicates got and then we out stray pockamout nor peptides and people said o no please do not do not complicate and then we start talking about how i neurons contain both her peptides and her transmitters and may be more than one her times may even hormones ton hormones and o lord you know it is just complicated but god admit that is why it works right and every time the brain teaches us something new about itself that we did not hypothesize we say all of course that would not work if the way i hypothesized it with it in we actually need redundancy we need all these systems to work together and it is a daunting sometimes but it also ensures many a many careers and saw it h an neuroscience in particular am a note that aspiring scientists there is plenty of room a for discovery if you want me to talk about nor ainefran ye same notion yes hat i look at would have love for you to tells about is what role this lack of nor up an efferent release during rapid movement sleep am is thought to achieve and maybe could also refuse some of your work describing conditions under which nor up inn ran invades can a rapid moment sleep another patterns of sleep and how that can be determine ye a lot of this is hypothetical that based on a lot of good evidence that we are sewing together into the schema from which these hypotheses count also a model on scheme up from its came hypotheses come but one thing that happens to people with postromatic stress disorder is that there is a lot of evidence that the locusterialists does not stop firing in rensleep whereas the er levels of normal friend might be similar to people without past during the day and even during the first part of the night a during the we hours of the morning and when you measure norpanefran levels from metabolites a in the blood or the tree will spinal fluid you see that people with past it is during the we hours of the morning when you have the most red sleep they have there norpanefran levels differentiate most from those that do not have past and that is evidence the locustrils is not shutting down during red sleep it should other evidence is heart rate variability when our locustrilis is firing a our heart rates a generally a little higher and they do not vary as much as they do when the locustrilis is not firing during slowing sleep nor we have this big guy variability an heart rate with every breath in and breath out because our noradenergic levels our normal even levels are lower during red sleep that goes away entirely in our heart rats is em is a dominated by a para sympathetic rather than sympathetic activity and also what our brain is driving in what or dreaming about for example for dreaming were running our heart rates will go up but norpanefren levels still should be low or off a people with p test that nor energies a we are studying these an rats to is it true that our locustrilis does not a shut off when we have postramatic stress disorder and preliminary evidence is yes it is true that it does not shut off what that would do is a norpanefren would act at snaps is to prevent that a weakening that you really need for example of novelty and coming structures and it keeps memories in that novelty incoming structure even once it is consolidated to the rest of the brain in the hippocampus which is important for remembering things throughout our lives and and it is that them drive a we we need it to be race that we can learn new things a once it is been consolidated to the the hard drive of our quarter and if if we are not able to do that we fill up that ram a really quickly or that thumdrive really quickly and we're not able to learn new things safer example after a drama i talked all the locustrillis responding in stressful situations that is great it is very adaptive but then you need it to stop once you have learned what you need to learn from it and you want to go to sleep you need the locustrilus to calm down and during remsleep you want to stop because then when you have consolidated that dramatic memory to the quarters you need to race it from the novelty and coming structures for example in the hippocampus that then when you are in the context of safety you can learn those new things was new context and a and stop responding to those same stimuli as though you're in that original tuition you are not able to source that them drive you will always feel that drama happened that same day might earlier that same day and a respond as you would to e a an early a recent drama which is with beating heart and all of that am even memories that ere years past if you are never able to downscale that novelty in coming structure and purge it from that dramatic memory it will stay fresh and new and then become maladaptive what approaches are you aware of that can a turn down the output of locus abulias during these phases of sleep and for that matter what things can cause camping up of locusrulias during this has of sleep we have had a couple podcast episode sol episodes and with guests talking about drama we had doctor palconti who isdamfortrained havertran ampsychitres you talk a lot about drama wrote an excellent book on drama and am certainly sleep was emphasized as as a key thing get enough sleep ut her your saying even if somebody which mama gets enough sleep if locusrulios is hyperactive during sleep it's dramas are going to persisting most of the drama treatments that i am aware of or everything ranging from con behavior ill there a be talk there be drug there be eddy a hypnosis am rowdies there is a lot of interest an attention on am clinical studies on exploring psychedelics hide suicide an an empty may that is a vast landscape none of which as far as i know is really focus on sleep specific well they are not and they should be because actually psychedelics is a sleep state and as red sleep state although of course there is some major differences yes much to talk about here anti depressence a are often nor adernergic a seritinar mic re uptake inhibitors they leave norpaneffran actually out there in the synapses and what that does is it inhibits red sleep a and if you are able to get red sleep it would probably be from sleep with some narginergic activities actually i think anyway am not a physician that a anti to presents are counter indicated you do not want to take them if you o experienced to drama and source experience in petiosty because if anything it is going to make it worse or at least prevent the type of the adapt i red sleep that you really need an order to resolve those emotions and move on am is that statement specific to into depressence that a tickle the noratronergic pathways that the one that comes to mind is amprepribe or can never pronounce a bra prior on which is a what ut think grandame as well betray it is a dope in magic and noratronergic agonist s sure the the not effect as opposed to the prose awol posterity which our access or eyes yes yes but as as eyes themselves also are rob matter because we did not talk about it yet that the dorsal rape nebulas which produces saratonean which the the pa civic sacaton is pacific baritone an septic invites block from being retaken am leaves too much sacaton about there and what saratonan also is another nordronergic advised other nor ahancementer that is down regulated during remsleep that specifically off during remsleep and what saratonan was is it waits all of our cognition to being able to recognize novelty again it sort of waits a our brain away from a sense of familiarity and toward novelty and am a might be one reason why its an effective a ante to present because it makes the world feel fresh and new again right am but youthen you have too much your holding a novel dramatic memory am in your novelty an cutting structure too strongly already you do not want to again wait things toward novelty you need that absence of serotonin also to help you get that sense of familiarity and to start erasing the novelty and could structures you need both to be absent its truly interesting a we hear a lot about stone and and a it is not often discussed in terms of its features related to novelty enough i think a and what you just describe accuse me to something that a doctor paulconti and others have have said in terms of remand here in paraphrasing to my apologies to them for not getting is exactly right that that an effective treatment for drama does not race the dramatic memory but it causes a transition of what once was disturbing and invasive an maladaptive to eventually just become kind of boring old story that has kind of a fuzzy texture to it as opposed to this kind of sharp a high friction texture that invades our thinking o madam and obviously our sleeping states as well a again an a i appreciate the disclaimer the soviets around i o not being acclimation at camera but i do think that there is a lot of interest now and whether or not until to presence are effective for drama or not i thin these these aspects of demodulation as they relate to am it is call it racing dramas are changing the emotional load of dramas during sleep a mi something important to take note we all have a lotic clinicians that listened to is podcast they should also take note am please if i want to reduce the amount of nor up aneffran release from locus sequoias during raping movement sleep to eliminate the troubling or maybeven dramatic memories am and allow at stages of sleeper to night to have their maximum positive effect is there anything that i can do besides avoiding am avoiding dramas avoid in am carton urgikon or eager urge compete well i would also avoid anything just prior to going to sleep that might excite those systems a lot of novelty am a lot of exciting a stress in during video games a try and enter sleep with as much calm as you can may be deep breathing exercises that is a beautiful way to calm your sympathetic fiterflight system is deep breathing and a we have not been able to test us with rats because we cannot ask them to do a deep breathing exercise a there might be away we can do that but i have not found out or figured about yet am but if there is a way you can make your sympathetic system nervous system calm down before you go to sleep might free for you meditation or deep breathing exercises might be for some a warm bath or comforting book nothing to exciting tut a also nothing too boring perhaps a just something right in the middle which makes you feel happy an calm is what she should do and if you instead go to sleep while you are anxious or a you are piped up then your sleep could become maladaptive am another thing that happens in rats that we have yet to know if it happens in women is that female rats have a three phases of their extra cycle that a their locustrilis does not seem to calm down during men sleep as much and we do not know why but during the high estrogen phases of the extra cycle the locustrilis shuts down just a dozen male rats but in the other three phases it does not a one thing that might work and in fact there are few studies that show it it could work really well is a a giving women after a drama event a something that contains estrogen because estrogen somehow is protective against it it and they know that through your retrospective studies where they a gave women in emergency room either a pill with estrogen and or without and those that had pill with estrogen in it were much less likely to get it s t from that drama as measured a year later than those that had the pill without a there is really good studies by born when graham she is out of australia to really hone in on how much estrogen do you need and also testasteran just gets converted to estrogen in the brain to stasteran also can be protective because it gets converted to estrogen a but there is something about estrogen that is really helpful and protective about a that from from the high locuserillas firing and this is again preliminary dateither we do not have full hey do not have all the answers yet and a we are looking into actively right now but its of really important the other thing about women is that we are two to four times more susceptible to anxiety related mental health disorders including postramatic stress disorder if we could figure out what is happening to h locusereosduring sleep in women a that and then figure out away to normalize that the locustrialus is silent when it needs to be silent i think we could go a long way and in helping women be more resilient to strestrulated and disorders what or some other a sex differences as they relate to sleep yet yet that is ta filthy good question there have been very few study unfortunately of women in sleep a women and extra cycle or menstrual cycle and sleep and a bat what we have found which actually largely replicated a study in nineteen sixty a is that that women or females rather at high estrange and high harmony phases of their extra cycle or menstrual cycle sleep a lot less but that sleep is more efficient that sleep is more dense in those sleep spindles which i have not gone into what they might do except this connection between the hyppocaps and cuteys but as those sleep spindles are more dense and more coherent across the brain areas the fade a cycle which is five to ten hurts in the hippocampus important for one your learning and also important during red sleep is also bigger and juicier a during the high harmony phases even though there is less sleep it is more efficient and better a bat a all of that efficiencyseems to be reduced in those other hormonal phases a even though you might sleep a little more a you might need more sleep in fact in order to accomplish the same thing that you can get with that short a very efficient sleep of hyfomonal phases very interesting i think em there is a growing trend at least among a an a founded grants to a require a that a as they refer to it in the grands biological sexes variable yes and the here we taught noting about sex the a the her although ism sure their studies about that too but biological sexist variable because there is a hurt of studies exploring sex differences and in most everything an there there all sort of reasons for that but more importantly the fortunately the trend is shifting yet a and even when you study malestreces females a lot of people just say include females in their studies but than do not tract the extra cycle or menstrual cycle and harmony have huge effects on our behavior i mean just think of oyoushead sex a before our harmony come in we are not interested in it and suddenly that is and of a main driver or behaviors harmony a can definitely change who are in what we do we s would be studying harmony not to sex i always say that a puberty is perhaps the most massive transformation and rate of aging that any of us go through an a short amount of time an individual their cognition changes their world o changes and that is largely hormones drivenand and obviously normal architectures change to am an very happy that you mention ism trying to get into calmer states prior to sleep and some ways to do that ism a big fan enough talked a lot before in this pod cast about things yoganedra which is a non movement base practice a sometimes called non sleep depressed where people achy take some time each date to practice how to go into a more part sympathetic an a relaxeidate deliberately is its a bit of a skill eye it is am an there is there is some good data really most out e laboratory and scananavia showing huge increases in am i grostride old dopamine when people go a basely engage in a practice of deliberate a non movement and that the brain actually enter states of a very shallow sleep sort of knavish but the ideas daw she stay awake but motionless and it does seem to restore a certain number of features of new chemistry but perhaps more importantly it teaches people to to relax which is something that most people are not very good at a a but in any event am and people who listen is police have heard me sat as over and over against i saw a broken record but this practice as a zero cost practice that does not require any a pharmacology does seem to really enhance people's ability to fall asleep more quickly and to fall back to sleep if they win and the ton he night in any out another plug for nasty are yoganedra well i just also wen i add to that that is one of the reasons why in some is incidias is because on people feel they have not gotten enough sleep and or getting of sleep and become anxious about getting up sleep and then you are anxious before going to sleep ism not enough fallsleev us can be forty five minutes and and then that positive feet blackly you need to break that lap say o k my body's going to get as much sleep as at needs i need not worry about it and then practise this relaxation to say ate it is allow it is going to be all right and and then concentrate on things that relax you a wether it is concentrating or not concentrating whatever it is am you met mentioned am yoganedra and that reminded me of a transintental meditation which is something that also has not been studied well i likely because we cannot ask non human animals to do it and we do not know what's happening with our narrow chemistry and a a brain activity it in a deep an meaningful way bat one thing that his has been shown in those it can do it really well is that that that activity that he said happens when you are learning something or we you are in asleep it it is well established and and increases during the transcendentomagitation it might be that some states of meditation could in some ways replace or medic some functions of for example from sleep but again we do not know if all the narcanmistry is right to do for example the thing that i was talking about which is you rasing the novelty and cut structures of the rain that needs an absence of warp an effed and serotonin which we do not know that goes away with with them trains dental meditation we just do not know answered not yet yet the studies on an yoganedra and sleep replacement or kind of interesting it does seem to be the case that nothing can really replace sleep except sleep but that if one is sleep deprived or is having trouble falling back to sleep that these things and i hear it is i acknowledge this is essentially yoganedra but we now call it non sleepy breast or an testy are because often times for i a names yoganedra act as at kind of a barrier for o what would otherwise be a people willing to try a practise a sound an i sail and and ye a sounds life lying carpets and w you not sound you have to go to eschew by the way excellence a beautiful place but it sells you have to go there or or live in the west coast at to believe in the stuff but it simply not the case the are practices that that are really just myself directed relaxation as a practice that that allows people to get better and better at directing their brain states towards more relaxation and most people have any symmetry for instance most people can force themselves to say up later but they have a harts ism going to sleep earlier and that just speaks to the a symmetry that is probably adaptive in survival base that we can ramp ourselves up far more easily than we contend to calling ourselves i and actually in o to appeal to other christian me prayer can be a wonderful way to calm yourself down because through prayer your giving your caries to give and saying and then you are relaxed more relaxed and i just whale to say that because the same reason that yoga might put some people life it might put some people if m to to talk about prayer that it is the same process of being able to relax em yet and get outside our own expel and tat i t i ya to back out yet a world view that might actually also help us to relax will you you might be surprised a how many amclenitions since scientist who come on this podcast u have mention things prayer from various perspective atryanygeism haslet traditions and others that as it as a parallel to all of these things and i think what its speak to is the facts that ultimately the biological architectures that were all contending with a going to be identify at right and different ways to tap into them and n one's that are congruent with people's beliefs i think is are great yet at because anything and none con tit your release also stress and feels force and that why this idea of calling it non sleepy breast in addition to yoganedra was not to tetra it from the naming or the history round yoganetra but i was finding that it was a barrier likewise a yoganead your tens to include things intentions where as amnesty a scripts and by the way we will provide lings to some anear nyoganedroscripts but amnesty a has no intentions its simply body candy relaxation mas at sort of the scientific version of all f the sat of actually we study it in the laboratory and and some of the brain states that people go into but that is a discussion another nothing is e hadn't my mother is to tell me hen i we we could plain i cannot go to sleep if she would say well start with your toes and relax you would clench your muscles round your toes and relax them and do that all the way from your toes a we your head and i do not know where she got this at might have been her own common sense as she might have gotten it from this a an be antiar shows called the mind can keep you well shes to listen to but that is another intentional relaxation that focus is on the body a rather than on your own mind mental processes bathe i do a lo bit of work with the military and a there a method within certain communities of special operations in the west military where if they cannot sleep were the having challenge of sleeping they will deliberately trying relax their facial muscling titular for drape the facial muscle and a use long or tell emphasize and breathing o does seem to increase the probability of transitioning back into sleep and those are hallmarks of yoganedra not sleep my breast body skin yean i think all of these things converge on ye on a common theme nous nearbyoljust we can say all of the things that we are describing certainly move the needle away from locust rebellious activation and we have not done the experiment to really look at that but seems all these things a counter to nordrennl and relies ay another were is yawning yawning in itself is it that can of i sort of ten sing of all the b muscles in your face and then relaxing them i might be why we yawn we do not know why yawn yet that a it might also have would be really great actually animals can to o my hole dog was it was a perpetual if he was not sleeping ho is yawning and it would be interesting to see what yawning does to the locussirust does that also calm found switch locus r is activity because it is an interesting that facial nerve try laminal nerve u know the through the vagus connects a indirectly to the locusriis and has a powerful effect on that interesting a common i think friend of ours and direct colly of yours a jack headman was a guest on us podcast telling us about all the amazing structures he another have discovered in the in respiration and breathing resounds we have a collaboration brewing three of u should should deafly carry out it'd love for you to share with us a limit more about a the spindles that have come up a few times and i do not know it is relevant to this o it is not let us separated out a love for you to tell us a little bit about the rule of sleep problem solving in creativity the spindles are involved and it'll consider myself lucky for batching them in the same question tin i they are not involves feel free to super i think they could be involved and the reason why think there could be invalids we now know a lot more about spindles first well the first thing that we knew first while we ignored them then we thought they had something to do with keeping us to sleep and that was their function is when the external stimulus came they would keep us asleep because they would arise but now we know that the density of our sleep spindles then number that we produce per minute is well correlated with our intelligence in the first place and that no matter what your intelligence is and no matter what your sleep spindle density is if you learn something during the day and increase your sleep spindle density it is really almost perfectly correlated with our ability to consolidate that information in an incorporated into the schemer that we already have in our brains if you try and learn something new even if your sleep spindle density at base light is great if you do not increase your sleep spindles that night you are not in a you sleep to really incorporated interestingly sleep spindles ore poor in those with skits of frena it is one of them characteristic signatures of sleep a that sleepspindles are very few and far between which might mean that that people with skirts of frena might not be able to incorporate new information into already existing scheme and instead it sort of flaps in the breeze out there and can be access to em erroneously at times when you you know you do not want it to be involved i digress sleep spindles and creativity one of the things we now know through some great studies by jury seep and a need duty is that sleep spindles are accompanied by an incredible plasticity out in the distill dendrite the listening branches of our neurons that listen to other cortical areas therefore proximal dendrites and our anurans that listen to the external world and are conducted through the thalamus and then therefore distill dendrites which listen to in internal can of conversation that is having happening in our brains it is kind of you knower internal state really and during sleep spindles that is when those distal dendrites are able to best learn from other cortical areas an from the hippocampus am it is during sleep spindles up the hippocampus in the correct are best connected and when that play incredible plasticity can happen when i talk about schema that is a cortical cortical thing that is when the image of manta class in presents in know comes together it is not through some external thing once we learn those things together it is our correct that that incomes that an brings those images back up together and that during sleepspindles when that is happening when that a there is big surges of calcium into those am distil dendrites and where plasticity happens in in just huge amount o during that sleeps peddle stage of sleep which is end to stage there is also another excusatory a event that comes all the way from the brainstorm and projects everywhere in our quarter which is called p go waves codes p for ponds g from geniculate newclases of the phallus which is where there first discovered and o occipital area chichis or visual area which is again where there first discovered but in fact it is now been shown that p go waves which we should generalized to p waves cause they come from the ponds and go to the phalymis and then diquartex happens all over the brains and that is where a glutamate which is a major excite to ring nor transmitter involved in learning and plasticity is being released in big amounts also in those distill downright p waves and spindles work together to cosplasticity and are schema together which could be the origins for am insist and creativity now when p go waves or p waves a first discovered it was thought to be random because this small area that generates p waves all over the brain in o gent o projects all the all over the thalamus and causes waves all over and you do not measure p waves all over the brain at the same time in fact it is just seems spastic and random that is probably in p waves also happening even more during asleep rap and i movement sleep that is probably that is why people think that red dreams are random is because these p waves a random and they could generate dreams because they are an internal source of excitation that kind of replaces the outside world during our dream state and these p waves if they are random could could functioncould be the underlying reason why red sleep dreams a random and it might also be why creative it can happen there was because were randomly activating activating different things in our brain that we can then together but it might not be as random as we think that is the baby to there i just learned a lot from me because i i och brainstorm to medical students and talk about the ponds the ponds this dense collection of all these differ newly i involve in a bunch o different things and its close by a bunch of interesting things and a it still run of a mysterious brain area but when i learned about p go waves i thought ponds geniculate occipitonly casocipitals most commonly associate with visual quarter i thought it was the origin of the visual common in of dream stahaflyis a very happy to learn that they should be called p waves because they include lots of different tries the brain in it makes really good sense to me why the o judo randomness a dreams especially these late night an early morning a a later in sleep i shan't si and early morning dreams seem to be cobbled together from desperate experiences ow you you walk through door and suddenly it is a complete different contacts in landscape yes am beautiful i i this ideal tit makes intuitive sense to makesbiological sense it also gives me something to talk about at to the medical students next quarter when i hung about ponds for a you an not talk about where and the ponds it is right below the locus aerialists it is called the subseralist their plutimatergic s also called a as else sub lateral drill newclius we ut an am note to any aspiring your biologist there is a a vast landscape of yet to be undiscovered structure and functions in the ponds you want to work on something that is sure to reveal something novel work on the on was it is in every text book it is a a clinically very important structure am sadly gliomas an and another a answers o the brain can sometimes a can often surface in in the ponds but but we still know very little about it am i read a paper this last year or and i think it was covered in a bit of popular press that doing rapid movements sleep people can solve problems or respond to external stimually for instance they would give them math problems they would whisper in their ear while they were in sleep yet what is too plus and people would say even though they were paralyze ardently they could still move their mouth ans they would say for or something that when they would say what is your name and people could respondence that in remsleep perhaps people am some elements of cognition or still am active i glad you rout that that what dyouthng you and i soft know the authors of that study and them and a listen if ever i say something wrong it is great on this spot gust because some one will tell us in the mas it is one of the great uses of you two moments but i love to know your thoughts on that study an is that just kind of a a a an odd feature that does this have meaning should we care about this result yes no just about it it is really actually intriguing and interesting and might relate to this paper i talked about where we very said different areas of the brain can be in different states of the plane the same time lucid dreaming is another thing we cannot ask animals to do or cannot ask them if they have done it but am we can certainly ask humans to do it and some people can do it really well and it would be really interesting to see in those people who could use a dream really well whether they spend more or less time in this a a symmetrical state where one are the brain is in one state and another the brain is in another and it might be that those people can respond to questions during remsleep best are those that have the most state symmetry or or dissimilarity or dissociation between sub cortical and cortical structures or it might be that they're the ones with the most symmetry we do not know am i do worry a little bit about lucky dream because people are it is a fad people are really excited about it and to be able to remember when is dreams is fun often unless there nightmares and that it is really interesting or to be able to direct one's reams if they are a nightmare is is really wonderful power to have em to belle to redirect a nightmare that that been repeated to something else and then kicked yourself out of that a repetitive nightmare's really nice but i i worry a little bit about because we know little about what is actually going on in the brain and if this lucid dreaming state is preventing us from for example from the locustrillis from calming down or the seretenergic system from silencing it should and maybe what we are doing during this state is yet we are activating the learning and memory structures but in a way that is a maladaptive in terms of the duration that we needs to do maybe one of the reasons why most people do not remember most of their dreams is for good reason your hippocampus is not a state wore it is not writing new memories in fact is writing out it is the memories it learned during the day to the quarter and it is a immune from in coming new information i maybe lucid dreaming is bad because you are you are activating hippocampus in away this writing knew memories and it might be really maladaptive for things you know pitiusty on the other hand et me just argue myself right out of this i when i used to have a repeated nightmare when i was a kid my mother who's wise would tell me well listen just next time you are in that dream you do not say hey ism in a dream and then change something about it she and i reverse to what the horrible dream that was was big monster in a running after me and my legs were mud and i could not run away and it was just terrifying and that was a dream i would have in o time and time again said oke next time what you get a do in that monster comes after you i when a run away no you that is what you do every time and it is always the same out come you cannot run let us do something different what what could you do that is difference a i game up with all i could turn around and punch it an the nose ya that is great and the next time my had that dream i did recognize this is that same old dream which means that there is part of my brain that is conscious enough to know that this that ism in a dreaming state and then i did not have the courage in my dream cause i was still terrified to punch there we touch the monster in anyway but i did have the courage to turn around and look at in the eye and said no that was enough i said no and that was enough to nock me out of that wet of that dream that i never had it again i never had that same dream again and in fact it gave me piece about dreaming because i knew that if ever there was a nightmare that was just too scary i could probably do something to change it and knock myself out of it even though i do not recommend lucid dreaming on a normal today basis if it is enough that can knock you out of a wet a one thing that happens with people with petiasty is they have the same repeated horrible nightmare which is often a reliving of the day's trapan that that they they had maybe luce dreaming can be used on occasion to be a powerful tool because there is much plasticity that happen hi doing am sleep to knock you out of that get of reliving that event and and just change it and you could probably practise that during wakefulness a rehearse the e tent that happened that was dramatic and then just introduce a new element now ism safe now we know the sound that was associated with that really dramatic thing i should now associate with something else an next time i have that dream ism going to change it that sound is now this new thing that is should be associated with safety d that might be enough maybe i hope a to knock you out of that repeated nightmare and maybe even strike you on the path to recovery because if you can come down about those nightmare states of sleep then maybe your local shrills which is involved in stress can also relax and you can do the race your parts that need to be done i love it i seem to recall a paper and it'll have to find the reference in and am send it you we will also put in the shownote captions that described a pro to call sentry matches this idea and i think what they had people do as either cue themselves to a particular smell or tone in wakefulness then to trying recall a recurring nightmare yet then during the night sleep they have the tone playing in the background which would then cut them to the wakeful state there still asleep mind you but in the judo lucid or sensate and then trying change some variable as your describing i shoe either look that the am predator in the eyes a do something different yet and then in the waking state take a lobe of time to try and script out a different am narrative altogetherand it took several nights as i recall or more but that they were able to escape this recurring i are a weak or something now to your familiar yet a view of he study i loved it ye we will put a reference to that i and i need to revisit that say which pretty recent but i i been to dive into it again as i think i i did not go as deep into it as i i should a no no that tithe one thing that you that you you said many right things bat one of the things you said is that they were able to cue the dreamer am when they they knew an and they were going to red sleep and then they played the sound or had the odor now when you're normally asleep alone in your bed your not en to be able to cue yourself but it might be that rehearsal enough before you go to sleep is enough to you know help to you to that repeated nightmare remembering what the nightmare is and then figuring you had a cut yourself to do something different in years i had the same recurring nightmare over and over and over again and it was salient and clear and ism not con sure what it is cause it is am something ts that disturbing as is it think it was sleep emotional load of it just how sail at certain features r one person in am who is a real life person had a particular u clothing ton it is in that just served as his and yet do not know if i ever did any direct work to try and deal with it but now it almost seem silly to describe and o yet lone dreams are usually silly d irdyry silly they are emotionally a violent dreamland your emotional system is cured during red sleep which is another thing we could talk about e apes i love yes local sequoia sis ideally suppressed we cannot rely nor up in efferent we cannot act out our dreams this a during these very emotionally laid in thought and and story lines during sleep almost like starts a sound a limit of a building u while sweeping tramathera because most tramatherabies in all trying to get people into states of counter to what most people think you as show want to get close to the tram an terms of the narrative that is a trying suppress the emotional r activity of it or i guess it is the motivation for beaming base thermos macramé or have also heard in the system perplexing to me that other waking these tramaterabes involve taking people the other way make it very cathartic take them to the peak of the emotion the response but then allow that to finally cycled down into a more relaxed response please if there is anything about locus seraglios and and dreams and that can help people basically extinguished dramas or dramatic features to to real life events share defiling one to know about ye ye well i think one of the things that people thought might help after a drama a school shooting or whatever wen a cracking it is to talk about it and in bed in fact that ended of being counterproductive and i think one of the reasons i as counterproductive is did not take it them back down it brought them up and continued to reactivate the emotions of it but then did know emphasize the safety o fact that it is over or help them work through how they might avoid it again in the future to calm the sympathetic nervous system down again before they went to sleep in a and any none of these studies have sleep ever been considered but to me that is the key part is bringing down your sympathetic nervous system before you go to sleep that your sleep can be adaptive your locaserless can shut up an normally does or should do and then able to race the novelty of it the other thing that i just mentioned a minute ago is tithe emotional system is highly activated and red sleep and that is definitely true and that might seem counter productive in terms of i know the nightmares and and how to help red sleep be a therapeutic thing rather than a a than a in reenforcing the emotionality of the drama and i think the key to that again is the absence of aware an efferent even though the emotional system is in high year without norpanefrand you can actually a divorce those highly activated emotions from the cognitive parts of the memory that you have just written out in that into stage of sleep when the sleep spindles are going a you have just now consulted the information that you will need to survive and to to make that adaptive and now you need to divorce from that schema and from that semantic parts of memory the emotional part because whenever you remember something is fine if you remember the being emotional at the time but you do not want a bring back and into that memory all of the same emotional systems you soft want to bring back the heart rate changes and the sweating and and all of that you want to be able to remember all the parts of it and even remember that you were dramatized and that you did cry and that you did have in all your heart was racing but when your talking about it years later you do not want to have to relive all that otherwise who would ever want to recall a dramatic memory because you are basically putting yourself though the same drama which is what people of pet aside have they do not want to recall this dramatic memory because of it is re living i its just happening again that is what were thinking is that a the emotional parts are not longer are not able to be divorced because the northbenefant system is not downscale during red sleep and that remsleep serves instead reenforce and in fact amplify the emotions because you are your emotional system is up the casrilises high re sewing in every night the emotionality of tho memories and with the memory itself you a told sad about locus rules in normal an iceland from locus rule is er any role for a normal veteran pan effernin quarters all released from the adrenals my understanding is that normal offer an offer neural will not cross the blood raspberry wont just probably why we have the brainwashed natronergic system yet locus truly i at another another no onsets i show that is a question i should ask you but there other sights in the brain where group an i free is fleas from or a just locos rule a there seven oh coins of yes a er heroic yes there is nine different atenerge i shut ans o a an ait but it just occur to me that am in some cases t rain there are other sources of a certain uric drive in the grain but races one means sat that is the one that goes the quarter and and and the locustrales is also the one that goes the quarter but there are other adenergic sources some that a from the brainstorm that descend and help us to ignore pain for example ism when we are street and meeting to run away from the tiger don't want to be thinking all my ankle hurts hear a you one it just be able to ignore it and go do what you need to do am yes there lots of other noradenergic a lucky i but the locustrilus is the main one that projects all over the brain the actually the only place a does not project is the dorsal stratum you talked about eventual stratum and addiction the dorsalstradom is the only place the locus r us does not project to and that is involved in procedure learning motor learning a kinds of learning that take over when you hippocampus for example is compromised my latter if you do not have good hyppticamus you can still do procedure learning and o and it is great it is a redundant system and am if your locustrilis is not working you do not have it any more you can still do if you if you do not have a good hero campus you can still do learning through this dorsal strait on the structure it might be for those kinds of learning a functions a sleep deprivation where you never let the locustria stop firing is oke because it does not have any he receptors for anorak efferent anyway a ya in one about bodily a bells e dreams yet m i i offer my people o know such thing as a dean's burn out rusty than a adrenals do not actually a burn out a but some people have a ma decanal in sufficiency soondrum other people have but adrenals at a justchronically rankyiu ow a up enough for in nor aneffern in yet what is all eat the wrong times vascular ye ye that there is a great questions and i think the answers to them have yet to be discovered the connections between our perfect and our central nervous system but we know that there are beautiful connections and it is untapped source of being able to manipulate our brains is to work through our bodies and a our adrenals do great things they constrict our blood vessels causing higher blood pressure which help blood rush out tell the extremities that need blood a devour muscles for example for running away from the lion a or the tiger or when a ring a gran thatlineare working a yet i re catching a than an watching a try yet a the adrenals help our hearts bump faster muscles get profuse with them a blood it needs a it diverts blood and everything away from our a part sympathetic system which is rest an digest am we do not really need to digest that croissant when a running for a train we can do that later am it is doing really important things what we do not know because it does not cross the good brain barrier is how that affects the brain and whether or if we can independently activate outdid i a adrenals a when a time in our brain thinks that we should be fine and calm and asleep a how our brain detects that an is it a feed back through our heart is racing and an our brainstends as what is going on my heart is a acing and then wakes us up and then our hearts were racing together with our rain racing we we just do not know the answers to these questions yet n there are some good studies old studies am but we need a lot more there will another another nod to the fact that this lots of great work on going ye and still to do of you to tell us about some of the work that you are doing more recently on the relationship between sleep and opiate use withdraw relapse and in an craving just addiction generally i get a lot of questions about people trying to come off penciday as o pens or on people's challenges with penciday spin and other types of edition a ye what what is the role of sleep in a diction and recovery from a diction and opiate in particular ma o this is a very young aria and in fact my laboratory is just started i have a graduate student who is been in my favor just one year she is done amazing work already but completely ground breaking work and what she has discovered already we do not have the paper out yet that a were working on it is that a when animals with draw from opiate and this has been sort of replicated in other ways with other times of things a our sleep is disturbed our sleep is terribly disturbing the amount of sleep disturbance predicts relapse behaviors than you might think well course you are going to relapse if you cannot sleep because opiate calm you down will learnt reasons why opiate calm you down is because the locus arils again we spot is covered with opiate receptors and that ore normally really responsive to our indigenous opiate am and what what happens when were pleased for example or laughing or whatever and dogs opiate a captivate those receptors in locustrilis and calm it down and it actually a suppresses locustrilis activity makes us happy and relaxed one of the things reasons why opiate are addictive is because it also calms us down and makes us relaxed abut the problem with exogenous opiate is that they really but strongly bind thieves receptors on our locustrilis and if you take and to exogenous opiate again and again your recovering from surgery for example take this pain medications is that our locustrilo struggles to do what disposed to do which has keep us awake and learning and and concentrating on things it will down regulate it will internalize these receptors that or normally only occupied by analogous opiate and and it will do this it will change our genes that our associated with producing these receptors so you actually have very many fewer receptors the locus rolls at we staring wakefulness can fire and help us to do these things learn about our environment and if you long term reduce the number of receptors out there a then when you with draw the exogenous opiate artist not enough of your indigent opiate to to be able to reoccupy those few receptors that are there and our locustrilis has nothing to calm a down any more no pacifier and it just fires and fires and fires and that phasic and tonic high activity stresses us out because it is normally associated with stress and any endogenous stress or that adds to that and also activates her locus riles there is nothing to calm a down again and it just keeps firing it disturbs our sleep and that is why may be sleep disturbance is a an indicator of a hyper active locus serious and and such a good predictor of relapse behaviors because nobody likes to live in that high stress state and they will do anything to get back to normal the rob with with am taking these drugs is that it it leaves you re excited and shortness i acid relaxed and happy but then the you come off it it your worse than when the when you were at base line you take it again m it only brings you up this far because your few receptors when you come off it your down even more depressed and an anxious and a depressed as a word i use loosely and that is not but i certainly central nervous system depression to in sleep are less motivated that sordid ye i mean our locus crisis's actually it is a it is a the anxiety kind of depression actually anxiety related depression yes we do not know yet what and there is some good research going on right now what could restore our own androgen's receptors that our own erogenous opiate can properly calm or locuserilis once that they have been tamped down by exogenous opiate but that would be really one way that you can access m the sleep disturbance we talked about sleep and the importance of sleep in terms of learning an memory the importance of the structure of the ninety minutes cycle for all of that you can imagine if your sleep is disturbed by too much locusrialous activity teethe the structure and the function of those sleep spindles and that theta doing remsleep and the and the lack of nope an errand all of those structures all those functions for for learning something new a new behavior that as as involved the drugs becomes a compromised and that is something that tan colugos in collaboration with camera kennel at you see ala that we are we are looking at hows learning and memory affected by the sleep disturbance if their way we can in animals that one coming off of opiate can we restore their sleep to normal that then they are less likely to a duly relapsed kinds of behaviors fascinating in ism i we will certainly have to have you back on to tell us the results of those studies meanwhile i think for any one whose trying to a come off opiate a exaugin of soviets and restore these systems a what ism hearing is that it is going to take some time but that any and all things that people can do to buffer there healthy normal sleep architecture morning and daytime sunlight limiting bright light exposure lowering the temperature at night a number things at we have talked about the on yourself do an anything i were sly tears meditation whatever it is the helps you call myself for sleep ya i would as would facilitate not just sleep but perhaps even accelerate the the recover and a and shorten this period of withdraw which from the questions i get him from what i hear a can be absolutely brutal i can imagine i had to take opiate for i only took it for three days after giving birth to my a first submitting second son one of them and a and just i just said after three days this is enough ism just going to try titan all and a id i weaned myself not weird i outdid a sudden sharp cut off and even though i felt i did not get the high o outhits when i was taking the a tiling a can holding a when i when you that boy it was pies times one hundred i was anxious an upset at little things aid thankfully only lasted o few hours but if i had taken it for a week or two weeks who knows if i my indoors opiate receptors would have been permanently down regulated and i would have been an atilt an adept i would have been addicted i shown thin an adit there is negative connotations as just a very physiological state a no judgments at all associated with it a ye the powerful powerful pain killers but can also alter you are entire brain and require it well a all the more reason why i many others are grateful that your doing this work to figure out ways that people can recover a more quickly and more thoroughly i must say you have taught us a tremendous amount in a in a relatively short amount of time about the architecture of sleep the different phases the relationship between sleep and dreaming and this incredible structure locus studios and ism happy we also got into the ponds that just heights me betas the we rarely talk about the ponds on this podcast is such an interesting structure a sex differences a that are important creativity and problem solving and a an drama sleep spindles just such a wealth of information and much of it that is actionable for people firs sell i want to say thank you for taking the time to sit down and have this conversation that many people are sure to benefit from we'll one o thank you for doing the work you do even though ism a fellow now biologist i think that a it is not often that a we take a step back and realize that it is really the work of a hard thinking hard a strongly motivated a pies stand per principal investigator by the way p eyes yourself graduate scents and stocks that really drive the discovery forward and that lead to these new therapeutics am physicians are wonderful clinicians are absolutely wonderful but clinicians do not develop new treatments they they only implement the ones that researchers discovers an thank you for being a brain explore witching am with a focus on a growing the good in the world i know i speak for everybody when i say thank you much thank you much and think for being an amazing inter your you brat out out of me in a coherent for fashion that normally i cannot do when am speaking in public i don oo that i heard your lectures and their super i direcpublet some of the other one they u and i as one to put to plugin for graduate students in general and them key an amazing roll that they play in research am i ism a pig as you said i us to be a graduatestuden in a nostoc training myself doing all of this on the ground hands on experimentation it is hard to do it is hard to do ride hard to think through all of that now i my pi i get to be an i dead person in just say hey why do not you do this and my an nobody will think about that and they of course intellectually contributes much to these a the planned experiments but they also do the really hard work and i just want to say thank you graduate student a thank you to my graduate students and all graduate students out the think were old under paid and and endless and to the major institutions stamdfor you sheila and all other major institutions pay them more please yes we need them an a no to have a standard of living yen not ism not afraid to say that not my primary employer ya them more they need it they deserve they deserve i absolutely great well we will absolutely have you back again if you will if you will be willing and m meanwhile we will direct people to where they can learn more about you and your exciting work and once again thank much thank you much thank you re joining me today for my discussion about sleep mental health physical health and performance with doctor gene to i hope you found it to be as in formative and as actionable as i did in fact ism already implementing the regularity of bedtime plusserminis half an hour in order to get that growth form on release and i can already see both my sleep scores improving end my feelings of daytime vigor and focus and other markers of sleep health improving as well if your learning from vendor enjoying this podcast please subscribe to a

welcome to the hubermanscience sciencepacti am drew supermen and om a professor of neurobiology and theology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor avid eagle doctor eagle is the associate chair of psychiatry in behavioral sciences at stamford university school of medicine he is also the director of the stamford center on stress and health doctor eagle is both a researcher and a cognition meaning he runs a laboratory that studies the brain and the body and neural mechanisms of how the brain and body interact and he sees patients as a psychiatrist at stamford his work is incredibly unique in that it bridge's mind and body but it also has a particular focus on the clinical applications of hypnosis as you will learn to day hypnosis is a unique brain state in which neural plasticity the brains ability to change in response to experience may be heightened and indeed the use of clinical hypnosis by doctor eagle and colleagues has been shown to improve symptoms of stress chronic anxiety chronic pain and various other illnesses including many psycheatricalnesses and even outcomes in cancer today we discuss hypnosis in the context of what is called self hypnosis to distinguish it from stage hypnosis many of you are probably familiar with stage hypnosis which is really about a hypnotist getting a person to due things that a would not otherwise due in contrast clinical hypnosis and the use of hypnosis for the treatment of various ailments of mind and body is vastly different it involves getting people to change their brain state and to use that brain state as a portal to make a adjustments in their brain and body and other aspects of their biology an psychology that benefit them and it is been shown over and over again in studies by doctor eagle and colleagues that those changes can occur extremely quickly now not everybody can be hypnotized as readily as the next and to day we also discuss a simple test developed by doctor eagle that can help you determined whether not you have a high medium or low degree of what we call hypnotize ability doctor single is truly an expert in the aware he has published over four hundred and eighty journal articles one hundred and seventy book chapters on hypnosis and on things psychosocial oncology which is the interaction of mind and body in the treatment of cancer and cancer outcomes on stress

research done in the special lab at stamford unlike a lot of hypnosis as out there and resources for hypnosis it was developed with clinical treatments in mind today we also discuss the use of breastwork and ism very fortunate that my research last stamford has been collaborating very closely with doctor speak in testing and developing specific breastwork protocols to adjust mine in body for things anxiety improving mood and improving sleep based on his incredible and unique expertise and the clarity with which doctrospeagal communicates information i anticipate that you will really

can you tell us what is hypnosis ah hypnosis is a state of highly focussed attention i it is something looking through the telephonalends of a camera in consciousness what you see you see with great detail but devoid of context am if you have had the experience of getting caught up in a good move that you forget your watch in moment inter the imagine world your part of the moving not part of the audience your experiencing it you are not evaluating it that is a hypnotic experience than many people have in their every day lives is any experience that really draws us in hypnotic in that sense or am me give a different a example if ism watching a sports game and ism really wrapped up in the game but i am also in touch with how it makes me feel in my body con a registering the excitement are the anticipation is that a state of hypnosis also because you mention there is kind of an a a narrowing of context but a kind of losing of the self orbs it is do have that right yes it is true that your it to the extent that yours somatic your body experience is a part of this the sport event that you are engaged with it'd say that is a self altering hypnotic experience if your physical reactions are distracting you or a make you think about something else that is when i it is it is less hypnotic and more just one of a series of experiences oka i have to ask how do you get into this business of hypnosis because am i think for most people when they hear hypnosis for they think about hypnosis thinking of stage hypnosis and i think of somebody with a pendent going back and forth of people upon a stage am you behaving abnormally for the entertainment of others ye am how did you get into hypnosis as an interest as a practise am and if you would could you contrast the sort of hop noise that you do in the clinical sitting with the ort of hypnosis s that a stage hypnosis sure well am it is something of a genetic illness in my family of both of my parents were sechiatris and psychoanalyst and they told me i was free to be any kind of we iatric i wanted to be here i am am my father a was training to be a psychoanalyst in nineteen forty a three and am he a ran into a view's refuge he who could not serve in the army but who had studied hypnosis and actually it would interest you in doing youropthemological research he had a a smallpox sort right the middle of his forehead and he did for instinct examinations and he noticed that some of the prisoners would focus on that spot on this forehead and then closed their eyes and seemed to go to sleep but they were in some altered state he got interested in hypnosis he used it for basically and his name was guitar on aschapinberg and am he offer to teach young society's how to use hypnosis when they went off into the war and he trained my father a and he my father got off the analytic couch and asked yo men e teethe analyst mentioned it to him that i we found out about it and my father said did i say something wrong in an lysis wisely talking to me oh and am he found it very useful in helping soldiers who acute pain when they were wounded and helping people with conversion post dramatic stress disorders and when he came back he went back to his training a but am he still a sort of interested in it and he had his one of his supervisors was freedom from ramen who was a very famous psychoanalyst and he he said that he had been told to stop doing hypnosis because he would ruin his reputation as an enlist and she set him what he is worried about your reputation for you are going to give a course at the institute in hypnosis and i know you ring to do it because i am going to take it he was teaching freedom from ramen hypnosis and he just kept doing and and after a while he discovered that he was getting better results with a few sessions of hypnosis than he was with daily psychoanalysis with his patients and he switched his practice and the dinner table conversations we pretty interesting and occasionally when he was making a move of a patient i would get to watch that and when i a went to medical school i forget all take of course that with tom jacket ho was ta cherish the city mas general was teaching in who was a very interesting course and the day that converted me was a i was doing my rotation o children hospital in boson and the nurses telling me a speak o your n patient as an astatic and room for thirty seven or something and ism just following the sound of the weeks down the hall i go in the room to a sixteen year old girl knuckle's wite both upright in bed struggling for breath an hear the weeping she would twice said subcutaneous up an effed to work they were thinking about general an as thesis and starting iron steroids and her mothers the a crying and am i said i dontknow what else to do i said not to learn a breathing exercise she knows and a i got her harmonized and then i realized we had not on to ask in the course yet i made up something very complex i said each breath you take will be a little deeper and little easier and within five minutes she is lying back in bed her uncles are not whine she is not weeping her mothers stopped crying the nurse ran out of the room and the intern my intern comes to find me and i figure house going to having on aback and say nice top spell he said the nurse has filed to complaint with the nursing supervisor that you violated a massachusetts law by hypnotizing a minor without parental consent and i thought well that is nice i doubt there is a law this the interns says you gent a have to stop doing this wither and i said why he said it is dangerous i said you are going to give her generalize these and put her on serous and talking to ears dangerous said well you'll have to do it and i say el tell you what take me off the case if you want but ism not going to tell a nation of in anything i know is not true there was a battle over the week end about what to do in the the intern the chief resident standing were all arguing about it and on money the came back with a radical idea they said let us ask the patient i do not think that ever been done to children before and she said all i this she would been hostile every month for three month instant is that radius she did at one subsequent hostilisation but after that went on to study to be a respiratory traps and i thought that anything that can help a patient that much violate a non existing massachusetts law frustrate the nursing supervisor had to be worth looking into i just kept doing it i discovered that they're ever all my classmates and medical school had just read the new issued the new inland journal and had some new medication to suggest and i would you no surgeons would say look if you can help this guide with this pain or is anxiety anything above the neck that is yours do it single i was having fund and being able to learn how to help people and away that just otherwise was not being done and it got me thinking about the fact that we are born with this train but we do not have a users manual for it and we do not use it yearly as well as we can an that something your researches all about too and and i thought i want to to wont understand this better and i want to see where we can do stage shipment was strive me not they they make fools but of people am there was one a might might this a case my father was in wile he got a call from the was to colombia he got a call speak you got a come we this woman shes in the yare and shes in some kind of weird upset stay that am happen and at turned out she would been on tho show with the stay hypnotist a who and what they do by the ways they they cymbal around they have a the beginning of the show they don't described somebody once they were doing this they get a bunch of people up they do what amount it hypeotizability testing to see if people and they they get the ones who are the most hypnotizable she was the one and he said there is now a little bird in your hand and you are going to play with a bird and she starts to cry and scream and he just gets her off the stage cause it is very upsetting and she is wanting round new york city in the middle of the night dissociated and brought to clubland that is where my father for she was still in a kind of uncomfortable transfer state and it turned out that she was the trophy wife of a very wealthy guys and she felt a bird in a gilded cage and to her that image just triggered all of this sense of dissatisfaction and discomfort fear about her life and he was able to get her your anted and talk whether about what she was going to do with her life but i do not stage hypnosis you making fools out of people m and you are using the fact and that is what scarce people about hypnosis they think you are losing control your gaining control selfhagnosis is a way of enhancing your control over your mind and your body it can work very well but because it gives you a kind of cognitive flexibility you are able to shift sets very easily youth give up judging and valuating the way yo usually do and see something from a if different point of you that is a great therapeutic opportunity but if misused it could be a danger to and that is what scarce people about it it it is that very ability to suspend critical judgment and just ravening experience and see what happens that can be a great their peptic opportunity but if somebody is miss using it it can be away to a people and there are plenty of examples of people having fantasies imposed on them that they come to think o reality it is not unusual these days it is it is an ability that if people learned to recognize and understand it can be a tremendous disputer cruel have been stage hypnotized and have been clinically hypnotized many times through a self hypnosis to i will to ut later and and then know we have plans for you to hypnotize me to day you have done it once before and m didn't very hypnotizable are we both know i i yo will talk about how one can engage their hypnotize ability shore but the stage hypnosis was interesting this is in college show know they brought someone out to the dormitory and a i recall been one of the people that was selected and a and reengaging in very bazaar behavior right it was not thoroughly embarrassing but it was pretty embarrassing and then being sent off the stage and as i was exiting suddenly screaming something out because he he planted a suggestion of some sort i and then i was told to look in my pocket and there was it a i think a torn up dole big l there a bunch of things that i have vague recollection of but it raises it of a set of questions a that really boil downs you it as a bale just always think that there is no there is no events in the brain their their processes and hypnosis we know has an induction then one is hypnotized i imagine and then sends this woman in this example of the the bird on an being in being distraught in york city is a failure to exit the my hypnotic state do we know what sorts of brainareas are active during the induction the let us call the deep hypnosis and then whats shutting off for changing as people exit hypnosis yes yes we do we study that we very interested in that and we a did a study where we selected highly and non hypnotizable people we could do the comparison and then hypnotize him in the function on our eye scanner and we found three things characterize the intern into the hypnotic state the first is turning down activity in the dorsal into singular quite the a we is in the central frontmental part of the brain as you you well know and it is it is part of what we called ta sailings network i it is a e conflict detector if your a engaged in work and here allowed noise that you thing might be a gunshot that is your inter lingulate quarter saying hay wait am in use this subpotential danger ever there you better pay attention to it it say it compares what you are going with what else is going on and helps you decide what to do and as you can imagine a turning down activity in that region make it less likely that you will be distracted and pulled out of whatever you're in and in another study we found that highly hypnotizable people even without feeling being hypnotized have more functional inactivity between the dc c the inter singular quarter and the left or sold prefrontal quarter o which is part of the a key region in the executive control that work when you are engaging and task here cant enacting a plan your writing an paper you are doing what every are doing that is the the retinal quarter is doing that and if that is coordinated we found more functional cognac a inactivity when one is up the others up when one is down the others down that coordination implies that the brain is saying oke go ahead i know what you are doing carry out that plan and do not worry about other possibilities two other things happen when people are hypnotized one is that that deep of we has higher functional inactivity with the insole another part of the sailings net work its a part of the mind body control system sensitive too it is happening in the body its part of the pain network is well but it is also a region of the brain where you can control things in your body that you would not think you could for example we did a study years ago where we took people a i were highly hypnotizable hypnotize them and told them to a mad we went on imaginary culinary tour a we would they would eat their favorite foods and we found that they increase their gastric gadid secretion by eighty seven per cent their stomach was acting as though was about get i mean there was one women it was vivid for her that half way through she said let us stop ism full eating these having ever e having never actual no incredible and then we got them to relax and think of anything but food or drink and we got a forty per cent decreasing gastric gas secretion they could and that was deal of see through the insolent telling the stomach you are getting food or you are not getting food and even we injected them with pentigastron which tigers gastric visibilities and even then in the hypnosis condition that had a nineteen per cent reduction i gastric gadid the brain has this amazing ability to control was going on in the body and ways that we do not think we have ability o control that just wen example that is to deal pie the insolent connection the third thing that happens and this relates to what you did on the stage is you have inverse functional inactivity between the deal of see and the posteriors singular quarter the posters singular i is part of the defaultmode networks in the back of the brain i and it is it is in aware whose activity goes down for example in mediators and in meditation your supposed to be selfless you suppose to thyself is an illusion your spot at a dissolve and just experience things and when you are doing that the poster sing of is decreasing in activity the inverse connection is ism doing something but ism not thinking about what it means for me i may not even remember much of it if i do i do not care of that much about it and that is part of the dissociation that occurs with hypnosis get's how you put things outside of conscious to wariness and do not worry about what it means it also ads to cognantoflexibility if you are thinking well people me do not usually do this that may inhibit you from in acting a new form of psychotherapy for example that you have never done before i but if your having this decreased activity in the party you brain the reflects on what it means i you are more likely to be cognately flexible and willing to give it a try and that is one of the therapeutic advantages of hypnosis as well fascinating and it is really a em to put m an embarrass you here a little bit om positive sense it is at your laboratory is really the the one that is pioneered brain imaging of hypnotic states and om it sounds it that is my under standing is that e a arabia i mean there are other people than excellent research too or but the arraingell and country all an several other people but we are one of the leading lampion and our imaging if hypnosis i have to ask about attention deficit o inactivity disorder i get a lot of a questions about this and i think a lot of people to struggle with holding attention nowadays is because of a it be and interference with phones and devices and and i of course there is a lot of a clinically legitimate eighty high to out there but the want or describe the am horsily inter singular and the sailings network in this a conflict attractor of et my focussing on something over my splitting my attention how intractable mi seems to relate to some extent activity in the worse a intern singular quarter a do people with eighty high to am dis play disruptions an elements of these net works and a has hypnosis ever been used to a for self hypnosis i should be is distinguish from a stateshipness as clinical and self hipness has been used to enhance people's ability to focus and whole attention am because that such a built an component of the hypnotic state it it is a great question there are there is sort of two ways to think about it in terms of enhancing focus yes it has been very helpful am in teaching people tod just prepare your mind to narrow and in focus on something and when i know when you're really engaged in reading something or you are writing a pay ma it'll have that sometimes i'mthing o god i i have to do this for another hour other times an hour go by and ethic great because when you are in that it feels apelike to you are just assembling the parts of the puzzle and putting him together it is fund you just get absorbed that for me that is a hypnotic experience when ism have not trouble when ism struggling sometimes doing things of hypnosis can help ism not an extra on eighty h t am my impression is that you wrist that these are people who are constantly distracted and and rather rigid the other part of it is they are easily intractable the very upset when they get distracted and a rather rigid and what they want to would ten to in what they cannot i think if the way of controlling this intractability frankly ah i my guess is that many people with at et would not be that hypnotizable but i have not event studied it a it it it is possible that for some people with that disorder training in self hypnosis my help but we would have to see how hypnotizable they were and take it from there the want a return to some of the underlying nerd networks and the a clinical applications but a what sorts of am things aside from the agma am have you used hypnosis successfully for at or have others used clinical hypnosis for and are there any particular areas of of psychiatric challenges are illnesses i guess are called am that are particularly am amenable to hypnotic treatment yes there are hypnosis is very good as a problem focus a treatment am it is really ts the oldest western conception of a psychotherapy and it can be used for specific problems and a way this very helpful a were founded very helpful first does reduction am for helping people the a were old deal in mistress these was i and it is helpful that mind body connection is very helpful because i part of the problem mistress is your perception you mention it earlier in a but a good sense your the football gambler something and you feel the physical reaction that can be a reinforcing thing while this is exciting lets do it it can also be very distracting your worried about getting covet or your worried about a am other physical problem you have and you notice it in your body you body dances up i start to sweat the sympathetic nervous system go as your parade goes up and when you notice that you think o god this is really bad and then you feel worse it is a snowball rolling down hill and and then you feel worse and then your body gets worth if noses can be very helpful in dissociating nomadic reaction from psychological reaction we teach people to imagine their body floating somewhere safe and comfortable a bath to lake a hot over floating in space and then picture the problem that the distressing them on an imaginary screen with he ruling a outer which o see on the screen you keep your body comfortable at this point you cannot you still cannot control distress but you can control your physical reaction to it and that start you feeling more in control least this one thing i can manage and then you can use it to think through were visualize through one thing you might do about that stressor if noses is very helpful in controlling mind body interaction an relation distress i it is very helpful for people to get to sleep a are having a lot of fun with that i it's getting you make from people who said i have not slept right fifteen years and now for the first time m ism listening your a and i can sleep at night it is very helpful and againyou know it if you wake up in the middle of the night i i tell people do not look at the clock that is an arouse of cue you just you wake up more a but mat picture whatever you are thinking about a working about on that imaginary screen while your bodies floating watch your own moving but keep your body floating and many people can use that to get back to sleep have been using that that self hypnosis for sleep for a long time am and now the revery a not will talk about our relationship to the reversal an its uses i find incredibly useful for falling back a sleep in the middle the night and and it raises that a question a have found and i think i understand the strictly that one can do self hapnosistrin the daytime and then if there is an assure that comes up later for instance a oneself hypnosis for stress reduction away from the stressful of that to prepare one to deal with stress batter or do i hypnosis for improving the return to sleep and that can be done when you actually want to go to sleep but it is that kind of a training up of these networks i all right is is there evidence that these bring networks actually form stronger a connections when people myself hypnosis over time a well there is a rule in aerobiology as the neurons that fire together wire together a san carl shots yes grot donate had by the way ton there there is a there is a wides red myth in the world that a is enforcing all over the inter net which is that the fire together wire together wat said by the psychologist donate have dona had to many important things but it is the gerbil just care shat was the eagle yes is that standard but was also barely and hazard a that to decent schools a that but is that a standard a who set fire together wire together and a man deserves the right credit for that statement of yes with repeated a use of self hypnosis am one could imagine that these set works are getting stronger i w i would i would think we do not have evidence of that yet a but a long terns potentiation a i provides a pathway and you describe them on your program a number of times that allow for repeated activation of a net for to actually build new connections that that work and at the least even from a learning and memory point of view a ' memory is all a net work of associations that is how we remember things am and i that the example id to give as you go back to your great school and and you see these little tiny lockers and the no size is all wrong and you suddenly have a flood of memories that you you r obviously stored there by you just in think of it context and association is what memories about if you start to a quire memories about a problem one thing we use hypnosis for is treating phobias for example and the problem with people who have phobias cairplain phobias or i crossing a brave or being up high is that the more they avoid it the more the only source of associations and memories is their fear they will not have any good experiences with it cause they avoid it you must get back on the horse after full of kind of thing and and with hypnosis if you can start people able to manage therinxiety enough that they can have more a wider a ray of experiences they start to have a net work of associations that is not negative and may even be positive it is almost a a sorry interrupt but i have to ask it is it is most a a exposure the be done in the mind yet it is always in the mind i mean even exposure to if i have a snake phobia to which i i do not i do not snakes but i do not think it qualifies as a full blown phobia thing of a healthy fear of snake a but if let say i had a snake phobia it that typical am e approach in a would be cogon behavioral approaches right would be that show a picture of a snake a the a rubber snake than real sing of tvhentuu eversions a holding of to constrictor something that with it that is all in the mind because that is all translate into nervous system signals ut with hypnosis some that you can give a number of positive experiences without having to use any props without having to bring any animals into the rang i drive some one across the bridge is that right yes i had a woman who was a very successful business woman highlevel and a corporation i had a terrible dog phobia and i i had her imagine that somebody brought in the dog to the room and i said what you doing and you could see her getting tense and she said ism waiting to see what the dog does and i said if somebody who works for you comes in to your office would you freeze in wait to see what they did and she said of course not i tell him what to do and i said well you demobilizing yourself the powers with the dog is with you imagine might you might do to engage the dog and and help control the situation and she said thanks and and this reminds me one one of my favorite stories about hypnosis that my father was seeing a woman and who lived in the town an had not and had a horrible dog phobia and she drop things she would still coffee n if she saw a dog she would time her trips to the store when she thought it was least likely the peopled be waging dogs now that would be possibly i have every one ever rid lied a fleet of french bull dog right take h answer easily i he taught her to think of dog as a friend have a neighbor who had a dog bring the dog over but hold the dog by the collar and make sure and gradually she was able to stroke the dog and say dog friend an distinguished between wild and tame animals there are animals you should be afraid of it she seemed to be doing better he called back about three months later and ask for her and i said well was calling to sun kidney said doctor eagle and the boyhood that is weird and my father said what is heard he said eagles in heat she she had brought a dog love and named its feel ti a wish transferee i love it but but it really speaks to the power of this and i i brings me back to this i issue mum what is different about what your father did in that case with this with this woman in terms of what happened in hypnosis that allowed her to go from being completely terrified of dogs to owning a dog and say ma it after your father win i fine amusing ah but that is different then just the two of them sitting down and talking about right i in therapy the narrative is a huge comportment and in hypnosis narrative as a huge component it must be that the brain state is what is really different because i we will talk about trapan in a few minutes but yo i think people who have drama or phobias certainly i could have a conversation about it they some of them might frees up some of them might lose their articulation and forth but what is different about that state that combines with narrative you think to allow these under lying heroin that works to to engage her to change as i find this fascinating because it were every attempt that a a dealing with stress arepobia in the clinical setting involve some discussion about what it is if but here were not talking about any medication being introduced at least not in these particular circumstansime i i just i realize its kind of an obvious cession the has to be some difference in brain activity but i find that to be incredible that the control variable there is the brain state it is not what spoken you raising a couple of very important as these into i i know we we talked earlier about with systematic these sensitization where you sot of lay out of hierarchy of things into one at the time i think of this is unsystematic these sensitization because your changing mental states and if and i think there is more and more evidence that mental state change itself has the repute potential were seen that with steaming treating depression the essociateanic drug a ye we see i we know it every morning when we wake up that problem we now you make the mistake of reading an anti email at eleven mama to know what to do you wake up in the morning thing oh that idiot i hers when i mentor you knowing just changing mental state itself has the republic potential and i think we under estimate our ability to regulate and en change responses to be cognitively emotionally and somatically flexible and we do things you write that follows similar principles of facing a problem seeing it from a different point of view and you have done a really a nice podcast on prom and stress and how you have to expose yourself to it not avoid at as we talked about before and then find some way to reconnect to it to substitute something that can make you feel good rather than bad om that you activate other centers of the brain mesilinbe reward system and i do that with hypnosis and you can do it much faster people do not think they can but they can if your having right now that physical experience ism thinking about this tat ism not feeling his bad as i used to om that can be a powerful thing and you can do it with hypnosis i had a woman came to see me who had suffered an attempted rape ut was getting dark she was coming back from the grocery store in the sky grabs here and once to get her up into her apartments outset her apartment and she starts fighting with him and she wings up with a baler's skull fracture he runs away on the cops come since she had not been are they left they were an interested an she wanted to usignosis to get a better image of what the sky looked which is a painful upsetting thanks she was quite hypnotizable i got her floating i she your safe and comfortable now nothing can happen that will harm your body but on on the left side of the screen i want you to picture the sky and his approaching an what is happening and she said i really if the light win was getting dark i really cannot see much of his facial features but i do recognize something i had not allowed my self to remember if she gets me upstairs he does not just want to rite me he is can o kill me and in some ways what she was seeing was even worse yet ow you are thinking good eagle you made her even more frightened than she was before but as you had pointed out in europeat es the stress lecture you have got to confront the drama to to restructure your understanding of it on the other side of the screen i had her picture i i what what are you doing to protect yourself and everybody in a promise situation engages in some strategy of prose protection an that is the sailings the work kicking and and i she said what he surprised an om fighting that heart he did not think i would and she realized on the one hand that it was even worse than she thought it was but on the other hand that she actually probably saved her life and it was a way of helping her restructure her experience of the drama and make it more tolerable that help with her she did not reckon she could not identify the guide but it helped her restructure and understand her experience and that something that you can do in just talking straight out psychotherapy but sometimes you can do what hellish to pasture and more efficiently using hypnosis and there is one rand of my trial out of israel that shows that landing hap nosiest to pets he treatment actually improves outcome a i id it is a way of accomplishing things that we understand in the broader psyche therapy world but much more quickly and and sometimes effectively tat sounds going into somewhat into the states that one is thing to deal with but then dissociating from that state is key and i could imagine i and not been open about the s on very spot cast o em done a lot of i and and access over the years anybody i experience myself that in in tho sessions depending on how i show up to them i might just get in kind of a laundry lest of what happened as a postally feeling anything round what happened i and i think people probably vary in the extent to which state can drop into feeling states and it can depend on the day it can be refound and how well a you slept the night before and on there the wanting i might and and an that is there is a notion the late cordon bower he did we just had a memorial for cordon i at standard he died about a year ago brilliant cabana psychologism when the founders of cognac of psychology at standard and and a great picture he most he almost became a majorly picture but he decided to go to rascal instead and ism ism glad he did i but cordon i helped establish the concept of state dependent memory that when your innoccertain mental state you enhance your ability remember things about it and the soot of the bad example of that is the drunk who hides the bottle and cannot remember where he put it until he gets drug again s in that same mental state people go into dissociative states a when they traumatize in a way hypnosis is helping them remember and deal with the memories better because their mora in the mental state that is more what happened and most great victims will tell you i was floating above my body feeling sorry for the women being assaulted below a a people intromatic episcopate just say know i blank out i do not know what is tapping on on auto pilot and that is a kind of self hypnotic state when you use hypnosis to help them deal with the dramatic memory your making the state therein right there in your office with you more congruent to the state they were likely in when the drama happened and i think that is part of what help's facilitate treatment of drama related disorders i see that its me have to ask every question i have to ask i because i really feel it as a almost a compulsion then if dissociation during a dramatic episode is for it is part of the adapt a strategy ram but it creates certain issues e creates problems right am why would something examine which creates a dissociative state be useful for the treatment of drama this is what i ism confused about these stays because a or colly card or authors also been on the carcass and and and his to workers a figured out ill can there's these layer one networks in court in the no creaks and those revolved in dessoci of stateancs were trying to gain some understanding of how seamen works at a nerd level i it does seem a as if for certain populations its a can be a useful treatment i do not know i never tried it i don't now what the current status of that is but it is legal it is allow at least and it is everyday proved and it is in use why would dissociate dissociy of states be useful if this if some element of dissociation is what a gave rise to the drama aroma memory in the first place well i yet car of brilliant paper in nature where he it was from from rats to humans and one paper and he showed that there is this rhythmic discharge in the reterosplano region that is associated that is triggered by codeine and and the rats actually showed does society of behavior in that they would touch a hot red that they ordinarily would not and they did not seem to have much pain in their paw and he then had a a a male subject to had a implanted electro human a human have tore human subject an and a the electrodes had picked up this rhythmic activity and when they did he would report being in an dissociative state and his description was it is being the pilot of an airplane and then i felt myself walking out of the cockpit and the plain was still flying and as is terrifying ins a tin robe in my at at m ansaright but the the point is in a way the principal indeed is the principle you said run e to confront a dramatic situation before you can modulate your associations to it you have to accept it except the arousal put some boundaries around it and then figure out how you can approach that problem or how you did approach that problem from a different point of view it does not surprise i infant we have studied a people who dissociated during alone of create a earthquake and the oklenberkly fire storm remember both tho el earthquakes follow me then i move s out anal h northward ism going to cute both everyone her is ism sturdy to dissociate in a dissociation does compartmentalized experience but that means from the point of view of treating drama it it is an it is an inhibition you do not engagement it is it happened over there and i think what happens is that people i i sometimes too good at being able to separate themselves from the recollection it is in there somewhere it does not it is out of sight but is not out of mind it is having effects on you but you cannot deal with it you cannot reprocess i do think one reason redeem my work a it is a that in fact it allows you to keep to re a approach the dissociative experience in a way that you can then start to think about and do something about it and just the fact you can turn it on and off and that is also where hit self hypnosis's elf it is not something that just comes over you and happens to it something you can make happen you can control it you can do something with it you feel less helpless and out to control the essence of tram is helplessness it is not fear it is not pain it is helplessness you become an object you become just your body you do not control whit is going on a were not used to that you and have discuss this at this and the this brigand paper on anticipation of breathing and it is not whether you breathe inhale or exhale or hold your breath it is that if you think you can inhale and you cannot a that it is really upsetting understandably and it is the the issue is control and hypnosis which has this terrible reputation of taking away control is actually a superb way of enhancing your control over mind and body love that and it it reminds me that naming is important you almost wonder if a self hypnoses and clinical hadnocess had been called something else that it would have a separated out from state hipness in a way that would make it a less a mean a less scary weird a complicated for people to embrace a but you the arteries over having this discussion as i have old have had great experiences with hypnosis have seen the data of the otimetalotic clinical examples it is incredibly powerful and it wells right down to nor brain states am and yo i think in the ears come its going to become a more wide spread along those lines how quickly you have describe some a examples of people getting relief very quickly how permanent are those changes om is there a need for follow up and related to that ism sure a number of people are listening to this in inking wonderful id love to get hypnotize for any number of different things by doctor eagle a somebody else expert and clinic hypnosis but they might not have access to you or somebody on with similar training what is the power how how quickly does it work how long lasting are those changes and then is it necessary to work with a clinical hypnotists and is it better to do that than self hypnosis and one and forth maybe you just give us a a consort of the of the landscape of directed and and self directed treatment well typically most people start by coming to see a clinician me its better to see some one whose life has licensing and training in their professional discipline medicine colony industry whatever as there a lot of hipness is other who a i us hypnosis is hypnosis and and the key issue is somebody who can really assess what your problem is and make sure that your not talking some one into reducing their chestpain rather than getting their coronary artery problem cause they could have a real issue the cod rat hypnosis might a just but would not deal it the deeper underlying epithet is right on the other hand and typically when i use it with people i often only see them once or twice or periodically but not every week and curtail not every day if they have a pain problem d hypnosis is very helpful for pain and and when ism doing is a identifying how hypnotizable they are i give them a standard brief test of their ability to experience enosis and then going through as self hypos as exercise with them to deal with the problems seeing how they respond to it and then teaching them how to do it for themselves and in the old days i used to have them use their phone and and record a the that part of the sessions they could play back the hypnosis experience now we developed an at a revert that that a can teach people and step them through dealing with pain stress a focus a in insomnia and help people eat better and and stop smoking and not we have a elements that take about fifteen minutes and elements such just take one a two minutes that people can refresh and reenforce yoni hypnosis yeas one is and it to it is wonder to we one tor two minutes now and reminding that two thirds of people find it even just the one minute refresh her i helps them feel better there reporting they feel better the nice thing is you no right away wither its likely to help you or not and we found we have done studies looking at hypnosis for painfully in acute medical procedures we did a randomized trial that we published an alliance three conditions people getting arterial cut downs to a chemo embodied tumors in the liver or visualizereng a arteries to noses you do not use general in a seizure for this its very uncomfortable and people are anxious and we had three conditions one was standard care they could push a button and get opioid i give is during the surgery during the surgery the second is they could do that please they had a friendly nurse comforting them we controlled for pleasant attention and support and the third which we thought himself enosis for pain control yer your feeling you can change the temperature your your body is cool tingling an non your floating and i water and feeling comfortable a or go somewhere else leave your body were and go to a desert island and enjoy yourself and we found that it is about two and half hour procedure that if by the by an hour and a half the hypnoses group had reduce their pain by eighty present a compared to the standard regroup using half the amount of opiates they had few er complications and the procedure took seventeen minutes less time on average yet done because not only was the patient were relax was the treatments tap they could they were dealing with someone who struggling and uncomfortable we measured their anxiety and same thing theyvno sister i was worry they were all dead they had no anxiety after an hour and a half they were saying on fine and they were fine and and the standard regroup had five out of ten anxiety scores at that point we publish that in the lance at big randomize trial a if we had a drug they did that every hospital in the country would be using it now but there is no industry to push it that is part of what helped us decide that we needed to help people i don't do this with with revery and teach them how to do it and provide inter act of support for them to do it and does it the question though is does it work long turn cause what we can do acutely does not necessarily carry on we did randomized trial of women with medesthetic breastcanser they had advancing disease we met with them in a supportgroup once a week and taught himself hypnosis for fir stress and anxiety and pain control it than and by the end of a year a the treatment group had half the pain the control group did on the same and very low amounts of education it last and they would say when i felt that pain an my chest and thought it was an metastasis a busted the exercise i got myself in a warm bath that i felt fine a it it works because it becomes a skill that people acquire but they can tell right away whether it is likely to help them working with a cognition or an out using the after i other ways of helping them learn to use it as a skill the nice thing is you will know very quickly whether it is likely to help you or not and if it is you can learn to do it for yourself that is great and we will a again they will be long to revery in the caption at a available plan drew and i think a eventhough there is a nominal cost there i think that a the as you mention medications and other approach as to dealing with these problems are quite expensive and and potential have all the potential for sad affection things not that some of those are not also useful could i before you get to that just one thing we we have work very hard on the apt we have an eyes apt for apple we decided to to table for a moment redoing the enjoy at it is not it was available a a when we were working through the elective platform it is not at the moment but it will be soon i just not want people to be disappointed if they are looking for it for android it is it is on our agenda but we do not have it at the moment thanks for that clarification sorrowfully in time for both i get ask a lot about am obsessive thoughts are intrusive thoughts a else to get ask a lot about lust is there any evidence that hypnosis ourself at noses can be is for dealing with obsessive thoughts a sometimes there is some very obsessional people who just turn out not to be that hynotinesable for y and it is not random they they tend to be over controlling a flight they are all busy valuating rather than experiencing i know my people sounds it is something an adaptive a minds the for a lot of professions then er is and that we get trained up in that during school how to obsess over the am obsess over the you're social interactions am it is part of becoming a functional human being and yet i can take us down different we sometimes her do it i may noel tell you on example from extreme situations a could that you know you judging a valuating you are not letting yourself experience including emotionally i know somebody a who listens to the tapes from airplane to they go down they get the black box wan they listen to it and he said to me let us this professional he does this record know to now as professions what he did and cause they are trying to do action in prevention and how to handle things and he said that you worry about people panicking right and here these guides know that they have got thirty seconds or some forty five second and they are just going through their checklist he said there they do not panic enough there they are taught that this is what you do and and there is reason there is good reason for it but sometimes they overdo it and you know its it is painful to listen to this cause what is going to happen it is kind of a balance we have to hit and something u know we sometimes we get to emotional and too absorbed and you do not you are not withed enough to set of see other possibilities that can be a problem but on the other hands sometimes you are too rigid and control and you do not let your emotions guide you to what you need to do to protect yourself for protect others i would say in general that people with out see are in the less on the less hypnotizable side of the spectrum they are less likely to allow themselves to engage in any and the typical example is to checking with out sexy for example they do not remember whether they you'll lock the door or turned off to guess an the of and they keep going back an they keep there the value of component of the brain kind of overrides the experiential one and i sometimes people can get some ben fit but but they are not a group that i would select for being the most likely to respond myself hypnotic approaches a up are superstition similar superstitions i the i think that is more there are people i who are very hyptisable who keep getting caught up in things superstitions and there the imagination suppliance the reality and a we have seen a lot of that happening recently and i i think there am it is possible that they could be help by learning to sit of see it but put it in context you must see it from a from a different point of view i developed a pretty vicious superstition when i was in college and it was hard to break actually i was feel of when i talk to coalitions i have to reveal certain things about in mythology and idol get my bill later thank you a arteries i a ism just getting be i did i i had a habit of knocking on wood for things an i notice is started to i would i would i would sneak knocking on wood every one son while because i did not want people to thing i was doing too often ti star to realize that i it was becoming a little bit of a reflex and then i saw this incredible video from ben si levity's lab that hazard he studies motor patterns he has these rats that press different sequences of we of levers and turned is in order to get a pellet of food but that as they do that they will start to introduce these behaviors that have nothing to do with the actual lever pressing they start scratching their end there hind quarters and things that and their had and of their heads keeps me then were hats and flipping their ears and this is is a picture before throwing a a baseball that oh you do this we we start to incorporate motor behaviors that are unrelated to the outcome but we are mine somehow starts to think that they are necessary for the outcome and then even o tit i decide to break it by simply forcing myself did not do it fore not a week and then i seem a ridiculous thing to do new well not rosewood we cod response prevention and ever cause you said what what you do is you set up a new context in your brain where you get the outcome you want devoid of the the extraneous behavior now and i knew it was it was nuts right i knew as logical right but somehow the these things take on meaning right we talked about stress reduce the the utility of hypnosis a for stress reduction cobias pain am possibly we do not know but for a things eighty t and o so it just will depend on hypnotizeability it you talked about this a beautiful study on the a mess a a precancel am outcome er patience hypnotizeability is clearly a we y variable ye could you please tell us of what hypnotizability is how it is valuated and what the eagle oral test it i sure a hypnotizability is just a a capacity to have hypnotic experiences and we have a test call the hypnotic conduction profile we re give a highly structure hypnotic experience and the the old tradition and clinical i noise is was that you try much of different things talking walking upstairs and downstairs and other images and time what you say to the breathing of this subject in all that and the more you change what you do as a cognition the less you can make a variation and outcome an it can take a long time of twenty minutes thirty minutes and i just view that as a kind of complex not very effective way of assessing the persons hypnotic capacity we know that the pique period of of hypnotizability in the human life is the laden my years in childhood every right your old is in a trance all the time you know you call them in for dinner they do not hear you they do in their thing and that is why childhood is such a wonderful experience work in play or all the same thing and we try to make them into little adult which i think as a terrible mistake they in everything is fun for that my enjoy learning they enjoy everything what age a i the edit is likes to six to ten six to eleven then their playful they enjoy everything everything is sot of a game and fun and we try to make it miserable for them but they they have got it and then when what page called a a a more adult cognitive frame work where we learn abstract concepts we learned that even if one bottle looks bigger than the other that can have equal volume and we start imposing logic we are growing our deal of see at that point and imposing cogent of structure on experience a some people track to lose that hypnotic ability by the time you are in your early twenties a a your hypnotizability becomes extremely fixed and there was a study done it at standard tor earnest till gar fills onwards to this looking at a a they retract down students who were incite one had their hypnotizability measured and retested them blindly twenty five years later and the test retest correlation was you went guests hent of us of of guessing it on a point six something yet very close it was point seven i you would be point six on a twenty five year oral it is more stable than i cut over twenty five your intervals once you are at that point that is where you are what a the factors that that lead to that well and and what it means as at about a third of indulge or just not hypnotizable two thirds are about fifteen per cent or extremely hypnotizable and we can measure that and give it a number from sure to tent and that is very useful for some of my patients when i do it i say look ism sorry your n advise began to do something else no medication systematic desensitization mindfulness other things a or if the very hypnotizable i just go for it i do not do a lot of explaining people who are low to moderate hypnotizable explanations about what you are doing but then they can still get the benefits it helps me i my the nature of my treatment up with these people now the the iron is my father a used to use an i fixation induction he used to say look up at the stealing and and now close your eyes while you looking up to your very just your her yes he noticed he had too patients back to bag and one was a woman who it'd seen him work with who had hysterical seizure she would just suddenly start shaking and if we real suleptexsezurs now suit eyelet exit she hysteria hysteria and although some people have both that is the for some people real epilepsy becomes a frame work that gets elaborated on for when your stress you have seizure she just had suit epilepsy no a ye abnormality since she was really something to watch her husband had to move his work bench near the door that if she start to have a secure he could run home and and try and help her within it was that bad and he noticed that when she when she she did what you did when she looked up when she would have one of her seizure events all you see i sclera you do not see i was any more and she would start to see he he did a great thing with her he taught her to have seizures everybody else was telling her to stop he made her have one he hypnotize her let us go back to the last time you had one an sure enough she start to shake and gradually he make them smaller and smaller she was learning she could control she would have access it is with parties the and or you confront you do not avoid it you do not suppress it you confronted and figure out how to deal with it a the next patient he had was a rigid obsessional business man who wanted to stop you o being controlling and and and all this of remind me there was a new york or cartoon of the driver who comes to a yield sign and he yells never its always bee times there new you om nine you a and this guy when he tried to look up he could not keep his eyes up while he closed him and my a father started testing people and it seemed that there is a rough correlation between the capacity to keep your eyes up while you close them and measured hypnotizability that people who are listening what a might and and watching on didos this beglirol was involves looking up at the scalene of tilting that had back of selling my chin back and looking up the sealing out en i also directing my eyes upward an my eyes are open and then the the oral tessibals then closing the eyelids while the eyes her own owner o and weather or not the eyes roll back and as he said to then you see glare of the wife smaller of the white rat nine your very hypnotizable or moderately hypnotizable right was if the eyes move down and iris the colored part of the eye as the eyes close less hypnotize right see you can look us up on line there it just but speegale oral was and a and you will find it an and we are also in the due in actual a example of hypos is em on be later ria it is you are asking the brain to do something difficult to to keep the eyes up while closing the i lis and that is contradictory signals for the third fourth and six cranial or lucky i the control i movement you said the third fourth and six ye cranalner of nuclei and and there there your suspending one activity while asking them to do another and i movements have a lot to do with levels of consciousness the very acuoductol grey surrounds these cranial nerve newly eye and a when we you know we close our eyes when we sleep we have davit i movement when we dream most drugs that a get level of consciousness can affect eyes and o movements either the dilation or contraction of the pupils depending on whether its a stimulant or an opioid stimulants make the peoples e right yet this the logan amphetamine right you sarsen and ovoids you get constricted pupils is a apparent the parents looking in there gets coming in the door at at night there liking for right substance the use to right and there is something about the eyes that has a lot to do with level of consciousness that i man obviously you close rise when you go to sleep you have rapid eye movement when you are dreaming it is not surprising and there is there is an old end practice can looking at the third eye and i think part of the reason that this happens is were your looking up in the inside this this a third eye between the other two and your forehead a and i think it is because we are visual creatures were we are pretty pathetic from a physical point of view many animals can outrun us a and for out smell us or see of eagles can read could read news print tat a hundred yards and we cannot it is a there are major defensive sensory in put is vision and that is why animals predator animals have eyes in the front of their heads that they have very good detailed division a vision of prey were is prey animals deer have eyes on the side of their head they do not see things that well but they have a much bigger range of of potential to see threat and we mainly use in effect that interesting there been social entrapologist to say why to we gather where we do you on on coast lines and at the edge of a forest or something it is because you got protection in the back something cannot attacking from one side and you have a big vision of what might threaten you and we tend a be attractive to those kinds of a physical situations you love is us we love is this as a very calming they take us into that panoramic vision that is right and i did not notice but it turns out that most of the scenic spots at any location in national parks and we are were people naturally aggregated it was not a which makes sense over the out but that those am signs and locations were built up around at people's tendency an animal's tendencies o really is went you aggregate their yet there is a interested book on the history of the national parks that that says that they did not give a a a research study to support it but there was no mental massive you said that it is very interesting ye panorama and and visual boundaries are really interesting i think said that the eyes as we both know are two pieces of the central nervous system of the brain outside the an i used to say that the eyes are outside the skull and and a a anear thymol just sad am there wrote to me and am vehemently pointed out that they are outside the cranial vault s there outside the cranial to but they are to pieces of brain their out there and the you mention cranial nerves three foreign sex this isn't anger anatomy course but m but may we can go a little deeper there there you said there is contradictory activity looking up as controlled by a a the one set of cranial nerves and then the closing of the eyelids is clot is control by another cranial nerve no it is the same one i think it is six that that am you you lo when you close your eyes you activate am the now it is the facia i guess it is the facial nerve it is the seven sevens er but you are looking up you are activating the muscles a that force your eyes to look up and the the closing your eyelids normally relaxes those relaxes that upper movement because your eyes are closed and you do not need to do it you are breaking a to a usual customary matter the revery the hey i can even do it see i lady a it is the grubbing your romp and patting your head it is it is a admit there is a bit of a conflict there right but clinically it is been a good probe for you and it have your father as it speak seniors legal legal den a legal senior that develop as trying i us and am but the key is sue is this normally when we close our eyes also we are going to sleep your you are not worried about what is going on in the world any more here you are maintaining resting alertness you's your focussing but your turning inward that is an unusual state normally we do not we close our eyes periodically we have to but am when you close your eyes for some period of time it is normally to go to sleep and you are not worried about detecting risk or threat a it is it is an interesting state because you are turning inward basically you are looking up you are shutting your eyes and you are allowing whatever happens outside you to happen and focussing on what is going on inward it is a i think it is a signal to your brain to turn inward very interesting am and meditation of course could be done with eyes open but almost i always has done with eyes closed yes i that is right very interesting you can very quickly determined whether not some one is highly hypnotizable a not at all hypnotize we see about two thirds of people can be hypnotized right i have see a third cannot and but within the two thirds that can there is a range and you sue fifteen per cent of people fall into this highly hypnotizable category ti thing to be a member of i and does repeated use of self hypnoses or clinical hypnosis increase or change hypnotizability for those that can accessed in the first place i would say in general it may increase a little bit but not a hell of a lot and it is not worth the effort to increase your potability at that point it is worth trying to deal with the problem you are dealing with you can get better and using it at the level that you have there was a study done in which they tried to train people to be more hypnotizable and no obviously there subjective and behavior components to the test you can learn to do a little better on them but what we found was when we reanalyze this data that we could account for three times the final score based on the initial hypnotizability measurement rather than whether or not they had been trained to do better you can approve it a little but it is not worth the trouble got it along the lines of eyes and i movements a lot of interest out there about e m d a i movement to senses action reprocessing i i should per herself was o working not she was not outstamfor directly but was the local to to stamford a thinking a he it'll time i what are your thoughts on e m d are where is it useful where you think it is less useful a rather things that e m d r could be combine with to make it more useful am we get you knot the listeners of this precast come to i think come to the podcast with a range of backgrounds and interests am to me a make sense a why em d r it literalized i movements a might work given the new or data that it can suppress make the activity in some animals and animal models and a in humans as well but it really has not been explored much normally have heard things it cognates the two sides of the brain which it to me is is just a throw away i do not my there is any evidence that crane that two sides of the brain is better than not counting i wouldn't be speaking right now at the two sides of my brain were were well correlated because language is literalize right a have heard that it mimics rapid i movement string sleep but actually it does not i i but i have heard am people talk about there plosive experiences with the m dear what re your thoughts man car ye you had a good comment on than in when your recent pod guys and i it'll tell you those way i sold of think about it i from a amused point of view is the old you mentioned it earlier the oldest sort of idea of a hypnotic induction was a dangling watch right know in o we much a and a in fact there was enough concern about it that when automobiles were invented there was a movement to prevent installing windshield wipers because people were afraid that they would be hypnotized if they watch the wished wipers go back and forth on a car now turns out fortunately that you tend not to look at the wishes wife is would keep looking through the windshield and we have winshell wipers to day but that movement is what exactly used to be a hypnotic conduction i think there is a lot of if noses in in the eddy a ah and i think it is a combination of that with exposure base treatments were you using i be are to think about it you tend not to process the experiences much and just do the physical part of it which i personally think as a drawback and every study have seen that was a dismantling study it there is no question that people who go though him to your many of them get better with drama related problems and the vie has a big program using and on but every proven that has dismantled going through the treatment with having the latter ale i movement a has shown that it the latterly i moment does not and anything to it and toward the end of her career a prancing a was doing ow contralateral touching or something it was not y movements any more it was other things i i tend to think that a eddy a is another form of exposeyoure base therapy for drama but as as you have implied with the exception of this possible new data its certainly does not have to do with rapid y movement sleep and i do not i do not think moving the eyes is the issue i think it a way of sitting down at confronting drama and i would rather that the from itself be process to bit more than often happens in the eddy a a lot of people have gotten there be some of them have been helped prancing used to originally claim that just one session would de sensitized people in do it and that is clearly not true i see a lot of people who said yet help for a while but i you in the more i i i think it it became a kind of a overly simplicity approach to understanding brain physiology and that part of wrong and and the interesting thing know you mention suppressing final activity it is very interesting that mig late friend alien poison who's a brilliant she assert rear i well i do not know him but i i read his book when i was in college about the chemistry of sleep i ended a similarities between dream states and hallucinations t and it's one the reasons i got into theses while i work with him in a ma cart hour my body at work for many years i brilliant i points out that we need to get into primarily apparent sympathetic state to go to sleep a that we have to shut off shut off the sympathetic nervous system and and that is why allowed noise wakes you up when your tartrate goes up an all is he was a be being it a documenting what happens in the brain sleep he pointed out something also very interesting about dreams which is that the stories in dreams and even the images in dreams can change all over the place in crazy ways but usually the affect is constant said usually if it is a frustration dream whatever happens you want to frustrated if it is ay enjoyment dream you enjoy whatever going on there is a odd consistency and affect in dreams that that you do not have in other states and the idea of or lateral i movement suppressing a medal activity what kind of fit with tat that you do not allow intrusions of fear and anger an upset and there it may be there all the time but it may not be there when you think it should be why is it that you can be falling off the building and somehow not that scared your just having is experience of flying in a dream i i think there may be something going on about regulating affect but there we have a elaborate ad better ways to regulate affect great the emdyare might incorporate some elements of hypnosis by to the latter lies i movements perhaps by way of suppressing the mingle of the sphere associated center might bring people into more parasympathetic calm state might be auto hypnosis and then an exposure therapy through t the discussion about the issue right making more research needed on heed are out there and am obviously something that is come up a lot in this discussion and in our am discussions that have the great fortune of talking you every week is and working together is this idea of getting close to the phobia getting close to the drama re experiencing it as a portal to then adjusting the response to it and rewiring somethings of the troubling thing were the horrible thing is no longer hart as horrible to us that but that the the repeating theme is we cannot expect to get over something without getting really close to it may be even experiencing it somatically nowadays we hear a lot about intriguers and trigger warnings and certainly one can understand why those are why those exist but it seems thirsty in the general population there is this idea that we want to move away from anything that upsets us and yet i think it is fair to say even though having gathers the statistics that on the whole that the a human beings are becoming more and more anxious and more and more stressed perhaps a because of but certainly in parallel with the fact that were trying to move away from troubling this troubling things have heard you say before that it is in terms of therapeutic approaches it is not just about the state you get into but whether or not you brought yourself the voluntarily exact we the this element of a deliberate self exposure deciding ism going to confront the drama ism going a confront the pain ism going to confront the insomnia ism going to confront the and filling the blank and then readjusting one's emotional response right up next to that troubling thing that seems to be the the whole mark of of this treatment and come if i thinking about it correctly of prettymuch all treatments for getting over stuff if people do not have access to a really good cognition yourself how should they carry these thoughts in these ideas i man i think almost everybody of any reasonable age has memories or things that upset them but we learn to suppress them what does one do i you see the reversal has approaches to dealing with some of this am inside of the a but how does one start to think about actually dealing with something this and awaiting the hazards of just count of reactivating a lot of painful experiences because a lot of being a functional human being is also going a work each day in er act with people and not bringing one's drama you on something it out all on the table or what being able to just function is crucial how do you think about this as a cognition well the image the comes to mine is the green with of candor's box that it open and the furies got out and you could not put him back in and we have this kind of fantasy that once you get into these memories it they will take you over and you will never get them back in the box and i think that is wrong a now we we people who use prognosis say that there are ways to presenting to people that will be helpful and ways it will not and one real mistake is to tell some one do not think about purple elephants what dor you thinking about all does not work you want a find a way to feel in control of the access and to defend what happen on your own terms and ism not a big fan of trigger warnings i think were going crazy over this could be upsetting that could be used and yet there are lots of things erusatyingyou know the average kid has watch twenty thousand murders and by the time he is twenty years old watching television and movies these days you a we see terrible things and and it is not a matter of ale you exposed to something that is upsetting but how do you handle it what do you make of it and are you feeling in control is not what i what prudent is doing to his his rival in russia forcing him to watch propaganda movie's ten hours a day while he is imprison it is a matter of thinking am about a problem in a way that leaves you feeling you understand it better you are and more control you can turn it off when you when you want you can turn it on when you want and we have to in life deal distressful things there is studies care parked at standard has done some wonderful a studies with primates about stress and inoculation that if you separate a babe monkey from his mother for two hours a day and then reunite them and then you stress that baby monkey later they actually handlestress better ire's less cortisol arousal in the face of distress stress an ovulation hats been called mere exposure to drama mistress it is a part of living anyway we cannot avoid it even if we to and it is not pleasant it is not great but it is sometimes things you need to learn about life and if you can find and algorithm for facing it putting in into perspective feeling with it you become a stronger person that a weaker person this idea that college students or such fragile flowers that if you talk about a sexual assault or something you or you are doing something terrible to them it is just wrong and and i think we need to build our ability to recognize an manageress and you cannot do that without doing it yer you cannot learn you can write a bicycle without taking the risk of fallen off it and i think that is the way i think of feeling with distress ism really appreciate you saying that i a was you and i were both at a gathering let say where am this issue was being discussed and around and issue of a of a publicized sexual drama and am you made at excellent case for why it the stuff cannot be pushed under the rug and that actually in my observation let to a lot a heeling for the people that and the families of people can suffered from this in the i do think a people are resilient they a but we do not really teach how how to think about feelings we do not you were told that we need to feel our feelings but then again a we are also told that feelings do not hold all the information and i think that as you mention the is no operating our user's manual for this nervous system thing am brings me to another issue which is the mine body connection something that were very interested in and i you have done extensive work on you we all to think that getting more in touch with our body would be a great thing learning to intercept paying attention to our internal landscape would be a great thing but as we often discuss am when we are feeling lousy then being really in touch with that lousy feeling mayor may not be a good thing i how should we think about mine body it i can see examples in hypnosis from your descriptions of hypnosis where a you want to unify the mine body connection feel what your thinking that think what your feeling et camera but i could also am point to elements within the hypnotic process in which you are actively entry to uncouple those it sounds to me this hold my bodything is a bit more a a car youcannot say that a forty miles per hour is the optimal speed it kind depends on the the road your on and the turn you mayor may not be taking how should we think about mine body in terms of a you navigating daily life what what mouthing is the adaptive way to to conventionalize the mine body it is a big question it is it it is it it is a very interesting one i i i guess i think that it is a matter not of absolute control but more control that that we need to think of our brain as a tool and and our body signals as tools as well to help us understand o what is going on in the world what we need what matters what is important what is not a but also something that can be manage not simply absorbed and hypnosis i think is a kind of limiting case were you can push it about as far as we can push it i in terms of regulating pain pain is that is a good example of that obviously you need to pay attention if you just broke your ankle you better pay attention to it and get help or your having crushing substernal chessman you better do something about it but our brain is sort of program to treat all pain signals as if they were novel pain signals if it is a sudden new problem that needs to be attended to i teach people t o to to think of the pain and categorize its is it does it does the pain mean that if you put weight on this your en reinsure your ankle for example or does it simply mean that your body is healing in the pain is assign that gradually thinks are getting back to normal and and you can modify the way you process pain based on what your brain tells you the n means and that is true for emotional pain as well and particularly where i think a strategy that really helps is if you think of a and inter personal problem or thread of something coming am as as a an opportunity to do something to ameliorate the situation it is not just its happening to you but something that you can influence and do something about it is blending the receptive with the active response that i think can make a difference you try in process in a way that give you would deeper understanding what is happening you face it but you also say this is an opportunity for me to do something about it and the minute you realistically in hand and this does not mean i imagine a way art attack it means figure out how to rehabilitate from hard attack a or a broken leg or something that in a way that you get as much control into the situation as you can aloft am grief grief is one of the states that is very hard to i remove oneself from it and a lot of people ask me how do i deal with grief and ism not a cognition ism deferring to you on the one hanushy some one out tampered recently am came to me in said my my mother passed away and i sibling the passed away and they are the only people that i had and also living alone and challenge with a number of things and i they look they were holding it together and i very well in fact given what they were describing i and on the one hand i i i well i certainly point out that not coalition by sit on the one hand you could imagine that it would be necessary and useful to go into the grief state if you want to transition through it i om on the other hand o there have heard before that the cathartic model of just really diving into an emotion can also be potentially hazard us if you do not have any anchors am to o grab on to of what what is the view of psychiatry or your view of grief and how to deal with grief because i think grief is is at one of those all encompassing emotions for many people him it is and it is a very important natural necessary stage of life and the reason we have all these gree rituals from very old and memorials and had stones and sitting china and other things that people do it is a way of making it real that an incomprehensible loss has to be comprehended you have to realize that your now when i have to live life without your loved one your parent your caviling whoever am and we have all go gone through this at one time or another i certainly have and it is very hard to just come to terms with but one principle is to sort one say it is not it is never all or none its more or less yes it is all or none that you have lost a loved one but i ask people as part of their grieving to say to themselves and i do this in hypnosis sometimes too a a you have lost them but what have they left you with what i what have they bequeathed to you even though they are gone and it'll sometimes asked them to say if your mother could be here right now what would you say to you how would you feel about your life now what would he advise you to do in our support groups for women with advanced press answer we we lost people and and i got to tell you that we were warned by on colleges that we demoralized people it i me there are wonderful oncologist but there is some that were very afraid that that we would harm them in some way because they the mortality rate is fairly high with nets that press answer they've been a watch people die the same disease and you will demoralize and i we actually measured there emotion and the content of speech every five minutes throughout a bunch of groups to make sure that was not happening what we found was that they talked about more serious issues but the mood did not actually get worse and were found in general that expressing negative emotion on the longer and helps people be less anxious and depressed over time and we have shown this an randomized clinical trial as not just my clinical impression and and of what we what we try to get them to do is to face the loss live with the emotion that comes with it but also see that the reason at hurt much is how much that person gave you we would do itself gnosis exercise that the integral say i want you to get your body floating safe and comfortable now picture marry and and a sit with the feeling of sadness that she is no longer with us and we do that for a few minutes and then we'd say on the other side picture one things she left with you that you still have that you carry on in your heart her tradition of what he gave to you and just seeing it not as a complete loss but as a real loss a painful loss but one that helps you to reflect on what you gained from her and knowing her a i think can be very helpful and the grieving process it is very helpful that the way to conventionalize it a couple quick questions a can children be safely hypnotized her yourself hypnosis they it sometimes harder for them to do self hignsis they need more structure to do at you got a share your dorsallout or forefront of porters with this a little f it but yes absolutely children can be very advotizable and a i i know pediatricians who use it wonderfully all the time they get them to focus on something else there can have to give them a shot or draw blood or something and they will say ism going up press your happy button and presses their billy button and they start to give e the way kids do and meanwhile the nurses drawing the blood and they do not even notice it a dentist good dentist can u such to help kids with fear and pain yes hat can be very effective for children we did a randomize trial i have a publication in pediatrics my late sister who as pediatrician and who always used to joke that a she was the only one in our family who as a real doctor you a i said i got she i got a paper in peasant and the paper was children having to undergo avoiding sister you rather gram there the the anatomy that kidney if you will forgive me such interesting in that the the crater that goes into the flatter normally goes into the flatter at an angle and that means that when the flatter contracts to expel urine it automatically closes off the utter because it sideways to the flatter some kids are borne with the perpendicular and then you will get reflects into the time and some children out grow at some see pretty duplicated surgery to fix that and you you image them every year or to see whether there getting kidney damage or not and it is a pretty miserable experience your nine your old girl you have to go on lie on a hard cold table have strangers pull your legs apart as to a cashier into your a urethra and hold in the flatter and then expel yuan and you get into the struggling fights and of course the more they struggle the mere they construct and it makes it harder to do it a i was asked if we could test we did a randomize trial of children hospital a they either got training in self hypnosis i would hamlet with them and the mother the week before we find out from the kids where they to be bandits ta turn to play a trick on your doctors your bodies there your somewhere else god visit your friend go to disningland do something else and the mother would work on this with me at the head of the table and we found that these children were much easier to image one got relaxed at you give we he is normally it takes us ten minutes to get them to pea after their doing this she was relax ye started being before i could even get the bed pan under er n it the clean up the table and they also seventeen minutes shorter procedures and that is a long seventeen minutes fer for a little kid it can be very effective with children or less anxious they have less pain and i get through these difficult procedures very well that is great has hypos as ever been done in a for couples like couples therapy ism thing of preach every clinical setting here both you ought to be hypnotizable of course but the reason i ask about this is next me an to ask about psychedelics and there is a lot of interest in coordinating states through the use of of drugs of different kinds a we a had do this when we treat depression right you a depress person with a family members or not to pressing you say well let us make them all a not depressed right i not yuibun all en and ism only half kitting there bees that is kind of the underlying logic in some sense but am are you aware of any i of any coordinated hypnosis that is interesting iii've done plenty of it in groups not not with couple you can hypnotize large groups fonts ye are hypnotized right now yet you are and i hope you have been enjoying it i ai but tithe themedisetic brescanst an it was a group of ten women who would me once a week and we would all going hypnosis together i did not realize on you were hypnotizing them collective yes yes right fascinate and and that if anything i think it brings out the best in people's abilities because it is a shared social experience and and they would talk about it afterwards and yes that is absolutely durable and i do not wont o folks on psychedelic specifically maybe that s a topic for a future episode but is there any basis for combining hypnosis with a drug therapies inside of the hypnotic episode i realize that some patience of yours might be prescribed a anta depression or a medication for for some a purpose i may be same different than the hypnosis's being directed toward but is there any evidence that if people are am relax through the use of a am propane all or somewhat you n one of these of many things in the psychiatric kit that hypnosis can be more effective well interestingly one study that i have not mentioned as we did a m spectroscopy on people who were hypnotized and we found am that there was a correlation between hypnotized ability and gabby activity in the a after singular quarters which fits with turning down activity to the extent that we can self medicate and gab receptors basically or doing what bens of daisopines due to the brain i that can happen when people are hypnotized you saying inside of the hypos you you have neral evidence that there is a kind of a a set it of effect of hypnosis at the chemical level ye right mas tit people who are more adnotizable have more of those saber receptive can its related to the degree of their hypnototsability am in terms of there have been studies where they try to give people medications as well and the interesting thing with bens of that is opened which activate in hypitory activity in the brain a if you are very anxious it might improve your hypnotic responsive it if you just anxious an canto it if you are not very anxious and actually inhabits idiotic activity because you get sort of sedated and just out of it and you cannot focus your attention as well by enlarge we do not use drugs as an agent to hypnotic experience most time you do not need to and sometimes it can make it worse rather than better some the some evidence that mild stimulants might enhancehypnotic responsiveness a little reliably but too much will again scatter attention and you will have less control over it they might be adjuvants but i frankly think a hypnosis is moreover replacement than in deed of supplementation you are laboratory my laboratory have a well a sort of snuck in to your lawn and trying to a emerge that you had been a lot of for and your hand learning a lot about a the power of respiration of breathing to shift brain states not just during breathing protocols but a at all times and we will do an entire episode about those protocasit hop we a after a those are published and and and on but breathing itself is a you described as a bridge between conscious an unconscious states d and a i have to ask how how important is the patient breathing pattern how closely are you monitoring their breathing pattern how closely do you moniker your own breathing pattern as your inducing hypnosis put simply what is the role of respiration in shifting the brain's state during a hypnotic protocol yet that is very interesting you had a great show with the fact ya jacfelmen a and he his and and the the issue a i i watch it a i try the work that were enjoying doing together shows that there are breathing patterns that may increase sympathetic arousal a were made decrease it may have been we new cyclic sighing seems to actually where you have more time spent exhaling than inhaling seem and there is reason to believe that it induces parts sympathetic activity cause your increasing pressure in the chest and a therefore a allowing the heart to slow down because blood is being returned to the atrium a more easily a i do use it i asked people to take a deep breath is part of the induction and and slowly ex ell and partly as a result of our research together i am emphasizing the slow exhale more as part of an som to enhance the idea in the induction that this is a period of relaxation cause i think they are inducing that and perhaps perceiving it as well is no you are absolutely right that breathing is very interesting cause it is right at the edge of conscience and jack talked about that to of conscious and unconscious control that it will go on automatically but we can control it and it is a kind of way for us to demonstrate to ourselves a it it greater ways of an of modulating our internal state you can either do it thinking about it the way we do with pain control in it noises or you can do it to some i stent by taking charge of your breathing and doing things that will pro duce the change that you want to see happen in your body i i it because it is right at that margin where you can enhance a for me i that as a way of augmenting hypnosis is more than medication i think this is a powerful way of doing that gray ism really excite the see where all this goes breathing vision bodily states a clearly the the and directed mental am access seem to be the the key elements of hypnosis an my missing any any other ingredients ye it is i think that is righterethens breathing vision how you change your vision a and you do not ityoutypically you are in a physically relaxed state but frankly there are people at the peak of performance including physical athletic performance or musical performance when they're in hypnotic states to you know have talk to classical pianists who say ism not thin if i start think it about what my fingers are doing now i screw up i floating above the piano thinking about the native the tone that i want to feel exiting from the instrument that is a hypnoticlike state to and in many athletes in who are in performance are just flowing with it there they are not they are not thinking step by step whontomy doing and that is when you are do in your best or when when we are working or a giving a talk and doing it well we are in a hypnoticliic state it it does not it it usually requires abut does not necessarily require physical comfort or quietness that can sometimes be intense activity incredible well am this has been

welcome to the hubermanlapoa science science pace to ne or i may druhubermen and om a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today my guest is doctor rondopatrick doctor trick is known to some of you as a podcast and one of the premiere educators in the landscape of mitochondria metabolism stress and other aspects of brain and body health her podcast found my fitness is one of the prefer podcast in the world for disseminating knowledge about how the brain and body work and how we can use behavioral tools micronutrient supplements and other protocols in order to maximize our immediate and long term health doctor trick did her formal training in cell biology exploring the link between mitochondrial metabolism a proptosis which is naturally occurring sell death which is a healthy form of sell death that occurs in our brain and body throughout the life spin and cancer biology she then went on to do postdoctoral training with doctor brace aims investigating the effects of micronutrient meaning vitamins and minerals and how the effect metabolism inflammation d ana damage and the agent process she has published landmark review articles end primary research meaning original research articles in some of the prefer journals in the world including science nature sellbiology tension cell biology and fascia indeed doctor trick is in expert in an extraordinarily broad range of topics that impact our health for to day's episode we focus primarily on the major categories of micronutrient that are essential for brain and body health i have to confess that before the discussion with doctropatrick i was aware of only one of the categories of micronutrient that we discuss and you will notice that i am rapped with attention throughout the discussion and i think that you will cantata pen and paper handy because she offers not only a very clear understanding of the biological mechanisms by which other michronutrians operate but some very clear and actionable tools and items that we can all embark on if we are to optimize our brain and body health we also discuss behavioral protocols doctor trick is well known for her understanding of the scientific literature on son and the use of heat and cold for optimizing things metabolism longevity cardiovascular health and ism delighted to say that we discuss that as well end how behavioral protocols can interface with supplement based and nutritional protocol ism confident that you will learn a tremendous amount of information from doctor trick much of which is immediately actionable and if you are not already following and listening to her excellent podcast you will absolutely want to do that its found my fitness dot calm is the website where you can get access to that podcast its also on apple and notify and tube as found my fitness doctor trick also has a terrific newsletter that i recommend signing up for its found my fit is stock calm slash news letter is where you will find it and it includes research on fasting my chronutrian sleep depression fitness longevity and far more along of course with actionable protocols ism please to announce that the superman ladpodcast is now partnered with momentous supplements our motivation for partnering with moments is to provide people one location where they can go to access the highest quality supplements in the specific dosages that our best supported bi the scientific research and that are discussed during various episodes of the supermen la podcast if you go to livemomentous took calm slash supermen you will see those formulations i should mention that we are going to add more formulations in the months to come and you will see specific suggestions about how best to take those supplements meaning what dosages and times of day and in fact how to combine those supplements with specific behavioral protocols that have been discussed on the podcast and our science supported in order to derive the maximum benefit from those supplements and many of you will probably also be pleased to learn that momentous ships not just within the united states but also internationally once again if you go to live momentous stop come slash supermen you will find what we firmly believe to be the best quality supplements in the precise dosages and the best protocols for taking those supplements along with the ideal behavior protocols to combine with the supplement formulations before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens an the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that t helps me cover all f my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to truth lentic greens you can go to athletic green stoical slash supermen and claim o special offer the will give you i free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of stand ow showing that vitemand three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in viteemen d three and k too is also important because it regulates things cardiovascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone cam slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fifty travel packs and the your supply of vitemendy three cat to to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talked many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element dot calm slash huberment and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element e dot calm slash superman and now for my discussion with doctor ronde iatric ronde welcome that been a long time coming even longer than because even before we discuss you coming on this podcast as aghast i been watching your content for a very long time when a start off i think thank you you we are the spirit to break through from academic science to public education i consider you first in and a the rest of us are just in your wake thank you for that that is been oh that is kind thank you think he smites it is absurdly than souk that to be here having you convetatioe with the you it is absolutely true if anyone a does there research they will realize that the statement i just made is absolutely true and there is not even a close second any other public facing a educators that have formal science training and a do regular posting of content came in several years after you initiated it we are all grateful ut i have many questions but i want to start off with my kind of a a new but old theme that you are very familiar with temperature is a powerful stimulus as we know for biology and you covered a lot of material related to the utility of cold but also the utility of heat and as i learn more and more from your content and from the various papers it seems that there is a bit of a a conundrum in that cold can stimulate a number of things increases an metabolism brown fat et camera et camera o fly you will tell us more about those but heat seems to be able to do a lot of the same things and i wonder whether or not the discomfort of cold deliberate c old exposure in the discomfort of heat might be anchoring to the same pathway would you mentoring with us a little bit about what happens when we get into cold environment on purpose and what happens when we get into a hot environment on purpose and hoping that this might eventually lead us to some point of convergent understanding if you would i would love to let us take a step back and i think you brought up a really important point here and i think that point has to do with the intermontane challenging of yourself and and whether that is through temperature changes cold or heat or through other types of stresses physical activity or perhaps even dietary compounds that or found in plants these are things polyfenales or flavenals humans were you know we evolved to intermittently challenge ourselves and before we had instrecard where you could basically just get your fruit delivered to you before the industrial revolution occurred we were out hunting and i say we not us humans we were out gathering we were moving m and we had be physically fit you could not catch your prey if you were a sedentary slab right you were moving and you had a leg picture berries you had a move and physical activity was a part of every day life and toloworc restriction ere intaminite fasting was also a part of it s is another type of of of challenge we we did not always have a prey that we cat or may be temperatures were such that there was nothing for us to gather right food scarcity was something common as well as eating plants getting these compounds that a mention said this is these these are all types of stress intermitted challenges that activate genetic pathways in our bodies these are often refer to in science as stress response pathways because they respond to a little bit of stress physical activity is strenuous fastings a little bit stressful heat cold these things are all types of little intermittent challenges and om there is a lot of cross talk between these stresses and the genetic pathways that they activate and these genetic pathways that are activated help you deal with stress and and and they do it in a way that is not only beneficial to help you deal with out little stressed exercise or heat its it stays active and it helps you deal with the stress of normal metabolism normal and younfunction happening just life aging right this concept is referred to us hormesas rite this is a a a little bit of chant stressful challenge that activates these stress response pathways in a beneficial way that is a net positive that actually is it has a very profound antioccident entire flam to response or or whatever the responses it could be the production of more stemsells these are tells that help regenerate different on cells within tissues or r something a tophigy which is a process it can clear away all the gunk inside of our cells pieces of deny proving aggregates you will find that these stress response pathways are activated by a variety of stresses for example one pathways called hatcheck prolines and as their name would apply one would go o they are activated by heat will correct they are activated very robustly by heat and we can talk about that but you can eat a a plant rocky sprouts which is high in something called sulphur faintness to say a compound that om is a sort of a hermetic compound or as davits chalices to say its say we no hermetic compound i love that i love that term ism and it act be peacock prolines among other things that also act activates o very powerful detoxification pathway called and arid too which helps you detoxify things carcinogens that you are expose to willguess what heat activates that what am getting at is there is overlap cold also activates hatcheck prolines really cold yes it activates these are stress response pathways and there activated by various types stresses now you arguing to more blessedly activate hatcheck prolines from heat viruses cold but there is some overlap i i think that sort of forms the foundation there now that is very helpful and it brings to mind in the contacts of the nervous system or sill be went you only have a small kit of hero chemicals to work with there is not dopamine for a not flan than opening for relationship and dopamine for work et camera there dopamine is a generic pathway by which motivation craving in pursuit emerge et camera it just a adrenalin is a a generic theme of many different behaviors n it seems that it is the job of biological systems to be able to take a diverse range of in puts even unknown in puts we do not know what technology will look in three years but you can bet that some of those novel technologies will taken to the very systems that ism talking about now and a there certainly will be other stresses to come about that will talent these pathways i have two questions relate to what you just said o before we a talk a bit more about cold and heat it you mention plants as a a rout o creating intermittent challenge there is a lot of debate mostly on line about whether not plants are our friends or plants or trine to kill us am the extreme version from the carnivore types a pure carnivore types s that plants er train to kill us from the plant bassi folks it seems it is more about what is healthy for the planet animals and make for us but if we set aside that argument and we just raise the hypothesis that plants have compounds that are bad for us but maybe by consuming them in small amounts they are creating the shormysist type scenario then i think we conceivably solve the problem we could say yes a plants are bad for us but in small amounts they provide this hermetic response in their good for us right it in the same way that heat is too much heat as bad for us too much cold as bad for us can kill us can kill near on but appropriately dose in a intermittent challenge type of saros can be good for us thief's how i should think about plants in these compounds do you think of them as good for us or as bad for us they're very start blade in we want to use them potently i i actually i think that it is almost impossible i mean you would have to e nothing but the same plant all day everyday in the lar i mean the byoabailability of these these compounds in the plants they're attached to a food matrices i it is it is not taking it in a supplement form is well ism it is it is such that it is it is very difficult to make it talksick now there are some cases for example if you cabbage and i think there is some group in africa somewhere that they that is all they eat is cabbage and there is a guatrogen in cabbage it is not furan it is another compound but there's all they eat every day nothing but that et wan they get a ya and there dying deficient on top of that ism i do think there is there you can of course make i mean at they r types of plants at our toxic in small quantities right i mean the a i hammock exactly s deal you do not t do not play the same with hem will but you are not gin a get poison from eating your your you are serving of brochley at dinner right i mean it it depends on the plant it is it is i do not these generalizations are kind of they just not useful and i think that a lot of people on lying em in the blast were it is it the gravitate towards them because it is easier and it is lot more sensational ism plants meat and starches on one of those rare ominabrs out there now i ye i feel a that is rare to bean omnabre but i think once you step out of the social medias as you said the blog of sphere the most people i would say ninety nine per cent of people on the planet are probably ominivours i and some one will price correct me but and i doubt the umber falls below ninety ninety eight i think if you look at data ism and and when we have carnivordata bi i cannot way to see a about right now it is a lot of o we where this is a lot of anecdotal evidence and i there is another a good there is a lot of a good starts with anecdotes but people change a thousand things at once and they do not realize that but they do and anecdotal data only good writes it is it is a starting point i and we do not really know long term what carnivore dits are n i do they may be beneficial short term i they may u no be beneficial for reasons of elimination of other things shoots right lots of possibilities but i do think with respective plants ism that there is that the there is much evidence for example sulphurate is one that i i really because ism there is just evidence that sulphurphane is a very powerful activator of the anger of to pathway and this is a pathway that regulates a lot of genes and lot of genes that are related to glad thin production a genes theatre involved in detoxifying compounds that were exposed you from our food heterocyclic amines in fact there's been g a studies to these are genetically ism these are studies that are ism genus wide associated studies for people listening that are not familiar people have a variety of versions of genes and we have a gene that is able to make am hetero cyclic means basically detoxify it to its not as harmful i and and people that do not have a certain version of that that is doing it well a very prone to coin cancer in increase cancer's but if they eat a lot of brochley and crucipherates vegetables that negates that risk because they are getting sulphurate which activates a lot of the gludifon transfer gludifhion transport in synches genes gludifhions a major antioccident in our brain in no no vascular system in a body basically ism there is there is evidence to it that that eating things we know compounds that are sulphurfhane or brochley or block brochley spouts which have a hundred up to a hundred times more sulfhurfan an brochley are activating gludithion in the brain there is human evidence of that i mean that is amazing there is amain in plans at ha disbarring in to i sone measure when o brochley s bouts are different in brochley a and you just told us that they have much there much richer in these a these compounds note to self i should have brochley s bracts not just brochley a can we cook the brochley and still get these neterinsr we a the at raw i confess in raw brochley is really aversive i the the sulphurphane is formed from a compound called luck raphanan which is in the brochley and the ends ism that converts it into sulphur fan is my roses and its heat sensitive you do somewhat lower the sulphur than levels when you when you cook the brochley however ism there was e study a few years back that showed adding one gram of mustard seed powder ground mustard seed powder which also contains the my roses and him tolyoure cooked brochley increases the sulphurphane by forgot must that's is great cause i confess i brochley if it is cook to the appropriate density a not too mushy but baffling to raw the idea of eating raw brochley to me just sounds horrible but i like the way mustard seems sound just a little bit of mustard seed powder added to the cooked brochley can recover some of these come yes what i do is i will you know lightly steam my brochley and then i add a little bit of my carrion butter am and then i add some mustard seed powder on the top of that inland it is got a little little kick its just a little spice and if he do not case that s expired it should have a little kid and because i know people will want to know how often and how much mum are you eating this every day were most says of the week well i had shifted to supplementation with sulphurate have have admitted aim admitting right now that have been terrible about at the pass i do not know six months or the supplementation or the sane to yes the supplementation an i and i there is another way to get there is another compound and it is actually called marina and doctor red fa he who is really the expert on sulphur thane i his good friend of mine his found the potassic couple o times he i he he basically thinks and mean has done a lot of research and marina as well the it is it is a cousin and it activates the an a of two pathway similarly to sulphurate and have been buying this cool cool marina powder i do not have any filiation with em colycoliesabran coolyquillies the ran that you have not a dilation give no fixation but media he has researched it that specific brand and s it is legit its legit its likes since back i an terms of actually containing marina an activating and a of to a and i out it to my smother that is what have been doing what anwoatd er some o do ranges i horse we give the usual recommendations if people should talk to the position et camera et camera but i if people are going to what do you take that is always the a et a a a ta resin a lite ma davits sectarian a profit what do where he will talk about what he does i as a way to to deal with this of course everybody's different and should i in all seriousness should u any time you ad or to let something from your a a consumption should a consult some trusted healthy professional trusted by you m what do you recall the the doses i do a big keeping table spoon m marina meet an trying getting easing a song it is a deva i no i but for people also listening s why what i do that you n i mention the ludic in the brain i i mentioned it in u plasma it is it is been shown a lowering a damage in people and n white blood cells a it is also been shown there is been several different cities in china you known china there's a lot of air pollution and i mention that i it is a very powerful activator a angry and i know your our roman of cubit and er too is at your transcription factor that is it is it is binding to a little specific sequence in a variety of different genes in its turning them on it wear n some cases turning them off it is regulating what is being activator or what is not being activator being turned off and i some of the genes are our basically the these detoxifying pathways we talked a little bit about the gludiflon but there is also one that are involved in er er born carsinagions bending benzine's found in air pollution i mean cigarettes man if your save your smoking cigarettes still please try to quietly manikin your dammit yet o i just ear nothing of the long cancer imitating your dead and hard does these risk hard of these rest but anyways i people and this has been repeated and and more than one study that literally after twenty four hours of taking cannot remember off the top of mi had what the dose of sulphur fang from brolly extract o broccbrochlys on seed extract was a broch scraps extract not the see as this sprouts ism anyways they started creating sixty per cent benzine and accreting n in that sending that we getting cooked foodie is coming out their earn coming on the earn ya why not of smoker and have to be ones it is rare that i hear of supplement for the first time cause have been you the deep diving on supplements since i was in my teens a this is fascinating and it brings back to this question the we have before big a appreciate the answered it very clearly plants have compounds that are good for us they are not just stressing us their activating pathways that are reparative that is what that is what ism taking away from everything you are telling me right and and and that our bodies were supposed to be getting thatstress to have those pathways activated it is right i mean this is conserved among different animals this is this is this is something that is is so its supposed to happen and in our modern day world we do not have to eat plants we do not have to move anywhere or exercise we do not have to go throughperiods of not eating food because we can have it at our finger tips at any second right i mean we have got this can in drum of we are never activating these stress responds pathways that were but that we are supposed to activate werespose to i find that fastening in again the drawing a parallel to the nervous system a what ism hearing you say is that historically we would have to go through some stress some confront cold or cord front heat or confront afford tor or hunger in have to exercise es sensibly in order to obtain these compounds and then those compounds are reparative that i feel that resembles a the dopamine pathway always say your there is nothing wrong with opening people thing about opening hits as bad or doping is bothers absolute nothing wrong with doping the problem is dopamine e specially high levels of opening released without the need for effort to access that opening is problematic a line of cocaine gives you a ton of doping with no effort except in just the drug whereas a working for four years or more to get your degree we will release a lot of opening and a lot of corners all along the way as we know and it is considered a healthy accomplishment in most cases a tremendous amount it if you we are approaching the spring and they'll be lot of graduations weddings are coming up now that the pandemic is kind s hopefully slowing and they'll be a lot of opening high little of opening are great but only after the effort of having done something in order to access it and that is what ism taking away from what you are saying is that we need to go through the intermittent the different types of intermittent challenge and we can re we are rewarded with particular compounds that a reparative both for the challenge but then make u stronger it is ermesous really is it seems a case of what does not kill us makes us stronger a what a you mention you i ad that one easy sat because please because this has been shown with for example sulphurate an animal studies you are condition give the animal sulphur pang and then you expose them to hypoxia some find of eschemixstroke condition whatever they do do induce that and the sulphurphang basically protects them their precondition and their the at their stress response pathways are primed and when they are then expose to the ischemic stroke they their outcomes are much better much better than the animals that did not get the sulphuring forty right hours before whatever it was and and this is this has been shown in multiple animal studies with sulphuring specifically in the brain i i know mark mats and to doctor mark mason he is a often thought of as the interment at fasting keen but hes in your nervous scientists and he i he did publish some work and an talks about sulphur fang as well'really glad you brought that u a that example up because many of the questions i get on sociamediun elsewhere are about dramatic brain injury and t b i in is just one example and people always think o sports its football whenever you say you be to people ways think football and i just want just take a men a moment to editorialize ninety per cent or more of dramatic brain injury is construction work at home accidents e football players are if hokey plays are martial artists are a tiny fraction of the people who have t b i and concussion of various kinds it just happens that within those communities many of them seventy five per cent or more experience those it is sailing within those communities but a cushions is prominent people are always asking what can i do in order to offset brain injury i had a concussion to years ago what can i do and and it is be it is been a tough question because you really do not have anything for them i mean you tell them sleep well eat well exercise but it sounds some of these reparative pathways a either should be explored in the contact of brain injury or ism guessing a being explored in the contacts of brain injury you couple of things there ism one is that i mean dramatic brain injury i mean it is terrible but it is also it is interesting because it is also literal real time brain aging it is you are able to accelerated and understand i i often think of when i think of dramatic brain injury i think of much overly between i hermishesease and dementia and these urged anerpresies is because there is that there are there are lot of similarities that there and sulphurphan i personally think ani do think there spent some animal research with t b i i mean and and a sulphur hang mostly preconditioning rather than a treatment i again it is well i mean if you are on a if you want a healthy life style thing in your construction worker are your r filling the blank that is you known i mean any when the dries a i mean your out rest to some degree right or bicycle bicycle yah around stand we have i was say a people demonized motor cycles people demonize a lot of things but moving e fast through space on a small object next to a three thousand pound vehicle we have lost we have a number of friends of i we no people dramatic brain injury i not again cycling or cyclist but it is i it is a risky sport a by any stretch ism in taking things marina on eating my rocky sprouts may be cooking them a less than am currently cooking them putting on the the mustard seed a is there evidence that hell first of all and or if to is expressed in anurans i those those cells should be protector of their other cells of the body that could possibly gain protection from these pathways ism well lungs for one a but just even in plasmyselves i i mean i think it is pretty an a up to is pretty ubiquitously express lever i theirs i mean to there is many animal studies that have looked at all those things i try to kind gravitate towards human wen is a little little lot more relevant i but but i think over all a i mentioned in a been a damage lower is twenty four twenty four or thirty four per cent lower and ism human blood sells after brockets ism rocky sprout powder supplementation ism an an i made a video on the sycersiga to thousand sixteen maybe and i think i have the references on there to exact mounts it cannot begun the toxicity o that s is common old tastes to the twenty sixteen but am i also had jet on the podcast and he he did talk about this i but you know it is also been shown and random is control trials to help treat option autistic symptoms and yet again it is doing interesting things in the brain and ism i think it i think it does have something to do with the oxidate stress n eluting on which would be relevant four to be i treatment i i has not been shown empirically that that helps with treatment but as you think a someone could do that study ism i think that it is should be dishonestly because it is a low hanging fry and an if there is any impact and there is at least one preliminary side that glorify own is increased in the brain after humans are basically taking sulphurphane ism which is really for people listing that is important because a number of compounds it a people taken supply form do not cross the blood ran barrier or they get metabolizing ways that what is listed on the bottle almost becomes irrelevant for what your sells actually experience that is very reassuring i we will not get back to heat and cold in this a theme that i tried to service by just find this too interesting to to a diverge at this point ism from from these themes what other compounds or micro newtrience you a place in the top tear of useful interesting there are animal studies may be the hopefully also some human studies we talked about a few i know you of a lot about o mama three lady acids if you had to do your tat of top three i your your superstars of nutrients for the brain and body something we have got one one set what would you put in alongside them of mama three o the marine o mama three fatty acids o these are found in marine types of animals fish cold waterish fatty fish i there's a there is three fat acids there is one from a plant and ism that is often refer to as ala people call it short capelin lake acid and then there's i cot i cost a pentinoic acid or e p and dock hexinoic acid which is d oh ya but mas even out to we up most vital words to pronounce right next an spell a a next to opthemology which if at you can spell it o i know people who have appointments in entomology departments that do not have to spell off theology a little secret there is the there is an extra p in there i the away the ism not an attempt is pro pronounced it because your pronunciation was perfect of both of these two compounds a an you side marine sources fish sardines card this sort thing but what about chill have seen chill oil in there was a few years back you were sent chill is a better source for a mage of threes than i is a fish boil i took some chill oil capsids i made me itch all over i stopped give a selfish clergy no i never think i do not think s ism not a big fan or selfish but i a oysters a renownian or temper something i feel fine yo we can talk about sources ism chill is a i i a source mostly of a type of d oh an e p that is in phosphoric lipid form it is a phosititl cosine of man three lady acid and ism that is different than most most of the l for talking about fish of supplements that the different story bit your talking about comparing fish to cry eating chill were talking y i witchery chill are we talking about t supplement that was loge clem and go chill supplement verses fishing fish oil supplement and if you if it fits in the conversation talking about great sources of of omega threes in their whole form like have bad feeling ongoing to tell me sardines i meetings a a other the si animal he for excel never the taste and and for the potential contaminate i mercury i think was not no job is say i was mercury an ism job is telling me about h it sardines every jo broke in was telling that he seems a sardines everyday an i and then he hi really high mercury levels and is only shocked because sardines are tuna lo in the fish groups o the teethe higher up you get swordfish and sharks really high mercury cause ere eating all the other fish right i but i think sombrands and if you look at consumerlab ism consumelob there is i s such a third party sad that ism ciliated with but it'll use them because they the do lot of analysis of different foods and supplements and you can look to some of their sardines and they have the have a list of ones that er pretty decent b anyways ism back to your question about fish oil supplements for is chill oil supplements i the one of the major differences is the that fish oil supplements if you get a high quality one it is in a trials ride form am your you have got a glicerall backbone with three fatyacids and and that's a tach in those ere either d oh or the e p and ism or if you have a lower quality fish roil supplement than you have what is called ethethelester form and typically ism the reason for that it is it is when fish oil is purified it is run through this columwithouall or something they cleave it off the glossal backbone and then it just kind of easier to leave it fat than rs esterifying it scooter money you can get at an ethelaster form which ism is not as bi available and in fact if you do not take it with food you are gong to be in trouble you are nock an absorb much of it at all would you sinus on the package and is scan ta say its in this ether ether form some official rounds will put it on the website perhaps on their packaging but you most the time ism you will have to take fort on the website and recall them but i think for the most part ones that are higher and will will market it trials ride form and it is not that ethelester's bad it just means take it with food ism the one the major prescription of megatheres out the is both o man leva which is a mixture of d oh n e p as well as the sea which is a highly purified e p these are both prescribed by physicians to patients with hyperotriclis remix high triglisterides ism among other things the think ism maybe deregulation of lipids is well this i amazing for people these are prescription drugs the are essentially very high potency purified o megatheres but they are given to people for lipid issues this the treatment of issues with fatmatabolism by giving people fat yet just a really is one and push home again ism not can of work hector the omnomnabore but but to just push home that u we one thing that is wonderful that you have done over the years that you continue to do is to move away from these very broad sweeping statements about you o fat is bat and here is a case were were saying fat is not only good it can be use to combat issues with fatmatabolism and there young fats are not just one thing the many things i an way i just a one a put a one highlighter in an a point of appreciation there and a man sure the people are are sensitized to the fact that if you hear that fat is bat left task what kind of fat right an here we are talking about these are megatheres o cast the triglistride form can be taken wither without of food and there is prescription forms what i cannot get i do not know if i can get a hold of the prescription for m unless som you have my eggs or i i have a friend with hightraglasory nit the on folks do not born ship prescription drugs be more you talk to your doctor and you say ism already taking this from i mean i do not homework any way what is the dosage that you re commend people get one way or we another rig i cate the the dosage that physicians prescribed for hightreless for its for example is four grahams a day for hams of e p a of i yes of the a visit i i think lava's also prescribed at for grahams a day and i you can you can get either those from your physician my father in law jest got one of hem describing see we were buying our own to make a three there years an years as a a you can actually get the nhelfanterns can cover it and it is really purified form but you have to take it with food that was the bottom line i have totally gone on tongues but your asking more interesting questions any way when normally i ask about mechanism and then i talk about photo calls but in the or the why were the why i didn't but me agent gotten they but i think that and we defiling will get there but i think a number of people now t is a just really excited about what they can do for their health and here were i were just raising the importance of o meats sees on than we will dealing get to the why in the underline vanish i think four grams is i i mean and in fact bill arris doctor bill arris is he is just a one of the the pioneers on will make a here facias at see sir chief as on our podcast not last august and ism he was saying that reason after a chose that was literally just because how much they could get people to take well they they it was not an operand o this is not anything above that is on say that was not the case i mean it was it was it was just purely cost and you don't compliance we know what they can get into it a pill the amount they can get in how many pills they can get people to take ism smiling because your good friend such an panned at the talk institute who sound lot of important work on interment fasting another incredible work on circadian rhythms et camera a when i was talking to him in preparation for an episode an interment fasting he i said why the it hour feeding window and he said well the graduate student who rand tho studies had a partner i think it was a girl friend as i recall honey get that backward and the partner said listen you can be in lab ten hours a day but you cannot be in lab fourteen hours ay you want this relationship to work and was eight hours of feeding window blossom measurements a men time to walk into the lab park the car et camera and the eight hour feeding wen know that every one hold holly was you she just borne out of this relationship between these two graduate student you now had they been single i was single all through graduate school or most of it anyway and i lived in the lab if i be me we would all be a interment fasting would mean eating fortune hours a ay o that was a joke not a good one but i just one may m joking but the point that you are making is a really good one that the for a for graham am amount is not a threshold based on anything except the threshold of people's willingness to i should take the stuff soh and i think that is important for people to here because often we here the eight hour feeling window programs of e p a a hundred fifty minutes of cardie and it is really a question of what you can reasonably do in a study i take programs day i take two in the morning two grams in the morning and i take two rams in the evening i take my e p in the morning and i take my d a oh in the evening split them i do i i do not know if i do not think it is necessary not necessarily ism i just happen to by i happen to get a certain fishbowl supplement that is separates them i and yon lava lava's a great one and it is all an one in its easier what if stone does not have a prescription i take over the counter fishbowl i know i feel better cause i done the experiment a going on and off i take the mainly for i do not have depression but i my mood is better my joints feel better mi just feel better u and i to think that my plate lets are slipperier and there the their you no cruising through any little la obstructions in my my pains are arteries that is the image i have in my head but obey did a support that part ya i mean i if if you are asking for were to people get the wo a likely the bottle and it says two grams preserving but then i look and it is seven hundred n fifty milligrams of e p a right or a thousand milligrams of e pa it is at half of it is e pa then do i want to hit a threshold of e p a wore threshold of oh m of what is listed on the bottle right on the on the front of the bottle and because my understanding is at we need to hit a threshold level of e p a in order to derive these important benefits i think two grams is i is a good threshold now ism the international fish ell standards i is o they have a weight where they do third party testing of a ton of different fishbowl supplements from a round the world and they measure the concentration of the o mega three fadiasis in the sexual supplement because nothing is ever what it says on e bottle and then they also measure measure contaminants o mercury p c b toxins things that you would find potential in fish that me harmful to humans and they also measure mercury and the oxidized fadiasid these ill make it re fadiasis are jolly unsaturated fadyasits which are extremely prove to oxidation please o keep your fiscal on the liberator i because it is closer y they are extremely lines in the covers an now i know that the the the shelf life increased as lower oxidation you do not make it herisents right i anyways they measure that and i typically to look for they give you a total oxidation number it is called too to no t o t o ax to too is what we call it for short and ism i it to be at the least under ten idling d or six is fly hard to fine all the right mixtures of things but om people can go to this website and they can brows through the products have put together and excel sheet which i have a a you to little screen casts that ism yet to publish press the publish botany on but at basically you have to go back and check and up daces see are from different lot numbers of the products they do have up till twenty twenty seven or something and have gone through and found my topics of hi e p a brains and hi d t brains if i were to buy some the one i would choose because of the low total oxidation and the high concentration of either e or it now ism people can go and do this themselves it must take some work no ism glad to you did the work i ism going to put up a tweet every week no with you aged until this list is relish on line sorry on o atone de i now it is very sadistic of to but in service to he community yes and now i and i and i toll five brains from me and i try to choose i try to find one in rope in one in canada to the rat a great selection of thank you you an in that wither i do not want to do that were and i i trust you ye i try and get two grams per day of e p you from supplementation it'll now put in the refrigerator a mood is better i made that decision mainly based on the data that ism aware of a looking at comparison of people doing that anywhere from two to four grams of e p per day compared to a assessor eyes sir tonal select of seritonary a taken visitors and firemen depression and i do not want to take an assessor if i do not have to and fortunately in do not have to but the data by my reader remarkable people that take these things in sufficient doses meaning the e pes are able to get by with much lower dosages of assessor is for depression relief were in some cases to come off to the accessories completely ism ere a void goal and the the present medication of course is is not something people should cowboy f your mental health issues are serious but i what other reasons id love your thoughts on that o yes to help part and at maybe could tell us waterhole things that getting two to four grams of p per day is going to help with in our brain and the rest of our body it is a you do ism i actually published a paper back in twenty fifteen about the role of a mama three invite him in d in depression by polar disorder by polar disorders gets a friendiin impulsive behavior but ism within that paper the doing back round research in this was overview article by the way i was as connecting dots dominant on mi grab but i i confess i do not know the paper but it i love quality use because the references therein are useful well ism there is a huge roll for inflammation the cause of inflammation an depression and i you n i think we did a short animated bayou on this as well i hear to go back when i was mean if publishing that work where people are injected with like a polish sybarite and mean this is something that were were generating from or from our got mostly from are got permeability which happens a lot a and toxin its recalled it is the it is amour toxin like poly separates basically the outer membrane of bacterial cells when bacteria dot would die when the mine sells in our got comeinto contact with the bacteria because we ran alcohol five days in grow or whatever mum we release endotoxin or t something street us out we released endotoxin into our body and that causes in formation and you can eject people with like o like poly salaried and cause depressive symptoms however if you take those same door people give them e p and i think it was somewhere around two grahams and then inject i with he like poly sybarite were establishing causation here i a it totally the depressive symptoms verses the placebo p they placebo with sailing control there is this as a placebo control because obviouslyech hugely important for depression am it ameliorated the depressive symptoms give as a cause by poly sybarite amazing ps let e jolly sybarite is no joke i a years ago when i was work on thermal regulation a we would inject animals with l ps to induce fever its there is a the vaguest nerve registers the presence fell pa signals to these a prettylar hip otlemicaries and cranks up body temperature because basically its a signal that the body is in fasten i am amazing a i will continue with my two grahams proa man ramp it up the fort ism not doing the d c separately there t d can the same yes supplement is the o k yes it ye and and kind of bet we have we got a lot of things to hit back on because your olein our original questions was chill oil verses fish n else and d y y d oh specifically am is it it it is i know infospel lipid form it it is more big available a our bodies if your comparing exact quantity or concentration intreglas it form verses am phospholipid form you will get more in your plasmacells in your plasma pans in your plan your plasma with chill oil however chill oil a supplements are logos i mean good luck getting two grahams a o megathere from crilloil and also crilloal supplements are notoriously rancid i do not know for whatever we that is what made me it oh all over i think there just i i i i i have not found a good chill oil supplement a i a are primus stay away for met me if you smelled to ambitious we it just smells danced i but the thing is and i also published a paper on this back in twenty nineteen or is something that i about d oh n phosphate lipid form getting into the brain i in a through a different mechanism than d h in trackless right form and it is got no through a transporter called the m safest two a transport and i think it is very relevant for people with an power formal i can with at all tierces s right twenty five per cent of the population has in a little an a gene called ape a for and basically it it is ape but the for is is rereferre to as the the the bad conto version of it i this is something in our blow bodies is also in our brain and it if people have one of these versions if they got one from their mama their dad they have a twofold in crease is for all summers disease if target too which is much it is much more let us less it is less common i think it is two percent the populations som he has to illegals but they have a ten n or eleven full increase rs of all summer disease i there is a roll for phospholipid form am de each in the rand but you also make phospholipid d oh inside your body and you can do that by taking in more trebles it forms the two grahams the magic more two grams a more is the magic number i think kind aback ti the the i for fishbowl and an i i personally think it is one the most powerful anti and lavatory things dietary lifestyle things that we can we can get easily relatively easily that mum is is gin a powerfully modulate the way you think the way you feel and the way you age and a variety of different types of studies kind of led me to that conclusion aka variety of you know observational studies there is been lots o work by doctor bill arris and his collaborators looking at what it is called the omega three index this is actually the o megathere level in red blood cells red blood sells turn over about every hundred and twenty day it is a it is a long turn marker omega three status this is very different from ninety nine point nine per cent of any study you see or any i lab that you go to to get your megathere levels testa you are getting a plasmaphosphe limpid levels tested which is kind of you can think of it as what id i eat a couple days before oh i had with my a mega the levels are great but do you et fish that everyweek or was it let was you when out to dinner i it is not a great big marker for long thermal mega three status it is kind of the fasting blood glucose levels wishes the h b wen c which is a long turn marker right of your of your blood glucose level the el mega three index he is done a variety of studies a observational studies for people listening these yer studies there obviously glad because they are not establishing causality there you you are looking at peoples life style but in the sit in the case of a bill arris is work he is measuring something is measuring you megathere index and he is measuring yo megathere an news in people and then looking at their mortality risk for example their cardiobasu disease risk a and what he is found is that most for it first of all a standard america diet i has no mama three ideas of five per cent japan by contrast has no mama three ideas of a round tenno eleven per cent big big difference there and they also have about a five year increase life expectancy compared to people ne us and not you thing that is mainly due to their fishing take fit an what he showed was i i think it is a bi part of it and men you can oil say its the only thing but what he showed in his data was that in and i think it was framing hand study where he he looked at the o make three ideas and people that had a o mama three ideas of four per cent or lower close to what the standard america is but little but lower ism they had a five year decreased life expectancy compared to people that had in eight per cent wo mama three insects and a big difference there right five for five years life expectancy but here is the really interesting thing intend he also looked at smokers and smokers and their o machree level since we stratified at right an he found smokers that had no damage three were the worst of all i mad was it was just the worst right we all no smoking is bad session will take taking yourself our life expectancybut smokers that had the high love smokers that were taken their fish wail or eating fish or whatever was they were doing to get him up to eight per cent they had the same life expectancy as non smokers with the hello lot make a three insects well right well and that is that is amazing and it is also making me that people still smoke see rent but i see a lot of full vain and i i and i and i know a lot of people consume anabas right people up as there been any studies of a specifically amazing or people um smoking manual and i we all cause mortality n vent seen this if i have not seen them h not out of enough to come in as research subject that was that was again a a poor joke u it is hard to study people o mere want a use unless ism told by my colleagues ta study the stuff unless you offer people parent in which cay still do it but again there actually not very good restart subjects in all serisasas they are not very motivated or consistent and they forget their appointments that is incredible and you mention that the de on pollution related to the plant compounds earlier most almost these things are again are acting in a reparative way the to mama threes are i mean there they are resolving inflammation there blunting inflammation there they're doing many different at they had the effect many different parts of the inflammatory path which is i think it place a huge roll in in the way we age that we are brain ages thatch we feel or mood just a joints all that and it is it is amazing but it is not i i love fish well i feel better when i take it i try to eat some fat fish a couple times a we i do want to just touch on foot sources for a moment a first of all are there plants that are rhinal mega threes and second by i have some friends whore really into meat and i meat lot o that is argentine but i do not eat very much of it a tiny high quality meats and relatively limited amounts by do pretty often but have been told a by these a sources of a questionable authority that if an animal grazes on really good grasses for instance that the meat can contain a lot of mega threes which in principle make sense based on this will megathere index cause your telling me that a lot of this a megathere sequestered into the red blood sells if i meat an high quality grass fed meat and the grasses had mega threes to my stakes have a meg threes or no a there was a study publish that compared conventional meat meat that is there that animals are fed in a corn or sopor whatever i which is terrible ya for animals and people as far as i can tell ism sure it'll get it'll get some a attacks but that k i will not read those comets the m they again a joke i read all the comets but a the it seems to me that he these animals have to get either be taking fishawell or eat plants that are very rhinal megatheres in order for that the meat to actual contain sufficient damage threes i the meat comparing the conventional meat to the the g grass fed bring a pasture raised cows a cattle a there were higher levels of alpha and law said and a a is it can be converted into e p d g am but the conversion is very inefficient and very dependent on a variety of factors including genetics genetics a a huge regulator some people can do it much better others your getting five per cent of conversion to e p a estrogen is a major a regulator of making not more efficient and and makes sense because pregnancy when your estrogen us goes through the to i mean these will make ts prefadiosis play a very important on brain development seer women are supposed to be converting any ale ay they can into the longer chain will are a three fa ya said right a estrogen does affect that but i would say plant sources if you are looking for the a a plant sources would be in a walnuts flack seeds those are probably highest but if you if a person is a vegan or vegetarian their best bet is to actually get my cryology was and you can supplement with my geology was because mycology do it is they do make the the d g and u that would be a better source for for people that a that are vegetarian n begin rather than doing the flaxseatoil because that conversion inefficiency no the aims that convert albino a piantiece ganders it is inefficient and then for people that eat fish i sardines you said i summon summon and e eft eat the skin as i understand i you had to boa it is got it is rich with with the i yet and and in the reason i say the i i i think the best would be wild almsman salmon first is the farm was because the farm rays again they're feeding em they are feeding em corner there feeding green an staff room and then they give em ask o the than ask o the action is a cretinoid it is the car and that is in things crib crustaceans that make their red pigment it's also being use now as e supplement and there is a prescription form to try and rescue some age related vision loss because of the the roll of the vitamin a pathway and photorscepters a ya will after the crinoids themselves lupines see than the'rereally good at sequestering singlet oxygen which is some damaging right i to the was we age they am because the rental sells i the i sells the is metabolically act of the cumulate a lot of reactive oxygen species and a might a control repair and limiting react if ocean species is of major a theme of trying of rescue vision i think ya that is tat hat's the whole other podcast an tasty there is a really interesting data now on these of red light to try and trigger these pathways from means to plunge that is my a good friend of many years and amazing science is glen jeffreys last the universe college onion ism the we should talk but that at some point i i o that study a twenty twenty was an i a i i can thee ye yes looking real i mean not the diner cautious the they're appropriately brutish and cautious about it i have i ways choke if those toadies a ben done over here everyone already no about it glen is a very conservative guy but they have done the stuff now in in pigs and rod in models and now also two studies and humans it is looking pretty pretty interesting am sardines but also anchovies ism an old like by the way i hate all the food items that ism describing i can barely tolerates him i do not fish at all i should i li oi i awe shat ant when i was a kid i just do not no i find fish unless it is in sushi form i find absolutely i repulsive and i do not know why i probably have some mutations the raw fish is actually fire and mercury then cooked o a will that's good n do not really such that much anyway am you are giving me great reasons to not e fish i bat except i should eat these other fish sources or supplement more heavily that is the man o t sardine ma my every day my first mel almost is a canisardines and obicatoo with vacate is good i yo with little be leman and then some little hot same is a octavo make a threes i cat is very good in mono and saturated tot i it isothere really high an plans i drink fall make it three really i mean it is it is it is either the the dacha epic it is in t the marine s horses fish or it is the plant ale source which is the flock seed or the wallets a it is rough i mean to all these o companies amour are making these a plant base products that taste meat my wishes that they would just make a fish that tastes a stake we that is the fish come out it'll by north once at they farm rays because they do not eat any of the i joking i do not wan y modified fish that tastes a stake thou know t i love the taste of sake the point here is that if you do not if you if one does not see themselves regularly consuming these fish of these at fish sources of omega threes it seems to me that the only way to really get them is from supplementation and supplementation is a good way to get a a high dose and and to get back to your dos point there was a a couple of studies that that basically nosh i think there's but there is some way they show that people that are in the four per cent o meg three index range in order to get to the eight per cent right the five year increase life expectancy for comparing the two groups was the supplement with at least two grams t washout two grams a day a and not and i think it as a little but lass offish trellis right for mat i think two grams is we a good safe number most america that are not eating lot of fish ndtheyre not supplementing a probably around o fortified per cent omega three index and to get to the eight per cent and and think that is a good empirical way of thinking about at right o he will i went to get to that eight preset by the way ism almost sixteen per cent omega three and dos can ask about a about testing yet were can somebody measure wherein how can somebody measures there omen three ideas which again just to remind people's the mentally the per centare of omega threes that you have in your blood with the caviar that the omega three ideas will be heavily bus by what you eat in the previous days not omega three inner o make under a i thouhtyou said in red blood sells alibi eight say an two days ago my mega three insects is gong to go up no that was plasma i miss lesson o the play o most people are measuring if you look at a lot of studies and honestly and i think a lot of the reason for conflicting data it is because people are measuring plasma o mega three levels of ta the phosphate lip its is in a phosphor li it rights years your fhosphe lip its are carrying thing these are lipoproteins i r their carrying things i o mama three in trellis rides and self and shuttling him around am the omega three insects is actually in the red blood sells and red blood sells take a hundred and twenty days to turn over if you are gin to do a baseline test am if you want to know before supplementing what you are level is you have to wait then a hundred and twenty days before doing the second less after supplementing to know how meou you went out because the i that is how long it takes for your red blood sell to turn over the omega three ideas on bill arris has a i a company that he he confounded is called omega quant and they measure they man three and ex they have a variety of different index last you new a basic one ore a little more advances from a bluddraw it is a little blood spot the ya and a the keys money to funnel back into doing lipid research let hes out there doing all sorts of interesting studies on a megatheres its great but i o the o megathere indies great o i think that honestly more people and more researchers should be using yet because i the conflicting daythat always always comes down to what were measuring the sensitivity other it i are we even measuring anything you are you are giving some one five hundred telegrams of de h and you do not see ne effect will did you measure what their levels were and did you measure the me megathere invalid there is all sorts of problems with ran is control trials and i think that i just we see to as scientists we need o come to gather and make some progress i me let us all talk to each other let us let us let us figure things out this this test is out there it should be used it should be use not just by bills group every one ye well in am learning much for mean i agree we need more collaboration have always enjoyed really fruitful collaborations in my lab at stamford and o clambering to much more fond on find there seems to be abyss more tits creating stylus as supposed to am bridges but i i appreciate the bring up the need for more collaboration and and knowing which measures are best and the case of it now thank you for the clarification i understand the o negate index is going to be best you mention you baby when now and i look you i think you are sixteen per cent omegthre dolphins or nineteen per cent ism almost is argol you are shine to get there to do the interesting a i shall they should problem do something you chine achieve the omegathry a a ratio of the the your favorite species a now that we have covered a bit of how to get these things into one system depending on what one eats at camera and some of the better measurements how is o mega three and some of these other related o lipids how are they having these passive effects in my mind and this this is incredibly elementary but my understanding is that it some level their making platelets more slippery is that true or not i hope ism happy to be wrong a how is it possibly impacting my mood is it through the anthesis of membrane on anurans that allows barons to release more transmitter ceirtone and opening what are some of the reported reported and known mechanisms i think some of the the most well known mechanisms a do you have to do with the the megathere fadiacids being very powerful regulators of the inflammatory process in some way ship per form whether that has to do with resolving that are produced that from the metabolites of de oh for example resolving play a role in resolving in inflammation you want your inflammatory response to be actuated when it is supposed to be but you wouldn't resolve that inflammation in the in flammetoryesponse in a timely manner right and resolve ins help do that and and resolving are one and then there is e specialize am premeditating molecules as pas that also help resolved the inflammation i there is you mention the latrines and prossiglandins and these things are being affected by e p and they do effect platelets in plate that aggregation and the if they do effect that whole pathway as well and there is just and there is t i think is i many different ways an imports and when we talk about inflammation honestly it that it is a big general term but you are talking about when you are talking about stone and release i mean at the level of neurons we know that these inflammatory molecules cross the blood brain bearer and he just mention to go about injecting people poly scare in causing to pressie symptoms ism it is known that that megatheres actually specifically e p a is able to help serotonin in inflammation inhibits the release of saratonan and e p a is actually able to blunt in flammitory responses along with ice as well date does that resolving and stuff and this then helps more seratonand be released because you are you are not having much inflammation getting into the brain and affecting saratonan release right that is one mechanism and then another would be well the itself has been shown it is it is a very important a facias that makes up sell membranes many sell membranes including in our neurons and as you very well know and we the structure and function of recaptures of transporters these mumbling bound prolines on the surface of ourselves including irons are affected by the membrane fluidity how rigid and how fluid the see mumbling is and d the plays a roll in than for example an animal studies if you make in animal deficient in d oh there serena receptors opining receptors they are effected because the structure of them is affected through the fluidity of the membrane and i think that is another mechanism and and ism talking sort of general cause ism not an hero scientists never makes perfect sens si in we know forces o norplasticity and the at almost always involves the recruitment a more receptors or an improvement in some feature of receptor to her transmitters and they literally move latterly in the membrane the con a float around little rat sometimes they are in fact in lipid rafts and it makes perfect sense at these molecules like d oh which are part of the structural fact of the no on because of course the outsides of theirounds are basically fat not just the milia that people have heard of but the actual membranes that if getting that right you wouldn't want id as rigid as concrete but you would not want it as soft as mad to come up with something here tea golly stuff the kids play with it is the go anyway there is madam is disgusting and its too soft to be a membrane for anuran that is get it in as machine he's none i put in ass too put in the comments and tell me what that disgusting guy stuff is a you do not want your neurons to be that day and yet you do not want them to be concrete either is bounce it is about not and in mentioning d oh ism just going realize of back tracking but i want to make sure that we close all the hatches for people we talked a lot about a e p but are food sources of d h that you find particularly attractive either by taste or by o potency for d oh what what are just a few that we could throw out because i am a i am aware that there are supplements re e can get a nice a to of e p h where you take them separately as you do but if i want to make sure that ism getting enough d oh what do i need to be sure ism eating on a regular basis well the fish is packaging the d oh n e p in race o an o but i i also do eat salmon row which is very salt and i it is a it is a really high source of the phosphate phosphorite coming d h that we ts fish eggs it is yet yet and actually i hat i for some real o do you ye it'll eat us ism discovering something about myself am that this is was not meant to be outrush nutritional psychotherapy but you are doing that for me anyway am ism discovering that ye i eating embryonic fish i just do not eating the actual fish aciwam o c fish legs are to ks here have arbs caviar yes and and that is a good source of the lospho limit for i and i was consuming not a lot because i wanted to get the phosphelip it form ye ism and it is usually really good there been some animal studies and piglets and rodents as while showing that consuming phospholipid d oh i during feudal brain development i i gets wat ten times more d chaining the brain again it is make see passed on feudal development do i need to inn a bi blue caviar stuff can get pretty expense of it two unit all i do not hetman need to i think it is a it is a matter of prophrends and i you if you are supplementing with your you are two to four grands of fish well i mean that you are going to get phospholipid form any your bodies can me get o calls have seen some containers of of what i room to be quality fish gs theater not at the caviar level the confined in in the better grocery stores that are not super expensive i would not dip as low as to go e for instance am fishing bat one or cads we use to go fishing and put the fish egg on the thing that is probably not g all the it is good enough for the fish of p i only half joking here fogs ism outrun to protect you from yourselves do not get any crazy ideas about eating fishing bates o a that is great to know we have these plantable compounds we have the omega threes s p h and then you mention there is a third category whatwould you place in your third category of o foods or supplement base nutrients that our health brain and we body health can really benefit from i mean i think the most obvious would be by him in which is actually it stailroight hormone that we produce when we are in the sun depending on the time of year om we can make it in our skin depending on how much melon an we have an our skin or whether not bring sun screen or how old we are it is it is a very there is a sliding scale and how efficient that processes and the sort of as nersham therein in verst relationship with the darker the more darker the darker your skin is naturally the more video in d you need to consume as that right the darker your skin is of the harder it is there is a study out of the university chico this a several years ago where they looked at on african america and om compared can america to o occasions with lightship fair skin and how how well they could make by the me from sun exposure and i how long they had to be in the sun to make examoutright and it turns out that o africanamericans with darker darker pigmentation which protects them from the burning rays the sun and a natural sunscreen i had to stay in this on six times as long as someone with no none of that natural sun screen i i think the the the the take home there is i lot of people with a darker skin living in subsahered africa or people living in india with darker skin or in the philippines of these ecitroyal regions were there their tendency darker skin because its protection from the burning rays of that position there they are in the sunward and their getting work a bit em and but on people that may be moved to united states cavemen is soda or in a place where a u v b radiation is in getting to the atmosphere twelve months out of the air its only getting their four months for example i or even living in our modern a inside peoples do not go outside any more me were inside were it are laptops in school were at workmen ore cubical whatever ism supplementation does play a major rule not only for people with om darker skin that that are outside a the time but for every one seven per cent of the u s population has inadequate video in d levels seventy of the whole amaze you what you ask there is every one i and and i think that insufficient levels defined as less than thirty anagrams premial leader i and in that is sort of defined by the the endrin society looking looking looking at a lot of different aggregate studies all cosmortality for example i there is been a lot of different met analysis of all cosmortality studies where bit him in d levels a r really seem to be ideal between forty to sixty anagrams premial leader and om in order to get to that level if you are not outside all the ti live in son at southern californium we are always outside withoutson screen on i always wear sunscreen because ism trying to protect my skin from some you wrinkles cutoff right but also skin cancer is somewhat of an issue as well ism basically the point is that video indeed dairroid hormone meaning it actually bines to a receptor and o another receptor r diorites with that item that the renting receptor and tot complex goes into the newbies of a all where your don is and at rest recognizes little sequences of liana called item in d responds elements a c ad arms their specific sequences of dona that this complex vehement you rs that bound the vitamin you receptor goes inside and recognizes and turns on a whole hostegines turns off a whole hostergines i in theses this is important stop imagine seventy present the population having insufficient to stopsterond right this air right hormone which might we might be headed there am but probably not no i think that it is names are very important and i think that one of the issues is that item and is called vitamin d it is not called a d g e or very an blow blot it does not sound a hormone i also am glad that you are mentioning a skin as the major kind of interface between the environment and item and synthesis because a lot of people think of skin as just a protective sheet around us a something to adorn ourselves with brings or status or whatever but skin obviously serves those rolls but the skin is an indican organ it has the capacity to make things that in pact hormones and to make hormones this is beautiful study out this last year where o the took place in over in israel where they had people get outside for twenty of thirty minutes a day three times a week exposing a am culturally acceptable yet substantial mount the their skin a during that time and saw big increases in testosterone and estrogen and this is through a coat in a site linked pathway involving p fifty three that did wontthis as done in humans but they did som knock out studies in periled and what the study told me or reminded me is that skin is an indicia organ the idea that son could trigger the activation of of a production of a hormone is really interesting a and makes total sense when item and gets into cells and it is combining to these v d are es es am what what sorts of things are they triggering for testaceron we know its skin trigger preaching sin this is muscle go at tenant strength et camera with estrogen its can be a keeper neurons going your joints feeling good i was remind people that am by the way because us are always seem to want to increase their tesocteron and reduce their estrogen just remind people if you reduce your estrogen guys your label will plummet to near zero do not crush or estrogen a it also make you stupid am if you are not already stupid it will make you stupid am estrogens vitally important for males and females when item and gets into cells what sorts of things is it stimulating o ifs the first of all its its regulating more than five per cent of the protein in cote cumin girl more than find is was n i say more than because when i was looking at the date i really in adapt back in is starting twenty twelve to twenty fourteen am it was that and then it is now grown but ism one of the important things that you will find interesting that i published on back in twenty fourteen was that it'd gone through this this big published dato base we some one had you a published all these genes they found day or was in and ism basically i found that trip to fan hydrocsalays one and trip to found hydroslays to was on there ans then i star looking at the sequinsinenc doing some insilico work and it turns out that ism the v dare and trip to found hydroxyls to fer people listening trip to fan hydro lays is an enzyme that converts trip to fan into serotonin trip to fan is what we in yo meanamased that we get from our food i you convert ceratonan you convert trip to even into sretonan into the got in the gut but you also do it in the brain however serotonin does not cross the bloodstain barrier trip to in has to get into your brain and then you have to convert it to serotonin in your brain well the ends ism that does that in your brain is calved trip to found hydroxslays too and it is activated by bedim in d ism the one the gut is actually trip to found hydroclas one ism some of my my published work hypothec size that at might actually be repressed by video and because it has a sequence the sequence itself o this twelve newclatye sequence it can determine in to some degree whether can be activated or turned off and i was able to cant look at that and think o maybe this and tot an since then there's been some groups that have confirmed more with in vive and or invert studies i mine was algin silicone all that stop but ism anyways serotonin a really important one but most people i mean this is regulating our mine or mine cell a mine system it is regulating your blood pressure all that that is water retention i mean bone of course homo stasis five per want more than five per cent i mean i cannot tell of much i man i was and was see seven zero per cent of the es population deficient i i begin to think that this could be the lynch pen an a number of really important issues supplementinvitedmin d three is what i normally peers the the i do i take a think i are not up taking five thousand i use sometimes ten i use o item indthree per day just done that for a long time and have had my levels tested in their in range but have a family member it'll just dimensionless have a family member who was not feeling well just cone of feeling awful little low at some digestion is uses went on along time was taking on my recommendation fifteen thousand i use of d three and was still deficient indthree now takes and ism not suggesting anyone to this is a special case perhaps i but no chronic illness that were aware of means to take thirty thousand i use per day in order to bring their three range just into normal which is to me a striking because they e quite will the healthy wat et camera but it in it is made o tremendous difference in turns o their mood now courses correlative now they feel better than doing it who knows i belly also getting outside more but i i think people need to get tested for they one to get the d three levels tested ah but we are we rein what is a good starting range for people too you think about thee three supplementation and again foods that can increase t three ism item in d three is a good way to supplement with it ism there it em and to would be a plant source you often find it fortified in foods milk usually d to there is been a a sane still drink milk besides kids people merit is that you cannot fix tell o i yet all the li most that your moat so ye and they are fortified in those as well oh they are o they are couther fortified and give a hards i foeman know no milk an all that stuff at they are they are they are in all that stuff ism vote em indeed is naturally to some degree in fatty fish you think about cod liberal oil right is it has by em and but it is not you are not in a correct a deficiency with eating it with eating fish for your by them index you are either in a created with son exposure being in the right area having the right amount of son and being right age ism because as you get old you become very inefficient at doing that converting ism vote em and making by them into three deerskin that is that alley at was going on here to this person is getting up an there there is a lot of single newly tied pollymorpmo more prisms we talked about ape we for previously but there is a variety of a genes that people very common actually in fact have had many people that have hated to done that exact same thing ism measuring your item in d levels before an after supplementation's the only way you can figure that outright ism very important if you do not measure it you do not know l you cannot know you do not measure ism there is a verity of snips that basically make that conversion inefficient and in fact there's been a lot of these been dealing n random isatin studies these are studies were people scientist will look at common snaps people that have these common variations of a gene that is a little more than one per cent of the populations s it is not a randomization it is actually found in it in a a sizable percent of the population and then they have looked at various outcomes and ism a lot of times they will look genes that are also involved in some kind of life style factor bite indeed i in snips that basically make the conversion a it em in either it em in de precursor into d three or in d three into twenty five five rocks e bite in d or into the act of steroid hormone which is one twenty five pivedroks he by the many ad here is a variety of different snips at show people and you are not looking at bite in d levels at all you are looking at just the snips and if they have it there have low by them ended a case it is really a way of doing a beautifully random control trial with an observational study because you are you are not by us it em in d levels a also associated with health people that are have higher by them ended are either outside more than for physically active or they are ware of their health an there supplementing right you always have to worry about that when you are when your you are doing an observationalsive at dealing aronimization is beautiful for that reason where you now just random people arranably have these genies and it is not there is no health status if you have the snap your friend your family member was healthy in all that they were healthy and yet they could not get their levels upright ism these these men dealing animations stayed have found that people that cannot convert ism into the the precise or the twenty five five drops you by them in you which is usury what is measured it is the most stable form inky cement in the body ism they have a higher all causemortality if they cannot do it people with that do not have it have a lower all cosmortality they have a higher respiratory related mortality they've a higher cancer related mortality ism to me now why did i get on this rand out because your front your family member basically ism they also are more likely to get multiples gross this this has all been done with endearing renmusation and ism it really does hammer home the importance of measuring your bitamnty levels and to being being very proactive about that i mean you can you can d get it at any were your doctor will do it you ask him to do it ism supplementation wise ism typically if you do not have one of those snaps for for the most part taking one thousand i use o video in de will raise blood levels by around five manor grams premililator let us say your deficient you are twenty anagrams formililator and you want to get to forty you are gin a need at least four thousand i use if you are normal do not have any of these snaps that change your metabolism of vitemend right does at matter a when you take it relative to sone exposure time of day with her without food have seen someone great preliminary evidence suggesting may be time of day is important i do not think it really i cannot seem t to find anything that really suggests because the for tact to be converted into the hormone mane it is stored just hammered if these slighter torments are slow outta it is not a mediate thing right maybe will get some new data that is otherwise but i just her i it simplified the problem anyway a for people who are going to be stubborn and not get their d three levels test or their de levels tested and simply say u it'll just take some my three am that was me by the way a be until i got tested i threw five thousand i use into the mean figured whilst nocking a kilmeit'l bringing my vydemendy levels up and realize that is a bit of a of a of a course way to approach it but now i feel fine in am ism still breathing an ambulatory am is is that reasonable a thousand a five thousand i use for most people be reasonably safe again were not make just assuming that people are on at just jump to it without the blood test of course i think that ism if we if we if we look at the the the literature of the science i literature it is extremely hard to get hyper calcific which would be the major concern with really high levels of visit in youthen supplementation i mean were talking hundreds of thousands ai you a day for a long time ism hundreds of that yes yes at now that the the upper tolerable intake was set by the i teethe medicine institute ism to be four thousand just it was just the safe it was kind of like one of those things where it is say i i i personally take five thousand i use a day as well and ism my levels really hover around fifty anagrams fertile and i i do out i do not i do not put sens green on all the time i do put on my face in i where hap some on my skin is being exposed by do make it me now from the sun as well but ism glad you brought up i i the fact you keep arms exposed if you because in these studies as i mention before looking at sun exposure on skin and increases in other hormones dossasseron assertion mainly it was it became clear from looking at those day that the amount of skin that you expose is important which makes perfect sense once you hear that but i think must be northing him out in the sun but are you wearing short and a teashirt or you wearing a sweat shirt and it is a headier you are you all covered up out and the sun will thou might be grate for setting your creating for them by way of a light to through the eyes possess the primary mechanism for that but seems to me that the the more of your bodies surface that you can safely and appropriately please folks appropriately exposed to the sun the more item indeed you are going to create it laying out and on your back deck i in short see a teacher with arms exposing legs exposed is a very different stimulus than walking around indenes in and a watcher spirit opium especial of yet sunscreen on your face i know it almost seems triveales simple but i not sure that people are used to thinking about their skin as a interface to create these hormones yes semfesaria matters and by the way ism there there's been studies looking at a people that are deficient invite him indeed ism in this case it was a african america that were given a four thousand i you a day by i mindecupplement to bring them back to sufficient levels and ism that this was a smaller smaller study than i i would but it reverse their epigenesis aging by three years because again it is a forgot it is regulating more than five per cent of your approaching n coating humangeno there was there is been studies looking at did em indeed receptor knock out mice and i i used the a lo on my presentations when ism talking about my mental in cavity bat ism if you look at these animals the item indeed receptor as i mentioned earlier ad em in rebinds to the receptor and that it complexes with the cretinoid receptor and they go into t the slice of the complex and red you turn on internoptings well you get rid of that receptor which is what you can do in animal studies ism you can you can sort of determine what effects there be with no bi om and right my what hood you study no no dimity and ism what was found was that these animals and if in fact i don't think if us a complete knockout or you know they think it might be in ranicllyful bet som i some hypomyes which is mosey geek speak for a genus very is vastly reduced in its function number and function number people know what i mean but abut is not eliminate completely right hell these animals ism if you look at them after the age of four months i mean the mice look light i mean the their accelerated aging the wrinkle they have no hair i mean thymus in their life and life span shorter ism they just they you can look at this animal and not know anything about mice or work with them man be that animal looks it is of course mi life spends iron like two to in half years bat five hundred years all right now i we i when to graduate it wit twice ye i she grades goes a lot of one i to think i age backwards and gradus school which is no true i look at the photos i dealing aged forward i you on the other hand look exactly the same way you did ten years ago ism not saying that flattery butts absolutely true i mean the day ore the daytime it is remarkable i i think it is ism defiling and trying get my magnet three percentage up that ism not gat it hinge it all on that but feel you are doing a lot of things right if ism taking my them indeed three i still need to get out into the sun caress the li look i think a lot of people do not know that or at least i have family members that have been li bit resisters i take my vitemintie i do not need to get outside this much i think people are really afraid of getting out into the sun because they are worried about melanomas and and ism as out to be of ism as scared of sunscreen as i am of melanoma li that some of the things in sun screen are really spooky mainly the come and here ism not one of these con drink top water wasn't exist people cringe i i drink top water have the occasional crassonor don't at ism ism not ism ism ninety per renting you per cent f the time ism doing the right things the right way i think although ism now going to prove on them with this new knowledge but but i do not what i see in most sunscreens because if you look at these compounds they cross the blood brain barrier i do not want compounds crossing the good brain barrier he that i dioxide a i oxide some of the trifles sands that are also in these cleansers i mean it is once you no a little bit about neurons folksong realize that her the irons you got a basely the ones you got four entire life there is a reason why the is a blood brain barrier of blood very and a blood testes barriers because the genetic material resides and the testes the ovaries and the brain those barons do not turn over there are few numerous but not that many unless you are a mouth frankly protecting those is very see and a lot of things in sunscreen a downright dangerous i think there are sunscreens that are safe but it is very hard to figure out which sunscreens are free of these compounds ism amazed that there still on the market frankly have always geared towards the ones with it the the minerals that are reflecting it ism it is it is somewhat difficult to penetrate things always through the skin into the get into the blood stream i do not but i do not know maybe some of these compounds getting their easily i have seen the evidence wit some of those things other there is o some of there they go transdermal and they and they get in t all i know that there ism of them reacts with the sun and while they do protect from the you a and or be they form mass of react of auction species and personage and i mean it is the the very thing you are trying to protect yourself you might actually cause right we do not now ism its completely speculation but i there is i thinks some more and more and more evidence comegout with some of those compounds and attic i cannot remember all all of a mouth the top of my head but ism a lot of high an ones also have have it is the chemical sens street one right chemical ones i we should ism proposing that we do a journal club a journal club folks is where academics get together and read pap where they read papers when they get together in thy pick a part the papers there is a strong correlation between being an early graduate student and being the most critical cause one you vastly publish some papers you realize that most studies people are doing their best within the contacts to what they can do but t be great to do at journal club at some point about sun streets cause it'd love to really figure out what is in these compounds i people are using them crazy and ism not one of these people is all i will not use commercial toothbays or anything that i i i a said i drink tap water i use commercial toothpaste whatever but when it comes to sun street it freaks me out because the some these compounds do go trains turn all and some of them cross the blood raspberry and it'd to get my rounds free of that stuff i w we are speculating now were at were hat a but get out in the sun and get your three levels up o case we have re tout hat these plant these compounds the o megatheres and three unless there is something else at you just absorb must throw into the me i probably will return us to the conversation i opened up with which is about cold and he which admittedly i pulled us off that that path i want it i take full responsibility for that but before i do that i just one of for you the opportunity is there or there is there anything that a it to supplement based or food base compounds that you you think or especially useful for brain and er body hi do think magnesium is immortal in there as well i mean i think again about forty per cent of the best population does not get enough magnesium it is an essential mineral were specivegetting from our diet and involved in everything it is it is invade it is also involved invited into metabolic and in fact o being deficient in magnesium ma make it more difficult for you to actually make vide i and forgot that one twenty five highboy bit in one of those other factors again talking we talked about genetics but there is also magnesium status as well considering forty per cent that is a big number ism now magnesium also involved in making it p the the energetic currency of ourselves tar easily all of ourselves needy to pee to do anything and ism they are also it is also involved in utilizing a t p as well as ana repairers cesar inside and r involved in repairing damage to our define i personally think that magnesium insufficiency is e insidious type a causes in insidious type of damage daily that you cannot look in the mere an s when you are deficient by dam in s you are my my gums are falling apart i have scurvy right but you cannot see dead a damage you cannot see a but it is happening it is happening right now and my body wins happening your bodies happening normal metabolism is happening every day i but we repair that damage we have repair ensign in are body called denar parensimes they require magnesium magnesium is a factor for them but that means is you know factory means and isms need it to function properly and i without that factor they are not doing it properly and i the the way i to think about magnesium it is easy we tropical what sushi write naturally that's a next question well magnesium is that the center of a chlorfimoth molecule color hill is wet gives plants their green color darkly greens are high and magnesium i it is one of the and people a easily what is the forty per cent insufficient insufficiency in that you just tell us people are not eating their greens they are not eating their greens they are eating their package bothering their process food standard america diet is not really high and darkly my greens i darkly greens are how i to get my magnesium i think it comes along with all these other important i mean you get calcium in them you get that by damn a one you are getting a lot of other machronetrians and you are getting other compounds that we do not know about and once that we know about sulphur fan i a as with brolly do i need to eat the dark leafy greens raw in this case i all more open to it because i a she the taste of deli s can and calls a darkly great right start a meat w is is an a in loading an and i ai coat medium not ism not colored blind but but is one ma spirit falls under the strict cat yes it is ever once while i you my equals a e of a capos of you of amiable i well vegetables also but kill what er some other examples an hale apanage charred twist charred rainbow charred i remain lactic is the bitterness an important component to the and it are tenesmus know but for for sulphurofane sulphur phasing for chricipherous vegetables that would be the the the the brassica family i but your question about cooking them magnesium is i it is bound of the food metrics and ism and it can be somewhat less you available i but cooking it can somewhat release the the magnesium but it goes into the water to you have to other steal or kind of get your water and f you mourn with it later yah i i personally do not worry about it o was do not worry i grit if you do not worry ism not but i also i two supplement with magnet do take around supplementation with magnesium i mean this we could go on and on let us keep this the shorten sweet because we can get back to the other stuff but i it can cause g i distress that hidrosis i personal to take around a hundred and thirty hundred thirty five milligrams i that way it is not a a huge bollix to my got no in depends on the forgot magnesium to yes ya i mean you can take magnesium a three and eight for example and is not as affect me know it doesn't effect the got as much i magnesium citrate nitrates when i take ya it is the pretty i take pretty learn i got stimulus am a minute if eel it syllabic harder demit doll take a hundred hundred andthirty five telegrams should be pretty good ism in situate actually i boy d we won to go here am i mean i i it is up to you and we can i we do not have to i personally i been supplement with maneshim for a long time ya am have i use three and eight and bisglicenate am and maleate ah for different reason i yes i would love to go there if your if you were well i would think mallet would be the best and ta that that has to do with the short chain out fatiasads being good for the god and a lot of work done by a former collie of mine and good friend markchigan i go showing that lest short chine fade citrate malice lactate a but but specifically male really lac tare the the other major ones that i get into ti to the g apitilial cells and are a energy source for the ma conduit in the goblet self anyways whole other o i i take valley because i was told that it would a be helpful first of all it does not make me sleepy some of the other forms of magnesium which act is a mild said it i for me am they do tap into the gabbergic pathway her need transmitter folks that in general broad sweeping generalization herein can have somewhat of a a of a said it i quality which is why i take man museum three and eight and for bisglicenate before sleep thirty sixty minutes before sleep definitely enhances my transition time to sleep am an the depth of sleep no question in my it my experience there some data that three either can be to can be need protective althoughthose are still the studies are still on going i am getting sense that made be a little more skeptical of the the a i ye i know i i have have seen the studies with the three and eye a i i think looking at the actual data from t the the the one clinical study i there was not statistical significance until all three of the pieces of day there pull together but that really could just be because their samples sees was see small right right yet i mean that that paired with that their saying worth the ye along lose work on with in the this is getting kind of inside ball of forbid that the quality of the labs matters folks and that something that is not accessible to people outside of feels and y know goon lo and some of the other folks with at that time an dow my teed it i i think very highly of their work and they the animal studies art indeed just animal studies boy pretty impressed by what they did in those studies very pionyearingthing when you think about this being done ten twelve fifteen years ago and then yes we need more human clinical data but i for me i finger that the given the safety profile man three and a given that t helps me sleep better in sleeping betters is better for everything i frankly a that is why i take it in disglicenate and thread eight see to be somewhat interchangeable a but there is i do not know of any reports the bisk eliminate can be nor protective but male i take sure in the daytime i i it for me a the gents is subjective it has a tangible effect and improving the recovery time from exercise it i do not know that have been sore from a work out since i stay taking male and i used to get very sore from even count of trivial work out i do not know what is going on there but i keep taking it valley again the short change diacid and i i mean you not when you do have a when you do intense exercise exercise you really enter tocsin from you are gotten i ism just going back to the interesting work is the the mallet being the short change diacid and i mark chain to a showing this is all an animal research by the way but ism i mean it was you feeding these animals male and it really protect at the got and your talksigy release and ism it effect end at abolecindrum an all sorts of things but i think me mallets all it en i always try to eat green apples thoroughly hin magic acid o good an and ism tart cherries hatcheries really highland as well sell tastes really yon but i i i ways really interesting the magnesium three and eight stuff i take a supplement called magnesium by moon juice and it is a little powder i it is got a little bit among fruit but it i taste good i it'd do it a little bit before bedtime ism as well probably several more hours thou be as i soft want to times an times it flu is if forgot o bat and ism it has magnesia three and eide and a variety aboutheir a versions of magnesium and it as well and i really it but i thought the magnesium threeandeight stuff was super interesting i you know left to see for clinical data as well but i think once we get it it will probably be oh yo it is getting into the rain in false himself right now by way i i a what and along those lines i once put out a a post hat said you know i i feel their number of different categories of health can health information consumers on line and understanding which one you are in for which topic can alleviate a lot of the strain and stress of finding the informationthat there is some people that a perfectly comfortable with data from amok studies if it is done in my great it'll try it other people sake no has to be done in humans a do not want posable control studies you know randomize clinical trials a et camera then other people are just you know what i do not care about any of that just tell me what you do and then other people that you knot only ma care what you do just tell me what to do and then there is this other category which are if it is in pill former powder form they will take it and i think a lot of the battles of people picking apart people's post one things have to do with fact that people do not re alive that people are showing up to the table it in one or some commination of those stances a we know people that will try anything non we know people that will not take anything a the idea here's to create a an a ray of possibilities for people a and i think the animal date are very impressive a we should have you back on i ta get with the hope of because i it alike the no it is very promise trying it r ho ism it probably is at i not well and obviously you are doing things right a cold and heat converge on some common pathways related to what you called intermittent challenge which i love i i think if a you now's interment fasting cold heat exercise i mean maybeven intermit sleep deprivation i keep waiting for the intermittent sleep deprivation movement i will say i pull a few all fighters for year just for work demands and procrastination and dead lines in ism a i the worst commination of of academic as ism both a procrastinator an a perfectionist you vend ut pulling small fighters the sleep i get the next night is pretty amazing i must say it is the sleep of gods but i do not recommend any when you sleep deprivation for that but i can imagine that we also of alive having some sleepless nights this idea of intermittent challenges is a really attractive one and i want to make sure that we credit you with the phrase intermittent called no night it doctor mark mason skate doctor mar mad titan notice and he has use that is wort of that yards oke great will make just doctor davit's in care i love that or he says i as in one of his publications is woman years an i just lot brilliant f brilliant terms mark mats and got tardigize or priest main u it is i meant it it is a good school i guess of of course said said good school a we will credit the appropriate people thank you for that clarification a you have talked a lot aba the use of deliberate cult what i call to liberate cold exposure only to distinguish it from cold that you might just be accidentally exposed to but it is sort of obvious when we say cold exposure there are some amazing baton cold a the other day i saw post from you and it is you have include this talks before i did not know this until i learned it from you credit to you that even twenty seconds of immersion in i think it's for degree forty nine to forty nine degree a farenheight o counts trembling asselsye boat forty nine to repair height waters o cold water can lead to long lasting increases in pinafore an a adrenaline a and i have to presume other narrow a nermoglayters in neuron chemicals as well a what are some cold protocols that you find particularly interesting or attractive from the standpoint of ion pic your favorite metabolism hero slash mood effects a brown fat stimulation which of course weaves back to metabolism we could we could do an entire episode all about cold but hat id love to knows o what sort of activity our stimulus you you think it is a reasonable and particularly potent one i to use in terms of cold to day i did three minutes at forty nine degrees fair and high i have a cold tub to get it up to your neck well i try i keep floating up ti i it is really hard ism soothe i i i would say oh may be most to my shoulder i calming really ism floating out by was sing i was telling my husband is this there too much water in here for me i cannot too much salt and there's it the dead sea re load on top is there faults in there nor he takes care of all the gong that it is it is it is the it is the plunge ism beta they been by the way the pod cast nor i am sponsor aby plunged they did give me one that thing is fantastic a cause it circulates the water which o make sure that you break up the thermal air in its even cold it is even colder it sox anyways ism look all all it'll give i give it a i it'll be honest here i wish i did more cold than i do i do cold when ism in go on a podcast i definitely you call when i me do podcast when ism going to give a talk or when ism anxious i need to make it more of a ritual ism i love doing this on ism hate the cold he day unless it is summer time it is a potties years for me to get in the coldness summer time but ism what i do love about the cold is how i feel after and ism i feel less anxious i feel good i feel more focus which is why i usually do it before any type of public speaking or in just when ism just anxious ism adjust getting there and ism the twenty seconds at forty nine degrees if i think it was forty nine to restrain high it wit was really a good number because time and temperature dodo at time a duration i guess would be a better word and temperature do matter ism but but you can you can do twenty seconds at a colder temperature which as i prefer or you can do a minute or longer at a warmer temperature i think there is another shoddy showing fifty nine degrees far and high at one hour i was to threefold but who ant's to be one hour him familiar t at study i the i loves is really reveals just how absolutely mercy i am and maybe why some times and relationships in my life were challenge i love reading the method sections of papers yo people can come but me with a umber of things about papers and i might miss something for surely i is certain things anybody is but the methods i sort of i i relish in reading the methods and that paper's really interesting cause they had people sit in long chairs basically swimming pools for an hour and it was not real it was chilly it was not super cold i in sixties not is not warm but it is not ice cold obviously but an hour is ridiculous it's some o but the increases in opening were massive and lasted hours it is it is really the mood enhancing effects that you report i they are not you are not imagining that that those are almost certainly a a the consequence of having slowly elevating but significantly elevated do opening that goes on for hours that is almost a dream profile for opening it's most everything else an after all a riddle in a cup of coffee and a and i work out drank a rework out drink or something is getting feel big spite in a drain and opening an a big crash and somehow it creates this really nice untoward profile i whatever your experience in there is very nicely supported by the at well i i need to get i need to get doing it more i have have had a a couple of scare experiences going from hot to cold darling blood pressure changes i think where i basically went straight from a really hot tocusya was in there for thirty minutes me know was i was doing heat to cosy of aye a hundred and for degrees fair in height is tasty and then id for thirty minutes and then i went straight in to at the time it was our pool i was in frebruary was if winter time and it was i fifty it was in fifties it is cold and and i was in there and i was listening to swimming carbuncle i was a transtayin along time get my cold an i trying to press and to see goes in the frolic he will staying there for fifteen minutes but i started to feel really blink look blood pressure something and i got scarce by got out and then i could not stand i had vertigo or something and i was scared it scared and and have have had a couple of times to where just going straight from the wanna to it a to the cold plunge i where ism starting to feel my feel little blood pressure change or something and and make sense the sand is causing was of violation and the cold plunge is caught a cold exposures causing vase construction it sis a very me know just shock to my system and now i wait i wait a few minutes before going in but i i do need a kind of make it more of the cold more routine because i talk all about the science ism family with all the science and that the more up and efferent o nor gentleman it is effecting brain and moon and way more about that than i do i know i feel and i know it is a narrow transmitter and i it is it is released at least in rats they have shown or it was at mice i think it may a ben rats but multiple say showing in that it is released from the cold in the brain and a now in humans as well oo doing that not duty but the that is the we with a long to this its a potion two thousand utopian journal physiology that big opening increase they also look it up in efferent and corisalln season really yes at this has been down de rain i d o no no not fatwa not yet yet eve i very hard to measure i doping directly from the brain leading mice did a snows unfortunately that there is unfortunately their skulls were in tact fortunately for them unfortunately for the research come their skulls were in facts this get measure directly in the brain but i see that there is a correct there it no its it is a very real effect i think that but do the advantage you've not doing it too often is that you are not cold adapted now it is very hard for any one to get truly cold adapted but some people start to look forward to the cold and what i think there looking ford to is the feeling afterward that foreman rush ah but if you get cold adapted than it certainly ones the some of the effect but i want a be cold adapted because that means i have more might a conduit in my adipose tissue and in perhaps even muscle that is been shown the may be this good opportunity to cold an you see p one if you could educate us on yum seep whale i find mister lunch and i learned about it from you yah ah well drop anaferan actually release in the plasma does that acts o hormone bays of constrictions one thing it does but it also regulates a variety of molecular functions that have to do with adaption to cold ism one tapping happening to be ism shivering is a very inefficient way to produce heat which is what your body's trying to do whin it is exposed to cold and your muscles are basically contracting in and and om and producing heat from that bit that just not very efficient a the the more eloquent we to do it or elegant i guess a way to do it is tobasially have you are might a conduit produce tons and tons of heat ism the way it does this is by activating a gene called you c p one uncoupling prating one or up an felon is upstream of that activating it i that what that does it is essentially might conduit are these little organs inside of yourselves that are responsible for producing energy usually that is in the form of a devising try phosphate a t p an that is what let us everything function inside your body from your nerve transmit or protection to your heart beating et camera i however a you can uncouple you are might a conduit basically you are might a conduit a they're a little battery they have it they while they have a double membrane first of all their structure but they have a negative charge on the inside and they have a positive charge on the inner membrane in between the outer remembering and inside the inside part eager a neuron was i guess it is a neuron it is a battery negative deposit well basically you can uncouple that that charge and that positive charge proton start leaking out ofthemigta conduit anyone might a contra free out this is called uncoupling it and they start to it is maximum respiration as we call it they try to make is much energy o they i got to get this that that that proton back that radiant y electrochemical radiant and they yes go in san and they am in this case it is uncoupled energy that energy they are making is actually heat not e t peat ah but heat is but you are essentially burning substrate who cares your burning your burning nucleus you are burning lipids you are you are easily burning things and making heat and ism that is what n coupling it does and tat is a much more efficient way of producing heat than shivering as you become more adapted i maybe the the longer duration that you you stayed in the cold or there times you have done you will no longer shiver any more you will start to than just do this uncoupling type of thermogenesis as it is call and ism another type of adaptation that occurs is you actually produce more might conduit in you are adipose tissue and ism and that actually happens also regulated by more a anafrona nor a formalin through approaching called pe g we one alpha and what that preaching does is it makes more might contra in you are atapostcell our atipocell you are getting more mite conduit it is a beautiful way to basically make more heat when your it is it is one of those things worth it is it is your body's going o a ism going to be exposed to this cold next time how can i make sure i do not die oh i can have more mighty conjryo and ism going to make more heat and you are making more might conduit in your adipose tissue and and this is often reefer to us the browning of fat and the reason for that is because if you look under a microscope at a lipid droit you not basically ism a fat sell i not a limit drop it at appetite am you will find the it looks darker because there is more mite country in there it is refer to as browning fat and ism in no going to get into the whole base fat brown there is is hole ism sure you have had experts on that talk all about that don't to yet ism can i allaying a wife at basal brown fat basis count of intermediinnert why cannot be converted into be bray and base take on thermogenic characteristics essentially and ism you can active a base fat that it is thermogenic in the sense that is ism burning glucose and near fatiacids and and producing heat ism the more you expose yourself to cold the more you can brown your fat to speak and and therefor ism you can tolerate the cold for longer periods which people do notice and you can then have the thermogenic qualities of having more brown almost issue or base act fat the be adipose issue which is ism you will get a lot of naysayers out there say o brown fat does not regulate metabolism at all the reality is there's thousands of researchers trying to bill pill up brown fat and thermoses your trying to make it a pill because it does affect metabolism ism it is not the only thing is certainly if you are obese and trying to loose weight you knock an it do that just by doing cold exposing no you to do dietary and exercise ism changes is prominently but it does it does affect metabolism and ism you this is this has been shown in human studies it is a a interesting other it is another possible mechanism fore ism affecting metabolism am n that is an almost tissue but you also make more mitacondra and muscle tissue and this is regulated not by a more pain offered but it is still pee to an alpha interestingly ism not not that any one else tell my carries but me and maybe you do i ye i ism eating this up i s o pig we one alpha is is respond is response in roup an are an tapes tissue to make more it a conduit but in a in muscle tissue it is in clear what the regulator is cold exposure does its this is this was shown am at least in a couple of studies have seen were a i people that were exercising i believe may be made have in men only they were exercising that some supper training and then did cold water immersion something fifty degrees fair an hight fifteen minutes an red you see an ala which is a big marker for mite control by genesis which is the generation of new it a curia by the way that is blossom you want more mite conjure n your muscle it is associated with am improved muscle mass i proved in durance i mean my a conduit are essentially either the making emerging yourself and we you now we do not make moremita conure an normally you have certain imports exrhigh intensity interval trading exercise can do it an i should make more mite conjure yes ya that is been shown in people and my ma training order just i into the interval train i haven seen wait training have seen it an in high intensity interval training and durance training but that does not mean that it has not been shown just have not seen in or that has not been looked an soutane ism ism always looking for reasons to finally do more it ti i intensity interval training work a do wait training if i do lo intensity cardie there was a brilliant study by am at the time house a postbox father robins and am he is now gone on to start his own lab at the university of organ health science enter re we am an and he do the study were a both young and old older people were they had this whole high intensity photo call which i cannot refer what it was but their protocol am for ex amount of time ism from sure it was at least a month a they then measured big markers of myth coral by o genesis in their muscle tissue and a the the amount of mite control by genesis an old people specifically it happened in both young and old from hit from the his intensity ideal training was i mean it was enormous at least fifty per cent i think i been wishes wo and why would you want that well m a contra you are your might a cot you do not make yourself yourself are turning over you make new cells you replace old ones wit your i contra a you do not really do that for the most part you can it cover by genesis does happen but you have to stimulate it to happen an m the way your mitacolik what happens with your conjure as they mentally are bobbing around inside yourselves and the they they fuse with other mite conjure eating exchange all their content mite conjraldinaa than is back apart and that is how to count stay young is but as you age you you keep doing that with the same pool of mite conjure than you going to get a monorail myth conjure mixing old stuff together right why would not you won i bring up new healthy young might a conjoint into that pool right in my mind when i hear mite contra by genesis on my aging that is the first thing no up a anyways cold exposure does that e a may other things as well no obis i and at please thank you for offering to somehow filter that the level detail but i assure you that listeners of the podcast a a familiar with getting i drinking from the firehouse of mechanism and that was really helpful and again this is just one example of may before five other things the you said at least that a on i inspire made to change my behaviors o most tar doing some hi intense internal training doctor and gallon was on the the outcast recently and he told me that that the subtle on to cardie in the weight trainings great but that i really should be doing som mas heart rate work per week you going into mass heart ray for ninety seconds and wasting in repeating that nave even mild repeats ism just curious as a brief aside before we we talk about heat what what sort of am party vascular other types of training do you do a you do hit imagine you a doing higintensh mineral training if you could just give us a sense of the contour of your your week as it relates to exercise and and because you ben very gracious in sharing some of what you do for supplements and food what about exercise i am it all depends on my week of course and and and what have got going on with my sun and in my work scended but i typically i do a lot of his intensity interval abacas on a stationary cycle i use platoon because i just that instructor there telling me what to do within e competing with everyone else you know i it work you revealing something about your psychology this a we just learn about this sodas is actually just a decoy for for a psychological session of snot getting ah but now we know your competitive good i that it is explains a lot of how you got through graduate school and in i do what you do you are getting on the relation and what is it looked for some one who is not familiar with relation i know what they are but give never been on one you are peddling against the instructor for how many seconds ism your there is a bunch of people that are on line either doing the class with you at the same time or at all time doing as to can you can kind of stolon what you want you can try to compete against that was sot ism realearnpeted oh ye of and the instructor is just there to whip you e li hong make you there there is there is a part of a the brilliance with platoon is i used to do rush was called rush cycle and i use to go in specially you go in in group group cycle and have an instructed there and you do all this hinetenseneral trying stuff and i loved at because there was a competitive aspect to it that had me working harder than i would work if it was just me in the without and instructor or anyone there and was just ism at a him any him and ism disown best stationary cycle listening no pot guess doing some which is fine if that is you group right but there is something about that group sating that kind of make hold you accountable you right and and the platoon made it somehow virtual it was amazing i and i remember being back at rush cycle thesis before fanatic an people talking about platoon in my class no my own ridiculous thought to do that likethus never in work i need the be here r and the the panama and i as all over the platoon and i it works for me really well i tend to do that at least three times a week i sometimes i do it more you of before and i do it ten minute just ten because it is efficient and i push my ass i push myself really hard that is the tomato it is it is twenty seconds on ten seconds off and it is ten minutes and on means your peddling you to put you are maxing it and there can to of resin all to ye will said you base there is a part where you are i always do resistance ism the power i do the power for there is a part where you you sitting set cycling and trying to really fast but i ways string the resistance up i was go above what they give me and then ism and then there is a part where you are standing and really crying the resistance up which i really don love you feel it your glues an going pail ye exactly and they break it up and most h time you willhave those two two two parts and i love the efficiency of it ism you just you get it don and people sometimes hear me go ten minutes or really you think you work and look you ma you do man you avatar for ten minutes and it it is it is intense thermos people cannot sprint for the for the gat of i implying thereabout to miss carrying a a back pack if you thing about if i thing about that and the i just ascribed mywiti a sprinting through the air portent on i and gallop when got my ninety second back hart rain for you carrying this thing a but twenty seconds on ten seconds off repeating that over and over for ten minutes by time you are done you are cook and then i because ism competitive during the recovery that they give you at the minute the end ism pushing it man i treat number any times in rick ye three times a week and then i always have my sand on red reheating up i takes about an hour and a half and i get it to about one eighty nine to repair in height i hop right in the sea after my inky my a platoon to the elevated hart ray continues as at the yes i i mean i literally down a bunch of water and then i get in and and then i either i read a science paper prepare for a presentation or podcast or i i pass over things in my mind and it is interesting because something about getting in the son i think the stress the heats tress of it i used i star during the sand in to does nine in graduate school and i o really adaptor i stir doing it every a i lived across the strain in i studio apartment with down with in the small studio part the smallest party you never imagine and it is a cross the see for ma was we i as i was poor in rites very poor very poor i mean i i ego a and recall an o gas i li tin in my lab well but an again i lived in my lab as a stock and is it i admit i lived in my lab with my bulldog as a faculty member a for other reasons a i gas i get it would your grade son you are for cases i and i used to used to go to the the sand before going in the lab and ism i would and i would i start noticing the at i was allow a sudden able to handle stress better theatres of my six month set back because i failed experiment which is crushing on top of the pressure from you admit my adviser and my own pressure ixia a very competitive it myself an i but a lot pressure myself i was having a hard time i mean i was very stress out n graduousan the sand serai to really noticeably effect my anxiety and my ability to handle stress and i was what is going on here i stir looking into the literature ism and so to getting interested in defects on the brain and in fact that the time i had a friend who was ism not actually experimentally but theoretically looking in to the the wo geoid system and ism basically when you get in this on you release a lot of endorphins and orphans are the feel good form a feel good options ism that make you feel good but o you also release something called dying orphan and dine orphan is an indigenous opioid that binds to a receptor called the capaopioid receptor which a dine orphan is responsible for that district feeling when you are in the san on your hot when you are running during exercise and your you feel uncomfortable ism well i think that is tin orphan ism speaking not i no i think is it is i mean that there's evidence in o ill collins that some of the symptoms withdroll the thixsperience are related to dinorphan and dinorphan is known to negatively impact the opening receptor system easily it is the feel garbage beth right you feel garbage and you think ism that that would not be good but i this is army my friend that comes in he he was looking at the effects o treating a morphine or heroinadiction and i men of people that are using the drugs they basically the the endorphins or the morphine or heroine they bind you receptor in the brain called the opioid receptor and ism as as they p they take these drugs that mop receptor i becomes down regulated and you need more and more of the drug to feel as good as you did right well endorphins am also bine to that receptor and he was looking into some of the ism other other drugs that are sylvan salsalanoria salvador ransoming the salvia it is call that a a binds the campion opioid receptor it also makes you can feel uncomfortable anyways ism he put some sides in front of me that showed basically binding of the either dinorphan or whatever lie down to the capaopioid receptor basically sensitized is the mu opioid receptor to the feel good endorphins and also changes i think it also ism regulates it or something basically there is a lasting effect of feeling good the endorphins at your release later from hugging some one or a joke your laughing out o whatever ism you feel it for longer right and ism anyways this is i but the san i with respect o this on its a big sort of hypothesis of mine i did kind of publish that part of a my hypothec is in i re you article but i do i would do wish more people were count looking to that than be amazing ism but but when i was getting out i think was i would use i would use the sand to memorize things this is way back in the done i still do it and an when i to talk to about this because you're you have your near your near scientist that there's something about being in the son and i think i soft know it has to do with the the stress response when you when you have an emotional trigger you remember things better right and absolutely that the there is it clear and non explanation for mechanism for thus you tho in the sand i mean you also release nor up an to friend just you do in the cold there is a lot of overlap your relieve your you what it mean i it is stress or but i lake use it to remember things ism going through something i want i go through a presentation or a talk or pogges or whatever an i go in that son and i mean yous try if you have not a right youth i have a sonar a can lunch now and i have not tried prepare i read books in the sand in the evening it is a it is the time i insist on having my phone out of there most because i initially because i thought id cook the phone but also just to get some separation from the phone in screens the evening i read books the only challenge sometimes you are dripping sweat on to the books bun willing to forego a few pages of a book i the a the the idea that being in this semi stress full environment would aid in the learning and and retention of information is is really well substantiate by this beautiful work by ruining names bagful i not of his laughs still active but he was you you see revive for a while and then i think it a you would receive arizona as well they have great memory group at both places very strong in learning memory on both places and he was the one that really defined this and of i inverted you shaped function for the relationship between a adrenaline and memory they finally if your to relaxed and not stress enough you're oi can remember any information at peak levels of stress you actually are a memory machine at least within the contact of whatever it is your thing to learn very well we what you are describing is very well matches with that then of course it tapers off as you really increase a dealing to the point where people are trying to lose out an comic function where they are just do it their panicking basically but obvious my your keeping it in range the other thing that would to ask you about its in the son of course there vase of dilation and profusion of blood to the brain is a wonderful way to enhance cognition there is even some really nice state or showing that during inhales as supposed to exhales people are better at learning information believe are not during the inhale your taking in and absorbing and remembering more than during exhales and these are beautiful sides done inhuman of course i can imagine the vase o dilation getting more profusion of blood to the brain plus a little bit of stress or may be a lot of stress from the pan afar m i and yet it is and then of course there is going to be that i do not call it placebo but there is can be the the contact the condition place contact of it we if we if we had a good experience remembering something in the son once sweet ended the plosive association effect of that location is real just if people go to a new city and they get robbed i soda since i tat her innocence tonight be yet robbed in sensinaity you first has taken your wall gets taken you cannot of hate since in at as a tourist but that could happen in any number of different sides right the office is also true if it something good happen momently som imagining that is a commination of those effects but it'll start it w we very hard to to do this in the cold i like the cold is a very potent a i think it takes you too far down that curve the manicure i have to sing the songs or something when i distract how e i sinks young but afterward your very efficient at learn after a am and with respect to the son ism the bays of dilation does occur there is a lot of overlap between moderate intensity erotic exercise and seamstress and as you can imagine when your exercise your eleven elevating your nobody temperature you're your sweating an ism when you are actually in the son blood does get redistributed to the skinned of celibates wedding but much exercise blood flow in general is improved to the brain the muscles everywhere ism i think generally speaking that and this you know there studies showing that son use is associate with a much lower risk of detention all timers dis ease i people me know people that use it for to seven times a week have greater than sixty per cent reduction in to mentioned it'll smash as ease visit how ton on a ow sorry i do mean to cut you off you said people w use it i upon was ta maybe it tells again people use it four to seven times per week a they have a greater than sixty per cent production in dementia risk and all smirch is ease risk compared to people that use it only one time a week ism people that use it two to three times a week have something a twenty little greater than twenty per cent roductioneris as a dose dependent effect ondimentur risk and all surmise is see risk i it also has a profound there is there is a big link between the carry of accusers system and the brain obviously blood flow a big one right you t you need to get blood to your brain i but carry of vascular mortality mortality from carry f vascular disease if people use our textural this was men if men use is on a for to seven times a week it is a fifty per cent production carry of ascus related mortality compared to one time a week again dos dependent manner two three times a week is something twenty four per cent lower the dim death from card of ascardisease there is also lower sudden cardiacdeths a hartittac that is sixty something greater than sixty per cent lower if if men use it four to seven times a week first is once again a dost pendent thing and the thing that is profound there also to me when again looking at the methods when i look at the data and this is all work from doctor yard lacanen hes in i the you university of eastern finland and just one of t e the the world experts on son youth especially with respect to carry of ask their health what a some of his data has also shown is that if you look at the duration the time spent in the son a lot of the the i mention the temperature i do is about i do one eighty nine degrees faranheiht typically i go in there ism party he adapted an am the more you do you the more you do the sand or any sort of heat stress whether a hot tubberde cause you you become adapted you are your basely tart to sweat at a lower corody temperature to cool yourself down all these wort of physiological changes star to happen earlier and and om i stay in for thirty minutes csch i say went e along to that is a lot yet to listen your body i most of the studies a that i just talked about were from the the duration the time spent in the sand when i said fifty percent production in cartyvaskdisease related death what was shown was that men that were in the son for only eleven minutes even if they used at for to seven times a week that production was only eight per cent said fifty it had to be greater then nineteen minutes like twenty minutes is the sweet spot at about one seventy four degrees fair in height and and and most most o the eonian finland by the way the their their humid to the they they put hot water a hot a ho they put water on hot rocks to crate steam and it is some usually between ten and twenty per cent humidity in the finish shank those those studies were i would say most of time your in a find that their humidity is also elevated but to me the the dost dependent nature of it and the duration knowing like to me that is a very strong data that this is more causal than some corelerything because that is always the problem with observational studies in clouding these which they corrected for a whole host of factors collected all exercise just everything the everything n the sun i mean they correct for those and on top of that you have the dost dependent nature of the duration the time spent in the son and the frequency to me it is some is going on here ouzo's there is been studies intervention studies worth comparing directly head to head moderate a intensiterobic exercise on stationary cycle to twenty minutes in a sand there there physiologically the same things happen heartriht elevates while you are doing the activity blood pressure increases while you are doing the activity but in after heart write decrease is resting heart rate decreases below base line blood pressure is improve it decreases below base line this is happening the same in modern intensity cycling versus sand again the sand this heat stress or something about it that really mimics this moderate intensity erotic exercise which is really great for people that cannot go for a run that cannot even get on a bite m to stable people granted there are some safety concern sir they are pretty mild u but they do exist you know people that had a recent heart attack or have some rare kind of heart disease or problem bringing uncle hug never do that elderly people lo ut prone to lowball blood pressure always talk to physician before do thionic is it is stressful pregnant women a ya i deal avoided son's when i was pregnant but ism a the the it is i think it is very relevant for disabled people and also people that are sedentary had been sedentarymos or life my mother i have been able to get her in the sand because she is not i mean i i did get on the fellation once but it is really much easier she feels its a saw treatment and and it is she can listen to her music in there and i care about her health but she is she is mostly been a sedentary person and i i find it much easier to convince her to get in the sand than to get on skeleton ideal you to both that the question would be well i exercise i run i do by high intensity neral training why do i been to get in tisane and and the reality is is and i published all this an an a review in the experimental geratology last yer i guess early late later and ism basically cardie respiratory fitness which is a marker of it is a marker of health cartyiouno cardiac respiratory fitness is improved in people that do exercise and sand compared to exercise alone organ alone for those be healthy fit peopled out there already exercising there is a synergistic e fact by also adding a ana into that routine and to me that is gray an i there is many beneficial things happening with the with the headdress in addition to mimicking robin exercise theirs the hatcheck protinesta we talked about earlier and this a kind of brings me back to my early days of science when i was at the sulk institute a for by pitiful studies doing research on little nematode worms that we or some one else injected amyloid bate a forty to the peptide the forty to an mean sad peptide that is involved in amazed plans found in the brain collate with alsirmersh is ease and other you know brain disorders i we injected those into the muscle tissue of worms and basically these worms become paralyze with age because he the the aggregate aggregated prolines i this these prolines aggregate i well hatcheck probings one of the main things they do is they basically make sure the prolines inside of yourselves maintain their properer three dimensional structure and are folded right and they do not they are not prone to aggregating and forming these place in your arteries and also in the brain and there is ism back to my my my worm studies i was doing i would i would elevate hatcheck ratings in this worms hand it would totally you know correct the problem where the the they would no longer become paralyze they would move around their young i many animal steadies have been done looking at all farmers disease i all all a human alsumires es in a radiant and he chalk prolines protecting from it am he chock probings are robustly activated inhuman an this has been show to a even o fifty percent higher over base line levels after just thirty minutes at one sixty three degrees farenhi neon ism and they stay activated at least in road ends for forty eight hours at least ism having these he chock prolines around making sure the they're properly tan care labor a preachings to their to aggregating in our brains and in a in our place could be another potential way that son's protecting from claimers disease and ism other party of vascular health as well as longevity ism there is there is people that have snips in he chock preaching factors seventy that if they have one of them they got one from their parentsfor they have more active he choke parting seventy they live on average one year longer than people that do not have that snip and if thy have two versions they got one from their mam and one from their at they live on average two years longer than people that do not have that snip that's also been associate with human activity as well as in lower organisms you can he chock a worm or fly and they live fifteen per cent longer this isn't work on by born li saw at the bucking to to years and years ago ism anyways they guess what i was getting at was i the recheck routines are are part of that street response pay y the we talked about earlier and they are also activated by cold as well cold chock does activate he chock prolines not as robust full for grin act at activates them again it is one of the reasons i think we should get all of these things because they are more robust in pots you another in pot activating mechanisms are more robust for you know different once there is cross talk there is you no i mean i guess i get i be more accurate to say there is om overlap but but it is also you one to get the most robust from all of em right i do i mean at that is why i when i do the son and exercise and eat myself my rocky proud in an i all thatsbut it is superinteresting a couple o couple of questions came up for me em one is a you mention these a snips these em yuclatat repeats busily comes that somephinople have more over less of a than others a that can predict longevity in some sense is that the fox three path w that is one thathan yet i mean fox three is ism in fact if you go back to the worm studies of his talking about that they one of the the first things when you see it with your own eyes you can take these worms that ism you basically decrease there insolent giggling pathway in their idea one worms have a what are called humoligus gene they have a lot of similarities to humans they have an insolent receptor they have an beef on receptor and they make something fox three which we have and ism basically if you if you decrease that insolent giggling path we their for fox o threes always active in those worms and they they live a hundred per cent longer and and not only do they live longer i mean they are like we a very young worm i me they are you look at this stang and your this looks the worm that was just born hours ago what is going on the tings that the end of its life i now as a as the side know the thing that always got me on this was am by the lathis was discovered by cintiacanyan and i this was back in the nineties and honestly it'd mot our that anything as been is exciting in the worm world since then but i thought i mean it was a really big finding i the only the only cabal there is that the worms go through this down it is called a down stage when when this happens when you decrease their insolence in long and stuff and they going this metal ecstasies a not eating is mantrmoming and and sos the locale they live a hundred per cent longer but they go into this weird state know i know people the sum in the longevity community i they know who they are but they will get the last laugh cause it'll be dead well fed but dead and they will well still be going ah in terms of the the many data on saunaed and i also just one acknowledge these finish groups that did this work is really pioneering i on you think twenty years ago on before call meet or any of this and there out there up there i should say measuring carters all and grow harm on and all the stuff an in people getting into have sauna very very interesting u twenty minutes seems the threshold at hundred n seven degrees fair height more times per week seems to be better than fewer when you when n terms of all cause mortality party of scuba risk according to what when i just learn for would be a a good i thing men mum effective ties four times a we and you combine it with the cold have also seen a photo call were is a very extreme protocol i do not recommend this to people right off about where they had subject human subjects get in the sand for thirty minutes get out for five thirty minutes get out for five threemetes for a total of two hours of exposure but that was what led to these massive sixteen fold increases in growth harmony i shut i i and they hade to do it very seldom it tells these protocols you are describing twenty minutes done a four times per week far more reasonable for most people to access but i i know people are probably desperate to know what if they do not have a san saunas kind of a unique to i have a couple questions can people use hot baths a with the appropriate warning of course that without getting into description of the the mechanics in the underline bold it is pretty obvious that the testes if they get too warm you will you will killsperm that is the reason why the messes are housed in a structure call the scrotum that can move around just to be we are biologist just talking about realities here if you are trying to conceive children where keep your sperm healthy i should pily stay out of warm ah that a for least six months that is been show six months setsperm prod that sperm motility goes down and perm production goes down but that is completely re corrected i if they stay out the sauna to for six months through six month lighter spectral great that is a very useful information ism sure to number of people out there i there if people do not have access to a sawn a an we get this about cold to you always say what about cold showers and i ways say what the studies ma have mainly been done on immersion because it is hard to keep things controlled in cold showers this does not make for very good experiments yo get a bigger person the less of them is under the shower and it does not make for a good experiment it is i it is not as god as immersion but with the with he i could imagine that a hot bath we work almost as well ya there spend some studies looking out for example activation if he checked routines also brain drive her perfect factory increases with seamstress ism and i the sat a the the hot bath that around hundred and forty sees far an hit which is to rely what studies will use for temperature which ism this echo cooler than what i crick my bath hot it is to ism you are very heat adapted ism very auto you and ism it is twenty minutes from the shoulderstown and not is a very robust activation i he checked prolines and in brain drive her trisect factor and then he chock ratings are also protecting against musclatrophy that is also having t do wit the proline structure in the muscle tissue was well tissue been studies an animal no animal data ism as well as om a recent human data as well it was local hiporthermi or local heat treatment but ism essentially a showed that i protected i mean it was there was a study where ism they precooking at muscle disuse and it was it was something the local heat treatment prevented almost forty per cent of the musclatrophy from dish of belike an it is funny that i used to use this on the i was injured and stuff i would go in the sauna i because i i i i did not know at the time use i was graduate stunt but i knew just from experiments that ism not losing as much muscle i feel better i at the time i that was reading all about the growth forming the stuff back then but ism and i knew about he chock routines an in i kind of new i but that date i was not around yet and ism now we have the data and have always felt i was not losing my muscle i should have been when i was doing the awn and i was doing it literally seven days a week it as harbor this also our in graduate school yet now now ism doing ism doing the sauna ism a bare barman am mi do three but i try to before because of the it it all depends on my schedule ism i also to do long runs i really it is long being three to not campaigns on ism but i i really for me and we were talking about this earlier off camera that the runs for me are are for my brain and that i get this mine wandering a fact where i day dreamwhen i think about things i work through problems i get created i come up with ideas and this is all happening on the runs and in i i just i i i i miss my runs if i do not do em an i miss it because of the brain of facts i get from it and when i exercise i it is funny because ism a female an you think that it'd be exercising i ts take within in shape cargo i care abut my figure about when i exercise literally what ism thinking about is my brain and ism this is the best long jacket lungjappany drop there is hat this is at right here on a you you are always wandering you areaways wanting to now you presenting to d us la if you do not exercise your missing that essential doubts i an to that for me is is is motivation the do not being seeking thing i ism looking for admittedly i need to i do not do enough strength raining and i have to do it have to have to have to i ism just and after the endurance in the head i an i i i really new to a that in i because mustlemass is also extremely important for aging is wile you knows to that is that is my that is my fault with the brain effects really interesting i also run i try and get one longer run per week and a few other runs and i do it without a phone it'd onlestin a pod case i occasionally will listen a music but i really try not to a i also find that my mind solves problems it i feel like up it we washes out the cob webs to speak some of the most am brilliant and prolific her a scientists i know who have had very long careers epic candela nowhere prize whether it colombia comes to mine for allies work on memory used to swim a mile a day and now i think swims half a mile a day but he is in his late nineties and hes still sharp oh is incredible and his lab has done some work showing that any load bearing exercise repeated its endurance work unlike the relation or cycling that is really load bearing all the your cycling really hard with the resistance but am causes the release of onto also from the bones which acts in and indican way sort of a hormone can i shall travel to the hippocampus and at least in these animal studies induce the proliferation of neurons growth of snaps is beat enough a number of downstream things which kind of make sense if you we were to put it just evolutionary story o on this a body that is active can signal to the brain that the body still needs cognition an inactive body in some ways is depriving the brain of any signal abut what the body is doing right this is obvious i making the sup is as as conjecture but we know in ocean and series ocean animals that they will swim around for some period of their life and then they will have a a completely stationary portion of their life and basically the brain degenerates there you do not been much of a nervous system if you are not moving i think there is really something there and also was letting your ideas in mind drift a i love that you and i appreciate you shared your protocols because i think right now were in an interesting time and public health in formation history where people are just bonding getting bombarded with cold as good heat is cold is it cold is good heat is good excuse me i mast spoke a there all these my crnutriance and of course mackernutrante r important to and to maybe really a enriched us with the description of the underlying mechanisms and the logic behind the but also sharing what you do is really informative because i think people need a jumping off place and says we they mean to start some place and getting heat adapt et camera takes time but i reallyappreciate that you are willing to share your protocols and that you do the things that you that you teach and educate people about as a final question because i have have have to ask red light son or no red light sand have been a little bit vocal about my feelings that none of the red light son's have ever been in got hot enough and it was frustrating got i feel it is neither here nor there however i do acknowledge that red light and leet the light therapies are now known to do a number of interesting things was a no about prize in nineteen o eight for phototherapy for lupus you n it is not a new thing the idea that it light and light could do things a posit to hour biology but do you have a red light in your sand do you think it is useful and i motionless because this is the number one question i get about sand red light or no red light or some some intermediate answer ism i do not have an info red sand ism but i do hat have a sand that has lights it makes red light but i do not think it is the red light that you are talking gets not activating it at a specific wave long which is it is usually the the range that seems to be helpful and i have i confess i use a red light panel for other things i is six hundred and seventy nanometer out to about seven hundred and twenty diameter it looks red and very dim pant ta lights dim red and bright red and the ideas that red light can travel the soon an energy is such that it can travel down through the a delayers of the dearness of the skin i i i do not have a red light in myna ism do not know if it is central or not i do not think basin a the did is have talked about i think that would be s is it that the the potential effect on my t contra is interesting i do think there is ism a lack of really good solid evidence in humans but i dob that not might only be because it is not studied enough and that is usually the case perhaps there is the u far the u they have those pant red light panels u van cosier the two ones i know close and you thither at as far as i know pro can insult both companies at the same time but it'd rather insult them both at the same time than than just compliment one in suit one a both of them seem excellent for getting the appropriate way of lands of red light and i do not have relationship either f out well i i personally think that the the sand in it itself it is about the heat stress and ism tibial the question i get is inferedsana or regular sand and ism there are some differences well info redshanks maybe the inferredsanas of the ones that have the red light that you are talking about inferredsanas only get up to around a hundred and forty degrees fair and height ism as i mention the studies where about one seventy fortress fair and hight and ism you really have to stay in a longer period of time however there have been some studies coming out of japan they they use in for redan they this whole protocol it is called way on therapy and the they they they get people and nferretzonas and they replevin a towel and they stay warm for ex mount that is you the whole proticalands that being an hour long but it again it is a hundred and forty to resparanizes wits an in for tana and it is been shown to improve a variety of corner heart disease in conditions heart related conditions they've been some improvements i obviously there is there is evidence that inferretzonas can be beneficial for cart yo task their health i do have used inferretzonaas many times at my might in laws they have a infereton and i have to crank that thing up for a while until it is based and the i have to sit in there for can hour at least i do sweat a lot an that is another thing i would no talk about you do sweat some have metals in some some me heavy metals are excreted predominantly through sweat others to yearn ism for example cadmium there is a hundred and twenty five fold increasing cadmium excretion from sweat when you get then also led is something seventeen full excretions higher another one is aluminum its about fourfold higherself inform red you do sweat a lot to and not because the dimandifference is that your heating your body up through thermal radiation verses the ambient hair air an a standard sand is a heater an the heat greeting up the air in that she you are heating yourself up ism at is a little bit of at a different mechanism i prefer regular sands most the date out there from from the heat stress itself the your heart rates elevating when you are in the you are feeling hot you regretting that cargo tat clear men hat such a feeling when you rein hot son an that for me takes a really long time in the inferretzon i get at the fairy end but i do think the are son benefits from informed and they are more portable their less of a fire hazard but again hop bats or i think a good alternative modality for heat stress a compared to a regular son great that is a really helpful answer i i said i used the red light but not in the san and a and thank you for reminding us of that a hundred seventy for degree fair inti threshold that mainly used in all these studies we covered a lot of of territory but i just want o thank you again it was extremely thorough and extremely informative it'd now have a my notes are i always look a little bit them they were drawn out by macaw monkey who has no knowledge of the english language but i can decide for this m to tell you that there are at least ten additions to my current protocols that ism go ad and it'll have lots of questions ad i apologize an advance for that but i behalf of the

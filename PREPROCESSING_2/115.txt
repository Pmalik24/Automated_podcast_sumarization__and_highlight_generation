commercial real estate prices tank as banks struggles to stay afloat jo baton cuts america drilling as out to arabia cuts the oil supply and avid whites seeks a gran very intipemen against hunter bison at last for a gun crime and bentunr of this is the bench verismo the shows ponder by express veins time to stands up against bigot protector data express u pans i coup freshen we keep hearing over and over that the economy is on soft footing that that install be fine we an to have a soft landing here the economy continues to be very strong because monomer san and all the rest of this here is only one problem every couple of days there is a story that comes out theyreminds us how fatal the economy actually is and the it would not take a lot to tip the economy over the edge here is the thing about economic crash is or or economic spirals everybody knows they are coming its just o question of wen if you are a trader in the stock market one of the hard things about being a trader in the stock market for example is knowing wen too short a stock when i say wen to short stock anomy that that the stock is get go down probably the stockskin go down the problems what is the time line you short it for a week for a month for a year how longed you short the stockpot if you are looking at the stock of the america economy as a whole it seems you want a short o but you do not hurt exactly wen because the fact is that the america economy is not in fact on softer or even solid footing it is it's in fact resting on a precipice and which do not know what sort of wind is going to blow that knocks it over the end to day's story comes courtesy of the wall street journal bank of k had two branches and rural ark install when chief executive gorge geese and brought it in nineteen seventy nine the little rock lender to day has billions of dollars in commercial real estate loans including for properties in many and manhattan where its helping fun the construction of one thousand foot tall office and luxury residential tower n fifth avenue wregural banks across the country followed o him lar playbook gorging on commercial real estate loans an relating investments in big cities over the past escape but the commercial real estate market now and melt down those trillions of dollars and loans and investments are looming that for the banking industry and potentially the broader economy banks exposure is even bigger than connomly reported the banks are in danger f setting off a doom loupsinareo it is always good stuff that that is hat you look foreigner morning papers the doom loupsinaria they are in danger of setting of a doom loopsinareo where loss is on the loans trigger banks to cut landing which leads you further drops an property prices and yet more losses and the problem of course is that you and up with a four closer spiral kind of lake you saw in two thousand seventy thousand right thous in the residential real state market because basically people could not pay back they're some prime loans but what happens when you are talking about large commercial entities that simply stop paying there they are loans when they are building a building whether doing at development son these things come on the market but nobody wants to buy them because we think they are going to get cheaper for example banks k is not pull back from lending but has started see some times of market trouble in canary a develop or defaults an on a roughly sixty million dollar loan from banks decay after construction costs escalated the banks that is another prom in elation has driven up the costs of construction wildly everybody's budget from canary no longer applies if you got some sort of speck budget from even somebody who is working on your home back in canary this his century happen t us and then you say what we want you to do the construction but it is now september will you give us that same pricethe'l tell theta for the price is significantly higher because of the prices of the materials and the prices of the labor the loan was con sided relatively safe because it was far below the building sites value of a hundred thirty nine million in twenty twenty one but in remember a new apparel put the properties value at a hundred million dollars the bank is not effectively stuck with the property to days trouble market feel by rising interestraces and high vacancies follows years of boom times thanks roughly doubled their lending to landlords from twenty fifteen to twenty twenty to to two point to trillion dollars also banks increased their exposure t commercial real estate and ways that are not usually counted in their tallies they lent to financial companies the make loans to see the same landlords the basically using it as a pass through they bought bonds back by the same types of properties in the same way that bad real estate loans ended up being sliced an faced a thousand different ways through credit instruments backing in two thousand seven two thousand eight yet what basically they took a munch of bad sup pramalons in they stack them up with good loans than they called it a level loans and they sold that thought the broader economy and that is why once the infections set in it infected every part the border economy the same thing has happened with commercial real estate because you have people are basically placing inviting these loans or their bang bonds that are back by the loans the indirect lending along with four close properties trading portfolios another assets link to commercial properties brings banks total exposure to commercial real estate two three points trillion dollars equivalent to twenty per cents of their deposits by by the we you can see this in real time again i know lot of people whore in the real estate investment industry and when it comes to commercial real estate that is not in industry that you want to be in right up but they are a lot of banks theatre aliens on commercial companies commercial real stay companies paying back they are loans meanwhile also according tote waste journal in elation and interest words continued to drag stocks downward stock slumped on lenesday after investors received a fresh sign the one economy could be raving up finding those in elation turns in flatirons not going away bees again it is not just the product of last years of spending it's the product of twenty years basically of incredibly loose spending by the federal reserve and by the treasury department of the united states quantitative easing became the order of the day back in two thousand seven two thousand a but easy money prevailed up in til two thousand seven two thousand eight if you go back and look at the mortgage rides in they're two thousand mortgages rates in the i two thousimor five six seven per cent but for most of the following two decades the mortgage rates were in the isothere four per cent range and that is because of easy money well the problem with easy money is that makes people make loose decisions raisin the in your own life the general economy runs kind of laker household in this way if you have a lot of money lying around you do not think that much about o cave fine i wasted little money on a dinner or i wasted little money on on a particular event when the great event but we have the money who cared the same thing is true when it comes to investors when investors have a lot of money in their pocket the get very breezy about giving that money away and then when the money tightens up suddenly they over compensate is a created out and way i do not want to spend that money ever ever ever again and that is when the economy search to grind to a screeching hall that is what you are seeing right now though the problem is that the amount of money that seen in fleeted into the currency means the people still have a lot of money in their pocket in s proud particularly try in consumer armets consumer markets tent reacts after business people business people the ones i know they're ready starting pullback they are ready starting to realize that the economy is is getting worse but the everyday consumer has seen a tun of money blown in their pocket over the course of last couple of decades which is why prices are really high and then they still have to spend on necessities that is not going any but the consumer pull back has yet to really take a fact because its non the interest of the federal government o many stake governments to allow the economy to go back to it is resting normal this is one of the huge probes of the easy money policies eating money policies make people the elect to good times arguing to go on forever anti actually exacerbates the called boombuss cycle if youshave a stable monetary supply well heueneeg at booms in enema bus but you are also going to get real grow when you have inflection field growth what you get as a lot of speculation and the speculation leads to the really dramatic down turns and he people usually and of getting hit are the people who are not these sophisticated players in the market s that is as happening in jo bison's economy hes now exacerbating that through foolish environmental policy will get to that momentarily first flamer pain has called the dollars drop in dominant's objective in your reversible brazil russia into a china south africa they formerly agreed to use a local currencies in trade instead of the stellar it is the first shoot to drop as the man fore the dollar start to weaken the buying power of the dollar is going to weaken as

think that one of the things you do not want is a inflation of of oil prices and yet that is exactly what jobidon is now pursuing it really mans there is a lot of focus that is being put on the fact that the sorties our cutting oil production until the end of twenty twenty three according to axis this is because the sorties are deeply in happywith the by and ministration and they wish to we the by administration golly they want see dona trump or some the re publican elected will be friendlier toward say rabid that would not be a shop sadyorabia has its own international interest and to be frank the biddy ministrations position on sadyarabia is utterly untenable and foolish which is why jobidon before he took office was ripping on the sorties in this human rights violations meanwhile he is making nice to the aroneans wo a way worst human ride violators than the sorties bite by leagues and score and then he ended up having to go on bended see before the midterm elections to the sorties and beg them to ais the oil production the sorties our saying no we are not real fond of you we see that you you kind of want to under cot what we are trying to do here to the sorties are are jacking up the oil prices you us ass prices according to axis are closely tether to global oil prices meanwhile presidential campaign season is heating up if sustain true price strength could way on presidentiobine's re election bid scoring to clear view energy partners the kingdom said tuesday morning it is keeping the cur reduction of a million barrels day in place for another three months subject to monthly review rush is also combining to do this there also cutting their international oil supply again in attempt to drive down people fighting them in the crane war tuesdays news halt push rent crew prices above it ninety dollars perbarel that is the highest since nonmember of two thousand and twenty two officials are holding the fire for now because it is sit far from the election the hoping may be the softy's back off it this but what is amazing about this is that there is a way for join to take advantage of this and you be thewy the dona trump took advantage of this when i turned out that oil prices were were petty high at the beginning of the trumpadministration dona true foist on increasing america domestic oil production which is why we had an oil surplus by the time that that dona trump left office job hes been precisely the opposite in the middle of a time when america are going going to be paying mar t pump join is beholden to his left wing bays which means that he is now working to pro habit drilling in the national petroleum reserve at the arctic natural will refuge no the amour has been a point of contention since i was in college tucking twenty five years that is been a point of contention the basic argument that made by air mental as yo cannot drill in this pristine natural habitat and the argument made by people who are drilling for oil is it is a pretty small foot print in a very very large area it is not actually killing the wild life in fact to turns out that the carabao kina likest being warm into the tend to hang out around the oil pie blinds in the mate ism but bottom line is this in the middle of an economic down turn or potentially economic down turn cutting off your own access to oil is an idiot move and this alwaysbee the problem with jobidon in reference to the oil industry at the same time he wants to claim the he is helping every day america to by the way don all own gestalts at the same time he saying that he is simultaneously taking every policy he can mansion in order cut off domestic oil supplies me he is set that he wants to cut off the ability to drill off shore in in large slaves of of america costal waters he is now saying he does not want be able to drill in the anear what exactly is the plan for oil in dependence for example most y real about the fossil fuel production is going to be crucial to the america economy for decades to come not are years to come for decades to come this bazar notion that even the electrical grid it is tolerable without carbon base fossil fuels or massive building of nuclear power plants is idiotic it an't can be done on windmills an electricity does not come from itself this there seems to be a theory when it comes to energy production on the left the basically the way you create energy is that famous mean of plugging a plug into itself the electricity comes from electricity no it does not the electricity that is in the power grid generally comes from fossil fuel production that is where it is coming from or fossil l use and yet jobidon is cutting off all of that and then simultaneously tellingyou that he standing for the little got let me stomping your people who are rich we can afford higher energy prices we can afford to keep our a a a c on sixty eight all a year but let me tell you en when we wort rich when i a when i was growing up we kept our a c a much higher temperature because the power bills actually matter to motor when you are talking a better regressive income tax in creasing the priceofenergy is a dramatically regressive income tax on people who are poor on people for middle class and it the bit administration is behold into its radical environmental bays and the do not care about the the average ordinary america what you have to pay at the pump who what left to payingyor indirect energy bills the new regulations would ensure what the administration called maximum protections from nearly half the patrolman reserve it would not stop the enormous eight buillingdollar willow oils rolling project in the same vicinity biding a prove that the rebuts putting more of the of the nor off limits he said

over the willow projects o he is trying to back fill that right now which just goes to show he is an eminently political animal but is politics are always about pleasing whatever is the constituency fresh in front of him it is why he is a union boy when when it comes to doing the unions bidding toobidaneis their man when it comes to the in mire mentalist he is their man he responds directly to to intensive pressure from the people he considers to be his most base supporters meanwhile by the way his heart court cost are continuing to rise according to axis while corks in how halting turns prices our measured exist and how medical provider set prices and they've led to a downturn an inflation a reason on that trend is now likely to reverse medical service as are six point four percents above all inflation but twenty seven percents of course service is ex housing excluding housing to health insurance is rising fairly dramatically agent a lot of that has to do wit the inflationary policies that a pursued by gabion the price medical services is up the price being treated has being brought has been rising slowly according to the consumer price index data a what is going what what went up i keep sang over nor it will come down and i am not paying intension on a personal level to the happy talk that suggest that we are all going to escape the the do move that we have created for ourselves economically yet easily or or quickly and just one second we will get to the other big problem facing job another than has incompetence in that of course is accusations of corruption or get

bison in the gun charge case now you remember the history here basically davidwise was appointed by the dog he was not given special council status that he could not independently going check into hunter bi in's various financial crimes which is the stuff we actually care about right the gun charge stuff is relations and goes to the fact that hunter biding of garbage bag of a human being who was simultaneously having a a an affair with his a brothers wife his his brother did n he was having a fair with his wife meanwhile who is a mass of drug abuser who is buying guns falsely and then passing them in in then his brothers wife postman trash can near a school an a the rests all that is very relations stuff that is not the real problem hunterbidon m bombing a drug at i derelict yah but the big proven hunter widen is that he was a bagman for his ad an every one knows this in clouding hunter bison who literally teat his own daughter that he pays half of dad's bills in a in a in a quote that apparently is utterly unstable to the manstremedia including people at the washington posts chili bum in any case what happened here is that as the investigation ins the gun charge began and as the investigation into hunter biding tax failures began because hunter bid failed t pays taxes for years on end while earning tens of millions of dollars for friends an family and himself well all that was happening nobody was checking into the deeper question as to where was this money going was influence being petalled i for example is hunter by popping charge with violation of the foreign agent's registration act he clearly was a foregnagien hots operating on behalf of a foreign of a foreign company that was clearly related to america to mystic concerns i in verism is it is hard to see a better case of a foreign agent than hunter biding acting as a go between between cranial company melisma and the america government and hots pretty obvious stuff you have to re sisters foranantion hadn't do that that can prosecutor for that the question became why was not a getting prosecutor for that the original theory was that avid nice even if he had wanted who could not because the do ja under jobidon did not give him special council statustactally pursue that and now is the case that was being made by virus whistle blowers very sharply who as sang a had dey would is told us he could not ask about jo every avenue into investigation regarding the hunter job connection was shut down by avid nice and by his team at the do jay and then they tried to bring in front of a judge a sweetheart deal for hunter bison just to recap the history here the sweetheart deal was that he would plead guilty on some tax charge as you get no jail time and on the gun charge he would be given a diversion instead of actual conviction on his record but buried in the gun charge was immunity for all further prosecution on things for an agent's registration act violations hat was buried the gun charge the judge look to the have never seen a deal remotely this why are you immunizing him from further prosecution or investigation on financial crimes in the gun charge you are doing this to hide the fact that you are doing this and then shed bleed up an open court and the delta denied that was go what was going on and hunter bins letters were that was exactly what was going on we do not have a deal after that the bite administration knew that what it had on hits hands was a pretty obvious scandal in which the delta had essentially massage this entire process s that hunter within would never be investigated for his involvement with his dad and that is when mericarling cam out n said o kan'tyou know what organ to make vivid west special councils they did it too late they give him special council stats now that also came just in time for avid nice do not testify from congress about all this because once who is given special council status then how can he be asked about failure to be given special council status again simply citizen there is an on going investigation i cannot comment and on going investigations or negotiations who is all very convenient it is all very obviously a cover up and now he come to the final part of what is the cover up you ovation and that is avid wise seeking charge is on the gun charges by the end of month according the scanned hunter baton had previously reach to deal involving a felony gun possession charge that would have allowed him to avoid prosecution if he went certain conditions over a twenty four month person according to the special council's office the speedy trial act requires the averment obtain the the return of an indictment by grander by fridge soptember twenty ninth twenty twenty three at the earliest prosecutors did not say how many charges would actually be brought again there is federal crime related to the gun stuff here but that is not really what this about the real question is is this deal now is this gun charge now going to include a plead deal than immunize him from further investigation or is avid i dis can say beware dun here and move on and there will not be any investigation ins the finances of job and hunter bison beget him more on this momentarily first my team is constantly talkingabout delicious all america met youknow why because amazing you bowfin they that even more when that america meet is free which is why we love goodranchers the force the vest meet in america they deliver it to your door even better right now they are offering two years of free ground beef to any one who subscribes that is a four hundred eighty dollar van you not only are yogi to get the best cuts from a trusted one hundred per cent america worst comparing you've also gin a lock in your price for two whole years when you subscribed to any of their boxes that is two years a free high quality ground beef and along an price n no other me company guarantees you a hundred per cent america meet and along an price that is his none else has good ranchers and given the inflation ran u general a lock in those price lick right now you'd save on your beef chicken and work by locking in your price to day every single stake course quality caught is individually wrapped and flash frozen to make a meal time easy they made they are one cocker godrancher stake for me i got t it was one loveable glue to good ranchers at do come today use code ben for twenty firebug off and free ground bee for two years remember subscribed to any box to lock in your price right now on america best meat for two hull years that is good rancher's dock company used my could ben rover five hundred buck an savings subscribe to good ranchers america meats to liver okas up what is this mean for the future of the hunter biding investigation apparently wisistil weighing whether to charge hunter biding with tax crimes he said in a quart finding last month that trial is now an order on the taxoffences and you might bring it tuitional tax charges in californium or washington d c but all of that is irrelevant to the brought question of f ou'recarging with tax crimes maybe you ought to investigate fully where the money was coming coming where the money was going li this is very very basic stuff here an if they do not pursue that it is pretty obvious why they are not pursuing that and simply saying the he charging with the gun crime in order to presumably cover for not investigating the thingthat everyone cares about it that sort of if they decided to prosecute allophone on the tax crime not because they wanted to put him in jail but to immunize him from further prosecution on you know murder that is it that is essentially all will get you slap on the rest on this little crime over here not because we actually want to get you on everything else hope one o that the allophone taxation charging is tat twas an easy charge that put human jail the rest of his lifeboat is how they want for hunter but they want for hunter it is some sort of slap on the was that basically blows him out of jail and if you do wit the grand jury proceeding or hunter biding get's probation from a judge or something andyou went up in the same place that you would have with the swede hartal n can e destroy thrust the investigation then i was pretty obvious the special council stuff was a ruse is what house re publicans have been saying it sent a letter two hunter bison's lawyer saying should you refuse to provide the committed with requested information because of any reported privilege the committed made need to see testimony from you and or hunter by n re guarding the disclosure of documents and communications they are looking for all sorts of documents related to the defunct pile agree men they will not know whats for sweet her deal went on behind close doors in fact names comer the republican who is the head of the house oversiecommtte of kentucky he he says that theyreare meals showing hunter's legal team telling job how to spin his corruption throughout this entire process wit jo by ally that o the pantry media i got log with is it well the wit why you gin why you bet t getting over bid he was not a part of the moment they at jo by to a firwhil but thing the govermentin a ti see that is not true and we tree with that the lack to we there e mails that wit backing fort we under legal ta wit telling jo by now the her about the corruption he got coin there was cops when copied about you can for policy and we believe the mediatory bout the bear titygo gap and then those are not being released creenshom pieberall's worst prassecrutaries yes yesterday the present in reunited states he took about transparency lot he could just release from the national arrives all of his v p documents involving his fake his fig names the sued hims who is using he could release all his females with hunter bid's wafer and all those communications why is not he doing that free on heres a low because because becks matter he narhwor e o ism just in a let i know the white home mi mi cam a the way o coup oh responded we i i en mi tam do i that that information i don a m for there she never has more to say on that am it is very obvious question why do not just release it you say there is nothing wrong folk then let let see it well a what is the problem exactly it is truly incredible how what is very obvious to everyone which is the jobidon has bee a corrupt politician literally since the day that he was elected to the united states senate that the thank were suppose to pretend as clean as the driven stone not only that it is perfectly legitimate for him to hide a bunch f females where he was using a sting him to coordinate with his son who corruptly picking up cash in for controls and we robs can pretend that that is totally normal but that is what we do when he come to the legacy media when it comes t the legacy media this is what they do they simply decide through selection by us what is to cover and what not'sto cover what is a story and what is not a story big hubbub on ax formerly non ace twitter last night because tucker carbon interviewed a man named marry sin care garrison care for those of you who have you now been on the intricate any time in the last fifteen or twenty years garrison care is a a man who allege is that at he had a cocaine field sex binge with brokobama back in brokobamas state house days in illinois now that is not incredible it is not brokobont in his own memoirs talks about how he the blow clearly the gotsfamiliar drugs brokobama wrote to a girl friend we now know that he regularly every day had fancies about having sex of men if that is not conjecture that is something the brokobama wrote in his own hand to a roll friend which by the was a weird thing to sad your groan any case it is not a incredible story the media at the time when after arris an care they pointed out that he had a history of criminality back in the nineteen eighties and the they just ignored the story now lemme point out that if barokobam had ben republican candidate for office this would have been from page story all the time there is no question his personwoulav ben on every he test there is no question this person would have bee on meet the press there is no question that this is person wouldhav been treated as a fully legitimate possible new source this is no question here was raisin claro admittedly is a wild died anon it turns out the people who engage in a cosine feel sex orgies a typically kind of while but here is here is arris in car talking about his accounts with barokobmama and ism wondering why is this what what makes him specifically incredible incredible that no one will cover him except for if he goes on tucker i got do off they last the next day was somewhat interesting because he ens up sharing up at my honor which i thought was somewhat weird but he wanted some wore when you think he showed up he he showed a man i had no waning i was e iron there is a nock on the door i open the door and he standing that and standing there was mare to any comes and and it was just a quick redo she re on from the night before exact in program exact tint programs he smoking again brokabon the smokes crack and then you performed the let sects on him gat here is the question the question is why precisely is lewis an car significantly less credible then say teaching carol real question why is it that every time somebody makes an accusation against a democrat of of behavior this suddenly the media go completely radio silent when n makes an allegation about jobidon that bourbon pushed her against a wall and thrust his fingers into her that is treated as absolutely non credible we will will pay little bit of attention just for end of the sake of saying that we did by what were not going do i take that superseriously but but if anybody accused tonal trump of a thing then obviously we have to take that superduperjuperseriously i that that that is very important here is the thing again there sin clares allegation which isn't he was in chico to particular time you should be able to check the records is to whether he was in chico at a particular time a journalist should beagle to ask raisin clearer there any distinguishing features about barokobama that would confirm your story one o the thingsthat parish car says in this interview with tucker marlin is that barokobona had told him at the time is ninety nine that he was having trouble in is marriage and when lewis in car originally said that there r lot of peoplelin no that is a we what how dare you they have a perfect what et came out in nickel upon his memoir that they were actually having some are significant marital troubles at that time the time line lines up with all this and again it is not a wild allegation to suggest the barokobama mauve engaged in homosexual behavior considering he literally wrote in a letter that he fantasized about doing it is not a wild ligation is suggest the brokabam may been doing coke in the late nineties considering that he literally protein his memoirsabout doing cot and this is not somebody who has maintained in his own hand that he is straight as the as as straight can be when it comes to his sexual proclivities and no drug use lignin against that me that what lady saint clary saying is absolute true i have no idea yourn't have an idea but again were asked to make these decisions all the time in the porter public opinion about who is quoticua credible and who is not credible remember we were told by the entire mainstremedia that christie lazy ford who accused just as bradchavina of having gang raped her back in their than age days she was brought before congress comely arris asked her questions she is on the cover of time magazine she became the leading face of me too and her allegations are significantly less credible than lathis and class her allegations had no confirming details they did not match withe behavior that we have known about from brad cannot in terms of his sexual life style they are no confirmatory sort of details none place time anyone else who can remember this vent like and and yet that was treated as as perfect evidence that breckcavinal should not sit on the bench and in fact if you confirmed him to sit on the supreme quart of the united states this meant the you were fine with going ahead with with with rape the fact that that again person claim has been round for a while these allegations were being traffics back in two thousand save two thousand eight as early as that and they're been widespread allegations about berockumoma sexual behavior back in hin chico days for a very very long time i do not know if their true i do not you do not knot their true but the point is that the media have a have a certain standard as to what is a credible allegation another standard always seems to be you are making it against republican that seems to be the standard if you are making an allegation against her publicanted his immediately deems credible which is presumably why werstill tike out egg carol emmer begin carrell is i has been held two to ha i she sued dona trump in federal court for defamation and she an ay judgment from him because he said that she is a crazy personal he did not rape her remember her allegation is that donate trump raped her an a manhunt department store room at the undressing mom at burg dwarf goodman in the middle of the day and she is and she she is written about it publicly saying that she did not considered a rape at the time and only later did she start to thing maybe it was bad la it is her i got as a her allegations i do not you by their wildly more credible than lathis an clares allegations why well now it turns out that a federal judge his rule the dona trump is bible a second time for to facing her this time over to sparigeon comment he made in twenty nineteen after she accused him of sexually assaulting her an the man can n department store yous district judge at louis caplin in new york said a coming trial would be limited to determining how much trump must pain damages to carrell who brought two losses against him in the spring they gave carol five million dollars an damages after finding trumpet bible for sexually abusing her and later to facing her and a social media posts in october of twenty twenty two the earlier jury by the way did not find that he committed rape but found more likely than that that he sexually abused her n addressing him of burgdorf good and based on nothing again she she she cannot describe details about the burgdorf she cannot describe it what what day it

continues to be absolutely feeble yesterday he did an event at which he am he explained that while job had covet he was sometimes wearing a mas sometimes that werestill doing mask theater here he was yesterday doing it o t press i e pec we tanto day ad clear cross e board i can keep con we be a e a to be ken days i one i yo keep we e don't cold my don't having on nit wanna again the mass theater is just ridiculous for shut no one cares old man i in at this point everybody in the crisis sad covert eighty three times the fact that werestill playing at this is ridiculous in the fact hes still feel the needs wo make excuse t everybody but masking not masking his even more oculus the truth is he is going to use the the bovid threat is now in excuse to just avoid events that is what actually happened yesterday there is a medal of honor ceremony and him and jobidon just left in the middle of the medal of honor ceremonies really weird n of is walking out emery's clapping and sharing frthemin join there the metal honor wieners are i where did not he go by the we there older he is an thou a i could hold it did we we do not know where join wends what was there excuse green jump her was asked about this and again being wildly on talensage says it was all part of the plan part of the planers for job iran just wander out of the room solid stuff here from mut cringshup here and he left a planned as it was planned he left wen day was a pause in the program in order to minimize to in amie his close contact with a tennis who ere where about to participate in a reception and he a reported that notice that he left won day was a pause in a program becausigat he wanted to in i i i certainly he is impact on folks who were there oh that is what it was he left when the middle ops o first of all he is standing afoot from a guy he is giving a metal of honor who is significantly older he is which does not he that is bovid pro to calla for ashalign in do this due crap again and then he is cut a had down the middle a does a very crowded from he is walking right through the crowded room indoors past all these people in i be safer from to stay up there far away from people but i know no that my my going theory remains the metamusul theory the met amuse conspiracy theory here is that ha date had to date had to hit the head i but no again this this continues to be a running theme in the biding campaign which that his too old to be president t everyone knows it is not eve that he is too old it is that he he does not have it he does not have at i know guys whore his age war really with it or on top of things were still running their business is with yo great acumen that is not jobidon jobidon is barely there which is why comely arris is now going to become a campaign issue so she was a she as asked yesterday about jobidon's age and she is acknowleus he is doing amazing he is doing a it which she has to say every picture of jobidon standing of comely arris standing behind jobidon seems on ai missing photo of stolen standing directly behind onion is onion climbs down some stairs win a she is waiting man she is just waiting here we go seventy seven per set of america setathy's too old i serve of second our itotways in one reason pole the bice present comely arris is now to sitting any uneasiness covers may had over age first of all i mi ta that our present has been an extraordinary war a subsanchlan on a time we spend together is an the over office where i the how his ability to understand issues and we through complex hes in away that no one else and to mexsmart an important decision not love the inflection of the en of everysends they have to go up at the end of every sentence no cause we issyou do not know or talking about ts very sound stuff there from from comely hairs i shows asked by a reporter from theassocied pressie she is ready to assume the president he which is a really dumb question i got a say not every question is done but summer is a very stupid question literally her entire jobs to stand there a a van until the point at which the president is that is the job of the vice president the vice president stands there in every administration as the break glassing case emergency in some cases that is more likely in some cases that is less likely but in this particular case comely arris is standing there the wicked which of the west with the with the hour glass and shut waiting for that time to wroth the sun that is happening and this administration by the way she has a rather large stake in that because if it turns out that god forbid something happens to the president of the united states and it happens too far from the election well then she isgittoget a challenger and she does not want that it sit is a bedding game not to be dark about this but there is a lot of is a america politics let just be real about thus when we look at the supreme court constituency its to ghoulish death watch that is what it is ready if you are a member of the opposing party ran out your democrat here's waiting until the re publican die the republican appoint he dies on the quart tit is that it is how this works it is it is you not insane but that's help works this happens to be true for command arris who is filled upward into every job she is of her held but here she was explaining she is absolutely ready to assume the presidency where shell alight from an electric school buss writing a unicorn question or the present ago often go hand and have questions about hi resteppin a all a necessary your peel prepare for that possibility ah it's her rest pes present prepared you for for that show yes a how you you describe that that process bit mar ye be red of present of a a let us the that answering your hypothetical a but do its con o be fine the that is not in ta combo resent but let us shouts to understand oat any i re ha thin every pice present understands that when they take the that they must be very clear about the responsibility they may have to take over the top to being president i no different i do not believe you i do not believe you and that that is the ism going problem for the bye administration again they are and beg shall skull party said before is that there is a theory in tort law call the egg shell skull theory it is to really a theory that the basic idea is that in tort launch all about damages a heat with my car who pays an and all that eggshell skull theories that there are certain people who have an eggshell skull and to unforeseen damages occur if you hit them that is the democratic party writ now jobidin's the eggshell skull and if that that beg shell cracks they have a roiling mass on their hands and they know it and that is all because they decided to select shim to the call arris as their number to meanwhile in terms of sort of how will see craziness of the day military leaders i have she the weaponisation of the military and behalf of the left is totally insane to me it is totally crazy the fact that the upper fashions of military have decided they are going to echo every nostrum of the left is the dumbest thing in the world you don't talk about things they're driving away recruits how about the real orientation of the military away from break things kill people win wars told find your individual self expression here in the military that is that such a weird move it is weird and the democrats are clearly using the military for these purposes which is presumably why they are insistent they are all fired insistent that the military is going to pay the bills of people who wish to leave in anti abortion state to go to a pro abortion state to have theirabortions a t the that is the that is the current policy statement of the united states militaries what democrats want to do there is a stand off right now between mommy tubberville who senator from albata he opposes the pens guns buran policy of reimbursing service members in their families who have to travel to receive abortion in the senate one senator can hold up nominations or a legislation according to we an end tuberville stands has left three military services to operate without a senate control leader sent at con firm leader for the first time in history now here is the thing if they want these leaders confirmed all democrats have to dos being them up one by one that is all they have to do right that if they bring in one by ones who give us an upright downer on this hominy tubervilte is not holding up the nominee he is holding up the unanimous consent yourn't have to have unanimous consent democrats control the senate plus have the republicans ore get vote for these people but tenant democrats keep saying the it will take up valuable for time which they li what valuable float what e gates doing for a livingyet of five week recess in august the what are you talking about it is obviously then trying to turn abortion into a political issue view the military an the military will pay for you to go get your abortion in californium if you are if you are in taxes and tubbervilles no ism putting a blank get hold on unanimous ism not doing your unanimous consent crapinsly trip that taxpayers should not be paying for america abortions that is state's not at something you on pay for yourself that is your problem there is no reason why tartars should be paying for your time off while you go get n abortion and the democrats alike well then we will just not have leaders for u military and then they blame tubberville for it and they militarize the military leadership to do the same thing the acting secretary of the navy carlostall to is now accusing republicans of eating and a bedding our enemies by not simply blanket confirming a bunch of people wile allowing the military to pay for abortions i take sir corgi on in con country have nevertact in chantry one round senators we'll actually be waiting in a bedding combines and o their autocratic regimes around the world this is having a real negative impact and will continue to have real negative impact on our combat redness that is what the america people truly need to understand and and senator tubberville re least the statement that dentin part this is two weeks ago i will continue this process of oversight and i will announce my opposition to specific notmanese ween this is this is absurd is absurd amid using the secretary of the navy is a stand in for abortion and then again you wonder why people goat fact a list proportionate umber of recruits in the military come from the south fact it dust proportionate members number of members the military are conservative fact it dust proportionate number of members the military are children of military numbers or relatives of military members you want to go directly at those people by turning the the military into the leading point of the sure one it comes to abortion police absolute nuttiness but again its social policy user alive for this s ad ministration they do not care about military readiness and then trying to clam republicans car care about milter redness when they can simply just bring these people up individually for a vote is totally insane it is totally totally crazy it is in in by the way terrible fore the country skin time for a thing that i as convicting a murder which is candid owns is new series about the seven every case that is going to be available to to the first t episode will be coming out tomorrow for every one and then you will have to to dailywhere plus of subscribed for the rest but if you subscribe it now for a daily wore play then you'll also be able to accuse the first three episodes right now before any one else today well we did not interview with candid bit earlier this week ism convicting murderiturs wot sounded joining us on line is the personwho needs no introduction the a course is canvas owns til give fer an introduction animations in your times best selling author the founder of bluest and the host of candistons over on daily where pluton nosh's of fascinating new dockyou series that is out it is called convicting a murderer and it takes on the nonsense that was presented by natflices making a murderer which was basically suggestion that a person convicted of murder originally did notcommit the murder actually he was innocent they left out a lot of evidence and candid on covers all of the canvas thanks re drying chow congratulations on the series thank you it is gone bi think our first doc you series the daily wire which is pretty exciting right ten apisesan the for summing done that that is right in it looks fan tactic why do not you talk about first of all what led you to want to you hone in on this story get a lot stories tot come across your dusk but this is the one that really drove you enough to one to make a full on took series about it i ganof i think i i demonstrated just in general interest and media per caption and i think it is fascinating its a study in human psychology and we can operate were above it but we have all been subjected to brain wash in the future were all going to to pain become big to miss by media propaganda and brain wash in the future none of us again are above it and i you go from greatest lie of her sole focussing on ma gorge food story which really was a psychological phenomenon everyone genuinely believed this man was innocent it was killed with the has of police and it is it is really an not exact same vain except with gorge flood you had black lives mater which seven very you sort of of white lives matter where there was just really this any police sandmen which i think the media was seizing upon and napflic just right place right time racing sized a story that was in fact interesting you had a man seen very who was put in prison wrongfully convicted the first time put into prison for eighteen years for a crime he did not commit a which was a the rape and attempted murder of another woman who wrongly pointed him out in a line up and i think people wanted to believe that will ma me the the just listen got at wrong twice and tat when he was walking free and got con got accuse of another murder they needed to believe that this is just completely wrong miss mantis in o send even in the face of overwhelming evidence and than you had two documentary makers to a liberal women lesbians from new york who went down there in to sited this is it for get to bring this to napless to superinterestin no story and what we are going to do is omit details very necessary details whom similar to gorge flood had three times level of fictional in a sister that could a possibly killed a horse may be removing but let us not talk about that because we are insisting on a different narrative very similar aspects and that is definitely what drew me to this particular story a ton of people watch to make a murder was can om a phenomenon when it first came out but for those who who did not watch it can given sort of bare bones outline of what exactly happened that led to the the original conviction of stepped ivory you mention he had one casino an who is released after that casein the what actually happened in the terms callback murder it instantly became o cult of making a murderer of the the first episode kind of opens up and you see this guy and he seems loving he seems family oriented he is being released from prison i mean all of us are drawn to a story of a wrongful conviction that concept of being put away in prison ting the you did not do it is your instantly going all my aches is fascinating and then at the end of the episode after they make you think this is is loving family man and he is also incredibly forgiving he is wrong place wrong time the reason why he got wrongfully convicted was because the woman genuinely and she was totally beat up about it genuinely thought that she recognized this person that had rape tern left her for dead and this was before we had than a evidence right and they they set this up perfectly and that the end they drop a bob on you y the first episode n they let a actually he is been arrested again and he is being accused of another murder a don't undone and this is kind of what drew everybody and that is the initial stepped aery story and then they went through an unpacked and very heavily suggested in my opinion a that stepped very was innocent and then of course you had than the chorus of celebrities for whatever reason alit balding is always right in the thick of it epic this is an unjust is this is completely wrong this man just cannot stay out of it you had celebrities that were tweeting about the series it when absolutely viral and again it was just sort of this cultural women where people we are developing this ante police sentiment in your series convicting a murder which again is fast i can ask you to give way all the details o in a wat there is a wat in there that the people just t do not know that was directly overlooked or or actually doctor by the original making a murder documentarian can give us just a taste of sort of the the suffix other was not presented to the public in making a murder or was actively change i meou make him accusations in convicting a murder that that are not accusations been there just realities the the for example see facts word deliberately omitted cut around that sort of thin i think one of the things that they were really really and to these to documentary makers was deceptive editing i think would be the right term which is to say that even if they are showing you port parts of the sort testimony you are thinking that your watching a person were spend there is a women whether there is there sitting in the sort room and the police opstigetes asked to question and they show you that he gets sort of time it looks his lying rights you have always come tors what's you so see is reaction was asked that question well reality that was not even that his response o that particular question they just see you whose him sitting up at a different moment and put it next to a question that he was ask at a different time is a sort of these deceptive editing tricks to heavily suggest that people were either innocent or people were guilty and a i think probably what people are most interested and back at home and still to this day is people who say i do think see navy was guilty but i believe that his nephew was somewhat manipulated i think that will probably be the most fascinating element for people that are willing to have the humility to explore how perhaps they were dupes i said we we have all been therefore if you found me ten years ago i was a left leaning a a o young woman who thought that abortion was aright we we change and if you are willing to go through that you will learn that even with bredandacy people we are led to believe that he was innocent eligibly that he was stupidleto bell that he was manipulated and i believe that he was manipulated but it was not from the people that are heavily suggested by making a murderer he was not manipulated a by anybody for in my opinion other than the documentary makers and his own uncle and is what you for see as the reaction to your knew series do you do you think that no any response from the very family from the original documentarian what you foresee er well we have a aery's family in the document a a that really incredible to actually here from his brother to be able to ask them those pointed questions do you actually think he was guilty which is interesting because the public perception is that the entire avoryclan is behind him the entire are clan loves him and i think that we will expose those elements as being false but i can tell you what the only reception has been people just knowing that we are doing this in seeing the trailer have had many s that ere angry i say cant is just say out of this when i love you much but you do not know all the facts we have been researching for years were on redan thread and i love that i loved the opportunity to change people's minds and i think that afterward again if you are a person that is willing to exercise that humility or just can a go wow it is incredible and you will probably not doubt yourself but you you'll grow from the experience none of us always get it right certainly not me well that is candy to oven's go check out her brand new doc you serious convicting a murder available only at daily wireplusko checked outright now it is really a fantastic piece for cans congratulations again a you thank you much bet already go check out convicting a murder over at daily fireplug it is a really good piece of work o ka time for a a quick thing that i hate things that i hate it there is a tendency and i think it is really bad on the part of both parties to suggest it this next selection is the only election that is ever manner in the country is over if we don't one i do not to bandits i think t is deary very bad of the country thing's bad for an my viable democracy if you truly believe that the next election is the last election that justifies pretty much anything it is it is it is it is a disaster in waiting because what is the alternative when you say this the last election what you really mean is o ka organic grab weapons and go at each other i only america are prepared do that souled they be prepared to do that because as much as i made dis agree with my fellow america from new york and californium as much as i do not wish their principles to govern me and i wish they would leave me alone i have not given up hope that number one the lose future elections if they push to hard because the vast bulk the america population is not radical left n and number two i nobody wants you have a shooting war with their fellow america everybody seems weigh to casual about this kennitalk of both the right and he left on the left if people jonathan liar who keep saying this the most important election of our lifetime it the truth is it is not it is not i mean technically speaking every electionthats happening right now is the most i portent election f your lifetime was it has not been decided yet but let us be real elect in eighteen fifty six the election of names you can and was the most important election of your lifetime in eighteen fifty two the election of franklin peers was he most important election of your lifetime but in the grand scheme of america history to that and of being the most important election of anybody's lifetime the answers now is the eighteen sixty election that was the most important election of everybody's lifetime andyou can only see that in historical retrospect but youwhat when left says this again what they mean is if this is the most important election of your lifetime because it is a battle between democracy and fascism this justifies any level of cheating and that of course drives republicans say well you got have the motive to cheat why would assumeyou are not going to cheats here is jonathan admire doing thisretine yesterday were got a question an metal abortions we have got to challenge ourselves and were got a fight back with the trust because more than at election is on the line and twenty twenty four o ceric and de mom reset is in the line and we have got a get it right mother's no castionof of that i man we hear every four years this is the most important election of our lifetime this thought actually is i think by most by most measures when they say democracy itself on the ball what is the alternative that mean the if don trampling what nations i his arrived you have to start the french resistance what is that care you talking about right here as not just on the left you will sure it on the right don't make hushaby he saying the same thing if the democrat wind the country is basically finished again i do not believe that is the case because have i believe that the institutions of the united states as as weak as they have been intros o public opinion our lot stronger than people give them credit for i think that the people of the united states are a lot better the me i think the least of the united states sock i think they are terrible but i think t at h generalized america public is not nearly is terrible as our least ten to think that they are here's my cuckaby who is a i in a sort of giving the righting version of the argue just heard from joscarborough and a jonathan air do how political opponents to those in power or out with an third world dictator ships the not a public in communist regimes well it is simple the people in power use their police agencies to arrest there opponents for made up crimes in an attempt to discredit them bankrupt them imprison them exile then are all of the above and if you're not paying attention you may not realize that jobigon is using exactly those tactics to make sure the dona true is not his opponent in twenty twenty four here is a problem if these tactics and the working to keep trump from winning or even running in twenty twenty four it is going to be the last america election that will be decided by ballets rather than bullets o we i mean is that last line i agree the lot of what you saturate there is just the last line that you start to say guys during you because this is a self fix in profit on both sides if both sides basically decide that this is the last election than it is the last election and i do not think it where theamerican people are t something that is worth america people should be i think it is why we have a federal i structure or states and localities actually matter is not being sanguine about america politics i think the stuff that we talk about everyday the shot is deeply deeply important but it i think is just as important that we recognize that the best way out of this position is not to declare that the next selection is the last one and that if we fail than its times to grab a tank and that that sort of stuff leads to some pretty bad behavior and sent in any self filling prophecy where people really feel they have no alternative but to do the bad thing that exasperates the rob in the first place already guise the rest of the so continues right now you are not con one of us it we den my father taken

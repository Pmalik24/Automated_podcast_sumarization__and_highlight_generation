welcome to the superman japonicas t a science science pace to for i manner supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire an effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public along those lines i want to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigrens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient incitement d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparations all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase they're all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element the dotcam slash supermen oke let us get started today is episode through the podcast and it is office hours office hours as many of where students come to the office of the professor sit down and ask questions requesting clarification about things that were confusing or to simply go down the rout of exploring a topic with more depth tan detail i asked for your questions to be listed in the comment section of the previous two episodes of the podcast on you two as well as on instrogram and i first of all just want to thank you for the many questions they are excellent we read them all we distilled from that large bach of questions to two types of questions questions that were asked very often and we are very often with there thus up tab as well as questions that we thought could really expand on the topics that were covered previously and to day were we are going to cover both of those if we did not get your question please a do not despair we will keep track of those and we have several more episodes devoted to this topic of sleep and wakefulness and learning during the month of canary maybe even a you no leaking overlobit into the month of february we have time that is one of the unique formats of this podcast is that we have time for dialogue we have time for your questions and we have time to really go deep into these topics it is official costello sleeping in the background if you hear snoring costello is going be keeping time a with is a deep and melodic snoring there goes the questions that we received i batched crudely into a couple different categories light exercise supplementation temperature learning plasticity and move and sort of mood related disorders the exotic questions about those before we begin any of this i want to point out something that i i always say it sounds boiler plate but it is important notes to protect me but to protect you which is that i am not a physician ism not a medical doctor i do not proscribe anything including behavior o protocols ism a professor i profess a lot of things based on quality pure reviewed studies you should take that information you should filter it through whatever it is that you currently happen to be dealing with whether not that is health or illness you should consult with a licenhelf care of professional before you add or remove anything from your daily life protocol ism not responsible for your health you are be smart with this information and be a stringent filter as we say of very well let us get started on the actual material somebody asked what is the roll of moonlight and fire am presuming they mean fireplace or candle or things of that sort in setting circadian rhythms is it o k to i you moonlight at night or will that wake me up will a fire in my fireplace or using candle light be too much light great question also offers me the opportunity to share with you what i think as a quite beautiful definition of what light is in a quantitative sense have mention a few times the use of of as and light meters and things to measure things lucks which sometimes are also described in terms of tendellas those of the two units for measuring light intensity typically lucks ell you acts is it is the unit and before we go forward and discuss this many lucks or that many lucks i wanted just tell you what a lucks is because it relates to this question one lucks equals the illumination of one square meter surface at one meter away from a single candle but that i somebody actually decided at some point that the amount of illumination at one square meter surface one meter away from a single candle that equals one lucks when we talk about six thousand lucks of light intensity or ten thousand lucks of light intensity now you have a kind of reference are a frame work that would be the equivalent of you could think of it as six thous in candles all with their light intensity shown on one square meter from one meters distance away or of course if it was a different number of lucks it would b a different number of candles you get the idea here is the great thing turns out that moonlight candle light and even a fireplace if youhav one of these roaring fires going in the fireplace do not reset your circadian clock at night in trick your brain into thinking that its morning even though if you have ever sat close to a fireplace or even a candle that light seems very bright and there two reasons for that that are very important the first one is that these neurons in your eye that a discuss in the previous episode these melons an ganglia cells also called intrinsically photosensitive ganglia cells those cells adjust their sensitivity across the day and those cells respond best to the blue yellow contrast present in the rising and setting sun call losel or angle sun also discussed in the previous episode but those cells adjust their sensitivity such that they will not activate the the triggers in the brain that convey daytime signals when they view moonlight even a full moon are really bright moon or fire now this does raise an interesting kind of thought point which is tat lot of people talk t about lunacy in the fact that when there is a full moon out people act differently and behave differently ah there is a lot of lore around that there is actually a little bit of quality science around that that may we can address in the future but moonlight is typically not going to wake us up too much except maybe if the moon is is really full and really bright there is possibility for that providing y n nocking to burn down the structure you rein and i can burn down the forest enjoyer your fireplaces enjoyer a your lights from candles and those are perfectly safe without disrupting your circadian rhythm because we talked about just how crucial it is to avoid bright lights between the hours of about ten him and for i except when you need to view things for sake of safety wore a or work or and forth ill received a lot of questions about red light w i think i was asked those questions because red light is used in a number different commercial products where these products tan to include a sheet a very bright red lights that one is supposed to view early in the day and there are various claims attached to these red light devices that they improve my to conceal functioning that they improve metabolism there is a man to be really honest a and i cant name brains and i a not in the name particular studies cause what ism about to say about these studies am not particularly am unkind but let us just say that none of the studies that have seen except for one that it'll talk about a moment pointing to the passive effects of red light on the visual system are published in blue ribbon journals they tend to be publish in journals that a do work hard to find am ism not sure with the pure review in stringency level is now that is not to say red light is in beneficial because there is one study in particular that came from glen jeffrey's lab at the universe college onion it was published last year glen is somebody i happen to know the excellent reputation excellent vision scientists what the study essentially showed and again this is a study that i i very much the data and think it was done very high standards what the study shows is that viewing red light for a few minutes each morning and have abusive effects on mite conduit in a particular retinal cell type that tends to degenerate or declining function with age in humans and that teletype is the photo receptor the photo receptor is a type of cell in your eye that sits at the back of the eyes and of some distance away from the gangling cells and it is the the sell that converts light information into electrical signals that the rest of the retina and brain can understand these are vitally important cells without them people are blind and many people's vision gets worse with age in particular agree macula degeneration but also related to some other factors including photos receptor a functionality just gain worse with time and what glen showed was that red light flashes delivered in particular early in the day but not late in the day can help repair the mitochondria now this study needs more a support from additional studies of course a they are doing a clinical trial they did report on what i i think it was twelve patients am and the work is on going but that was very interesting a and it points to some potentially really useful things ago ut red light however most of the questions i got about red light for sake of office hours were about the use of red light later in the day here is the deal principle red light we will not stimulate the melanous in retinal neurons that wake up the brain and circadian clock and signal daytime however most of the red lights in particular the red lights that come on these sheets of these products that people are supposed to view them a in order to a less a number of a proclaimed health effects those are way to bright and would definitely wake up your body and brain if you are going to use those products and ism not suggesting you do or you do not but if if that is your thing youwould will not use those early in the day who knows you might even derive some benefit on mitachondreo function in these photoreceptor but if you were thinking about red light forsake of avoiding the negative effects of light later in the day and at night then you want that red light to be very very dim certainly much dimmer than is on most of those commercial products now do you need red lights no although red lights are rather convenient because you can see pretty well with them on but if they're dim they will not wake up the circadian clock they will not have this doomed disrupting thing that we talked about in the previous podcast there is a roll for red light potentially early in the day and for mytocondrual repair in the photoreceptor there is a roll for dim red light later in the day and at night sere starting to notice a theme here which is that there is no immediate prescription of look at these lights it is look at these lights potentially if that is what you want to do at particular times of day n wat particular intensities and brings us back to the blue light issue which is many people are obsessed with avoiding blue light be as show want ton of blue light early in the day and throughout the day do not wear your blue blockers then or maybe ham do not wear them at all and at night it does not matter off blue blockers on if the lights are bright enough then you are still can be activating these cells and mechanisms i just want ta add something since about the science behind the blue blocker om confusion these melanous in retinal cells do react to blue light that is the best stimulus for one of these melanous and cells which led to the belief that blue lockers would be a good thing for preventing resetting of the circadian clock at night and dilitarious effects of screens et camera however the people that made these products fail to actually read the papers start to finish or if they did they did not comprehend a critical element which is that most of those papers early on took those neurons out and put them in a dish and when they did that they divorced those neurons from their natural connections in the eye turns out in your eye and my eye right now as that is what we care about these cells exist and these cells respond to blue light but also to other wave lengths of light because they not only respond directly to light as they do in a dish they also respond to in put from photoreceptor if you talk to any one in the circadian biology feel they will tell you ya is blight thing is really got an at a control because people assume that blue light is the cooperate because blue light is the best stimulus that does not mean that blue light is the only stimulus that will trigger these cells of many things a scientific paper can be accurate without being exhaustive in a lot of claims about products can be accurate but not exhaustive blue light during the day is great get that screen light get that sunlight especially get overhead lights i talk about all is in the previous podcast but at night you really want avoid those bright lights and it does not matter if its blue light or something else and some there was a real confusion about the the papers and and the data am when most of those product recommendations were made o k while we are on that topic let us talk about light in other orifices of the body i made a kind of a joke abut this the last pod gas episode but a couple real groat to me and said well have seen some claims that light delivered to the ears into the ears of the roof of the mouth or up the nose can be beneficial for car get setting circadian rhythms a ye no a not directly anyway and this is a great opportunity for us to distinguish between what is commonly called the placebo effect but a more important way to think about any manipulation behavior or otherwise that you might do is the difference between modulation and mediation there are lot of things that will modulate your biology putting a couple lights up your nose please do not do this might modulate your biology by way of the stress hormone that is released when you stuff those things up your nose member earlier a previous podcast i said that virtually anything will face shifts your circadian rhythm if it is different and dramatic enough it the question is is it the light delivered up the nose or through the ears or some other orifice that mediating the process is it actually tapping into the natural biology of the system that your trying to manipulate and this is where i light to distinguish between real biology and hacks i do not the word hack or frankly narrow hacking or big hacking i just do not the term because a hack is is using something for it purpose for which it was not intended right but where you can kind of it is a kind of a cheat and that is not how biology works well i try and distinguish between things that really mediate biological processes in things that modulate them there are a number of of commercial products out there with some studies attached to them claiming that light delivered to the ears or wherever can am a just your wakefulness are adjust your sleep have looked at those papers again a yon pagan lonesome friends by saying this but may be it'll gain a few as well a not blue ribbon journals frankly a often times read the small print there was a conflict of interest claws there related to commercial interest if somebody disagrees with me outright on this and consent to me a pure reviewed paper publish in a quality journal about light delivered anywhere but the eyes of humans that can mediate circadian rhythms wakefulness et camera ism more than happy to take a look at that and change my words and stands on this and do it publicly of course but until then ism guessing that the proper controls were not done of adjusting for heat that could be delivered which can defiling shift circadian rhythms were in talk about temperature and other things that light to the eyes folks is where these light effects work in humans in other animals they have dextrocular photoreceptor inhuman know and just be mindful i mean ism not training courage people to avoid certain products in particular but just be mindful of this difference between modulation and meet and mediation and my a mediating a process through a hard wired or long standing by logical mechanism is really where you unable the powerful effects over time i also as you have probably noticed i really tend to favor behavioral tools and zero cost tools first in getting those dialed in before you start plugging and plugging in and swallowing in putting things in various places just to really figure out how your by logo works and explore that unless there is of course a clinical mead to to take a i prescribe dragon which case by all means listen to your doctor oke a huge number of people asked me about what about light through windows and i ashed in insgrampost about this look setting your circadian clock with sunlight coming through a window is going take fifty to a hundred times longer if you want the date on that ism i be happy to send you to the various papers that were described in the previous podcast that came sizar from stamford and i have discussed also elsewhere but here is really the key thing with this do the experiment you can download the free a light meter you can have a bright day outside or some sunlight hold up that a take a picture it will tell you how many lucks now it lucks are it will all you how many lucks are in that environment now close the window and if you want close the screen or do not open the street you can do all sorts of experiments you will see that it will at least half the amount of lucks and it does not scale linearly meaning let say i get a ten thousand lucks outside five thousand looking out through an open window and then i close the window and its twenty five hundred lucks it does not mean that you just need to view that sunlight for twice is long if it is half as many lucks oke is not twenty five a hundred lucks means you need to look for ten minutes and m five thousand lucks means you look for five minutes it does not scale that way just because the biology does not work that way best thing to do is to get outside if you can if you cannot next best thing to do is to keep that window open it is perfectly fine to where prescription lenses and contacts why is it octet where prescription lenses and contacts when those are glass also but looking through a window diminishes the effect well we should think about this the lenses that you wear in front of your eyes by prescription or on your e s are designed to focus the light on to your curl retina in fact that is what near sightedness as is as when the image because your lends does not work quite right the image falls in front of the curl retina wearing a particular lends in front of that focus as the lends on to your retina on to these very our on they can communicate that to the brain it is costellos loving in this li is deep in sleep and if we that we could play some tones and he will remember it later based on the studies organ a talk about nail bit i do not know how we would know if you remembered it or not but prescription lenses a fine in fact there great for this reason there actually focussing the light on to the retina think about this logically and all the sun it makes perfect sense your glass window or your wind shield or the side window of your car it is not a it is not optically a perfect to bring the image and the light on to your retina in fact what it is doings its scattering and filtering light in particular the way lines of light that you want if you live in a low light environment a lots of questions about this we talk about this the previous podcast but just get outside for longer or and or use really bright lights inside case let us think about we ism making some of these recommendations because i think it can really impower you with the ability to change your behavior in terms of light viewing and other things depending on time of year depending on other life style factors important point understand is that early in the day your central circadian clocks and all these mechanisms are looking for a lot of light i men they do not have a mind to their own but it needs a lot of light to trigger this daytime signal alertness et camera and early in the day but not in the middle of the day you can sum or add futons there is this brief period of time early in the day when the sun is low in the sky when your brain and body are expecting a morning wake up signal where let us say it is not that bright outside some one sent me a picture or lo move of their walk in inland and it was pretty overcast and they were using light meter and they said it is only about seven hundred lucks or maybe even less and i said well stay outside longer but when you get inside turn on the lights really bright and overhead lights in particular because those we be best for stimulating these mechanisms and that is because at least for the first few hours of the day you concontinue to sum or add potion activation of these cells in the eye and the brain in the middle of the day once the sun is overhead or even if you stay inside all all morning and then you are in the circadian redone which sounds terrible and it is terrible because you does not matter if you get a ton of artificial light or even sunlight you are not can a shift your circadian clock you are not on get that wake up signal and then in the evening you want to think about this whole system as being vulnerable to even a few futons of l right because you are sensitivity to light really goes up at night and i talk the last time about how you can protect against that sensitivity by looking at the setting sun and watching the evening sun even of its not crossing the horizon around the time of sunset and that is because it adjust your retinal sensitivity and your melatonin pathways that light is not as detrimental to monotone and at night think about the afternoon sunlight viewing as kind of a a i think of it is kind of a net flies inoculation it allows me to watch a little of net flicks in the evening on l that's very hard to watch a little bit of anything on that flicks it seems there is some other nor biological process to going on there where i have to watch episode after episode after episode but in any case you can protect yourself against some of that bad effect of light at night by looking at light in the evening it really does adjust down the sensitivity of the system of i will not talk about seasonal changes in all these things as they relate to mood and metabolism depending on where you are in the world northern hemisphere southern hemisphere at the equator or closer to the poles the days and nights are going t be different lengths that just make sense but that translates to real biological signals that impact everything from wakefulness and sleep times but also mood and metabolism here is how this works now after seeing the previous episode of the podcast and paying attention here you are armed with the knowledge to really understand how it is that believe it ore not every sell in your body is tuned to the movement of the planet relative to the sun as all if the earth spins once every twenty four hours on its axis part of that day were bathed in sunlight depending on where we are the other half of the day or part of the day were in darkness the earth also travels around the sun three hundred sixty give days is the time that it takes on year to travel around that sun the earth is tilted it is not perfectly upright the earth is tilted on its axis depending on where we are in that three hundred and sixty five day journey and depending on where we are in terms of hemisphere northern hemisphere southern hemisphere some days of the year are longer than others some are very short homemade very long if you the at the quarter you experience less variation in daylengthen there fore night length and if you are closer to the poles you are going o experience some very long days and your also gan experience some very short days depending on which pole your at and what time a year it is the simple way to put this as depending on time of year the days are either getting shorter or getting longer now every selling your body adjust its biology according to daylength except your brain body and sells do not actually know anything about daylength it only knows night length and here is you it works light inhibits melatonin powerfully if days are long and getting longer that means melatonin is reduced the total amount of melatonin is less because light is more therefore melatonin is less if days are getting shorter light cannot inhibit melatonin as much through the summing of photon mechanisms that we talked about before and that melatonin signal is getting longer every cell in your body actually knows external day length and therefore time of year by way of the duration of the melatonin signal end in general it is fair to say that in diurnal animals meaning animals us that tend to be awake during the daytime and not nocturnal animals which tend tore awake at night the longer the melatonin signal the more depressed not nasally clinically depressed although that cant happen but the more depressed are systems tend to be reproduction metabolism mood turn over rates of skincells and hair cells all tend to be diminished compared to the spring and summer months for some northern hemisphere spring n sever months or the times in which days are very long and there is less melatonin that tends to in almost all animals including humans more breeding more hormone elevation of the hormones that stimulate breeding reproduction and and a and fertility metabolism is up lipid metabolism fat burning is up preaching synthesis is up these things tend to correlate with the seasons now some people are very very strongly tie to the seasons they get depressed clinically depressed in winter and light therapies are very useful for those people some people love the winter and their happiest in winter and they feel kind of depressed in summer although that is far more rare that does not mean depression cannot exist in the summer but when sweetie mot seasonal depression that tends to be true its more depression in winter now there is other things that correlate with seasonality suicide rates tend to be highest in the spring not in the winter but that as to do with some of the a more complicated and unfortunate tragic aspects of suicide which is that oftentimes people will commit suicide not at the at the very depths of their energy levels but as their emerging from those depths of low energy we will talk about suicidally and and mood disorders in a later podcast season meaning a month later but for now just t understand that everybody is going through these natural fluctuations depending on the duration of the melatonin signal now this might lead you to say well than i should just really get as much light as i can all the time and reduce melatonin feel great all the time fortune t does not work that way because melatonin also has important effects on the immune system it has important effects on transmitter systems in the brain et camera everybody needs to figure out for themselves how much light they need early in the day and how much they need to avoid late in the day in order to optimize their mood an metabolism t there is no one size fits all prescription because there is a range of melotonand receptors there a range of o of everything from metabolic types to genetic histories family histories et camera there is no one size fits all prescription but by understanding that light and extended daylength and habit melatonin and melanoma tends to be associated with a more depressed or reduced functioning of these kind of activity driving and a mood elevating signals an understanding that you have some control over melatonin by way of light including sunlight but also artificial light that should empower you i believe to make the adjustments that if your feeling low you might ask how much light of i getting when am i getting that light because sleep is also important for restoring mood right you need sleep you cannot just just crush melatonin across the board and expect to feel good because then your not can fall sleep and stay asleep melatonin not incidentally comes from is synthesized from ceratoid ceratonan is an arotransmitter that is associated with feelings of well being provided at proper levels but well being of a particular kind well being associated with quiescence and calm and the feeling that we have enough resources in our immediate con conditions is the kind of thing that comes from a good meal or sitting down with friends or holding a loved one or o conversing with somebody that you really bond with serotonin does not stimulate action it tends to stimulate stillness very different then the normodulator dopamine which is a reward feel good neramodulator that stimulates action and actually dopamine is the precursor to epineperant to a adrenaline which actually puts us into action there itsectaly made from doom right you can starch ta thing about light as a signal that is very powerful for modulating things sleep an wakefulness but also serotonin levels melatonin levels and i talk about this previously but ill mention once more that light in the middle the night reduces dopamine levels to the point where it can start causing problems with learning a memory and mood that is one powerful reason to avoid bright light n the middle of the night o seasonal rhythms have a number of effects but humans are not see purely seasonable breeders unlike a lot of animals we breed all your long in fact o o there is a a preponderance of september babies in my life a not actual babies people the borne in september which means that they were conceived in remember i without knowing the details we we can fairly assume that a and remember at least in the northern hemisphere that days tend to be shorter and a you do not nights ten to be longer clearly humans are not seasonal breeders but there are shifts in in breeding and fertility that existing humans but also much more strongly in other animals seasonable effects vary some of you will ex experience very strong session facts others of you will not i think everybody should be taking care to get adequate sunlight and to avoid bright light at night throughout the year if possible throughout this podcast and in previous episodes have been mentioning neromodulators things ceratonan and dopamine which tend to buy a certain brain circuits and things in our body to happen and certain brain circuits and things our body not to happen one of the ones have mention numerous times epinephrin which is a neromodulator that tends to put us in to action make us want to move in fact when it is released in high amounts in our brain and body it can lead to what we call stress or the feeling of being stressed several people asked me what is the difference between epinephrin and a adrenalin a adrenaline is secreted from the adrenal glands which sit right above our kidneys epinephrin is the exact same molecule except that its released within the brain and people use these phrases are these words rather interchangeably spy means near were on top of sometimes and new new any time you see nephron or of it means kidney it means near the kidney epinephrin actually means near the kidney it was used originally to describe adrenalin but epinephrin and adrenalin a basically the same thing and they to stimulate agitation and the desire to move that is what that is about which brings us to the topic of exercise got lot of questions about exercise what forms of exercise are best for sleeping well when should i exercise et camera there is a lot of individual variability around this but i can talk about what i know from the science literature and what i happen to do myself there are basically two forms of exercise that we can talk about although of course i realize their many different forms of exercisers much wore haunts to this but we indie about party of vascular exercise where the ideas to repeat a movement over and over and over continuously ivy running biking rowing the cycling this kind of thing or there is a resistance exercise where your moving lifting presume we putting down also a things of progressively have your have your weight a that you could not do continuously for for thirty minutes a carry of vascular exercise is typically the more robin type exercise and resistance exercise of course is the more anerobic type exercise and yes theirs variation between the two most studies of exercise have looked at a robin exercise because that is basically the thing that you can get a rat or amounts to do what's really weird about rats and mice they l to run on wheels much that some one silly did the study was published in science they put a wheel a running wheel in the middle of a field and mice ran to that wheel and ran on the wheel they turns out that what they is the passage of the visual image of the bars in front of their face which i find a kind of a remarkable and troubling cause it seems trivial but anyway they love a robin exercise and most the studies were done on these mice that love running on wheels rest far as a it is been challenging to find conditions in which mice really to lift weights or will do it in a laboratory any wait bearing exercise studies really have to be done in humans and since humans are what we are interested in a there are some studies looking at these two things and when they tend to work best now you will see some places of robin exercise best done in the morning and weight training is best done in the afternoon i think there is far more individual variation than that m i think there are however a couple windows that the exercise science literature and the circadian lecture points to as windows related to body temperature in which performance injury a in which performances optimize injury is reduced and on and those tend to be thirty minutes after waking and that probably correlates with the inflection in quarts all associated with waking whether not you have get in light or not three hours after waking which probably correlates to the rise an body temperature sometime run around waking and the later afternoon usually eleven hours after waking which is when temperature tends to peace some people exercise in the morning some people exercise in the afternoon it really depends i think for those of us with very busy schedule it is a advantageous to be able to to do your training whenever you have the opportunity to do it a unless you can really control your schedule and i would never want these a recommendations to seem recommendations what ism really describing some opportunities thirty minutes after waking three hours after waking or eleven hours after waking has been shown at least in some studies to optimize performance reduce injury in that sort of thing be really have to figure out what works for you a note about working out first thing in the morning last time we talked about nonphotic facelifts if you exercise first thing in the morning your body will start to develop an anticipatory circuit there is actually plasticity in these circadian circuits that will lead you to want to wake up at the particular time that you exercise the previous three or four days that can be a powerful tool but you still want to get light exposure because it turns out that light and exercise converge to giving even bigger wake up signal to the brain and body som i want o think about that some people find if the exercise late in the day they have trouble sleeping in general in ten exercise s does that whereas the kind of lower intensity exercise does not i found some interesting literature that talked about sleep need and exercise i found this fascinating that a if one is waking not feeling rested and recovered from and yet sleeping the same amount that they typically have it is quite possible that the intensity of exercise in the proceeding two or three days is too high whereas if one cant a recover no matter how much sleep they get there just sleepy all the time i realize these things are correlated that the volume of training might be too high now ism not an exercise scientists we should prattler get on any gain or somebody else on here whose a really an expert in this kind of stuff i i do realize as soon as any one talks aby exercise or nutrition publicly there basically opening themselves up to all sorts of a challenges because you can basely find support for almost any pro to call in the literature what have looked at was a two journals in particular a international journal chronobiology am and a en journal biological rhythms excuse me to a to assess these parameters that i mention just just a moment ago because the studies tended to be done inhuman they were fairly recent and they came from am groups that i recognized as well as a knowing that those journals are pure reviewed many of your questions were about curl plasticity which is the bring and nervous systems ability to change in response to experience there was a question that asked whether or not these really deep biological mechanisms around wakefulness time of waking sleep et camera were subject to neral plasticity and indeed they are some of that plasticity is short vermin some of it is more long term there is a really good analogy here which is if you happen to eat on a very tight schedule where every day say at et a m noon and seven p m is when you eat your food not suggesting you do this but the say you were to do that for a couple days after a few days you would start to anticipate those meal times where no matter where you were in the world no matter what was going on in your life about five to ten minutes before those meal times you would start to feel hungry and even agitated which is your bodies way of trying to get you to forge for food and that is because of some peptide signals that come from the periphery from your body things hypocrite an erects an that signal to the hypothalamus and brain stem to make you active and alert and looker food and feel hungry there is cone of an anticipatory circuit that is a chemical circuit but eventually over time the neurons the curl circuits that control hypocretein erects and would get tuned to the nerd circuits that are involved in et and and may even smell and taste to create a kind of eating circuit that is unique to your pattern to your rhythms the same thing is true for these waking and exercise and other schedules including all radian schedule if you wake up in the morning and start getting your sunlight you start exercising in the morning you exercise in the afternoon pretty soon your body will tart to anticipate that and start o secrete hormones and other signals that prepare your body for the ensuing activity of waking up ore going to sleep if you get on to a pattern or rhythm even if that rhythm is not down to the minute you will find that there is plasticity in these sprouts and it becomes easier to wake up early if that is your thing or exercise at a particular day if that is your thing that is the beauty of normal plasticity a number of people asked what can i do to increase plasticity and that really comes in to forms there is plasticity that we can access in sleep to improve rates of learning an depth of learning from the previous day or and there is this an it a non sleep deep breast that can be done without sleeping to improve rates of learning and depth of retention et camera let us consider the those both and you can incorporate these protocols if you again these are based on quality were reviewed studies first let us talk about learning in sleep this is based on some work that i but provide the reference for that was published in the journal science excellent journal catwalk are also talks about some of these studies m done by others in his book who we sleep the studies just to remind you are structured the following way an individual is brought into a laboratory look does a spacial memory taste o their tends to be a a screen with a bunch a different objects popping up on the screen in different location might be a bulldog's face that might be a cat than it might be an apple than it might be a pen indifferent locations and that sounds trivially easy but with time you can imagine it gets pretty tough to come back a day later remember if something presented in a given location was something you have seem before and whether not it was presented n that location ore different location you had enough objects and change locations enough this can actual be quite difficult in this study p the subjects either just went through the the experiment or a particular odor was a released into the room while they were learning or a tone was played in the room while they were learning and then during the sleep of those subjects the following night and the following night so was done repeatedly for several nights the same odor or tone was played while the subjects were sleeping they did this in different stages of sleep none sleep and rapid i move in sleep red sleep they did this with just the tone in sleep a if they if the subjects had had the odor but not the tone they had they did it with putting the tone if they had ad the odor while learning easily all the controls all the things you want to see done to make sure that it was in some indirect a facts a modulatory effect and what they found was that providing the same stimulus the odor if they smelled an odor or a tone if the subjects heard a tone while learning if they just delivered that odor or tone while the subject slept rates of learning and retention of information was significantly greater pretty cool what this means that you can cue the subconscious brain the asleep brain to learn particular things better and faster how might you implement this well you could play with this if you want i do not see any real challenge to this provided the odor and a is a safe one and does not wake you up in the tone is a safe a safe one and does not wake you up am you could do this by having a metronome for instance while learning something playing in the background or particular music and then have that very faintly while you sleep you could apply this if you and and try this a there are number of groups a i think now that are trying this using tactile stimulation slight vibration on the wrist during learning and then the same vibration on the wrist during sleep it does not appear that the sensory modality whether not odor or a auditory tone or tactile stimulation some a sensory stimulation it whether not it matters it is remarkable because it really shows that sleep is an extension of the waking state we have known that for a long time but this really tethers those two in a very meaningful an actionable way i think all report a back as i learn more about these studies but that is that is what i know about them at this point as long as were there we might as well talk about dreaming cause i got many questions about a dreams a couple will not ask me what their dreams meant a look gunmen know what my dreams mean half the time am i a occasionally will wake up from a dream and remember it if you want to remember your dreams better if your somebody who has a challenge is remembering your dreams you can set your alarms that you wake up in the middle of one of these ninety minute cycles which toward morning tend to be occupied almost exclusively by red sleep remember early in the night you have less remsleep than later in the night but you want to get as much sleep as a you can cause that is healthy i doftnothy wont awake yourself up some people find that writing down their thoughts immediately first thing in the morning allows them to relater spontaneously remember their dream they had their some literature on that the meaning of dreams is a little bit a controversial some people believe they have strong meaning other people am believe that they can be just spontaneous firing of anurans that were active a in a the waking state and do not have any meaning they are good data to show that when you learn spacial a new spacial environments that there is a replay of those environments ism call place cells that fire in your brain only when you enter a particular environment that those are replayed in sleep in almost direct fashion to the way that a things were active ate when you were learning that spacial last dreams are fascinating there you now were paralyzed thing dreams which brings us to another question somebody asked about sleep paralysis a we are paralyzed for much of our sleep called aktoniout presumably we do not act out our dreams some people wake up and there still paralyzed have actually had this happen to me not very many times but a few times and then they jolt themselves awake and it actually is quite terrifying i could say from personal experience to wake up be wide awaken you cannot move your body at all it is a really quite frightening they're couple things that will increase the a intrusion of atonic into the wakeful state which is essentially means you are waking up but you cannot a you cannot move one is marijuana t h c ism not a marina smoker am ism not a a copper i do not know the legality where you live ism not saying one thing or another about martian ism just am the fact i had that experience a without marijuana means that it can happen regardless but marijuana smokers for whatever reason may be has something to do with the anabantid receptors am or the ceremonial receptors downstream of the motor pathways i do not know ami count find any literature on this but marijuana smokers report higher frequency of this a can a paralysis and wakefulness a as you transition from sleep to wakefulness i suppose probably one could learn to get comfortable with it of for me it was terrifying cause ism just used to be able to move my limbs fortunately and i was not able to and it it is quite a am a quite a thing let me tell you of some other questions about negro plasticity the other form of narc pastose is not the normal plasticity that your amplifying by listening to tones or am smelling odors and sleep but the hero pastose that you can access with nonslip deep rest enemy are nonslip deep rest as well as short twenty minute naps which are very close to nonslip deep least because people rarely drop into deep states of sleep during short naps unless there very sleep to proved enemy are has been shown to increase rates of learning when done for twenty minute bouts for pronto match an approximately ninety minute bout of learning what am i talking about ninety minute cycle are these altradian cycles that have talked about previously and we tend to learn very well by taking a ninety minute cycle transitioning into some focus mode early in the cycle went hard to focus and then deep focus and and learning feels almost agitation and strain and then by the end of that ninety minute cycle becomes very hard to maintain focus and learn more information there is a study publish an sell reports last year great journal a excellent paper showing that twenty minute naps or light sleep of the sort of non sleep deep rest taken immediately after or close to it does have to be immediately after you finish the last sentence of learning or whatever it is or or bar of music but couple minutes after transitioning to a period of of non sleep deep rest where you are turning off the analysis of duration path and outcome has been shown to accelerate learning to a significant degree both the amount of information and the retention of that information that is pretty cool because this is a a cost free drug free way of accelerating learning without having to get more sleep but simply by introducing these twenty minute bouts i would encourage people if they want to try this to consider the twenty minutes our every ninety minutes of all treaty in learning cycle there your incorporating a number of different hero science back a tools ninety cute cycles for focus learning could be motor could be cognitive could be musical whatever and then transition to a twenty minute non sleep deep rest protocol this one acts the fact that in last episode in the caption on you two we provided links to two different you an idea non sleep deep rest protocols as wells hypnosis protocols that are clinically backed from my collidavid s eagle at am stamphord psychotic department m all those resources are free there are also a lot of other hypnosis scripts out there i the ones from michael feel s e a l i think it is epilog may be it is just why you find them easily on you to clinical hypnosis scripts meaning not stage hypnosis dare not designed to get you to do anything in fact there just design to help rewire your brain circuitry now how does hypnosis work that way is has a lot to do with sleep because it engages her plasticity by bringing together two things that normally are separate from one another one is the alert focus wasteful state where you activate the learning and then there is the deep rest where the actual reconfiguration of the neurons and synapsis takes place hypnosis brings both the the focus and the deep rest component into the same compartment of time its a very unique state in that way hypnosis can a maximizes the learning bout and the non sleep deep least bout and combines them but of course that require some guidance a from a script or from a hypnotist clinically a a trained hypnotist and it becomes hard to acquire detailed information it is more about shifts in state fear to a states of calm or am smoking to quitting smoking anxiety around a drama to release of anxiety round a torment rather than specific information learned in hypnosis ski hypnosis seems more about modulating the circuits that under lie state as post a specific information although i would not be surprised if there were not certain forms of hypnosis that could increase retention and learning of specific information but ism not aware of any of those protocols out there yet which brings us to the next thing about learning an plasticity which is neurotics a oh a smart drugs ah this a big topic that big was a a sigh of concern about how to address neurotics in a a thorough enough but thoughtful enough way look have a lot of thoughts about neurotics first of all it means smart drugs i believe am an i do not that phrase because let us just take a step back and think about exercise you say i want to be more physically fit what does that mean does it mean i would ask for more specificity i say do you want be stronger oka may you need to lift terror objects progressively do you want more endurance very different protocol to access en durance do you want flexibility do you want explosiveness or suppleness huge range of things that we call physical fitness may be want all of those if we were talking about emotional fitness we would say well in ability to feel empathy but probably also to disengage from empathy because you do not want to be tether to other peoples emotions all the time that is not healthy either you would think about being able to access a range of emotions but for some people their range into the sadness regime is really quite vast but their range into the happiness regime might be kind of limited for other people or in a manic state it might be they can access all the happy stuff but not the sadder stuff am you now speaking by way of analogy here but if we say we are to talking about cognitive and cognivabilities we have to ask i creativity memory we tend to a social intelligence with memory i think this goes back to spelling bees or something the ability retain a lot of information and just regurgitate information i which will get you some distance in some some disciplines of life but it will not allow you creative thinking it is necessary for creative thinking you need a knowledge base right you cannot just look up everything on fugal despite what certain educators or called educator say you need a database that you could have the raw materials with which to be creative necessary to have memory but not sufficient to be creative right the creative could have a poor memory for certain things but certainly not for everything they cannot have interrogate and retrograde amnesia they would be the goldfish that every time around the tank it a you know cannot remember where it is that as you do not know that they have ever done that experiment by the way but no disrespect to goldfish but you get the idea you have got creativity you have memory you have the abiliiatasks which right you have the ability to strategy develop in strategy implement the problem i have with the concept of a neurotic or smart drug is it is not specific as to what cognitive a algorithm you are trying to engage we need more specificity that said there are elements to learning that we have discussed here before they are very concrete things the ability to focus and put the blinders on to everything else that is happening in around you any in your head mainly right distractions about things you should be doing could be doing your might be doing and focus on what you need to do and then that is required for triggering that i see coming not demodulator that will then allow you to highlight the particular synapses that will then later change in sleep no neurotic allows you to by pass the need for sleep an deep rest that is important understand i day dream about a day when people will be able to access compounds that are safe that will allow them to learn better meaning to access information focus better as well as to sleep better and activate the plasticity from the learning bout right now most neurotics tend to bundle a bunch of things together most of them includes some form of stimulant affine episode to till you more probably than you everyone to know about canine a menacing and how that work refer there for how caffeine works but stimulants will allow you to increase focus up to a particular point if you have to little to alertness in your system you cannot focus to much however you start to cliff in focus drifts ache you cant just in jest more stimulant to be more focus it does not work that way most neurotics also include things that increase or a designed to increase a seat coming things alpha p c and other things of that sort and indeed there some evidence that they can increase o seat coming i refer you again to examine dot come the website to valuate any supplements are compounds for their safety and their effects in humans and animals free website as well as with lengths to studies we need the focus component we need the alertness component the alertness component comes from epinephrin traditionally from affine stimulation the retooling stimulation traditionally comes from coming donors or alphorn p c things o that sort and then you would want to have some sort of offswitch because anything that is can a really stimulate your alertness that then provides a crash that crash is not a crash into the deep kind of restful slumber that you would want for learning it is a crash into the kind of am let us just call it lopsided sleep meaning it is deep sleep but it lac certain spindles and other elements of the physiology sleep spindles that a that really engage the learning process in the reconfiguration of synapsis write now my stands on neurotics is that may be may be for occasional use provided it safe for you ism not recommending it but in general it tends to use more of a shotgun approach than is probably tan o be useful for learning and memory in the long run lot if you lasts about modaphanil or armodaphanil which was just in for treatment of narcalepsis writ there tells you it is a stimulant and yes there is evidence it will improve learning memory modaphno is very expensive last time i checked armodaphinal i think his see a recent released a generic version of this that is far less expensive most these things look a lot amphetamine and many of them have a the potential for diction a or come habit forming a but more importantly a lot of those things also can create metabolic effects by disruption to insolent receptors and forth you want a approach those with a strong sense of caution now there are the milder things that act as neurotics t i mention some of them alpha p c am some people into pinko gives me vicious headaches i do not take it people really differ last podcast i recommend magnesium three in eight if you were exploring supplements i not recommending anything directly ism just ting if you are exploring supplements magnesium three in ate seems among the magnesium a to be one of the more a biovailable and useful for sleep i recommended actually to a good friend fine it gave him at very low dose he had a stomach issues with it he just had a simply stop taking it there is very ability there he just it gave him some stomach cramping in just did not feel good on it stopped it he felt better other people take magnesium three in a and feel great i was asked do magnesium need to be taken with or without food daytime or before sleep if you are going to go that route it should be taken thirty to sixty meets before sleep cause its design to make you sleepy and ism not aware that it has to be taken with food but again all this has to be run by your doctor and this is your health care am to to govern not a these are not strict recommendation look in to it but am magnesium three n at most people i recommend it to have benefit from it tremendously some people cannot tolerate it s you have to find out there were no more questions about other supplements design to access deep sleep in part to access normal plasticity but now ism just sort of transitioning from normal plasticity to these compounds that can regulate sleep one of them that i discuss at the end oath last potassic lotic questions about at apigenin a p i g e and i n apigenin if you look in the literature the way it works is hat increase system of the enzymes associated with gabometabolism it actually galas an inhibitory nor transmitter it is the hero transmitter that is increased after a couple ala a drinks containing alcohol and that shut down the forebrain apigenin is a dederivitive of the camomile i think that the proper pronunciation of this is matrix maria camomile although i was feel shut using a punish accent whenever a nor say something that other related things that impact the gala system and increase bar things passion flower which is pass flora incubate the do not know why the italic is at italic anyway my italic colleagues please forgive me have om some very close italic o friends in colleagues in general i butcher the italic sorry in any event apigenin and a passion flower found in a lot of a a lot of supplements design to increase sleepiness in sleep because and they work presumably because they increase gala actually they work on chloride channels rather than give you a whole lecture a mumbling biophysics and neurons it'll just say that when neurons are really active it is because sodium ions salt rushes into the cells and causes them to fire electrically the sells ten to become less active as more chloride which is a negatively charged ion om isiprtly taking some of you back to the either the a wonderful times or dramas of high school physics a the chloride is negatively charged to it tends to make sells less a electrically positive cause carries a negative charge and hyperopolarizes the neuron apigenin works through these increasing the activity these chloride channels passion flower in works by increasing the activities chloride channels and gala transmission it tends to increase this in history nor transmitter that shuts off a thinking are analysis of duration path and outcome if you can explore these things i suggest you at least know how they work you at least go to a examined o come that you talk your doctor about them some people asked about serotonin for getting to sleep and staying asleep now i understand the rational here just i understand the rational of taking something mecunopurians or el top to increase dopamine but sometimes what works on paper does not really work in the real world i personally have tried taking a supplement which was a altriptophan which is the crecurserto serotonin or five h t p which is design to increase whip it is saratonan basically your are just a one be chemical step away from actuating actual serotonin and arsonist the sleep that i had a with increase saratonan by way of trip favor five h t p was dreadful i fell asleep almost immediately you say with that is great and ninety minutes later i woke up and i could not sleep almost for forty eight hours now that was me i have a pretty sensitive system to certain things and not the other things some people love these things you really have to be thoughtful and explore them with that kind of awareness of of being thoughtful and realizing that what works for you my not work for everybody in what works for everybody my not work for you oke i to continue by talking about the roll of temperature in sleep accessing sleep staying asleep and wakefulness first i want a tell a joke because i think this joke really capture some of the critical things to understand about any self experimentation that you might do this is a story that was told to me by a college of mine who now professor of calpac not to be named there is a scientist and they are in their lab and there try and understand how the nervous system works they go over to a tank and they pick up a frog and they take the frog they put it down on the table and they clap and the frog jumps they think for a while they pick up the frog can they go over the cabinet and they take out lo bit of a paralytic drug and they inject it locally into the back leg set it down they clap and the frog jumps but it can jumps to the side a little bit they pick it up they inject the paralytic into the other back leg they clap again the frog jumps but it really does not jump well that time con drags itself forward they pick it up and they inject the paralytic into the remaining two legs they set it down and they clap the frog does not jump they my goodness the legs are used for hearing now they publish the paper paper comes out in a great journal news releases the really big deal their career takes off twenty years later a really smart graduates point comes long and says yet but that is loss of function does not really show gain a function let us take the closer look thy repeat the first experiment and checks out everything happens the same way but then they take the frog and they inject a drug into all four legs that turns off the paralytic right's an antagonist they set the frog down they clap and the frog jumps they my goodness it is true the legs really are for hearing now first of all i want to make the point that this is not to illustrate that science is not a good practice it is we need to do loss of function and gain in function experiments but just to show that correlation and causation is complicated you need to do a variety of control experiments and you really into figure out will works for you and while science can provide answers about what works under very controlled conditions it does not and can never address all the situations in which a giving compound to give in practice will or will not work and it is not is individual variability is that their number different factors you all of course know that light can actin eight and shift your circadian rhythm but can exercise con food the last point i want to make is an important one which is that no frogs we are hurt in the telling of this jokeoca let us continue i want to talk about temperature temperature is superinteresting as it relates to circadian rhythms and wakefulness and sleep first let us take a look at what is happening to our body temperature across each twenty four hour cycle in general our temperature tends to be lowest right around four a m and starts creeping up around six a m right a m and peak some time between four p m and six p m now that series from person a person but in general if we were to continuously monitor occasionally honor temperature that is what we would see now it is interesting is that even in the absence of any light cues or meal cues we would have a shift we would have an oscillation or rhythm in our temperature that would go from high to low this is why the idea that we are all ninety six point eight and that is our correct temperature forget that that is no longer true t never was true it depends on what time a day you measure temperature however there is a range which is within normal range i think most of us associate fever with somewhere around a under at a hundred one hundred three that is concerning and we would be very concerned if temperature drop too low as well the way that the temperature rhythm that is in dopiness that is within us and rhythmic no matter what the way it gets anchored to the the pattern i describe before of being lowest at fore i m and increasing again around om through the day until about for to six p m is by way of in trainmen or matching to some external cue which is almost always going to be light but also ex excise now you may have experience this temperature rhythm and how quickly it can become unit trained or it can fall out of in trainmen here is an experiment i would not want you to do but you have probably experience this before where you wake up it is sunny outside and may be have some metal or somethings to take care of or maybe did not sleep that well the night before and you stay in doors you do not change anything about your breakfast you do not change anything about you are within home temperature or anything that and somewhere red around ten or eleven o'clock you start feeling kind of chilled your cold well what happen was the oscillators the clocks in your various tissues that are governed by temperature and circadian rhythm are starting to split a way from your central clock mechanisms it is actually important that your temperature match daylength now there is another way in which temperature matches or daytime cues me there is also important way in which temperature matches daylength in general as days get longer it tends to be hotter out not always but in general that is the way it is and as days get shorter it tends to be colder outside temperature and daylength are also linked metabolically there linked by logically there there lined excuse me and atmospherically there linked for the reason the we talked about before about duration of daylength and other climate features and forth one of the most powerful things about setting your circadian rhythm properly is that your temperature will start to fall into a regular rhythm and that temperature has a very strong effect on things metabolism and when you will feel most willing and interested in exercising typically the willingness to exercise and engage in any kind of activity mental or physical l is going to be when that rising temperature is steepest when the slope of that line is greatest that is why thirty minutes after waking is one of those key windows as well as three hours after waking and then when temperature actually peaks which is generally generally about eleven hours after waking this is why we say that temperature and circle rhythm are linked but there actually even more linked than that we have talk before about how light enters the eye trigger's activation of these melons and cells which then trigger's activation of the supervise magic nuclear the master circadian clock and then i always say the master circle clock in forms all the cells and tissues of your body and puts them into a nice cohere of rhythm but what have never answered was how it actually puts them into that rhythm and it does it two ways one is it secretes a peptide peptize just a little proline that floats through the blood stream and signals to the cells ora where tuning your clock calico a join a watch store the the watch sterner would tune the clocks but the other way is it synchronizes the temperature under which those cells exist temperature is actually the effected of the circadian rhythm now this is really important because changes in temperature by way of exercise by way of eating but especially by way of exercise can starch to shift our circadian rhythm pretty dramatically but let us even go to an more extreme example nowadays there some interest in cold showers and ice bats not everybody is doing this i realized people seem to either love this a hate this i do not mind the cold dunk thing i i get regular about this from time to time and it'll do it i have been doing it recently it is always painful to do the first couple times than you get find used to it however have taken people to a cold don cere an ice bath i have a family member who would not get literally past er to of this is just too aversive for me some people really the cold people very tremendously getting into an ice bath is very interesting because you have a rebound increase in homogenesis now you should know from the previous episode that as that temperature increases it will shift your circadian rhythm and which direction it shifts or circadian rhythm will depend on whether not your doing it during the daytime or late in the day if you do it after eight p m it is going to make your day longer right because your body and your central clocks are used to temperature going up early in the day and throughout the day and piking in the afternoon if you then increase that further or you simply increase it over its base line at eight p m after temperature was already falling even it is just by a half a degree or couple degrees er you do that with exercise does not after you the ice bath you are extending you are shifting forward you are phase delaying your clock you are convincing your clock and therefore the rest of your body that the day is still going right youyou giving it the perception the cellar and physiological perception that the day is getting longer and you will want to actually stay up later and wake up later now you might say weigh i do an ice bath late at night and i feel great and i fall deeply asleep well cold cantrigger the release of melatonin there is a rebound increase in melatonin that could be the cause of that effect you have to see what works for you but if you do the ice bath early in the day and then get out you you will experience more rapid rise for cold show early in the day a more rapid rise in your body temperature that will phase advance your clock and make it easier to get up early the following day for those of you that are having trouble getting up and this is going o almost ounlaughable but a cold shower first thing in the morning will wake you up but that is waking you up in the short term because of a different mechanism which it'll talk about in a moment but it also a shifting your clock it is phase advancing your clock in a way that makes you more likely to get up earlier the next day of in other words increasing your temperature by getting in an ice bath which or cold shower which or exercising which causes a compensatory increase in body temperature think about the normal pattern of body temperature low around for thirty five a m starts to peak right around waking starexcuse me starts to increase right around waking then steep slope steep slope to a peak round for to six p m and then drops off if you introduce an increase in body temperature by way of cold exposure early in the day let us a six a m or five a m if your massacistic enough to get into a cold shower at that time more power to you it is going to make you want to wake up about half hour to an hour earlier the next day than you normally would whereas if you do it while your temperature is falling it will tend to delay and make your body perceive as if the day is getting longer these are have advances and phase delays we are going get into this in far more detail we talk about jetlag an shift work in episode for as well as other other things but temperature is again is not just one tool to manipulate wake up time an circadian rhythm and metabolism it is the effector it is the way that the central circadian clock impacts all the cells and tissues of your body if you want to read further about this and your really curious about the roll of temperature work by jo takahashi who use to be at north western university and is now at you tee south western and dais a incredible a scientist and is it really worked out a lot of the mechanisms around temperature and circadian rhythms you can just good his name you will see a a whole bunch of studies there i want to talk about cold and cold exposure because there is a great misconception about this that actually you can leverage once you understand how to use cold to either increase thermogenesis and fat loss metabolism or you can use it for stress mitigation and mood and it really depends on one simple feature of how you approach the ice bath a cold shower if you get into an ice bath or cold shower and you are calming yourself your actively calming the autonomic nervous system may be through some deep breathing may b y through visualization may being a song in a people do this stuff n they use various tools some people find paying attention to an external stimulus is more helpful you will thinking about something not they experience of the cold other people find that directly experiencing the cold and its most intense forming kind of going into the cold quote and quote a is the best way to approach it it really varies for for people there is no right or wrong way to go about this but the goal of using cold exposure for stress inoculation and to raise your stress threshold to be able to tolerate heighten levels of real life stress not the ice bath but realize stress work stress and relational stress et camera is by suppressing the activation of the local sympathetic nervous system meaning the alertness or stress system that involves buffering or trying to resist the shiver response the shiver response is autonomic response designed to generate heat presumably in actually that is what it does in order to counter the cold when you use cold exposure and your on a muscling through it or your learning to relax within it as a form of stress inoculation that is great and works quite well for that purpose and there's a reason why cold exposure is used in a variety of forms of military stress inoculation most famous of which of courses the navy seal books rostra test really which is screening procedure for becoming seal wolves a lot of exposure to cold water however if you are interested in using cold exposure for fat loss and thermogenesis you want to do the exact opposite thing there was a paper published in nature to years ago which showed that cold induced shiver the actual physical shiver activates the release of a chemical in the body from muscle called succinate es u c c ion at e succinate travels in the blood stream and then goes in activates a particular category of fat not the typical kind of pink or white fat that we think of is blubber in humans the h stuff that people seem to generally want less of except for those genetic freaks that seem to have none of it defending what they consume congratulations brown fat is cold brown fat exxactually dark under the microscope it it is rich with mitochondria and it exists mostly between the scapulaiand in the upper neck and it generates generates thermogenesis and heat in the body it is rich with a certain category of adrenergic receptor intently apineferon binds to atronergic receptors these brown fat sells increase metabolism it is called brown fat thermogenesis and cause fat burning burning of other kinds of fat the pink and white fat what does this all mean this means if you want a use the ice bath in order increase metabolism shiver away if you want to use the ice bath or cold shower in order to stress inoculate resist the shiver and learn to stay calm or quotnquote muscle through it now i do not know that any one's ever rally talked about this publicly o a because i think the date are new and i think that people assume that the ice bath or cold exposure is just one thing here have talked about it three ways to shift your circadian rhythm depending on whether or not you are doing it early in the day while your temperature is still rising or at its peak or after that peak in order to extend the perception of your day as continuing and make you want to go to sleep later and wake up later now and then the third way of course is to either activate brown fat thermogenesis and increase metabolism i suppose the fourth way would be to a increase street tolerance or street threshold but remember temperature is the effector of circadian rhythms light is the trigger the supercisematic nucleus is the master circadian clock that mediates all these changes also influence by nonphotic influence exercise and feeding and things that sort but temperature is the effector now you can also shift your circadian rhythm with eating when you travel and you land in a new location in your schedule is inverted twelve hours one way that we know you can shift your rhythm more quickly is to get on to the local meal schedural now that probably has to do it two effects water changes in temperature inducement eating induced in increases in body temperature now you should understand why that would work as well as eating has its anticipatory secretion of bate of hybrocretenerectson that i talked about it earlier if this is getting a list you down in the weeds do not worry about it we i will get more into this in episode for of how to shift one's rhythm but i would love for people to understand that light and temperature are the real heavy duty levers when it comes to moving your circadian rhythm and sleep times an activity schedule and exercise in feeding can help but really temperature and light with light being the primary one or the most important when it comes to sleep and wakefulness many people asked questions about food and negro transmitters and hallows relate to sleep wakefulness and mood which is essentially twenty five hours of content for me to cover but i am in a trying to still out the most common questions we have talked a lot about demodulators too me to seetocolling in nor up in efferent you may notice in those discussions that the precursors to say ceratonan is trip to fan trip to fanachaly comes from the diet it comes from the foods that we eat pyroxene is the precursor to dopamine it comes from the foods that we eat and then once we invest them the those compounds are circulate to a variety a different cells an tissue us but it is true that are food an the particular foods we can influence things neramodulator levels to some extent it is not the only way because there re also enzymes and you chemical pathways that are going to regulate how much tyrosine gets convert into dopamine and there are elements of the doorman uric morons the dope neurons themselves that are electrical that have influence on this as well but there are couple fair assumptions that we can make first of all nuts and meats in particular red meats ten to be rich in things tyrosine i that tells you right there that because tyrosine is the precurserve dopamine and dopamine is the precurserof nor up aneferon an epineferon that those foods tend to lend themselves toward the production of dopamine and epineferand and the sorts of things that are associated with wakefulness now of course the volume of food that we eat also unpacks are wakefulness if we eat a lot of anything whether not it is ribitakes rice were cardboard please do not eat cardboard your stomach of its very distended will draw lot of blood into your got and you will divert blood from other tissues and you will become sleepy it is not just about food content it is also about food volume i fasting states generally are associated with more alertness epineferan forth and fed states are generally associated with more quiescence in relaxation serotonin and and the kind of things that lend themselves more towards sleep and less toward alertness foods that are rich in trip to fan ten to be things white meat turkey also complex carbohydrates if you you can start experimenting depending on what foods you eat you can start experimenting with carbohydrate rich meals for accessing sleep and more depth of sleep this is actually something i personally do i tend to eat pretty low parish during the day i ashy fast for until about noon not because i have to work to do that but because it'd rather just drink canine and water during that time and then sometime around noon i cannot take it any more and ism hungry and i eat and i try in o eat low care is unless have worked out extremely hard in the previous two hours which i rarely do although i do sometimes and that meal is then designed to prolong my period of wakefulness into the late afternoon and then sometime around dinner time which for me is round six thirty seven p m eight p m sometimes lays nine p m i tend to eat things white meat fish posts rice that kind of thing my favorite food of all for accessing trip to fan is actually a starch it is a it such a vegetable that is the croissant which is my favorite vegetable i do not neat those all the time but i i love them and they seem to increase dopamines well a never ally done the maspectomatry on a cross but id they defile increase trip tolan and relaxation for me in all seriousness lo carbohydrate slash fasted slash keetogenic diets ten to lend themselves towards wakefulness by way of increasing epaneferan nor upon efferent a dental and dope men an things of that sort carbohydrate rich meals and i suppose we stock bout meals as supposed to diet tend to lend themselves more toward trip to fan sceratonan and more lethargic states there is very limited evidence that i am aware of that carbohydrate should eat and at one time a day in as it relates to a metabolism et camera ism sure that will open up a certain amount of debate ah if you work out very hard in you to pleat likagin than this all changes some people are working out very hard in to pleading lagan other people or not that gets away outside the contact of this particular podcast but yes indeed different foods can bus different normodulators and thereby can modulate are waking or are feelings of lethargy and sleepiness there are couple effects of food that are independent rashes at couple effects of eating cause the food will not do it when it is sitting across the table but of eating that are powerful for modulating circadian rhythm wakefulness et camera and that is because every time we eat we get eating induce thormagenesists regardless of what we eat now the eating induce thermogenesis and increasing metabolism which is an increase in temperature really is probably greatest for a monoacid rich foods meats but also other types of foods it is a minimal increase and body temperature compared to say cold exposure ore exercise now whether not say quarter of a degree or half a degree or degree it really depends on the individual and of course there are blood sugar effects there are things whether not you are type one or type to diabetic whether not your insolent resisting whether not there is a a a kid who a in turns on the podcast here whose a seventeen years old and ism convince that he can eat anything and he just seems to burn at of hes growing at every time early the other day he walked into the other room in two days later he walked out of the same room e came out in between of course but and fans your ye grew was at but he is at that stage where he just growing food as going affect a tea nature very differently than s can affect a full grown person in general starchy carbohydrates white meats such as turkey some fish increase trip to fan therefore ceratonan therefore more lethargic states more calm meat nuts and there are probably some plant base foods that ism not aware of an i apologize i should read up on this that also high entyrasene that can increase things dope me nor upon efferent pan veteran alertness you can vary these however you most people i think are eating a variety of these things in in in given meal and there are other parameters of nutrition the are important too volume of food for the reasons i mention before the volume of food in the gut less food in the gut whether it's empty or small amount of food will intend to correlate with wakefulness large volumes of food of any kind we will tend to correlate and drive the calming response and that is by way of this nerve pathway call the vacate we fact you have sense my fibers in the gut that communicate to little protrusion of neurons that s at rectnicxs the juggler called the nodose ganglia and o d o s e on might costello it is nodose right now he is all doze roofs actually means having many protrusions and its account of a lumpy collection of neurons a angles just collection earns and then it goes into the brainstorm and then forward in the brain to the areas the brain they are involved in production of various normotulators what we eat and the volume of food are both signaling to the brain it is not just one or the other and then there is also this eating in duce their agenesis and now from the discussion about temperature that if you are eating early in the day your tending to shift your rhythm earlier it you will want to wake up earlier the next day if you are eating very late in the day even if you can fall asleep after that there is a tendency for you to want a sleep later the next day now this of course is all going to be constrained aby when your kids need to eat when your spouse needs to eat when your friends need to eat or if you live alone or what other things you are doing if you are me and you kind o do not eat until noon then eat some time around noon and then ism terrible about meals i just start eating the ingredients while spoke to be cooking and then eventually they are all gone and i guess that is of meal it varies some people are narcotically attached to a particular meal scandal somepeople are not i take my light exposure scatter far more seriously than i take my meal schedule although in general a chine healthy foods for the most part prisons included i was asked several times whether not men and women are males and females differ in terms of these narrow transmit or genotypes and the rhythms of sleep and temperature we could probably devote a whole month d we pry will devoted entire month to what are called sex differences because those tend to be related to things we absolutely know exacts i ex why cromazones are ex why who and some cases are double ex cromazoes om as pop to gender sexton and carrion type as we call it genetic make up is is crystal clear there are are things that correlate with one or the other but it is complicated and it is not something that is been explored in what i think is enough detail actually in recently i i guess it was about five years ago the national institutes of health made it a man date that all studies use sexes a biological variable and actually explore both sexes of mice both sexes of humans when doing any kind of study because there was a bi as towards only using man animals or mail subjects prior to that time a lot of at are now coming you revealing important sex differences that i think are going to have powerful impact on health practices et camera response to drugs response to different sleep schedules et camera i perhaps the the most sailing and obvious one is that during pregnancy females experience a a whole range of endearing and burro a effects and we definite we will devote a month to pregnancy an child birth and child rearing and for that it'd really to bring in some experts have got terrific colleagues at stamford and elsewhere that work on these things s that we can go into those in more depth ism not am blowing off those questions ism just ism con o pushing them down the road a little bit were i can give you a more a thorough answer as we finish up i just want to offer you the opportunity to do an experiment we have talked about a lot of variables that can impacts sleep in wakefulness and in keeping with the theme of the pod casts we are going to content to talk about sleep n wakefulness and tools for those and the science behind those tools as we go forward but there are really just four simple parameters that you have control over that you can immediately start to record and take note of just to see how you are doing with these things with no judgment are perhaps no change to what your actually doing it might be interesting just a suggestion to wright down for each day when you went outside to get sunlight and when you did that relative to waking you would write down i the way i do the my calender s it'll wright down that i do not get exact about i might say n i woke up at six fifteen and then i as it'll put a u six fifteen and then m s all for sunlight ow you sometimes get outside right away other times ism less good at that and it'll go out around on o say seven and for how long i maybe ten fifteen minutes or and then it'll put a little check at roughly the times a that i ate my a called meals or those i mention sorts my meals are a bunch of small checks that just kind of extend through the late hours of the day yours might be more confined to to certain times and then you might just take note of when you exercised just put down a e for when you exercise wait training or erotic exercise and you might note when you might have felt chilled or cold if you do or you might have felt particularly hot or if you woke up in they'll night when you felt particularly hot and then the last thing you might want to do is just right down if in when you did a n on sleep deep restprotocall and as the our photo call that could be meditation that could be yocanidra that could be hypnosis anything that your using to deliberately teach your nervous system how to go from more alertness to more calmness in the waking state even of its waking up the mill the night in doing an as the our protocol or in the afternoon or first thing in the morning to re cover some sleep and ability to per form deepens that you might have lost from a minimal or poor night's sleep you aregoig to right down when you woke up when you view sunlight that might be in the morning in the evening are just a the morning hoofleets the morning and the evening when you exercised when you hate your meals and using a simple record keeping scheme db you for waking resell for sunlight maybe you come up with a system where it is a check or an ex or something for exercise this is not design to make you neurotically attached to on tracking all your your behaviors and everything you do om i fornicate do not track what i eat in particular i can i know what what works for me and i just trying stay within on within that range but by doing this you constant to reveal some really interesting patterns patterns that no answer that i could provide you about any existing tool or protocol could counter it is really about taking the patterns of behaviors of waking and light viewing and eating and exercise and superimposing that on what your learning in this podcast and elsewhere of course and what you already know and trying to see where certain problem or problems or pain points might be arising maybe your eating really late in the day and your waking up in mill the right really warm well now you would say well that could be doe to kind of an increase in temperature that is extending my day o or maybe you start to find that using cold exposure early in the day as great for you but using at late if it is too late in the day that is not great or om if you're into the sonars even some people including myself if i take a hot showers in a hot rubber sand late at night well then i get a compensatory decrease in body temperature and i sleep great provided a hydrate well enough cause that can be cold of a be hydrating thing to sit in hot a hot conditions but if i do the sand early in the day unless i exercise immediately afterward then i tend to get the temperature drop which make sense because we get thesana your get vazodisolation you awful lot o heat n than you generally get a compensatory drop in temperature if you do that early in the day that is right about the time that that temperature is trying to in train the creating clocks of your body that is what happens to me other people it might be slightly different and some people have more resilient systems than others i just encourage you to start becoming scientists of your own physiology of your own brain and body and seeing how the various tools that you may or may not be using are effecting your patterns of sleep your patterns of attention and wakefulness it is vitally important that if you do this that that it is not about trying to get on to t an extremely rigid schedule it is really about trying to identify variables that are most powerful for you and that push you in the direction that you want to go and changing the variables that are pushing your body and your mind in the directions that you do not want to go self experimentation is something that should be done slowly carefully you do not want to be reckless about this and this is where i would say manipulating one or two variables at a time as really going to be best as a p of to changing a you know a dozen things all at once to really identify what it is that is most powerful for you as always thank you much for your questions we are going to continue to answer questions i certainly don't get to all of them but we tried to get to most all of the ones that were frequently ask episode for of the podcast i am going to get into shift work jet lag and age dependent changes in sleeping and wakefulness and cognition for those of you with kids for those you that are kids for those of you with older relatives or who might be a older meaning on ayin you start to get into late sixty seventies and eighties as when there some marked a biological shifts in temperature regulation and things that relate to sleep and for those of you that travel we can talk about jet lag the shift work discussion might seem only relevant to those that work nights but actually that is not the case most people because of the way their interacting with devices a actually in a form of shift work now where the days are certainly not nine to five call bankers hours and then the lights are out at nine and there sleep until five am some people have that sketduwill most people do not episode for we will go deeply into shift work jet lag age dependent changes an sleep alertness and cognition and i will touch back on a few of your questions but do not think that if your question was it answer during these office hours that we will not get to it i absolutely will at some point in addition to that several of you have graciously asked how you can help support the podcast and we very much appreciate that you can support the podcast by liking it on you too by subscribing on you to by recommending the out videos to others as well as subscribing and downloading the podcast on apple where you can also leave a review and on modify ere all three if you you can also help us by supporting our sponsor check out some o the sponsor lengths that were described at the beginning of the episode and in general recommending the podcast to people that in that you think would benefit from the information would be terrific and as mentioned the beginning of to day's episode we are now partnered with momentous supplements because they make single ingredient formulations that are the absolute highest quality end ship international if you go to live momentoustock calm slash supermen you will find many of the supplements that have been discussed on various episodes of the hubrouman lad podcast and you will find various protocols related to those supplements as always i will be continuing to post on histogram you can expect another podcast episode out next money about the topics that we been discussing this month and above all thank you for your interest

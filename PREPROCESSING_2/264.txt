dare easy china goes this medical life i or a glass quick whantin't everybody's listening to this pocks version of a show there some words that we have beeped you do not hear that maybe wing with kids you can get a beeps version at our website this can lived out or caught a comfy what one of our producers has been reporting this story it is goby the whole hour to day it is a really good one you she's when vision started reading about the men in hollywood and the media and their sexual transgressions she thought of the men in her past who had behaved police the man who assaulted her in her twenties and the others a few unwanted kisses over the i me truly unwonted drunk and geisha sort of pushing themselves all in ma and the useful array of jokes and comments in this an that she thought of them and she thought of don her partner of twenty three years and vision wondered don was a boy to dozens of women he ran internet a progressive newsmen sight an he was a flirt it was easy for me to imagine that down it miss unspoken signals of being a little too present a little too close a little too eager a little too en of those kinds of things she would seen it she would seen don's attention make women in comfortable at party s in restaurants and what would went helpings i would catch hurt and we would roll our eyes together a god man therewould be a sort of a bond there and it would got be ant on things would go on this is don flirting with some women in front of you yah he was a flirt yes i knew he was a flirt i also really knew that did not have anything to do with us that had to do with a need of need for attention did that feel did you feel embarrassed by it of course of course but he had pass quickly it was usually very easy to move things along then i could step in i could sit up between i could enow in gave her in conversation whatever right would you talk to don about it rarely because i didn't think i bee believed yen by him ai think he sort of laughwoud off an say o you just done gat it it's all en fun which i do yo think was his attitude i cha now was he south a couple meets ago when don told vision that busted news was writing a story about him vision was not surprised people who used to work for don at alternate were accusing don of sexually harassing them titian read the article a number of women detailed encounters at don unwanted advances in appropriate touching sending them explicit emails vision recognized don an some parts others thou they were describing a person shed never met mostly she had a particular experience reading that story that actually had nothing to do with don a memory came back to me what i was twenty eight that ism sure i had not thought about since it happens she was training to be a psychologists with a bunch of young trees at a clinic she is in the backroom where the staff took breaks and wrote notes the supervise er was a manes virtually all the supervisors at the time for in his forties oh maybe even early fifties vision was on the couch with a friends a women in her forties and a two of them watched as many of the young psychology in turns women vision's aged in the twenties crowded around the supervisor the surrounding him an and sort of hanging on his words and leaning in and it is just got that ah no offense his words wort that interestenewhait is they were fine but oh my god and he was eating it up vet you could just see he loved this that ism sitting a the back through an the cut and a with this other womanly she looks up the cup cakes vision lost it she loved this word it was perfected and you understood immediately that that was meant to refer to the women who were surrounding absolutely absolutely ah and it i was really proud that pros basically say you are not one of them you know i did not want to be one of them she is easily saying your cool and they are not exactly exactly we are grown up women they are not look i dead that is who i want to be that is were her mind went reading about her partner of two decades in the news the cut cakes vision felt full of regret she regretted her contempt for the cup cakes she regretted her acceptance that this was the way it would always be between men and women men would have power and women would have to deal with that what i thought interesting about this was vervivian learning the news about dons parked this memory that was not about don but in some ways it felt it had everything to do with don it explain something to her about who she is and how she is and choices and a sumption she is made in her life now i want to tell you about another group of people have been talking to the women who worked for on including women who say they were harassed by him i talked with them s and theca should me their don stories but they also did the same thing vision is they brought up specific experiences from their pass things that happened years ago because for them that stuff in the past feels related to their experiences that hoverthe less few months of me to stories i keep wanting to hear more from the women who were in these news reports their broader history not just the bad experience they had with one man at an office or on a move said but the other moments before the harassment because there is no me to moment that is actually separate from the rest of our lives to days show we are going to do that five women tell their stories titian and four women who worked for her partner don heaven over the course of many years at different times with he wide range of experiences we are going hear from each of them wanted a time about their experiences with dons and their experiences before don don resign from the job a few months ago and told me the word that oversees alternate insisted he could not talk on the record i can tell you some about his version of events that you will not be hearing from him is not a story about him it is about them these five women what these women are doing is what i think many of us have been doing lately they are doing it in ways i found braves invulnerable there real valuating who they are how they have related to men how they came to think of certain things as normal it is a reckoning not just for men for women it is this america wife am con jiffy want they with us h went this is probably evident by now but just to say we will talk about sex in this show not just its existence but some of the specifics and there are some moments of abuse take this as a heads up look at the women who worked for don at internet beginning with act one wanna the list started when wanna was eight years old the first on it was face from the eighteen liana got a postcard of him that year when her family went to universal studios she put a puffy red heart sticker on it took it with her during the day slept with it at night and i actually and am eight and i felt as in a die if i never met him i actually thought i would die i was i will i will cease to exist if i do not get to meet this person the next one made her cry he was twelve was she liana called her aunt rose from the basement distress she would written him letters dedicated a song to him on the radio and nothing no response ant rose was quick to deliver advice this is the way boys are they do not understand you they are dumb they do not get you your strong as maraud into end in and dot just is never in a makes enstimen ant rose explained it would be dean's job to make sense of things to men if she was gonna had relation ship i them it d never be easy and ad be on her to figure it out boys were too dumb to do it for themselves jaws dad was a minister via liked on to python and had a car and very few opinions he was incredibly sweet and he was very much whatever you want to do what what do you want do not promotivated on his own i was i come along with me when liana went away to college ja said all come too when she broke up with him his mam called german to ask if there was any way they could get back together chis worked at the dollar store in them all chis wanted more from his life dine was nineteen and got him a job on the other side of them all at a say goody she used to work at she wanted more for him too he was funny ad moody and he was the first person liana had sex with mark wanted a job in film or ten but nobody wanted to give him film or ten jobs it was his idea to move to new york and once they were there liana got a job first as a bookkeeper mark got no job she called his friends his friends friends and found mark and item job which he hated she found him another job at a magazine he worked there for the next ten years liana moved out three weeks before nine element there was the german the as daily with the burger join men seemed to want wives and dine did not want o be wife men else seemed to want her but had no thoughts about what else that might look try do not get you german would say on the phone you have to show them how to be with you direct war was starting and was the presidential race donna volunteered for the toward dine campaign jihad a rally in new york before her twenty eighth birthday the while she was at the rally ah the sky comes up to me and he is got a reporter's pad and he said hey after he is done talking an know can i talk to you and i said sure and he said your volunteer said ya and we talked for really long time and i actually got to an argument with him ism about deniscasinich he was pro misunderstood but come on that got could never win and then he said well i can have your emeladress all we'll send hug the article when it is done and i was sure you know when you writing for whatever he was own the executive editor of internet don he son alternate was not a major publication but liana knew it she read it all the time the next day don enter his article very pro dean and a personal note to her see how much you influenced me already and is well that is cool i just convinced editor guy that is all i was that is really cool what made your change your mind it started up this male conversation he asked about her wat she hoping to get into politics what was her job did she it what else did she want do it seemed really kind in a little bit flirtatious but i was fine with that i was i liked having this superinteresting compelling man interested in me don lived in californium but had an apartment in new york for work liana could not quite guess his age she thought maybe mid forties he was fifty six he would becoming out to new york again did she want to get dinner a kind of figured it as a at and i did feel flirtatious with him i did feel who is fen it was fun he walked her home they talked about the party she was planting for her twentieth birthday where she should have it they made out outside her apartment in the next day don asked her out again dinner and this time back to his apartment they were making out got needed and when she felt him push inside her liana was startled it was abrupt and he was not wearing a condemn in duenna's experience some one always went and got the condom that had never happened before she felt slow she wasfloating in a silent conversation with herself ah to should i say something ah the get's pay i mean i do not really want a stoppings he is older she thought was that are not getting around be nice to him your own birth control you are not getting expert end right now you are having a good time you are fine right it last just do this it was new and adventurous and that who liana wanted to be plus she felt powerful in that moment this is something the am bestowing upon him this useful gift this useful body or something i like i did feel that way and kid of it was doing him a favor and he seemed very grateful and and it'd not have that curies before with twenty five old why no as it turns out a different real different i definitely felt this was o had thing for him ah she thought about the condemn thing again on the way home duenna's story about don that he was a good guy a grown up self actualized man who as taken by her was also a story about herself she was powerful interesting could change his mind on important issues the fact that he never even thought to ask about protection it just did not make sense and i my default was to trust that it was going to okay it did not make sense to me and i made sense of it and that carried through the entire relation don sorta giving her work he wanted her to help manage a big project for alternate liana said yes don thought she was a poor fit for her corporate jab she agreed when he was in town they get dinner spend the night or week and which she loved and then he would leave which she has loved don did not need things from her as her other bay friends had it was the opposite he set things up for her he had an apartment for her to crash and he had contact she should meet he bought her her first mack blacktop he helped to quit smoking dinner was on him and he did at all without demanding she would be a wife it was seven months later that wanna learned don had a wife a partner actually a distinction without a difference as far as liana was concerned since don explained that this was a woman he would been with for years vision you heard from earlier they owner a house together and she did not know about liana she says it was one of their first fights believe you lied to me and hews i did not lie to i n ever lied to you an i was a lying by of motion is still lying and he was you knew and it'll never forget this word he said you you have been colluding with me all along and i was i do not think but she went back to old meals to reference is don would make to his domestic situation maybe she had wanted to anal she stopped sleeping with him she kept working for him by now there working on a book together that meant seeing him and when she saw him she would inevitably sleep with him again she liked him their conversations their connection he wasn't throne by me in a way that felt other men had been he was not he just was not afraid of me he saw her as she wanted to be seen she seed in the secret affair ignored his daily phone calls home to vision liana want end more time with don more contact as he did with her he could be annoying about it she started a folder called his where are you meals he did not lack of contact were the wrong kind of contact he would say why did you meal me about personal stuff there is a work in to in here i need to know what is happening i need to know where things are i need to know what were working on an i one o i said in the workmen why is not there anything emotional here do not you love me i guess you do not care about me ye would send these supervicti me eels that was also the point where he started talking to me more about about the staff and his frustrations at work in his i soft want to do all this anywhere but everyone is that worse for me is incompetent that i have to be in there all the time doing all these things for them by now liana had met a lot of don staff he would starteflying her out to californium as a consultant for alternate she would see him in his office he was just a very demanding pass just she yelling at people why cannot you get this right in what is wrong with you liana tried to make sense of this behavior he was angry and insecure this was not the easy going confident man she would signed up for she wanted to be supportive the way he would been supportive of her but this felt all new to her if jehad been to an event together he would watch how much i was drinking and would accuse me later of drinking too much from being too tired ism to one have sects with him and starting a fight about that whup you mean why not why you tired i had a really a is when you knew you were seeing me to night why did you have a o it why did you do much i well when i was working for ye and too you known i would defend myself and then he would get really a septic and red faced eyebolt sing this popping and he was scary tit when he was angry liana started giving in to sects not i do not feel it by love you sects this was sex to end a fight having sex could shut down the behavior that was not making sense the parts that did not fit in to dean's story of a powerful woman who was having adventures with a man who was not challenged by her power tat too the dinner fanatic had just started at alternate she was still getting away of the land she was bright ambitious ready for her chance and here it was the staff was friendly the boy don was too sometimes don was very very mercurial very very moody some times it would be compliments in praise other times it would just you would be furious about the pettiest thing but she generally escaped his anger initial learned early how to anticipate his moods keep it professional she kept her distance a couplemonths in the whole alternate staff got together for some meetings every one came don flew a couple people out from new york including a consultant for alternate named liana initial did not know liana really she seemed nice after the meetings they all went out to dinner and initial saw that liana was sitting next to don but made nothing of that it was initials colleague aura who noticed at first here is aura and during that dinner i i glanced over an notice that she was cutting up the meat on don's plate his stake or something and i was just what i was just lie what as happening this s this is strange to me cutting his meat she was leaning over his plate me yet they were sitting right next to each other in a tight is he big table but a crowded restaurant they were sitting very close together and she was just leaning over it was her plate but ameba's not normal yet just not normal it is just why why would he need that why would she need to do that why was he letting her do that did he asked her to do it i do not know you even dow do was something about it that was just very profoundly i disturbing oh was weird was she is cutting his meat for him initial eventually noticed it too and she could not figure out what is up with this woman i just do not understand this dynamic the manual it'd constructed on how to navigate n dead with ton i was just flipping through all the page to no no no no what no i have no died for this u were to place this behavior aura could not place it either here is really no rationalization i could think of no possible reason for that to be a thing happening wright that that moment the made sad be in their sleeping together but it still did not make sent after that dinner aura and initial left and never mentioned it the intake to each other about it we any one else in the office initial says it just did not feel fun office gossip i felt something she did not want anything to do with she did not know anything about the woman sitting in that chair next to don but anima had always known she did not want to be in that chair iced three initial most other girls quite being friends with boys earlier but initial was thirteen and she still liked her friends that summer she hung out wit the same boy she always had in the same places the kitchen her friends basement playroom or would all go o the pool together and i had this tide eyed bathing so this one piece and you most mother friends were wearing bekeenis but was no ism good at the snackbar they would get pobsicls they are always be talk about the seen at the pool i talking about different girls hey would occasionally be part of conversation i think they probably raided in when i was around but there would occasionally comments and they were they they had named some one the hypnotizer there is this title for some woman it would have been nothing if it was the other girls they talked about a passing thing but this one persisted for weeks it got to a point a recall were they talked about enough that as i oh who is she i want to be onion on it was sore to me and they ere all critic about it the o the hypnotizer the hypnotizer oh she is here ear did you we the hypnotizer a and i cannot morris found out but eventually found at it was me it was the first time fanatic had the feeling there was her and there was some one else she had not known was there a first on who looked good to these boys her friends i guess a part of me was pleased by that but the more prevalent feeling was whiplash they were talking about me in front of me is there was the me that was present in there interacting with them and then there was just other separate objectified body it just feels this whole other person enters the room another person who has you yet ah fuller i guess o fundamentally give i felt the same but suddenly i had to reckoned with the fact that i did not look the same to other people it was obvious to fanatic how to reckon with that she needed to crush that other person she did not wont to wear the tied bating suit ever again she slouched she were baggy clothes it was not a decision or anything it was just instinct she watch the girls in bichinies that summer considered if they somehow had the of polite instinct or maybe they had made a decision to actively try to merge the two girls the one with breasts and the one from before it really seemed easy for some of them they welcomed it and a part of you wishes that i could do that he sort of own it in you use it a power and and it just never struck me as a power it does it feels a false power it feels if if that is somehow getting me a mention it could turn that is not a safe kind of power to raff gat by the time again met don she would not have been able to say if wearing loose clothing was her fashion sense or strategy she was twenty three years old she would been guarding against that separate person the hypnotizer for a decade by that point alternate was acacia's first real job the first time she had a desk that was hers the first time she learned a male colleague was getting paid more than her for the same work the first time she asked for a raise from her boss don which did not go how fanatic expected yes i build this showcase and i get in there and ism nervous i how my opening fore where ism just have have been doing action why and the quality the work have been doing even wee can really hard ah and i make you known in it it it is it is hard to survive in the city on such a low salary he just latched on to that me can clean an hips o you having trouble pain rent and i were that specifically cause it was my rent was oddly personal and unnecessary and out of a field and i was completely disarmed ah i did not know how to respond i think i just sort of stuttardand was no it is not that he was not offering to pay her rent directly just did she need a salary increase to help pay her rent which anemia did not want a talk about i do not remember whether i said know ism not having trouble pain get i think i tried to avoid answering that because i did not want i felt that was none of his business but when i tried to shift the conversation back to this about being compensated i do not remember if he got angry angry but he was definitely visibly displeased and a he he did not want to give me a race instead he offered her a title change wait but had you what would have happened had you said ye i am having trouble paying my rent he would have you would have won would wound mean won what have want a little a little corner of of more power over me we but it would he have paid it would you have hardly money probably would have so you would have for you would have gotten more money no i would have lost initial felt don was not talking to her but to the hypnotizer that he did not want to engage her as a professional discussing her compensation but as an attractive young woman struggling with her rent he did not want to be a boy paying for her work but as saviour paying for her life initial did not want that can a help maybe's can o petty butts you were not in a win you do not get to have this she one but she did not get ha rase act for the cliff the summer venitia's first year at alternate don left for several weeks of sabbatical a friend had offered don the use of his vacation house in big sir californium he had it out and wrote liana asking her to join him it is the cliff of the universe he wrote what some one calls the greatest meeting of land and see liana wrote back bring me soon please don flew her out picked here up from the air port the drove to the house together a we went to bed and started fooling around and ah he stops and he says we probably should not have sex and i said how come don said he had an as t i a sexually transmitted infection he would tad it for a long time had not had symptoms in years and i was just started i actually got dizzied hold up what wait we have been having see without condos for two years and now we were telling me that you and he was s not a bi deal have had it since i was sixteen and i was it is definitely a big fucking deal and i got really angry i cannot believe you would risk my health this way and that about this is really fucked up and he was why are you getting but about this his is no i a deal i was yes it most certain this is not as yet and his cannot understand why i am upset at all eventually done did seem to get that dine was upset and began to comfort her she calmed down wanted to go to sleep he am started wanted o fool around again and n to a this you rat now the soft feels and he was what widow of jersey an whatever and then he was we can have antheses and i was blank blank no she did not want to do that and he we were naked and bed he was spooning me and he made a move he was going to penetrate me and i jumped up and yelped what the for and i was what are you doing and he was wee me what i mi doing just to know i one to be with you won am and i was your starting pressure me and it is starting to make me really a comfortable this is messed up and he flipped out he stood up and hates started screaming at me he was how can you say that how can you say that pressuring you i am the most feminist man when it and that is locked up he swear screaming at me the eyes holding of but screaming i am the most heinous man yes and then he the bedroom was sort of right on the other side of the kitchen and he goes in the kitchen and just start slamming stuff and throwing stuff and ism just hearing shut smashing in the other room and i am naked in some dude's bed in fucking big sir i do not know how to get out s and eventually just stopped i just sat there the whole time i didn't know you are an you were in the bed yet i just say to the bed he came back eventually and suit with his back to me which was his cultholder move and i just laid there thinking i do not know what is going to happen next because i i really did not want to challenge him i just had to start making sense of everything around me and being okay with everything if you're not going to challenge him or talk to him et then how are you going to make senseshut this out do not thing about this again and do whatever you can did not make it happen again liana would manage manage her feelings his temper managed them away from explosive moments this is what it meant to be close to some one managing a relationship was a role liana had practicing he made sense to her i have been told my whole life that i was and have difficult relationships with men that not none of this was going be easy that they warned me that this was how my relationships were going to be they were going to be very difficult in challenging and this was oke that was how was going be for me i took three years for liana to break up with don after that she was not angry when she did just tired and sad she told him she loved him but she could not keep doing this he was not angry either she thought he would be but he was gentle he said he knew the day would come they both cried after that she would still run in to him a professional or social events they were friendly a few years after they broke up liana went to a protest up town and my friends were staging part of the protest or i went to to be supportive and i ran into dawn there and he was well this is some that we are just kind of chid chatting i had not seen him in a while and whatever whatever and were kind of walking along with a protest and talking to different people there was a young woman walking near by with a reporter's note pad she was looking around and quickly scribbling notes and i actually watched tie i felt watching the terminal a little bit he just looked and a zero in on her and just belied over to her and said who he writing for and she is oh i miss seven's and his you do not have a place for this article yet it'll give you a place for you went pitch me and she was you who are you and he introduces himself as all raters a go would be greatest for alternate he really just came out of nowhere this is christen christen was a determined twenty one year old who bought the same breakfast sandwich from the same came every day because she knew what she liked and she had no need for wasting time christen had never actually heard of alternate but she knew she wanted to be reporter and this had a business card and she did not i was a vernal as om student undergrad at and why you don told her to send him her article and if it was good he would publish it christen said she definitely would liana was off to the side watching and i got mad because it just seemed gross and i heard that tone of voice and i had remembered how he had said things that to me it'll give you a dot it'll help you it'll support you and i got angry i just looked it woes i can f an believe you and he is what and i was law tit her ism geindone the story they had created together had just been obliterated they were not to creators this was his story liana was a set piece ye it made me sick t his i was not that special an seeing her kind of brightness and enthusiasm you someone was to give me an opportunity cool i was angry angry ah got liana left went home christen went home too she wrote and rewrote her article until it was too in the morning and she knew she had to get it off to done and i was excited yet i thought out what this is a crazy on me know chance incident and maybe this all be good and turned into something and it it did turn in to something coming up the story starts over but it is going to go differently next time that is in a minute from chico public radio when our program continues it is this america life am connajoffee want to days show five women we wanted to take one of the met stories were you hereabout encounters women have with men who abused their power in the work place and expand that to look at the lives of the women before that encounter we are telling the story of several women who worked for the same person down haven at alternate over the course of thirteen years we met liana amanita and we just met christen the student at anoa you christen is going to come back you need to meet some one else first act five wanna gonna was asked to have an opinion about anima hell it was nineteen ninety one and she was in the third great her opinion was that it was wrong because she knew that was the opinion she was supposed to have the opinion tana actually had was not when she imagined the adults were asking for i member thinking that it was not that big god deal but i think that my natural instant an me again i was a child was maybe people were going breaking how li bit too much maybe i will not should be a little bit more chill by tenth greed she was stronger in her conviction she knew about sex and she knew about feminism and she believed that if monicaluinsky wanted to have sex with some one or below them or whatever actually happened in the oval office that was her choice men had been allowed to follow their bliss forever they went a little too far but that had been corrected and now tana could see things had swung too far in the other direction oh nobody can a sex any more that is terrible that was the impression i got i just in vision the you us work place as a bunch of sure crowded fun eating each a people takin you to jail if you said some one looked nice one of her first basses was eff he ran a ship in town tons had juststart a college but it was summer she spent most of her days at the chap ah man he would always tell me these awful things about his wife where he would say she beautiful when she walks down a restaurant all men i plash to check her out but ism sick of her am one got to dinner can i get you salt show know your tiny can a grab your ways he woefully tried to physically group me a lot it was irritating but tons tried really hard not to show it because eff was middle aged miserable she would heard his wife kicked him out a coworker said he found eff in the shop one morning waking up surrounded by beer bottles he made tons uncomfortable but he was pitiful that it felt unreasonable to attach any value to her discomfort when her friend at work he guy her age told her eff always talks about you it is a really creepy and he goes eff always talks to me about how he just wants to put his hat head between your breasts and just go back the motor body sound in the says that that ell sick sitting me that is the safest thing that is war twelve year old would say this the grown ask man how could he say that hitters from her being growstout eff denies all of this by the way tons did tell her parents though it took her a while there protected she is worried they make her quit and then they were driving one day her mam her dad tons in the back seat that was women tot have some a tally on sora dramatic about it and he like what it would happen mud taking deep breath and saying have been actually her last and the got a laugh in my face nor what told yo expect our night year old woman of corner being sexually harassed i thought oh that is just the thing that happens that i can except everywhere in a work w tons worked a lot of different jabs and got a lot of education college graduates will but she'd not open a path to a graduate school jab but a job at a whole foods that is when her roommate told her she knew an editor of a political news sad but tons be interested i cannot even imagine a world in which i would go from work at a whole foods to working journalism she was jewel how an interview with this guide on her way out the door to me don her roommate said if you get that jab you will definitely be sexually harass that is con us that well that is the way this the interview went well which felt great to tons because she was used to bombing interviews she was shy was raining when she and don walked out of the building he offered her a red she said no it'll take the train then no out it'll give your it all give you right an he cot insisted on it an do remember we now i got his car and i that this is silly and even me fund me about this years later where i said i really want the job i would even do i for free ah until i prove myself that i can do it in insight go one a like slap bis the no heathy due twenty five youarlds elf fortunately i did have the opportune o screw myself over that way because don brush that idea as ridiculous in the interview don suggested tana might start editing a section at alternate they recently created about sex it did not seem totally out of nowhere that toward the end of the ride he sort of on a casually put his hand on my knee and said something i hear you and your room made pretty while the crazy sex lives i think i said something godlike precrazy or something that id just on some level i very sassily did nothing and did you feel bad neutral just whatever it felt bad but also was ecstatic because i felt a had a really shot to the job she called her friend to thank her she said as you warned me he got a little actually harass but ism excited i think i got it she did and from the beginning tons understood that her attractiveness to don meant she would be seen rather than ignored tons was seen by don all the time he'd take pictures of her sometimes when she was not looking and send them to her he was generous with his attention and controlling usually at the same time there is no way to tease the to apart and she accepted them both he appreciated her legs which he told her he did not seem to love her personality i remember once we were at when she was tons would you have to say you cannot even talk and i was really six who con e coughed a little bit s i had the flue r something and i remember he in front of every one fate caught yes o all you do as air cough that is all you ever doe that the only thing you can ever even say at a party don robbed tuna's shoulders and asked if she wanted another drink when she said no he grabbed tank's wrist twisted her arm and pushed her into a table he to be physically separated from her he apologized later and she forgave him easily don was old to her perky but again sort of pathetic i theft can appropriate to read him as anything else i remember there was one woman in the office who started freaking out and crying because don told her that the color of her shirt looked nice on her in my reaction was alright everyone i son's being hysterical here it's nice color our chilledtifuck out was my in her that there is another woman who was really fought actually when she found the porn print it out in the prince she as that now we are all a giggling about because we all knew who it was a obvious and she sent this hilarious male to all of editorial that was something to the effect of whoever decided to print up porn and the office pec sustain from we who did printout the point it was don obviously one of tank's coworkers another young woman quit because of don's bullying like ravelled fit is i can handle that bulling in the sexual harass she could it did you feel canny proud of that yes i did i can take it tana was the cool girl who could take it she was comfortable in that rule it gave her more power professionally to have the attention of the most powerful person in the office even if it meant accepting the attention that was not professional when don kept telinghary wanted to buy her a black cocktail dress he thought would look great on her body i just ought it was really a kind of sad or bitter sweet or mommy pathetic he that i needed for him to buy me this dress when i could have justbought it myself and midway through that indignant that tana felt guilty don wanted to be generous to be a wealthy charming man who could give her beautiful things this was not the way she saw him which made her feel bad for him and then actually did and e buying it n this is where i wonder was i not clear enough about setting out boundaries i bought the dress i told him o ya guess what i bought this dress t have ninety dollars don seemed to pleased but then she did not the dress she the way it fit her which she told him ad hews o give it to me ism going to give it to my girl friend it all look better on her because do two years of yoga she has curves and muscles that are in separate places than you do won the crazy it that is pretty crazy i when you say this is where i feel confused about what is not they feel confused about if i did not sat clear enough boundaries to more clearly communicate that this exchanged met me uncomfortable that is what you are suppose d to do you know you say no that first time don drove her home and put his hand on her knee tea did not say now instead she entered into an unspoken agreement between cool girl and flirty boss he would look after her career and he flirt with her while he was doing it the rules were cleared a tana you do not say no saying no would destroy the agreement from which both parties have something to gain you do not ask why d you went a buy me this dress you do not say please do not rub my back or please stop taking pictures of me you do not reply when h e says by male what he wants for his birthday sex with a mysterious blond women and then adds or you could just put on a was when don asked tons to his new york apartment for meetings she followed the agreement she said nothing there was no office in new york it was easy to pretend this was appropriate one night they met they talked about work and then don wanted to keep hanging out he was getting hostile and we were drinking and he was holden just one second when we got wit for to get to come out wat comes back out runs back out to the table with a a paper bag filled with photographs and he says i know these are photos from my path whee sorts showing the all these old photographs from the seventies eighties and there like basically almost exclusively s very conventionally beautiful blond women we was this was my coal friend at this point this was my excel from at this point was art cool lot of blonds on what why you showing me this stout and then he gets the a photo then he says and this is an artistic photograph of my penis and he hands me this photo and it is a black and who photograph of an erect penis i just ted it casually was conga look out i and handed back to him i captain barbell to show me picture of his dick tit as li yet you did this did seem a violation of the agreement i mean it was an artistic picture was black and whit it was from the seventies i mean i daffily did not say hey what's love to see right now a picture of erect penis from the seventy was definitely not the most appropriate thing to do to a female subordinate right right yes right thehadtims very true i are you still doubting if that was appropriate or not it was obviously an appropriate i doubly did enjoy the experience i told a million people about a contemporaneously has guess whose dick i just saw against my well rite out but also we were in his apartment as late at night we were drinking it just seems e sixty something your old man who in charge of twenty five different people she just cone him know that you do not show i young female subordinate a picture of your penis events it is from the seventies even if it is late at night and even if she does not say hey this is wrong there are certain standard of behavior that seem these should be obvious to everyone but it seemed they were not obvious to don don seemed to think it was appropriate to show her that picture tomb thought maybe there was no unspoken agreement between them maybe the agreement and the boundaries of that agreement were something tons imagined on her own in the beginning as a new imply with no experience tuna's power was fer attractiveness to don she tried to use that to her advantage it was the same power that a data did not want to use when she asked don for a was the power of the hypnotizer tons engaged fanatic did not it cost them both in different ways new people came in to alternate and tons trained a at of them many of them were young women and one of them came to tana and said we have got it do something about don't behavior and i said a kitting you are not going to change anything i do not this it is a good idea i cannot do this tons felt for this women but she did not understand her and why she thought any one would care about this she said this is not news that this happens it was ye died what you expects yet you were your parents in the car that day ray the young woman was christen the an why you student who don spotted at the protest terminator while tana watched now christen was full of urgency and she was ready to fight act six christen christen was thirteen and she got a note wat she never actually saw the note even though it was apparently written to her it was intercepted by a teacher but she knew what it said because every one in school new it was from the boys look cross team dear christen you have nice boobs you should use them christen remembers how absurd it seemed and laughing with her friends at the note and the boys you've your boobs we were joking about better yo put better put him to you the boys across tea needs em what are they went to do with em how can boys how could you use my boobs on on the lacrassteam it was just stupid one of the boys who signed the note was christens boy friend but the she never talked about it because they never talked because they were in seventh grate and that is what it meant to be boy from a girl friend the guidance counter came for christen in the middle of class they walked to her office and she asked christen what she thought of the note and i was o know i think they are just being stupid boys and she was your victim of sexual harassment and i i just remember being feeling really were that she said that to made because it sounded serious and i just i just just cannot we just let it go one of these guides as you are boy friend what does he think that this is cut and i was i do not know he i do not even know hit he is an idiot he is not going to be my boy friend any more and then i felt she was angry with me because i wasn't freaking out about this latter but that is how i fell you were not performing victim of sexual hryesyet i was just performing child in a room ism twelve and you are non a dull talking about my body and boys and a someone comfortable i remember i even zipped my hood u really to real tight hallway to the top cause i thought that she would make a comment about my boob shelling er something it is not christen could not imagine some girl being upset by that note she could and she could imagine some girl might enjoy that note but she was the girl she owned the boobs they were talking about that every one was now talking about at a one w and then there was again thing in the auditorium an this girl who i did not know at all tat dow backs to me and was a heart about the note our to q and all that kind of shit was just making me uncomfortable i was just gam fine i did not care what i remember caring about well the guidance counter for not just letting it be a stupidkid thing and making it into at an attempted rape or something is that hotel it is a bit it just felt they wanted me to cry and and act it was the worst that ever happened me and i was violated when christen was raped a few years later it took her a while to use that word he took advantage of me is what christian said at first when that did not feel right she said he is an asshole but that did not seem right either she would no word to somewise the experience some thing that i did not that was wrong but it was not what i imagine drape would be and it was not as gay as i thought that it would be she was at her friend's house for a party it was late people were going to sleep she climbed up to the top of a bunk bed to get away from an older guy who was creeping her out prison was drunk she remembers her face felt numb she remembers hearing some one binging on the door which she leader found out he had locked before he climbed up into the bunk bed and took her clothes off she said no but he had sects with her anyway sex that did not feel the raihtword either christen noticed her friends doing the same thing describing the experiences with boys in different tones in different arrangements and then there was the friend who would not say anything at all about what happened except she was upset and did one a talk about it and eventually she did explain he said cam i just put it in you for a second he friends had no he did anyway that is when christen said she felt she had not understanding to share all those times hence were mad at those boys because of what they did to us we were mad because they raped there's several of my friends where it touch us a really long time to put the word to it when she added them up all the experiences christen felt boys were aiming their behavior it would come in just under the line of something that had a name they're playing a game to see what they can get away with is that is what i kind of realize from it the the way that a guy is going to screen over most likely is not going to be he is on a bayou in an alley it is going to be something that people might doubt and it is not going to look the worst examples of things or the most clear cut and it is intentional and thaws why it is carry they tell the actually i think maybe they do not y they do not believe that what they did was wrong because it does not look what they consider rape stamens for you rape the word was congruent with the way she felt about it that she decided was what mattered and i think ma be maybe after that i was just ready i do notknow i i was not waiting any more to call something what it was four years later christen meant don at a protest graduated from college and accepted a davit all to it she was twenty one alter puts youngest employ done loved to tell the story of how they met how he would found her on the sidewalk yet he he liked very much that he had discovered me i deftly got the see that he liked feeling he was doing me this huge favor and i was his prodigal or something and then it evolved from oh i found her on the sidewalk light was this cute thing too do not you dare publish anywhere else and the around of control that i realized he had over me was up was concerning early when done invited her to meet at his apartment christen did not think as tin a had well there is no new york office that makes a certain him in a sense christen thought i know what this is i know why he wants me here i know why he is ordering so she and offering me weed and repeatedly asking me if i his music and he wanted me to he that i was young and thought i was cool he was hanging out this young person who was having a good time with him and i think a lot of the shameless way he would look at her talk about my body was away for him to a kind of force me to see him as a sexual being ism not a sixty something your old man with no sexuality and if you think ism going ta prove to you that ism not by forcing you to realize that i do have i do have sexual thoughts and urges and and also there about you a friend said to me recently relating a different incident she said forcing some one to be part of your boner against their will it is just a smarter way of forcing some one i thought about christen when she said that how alert christen was to a violation that was not definitely over the line christen found it alarming how lad back don was how he behaved as if their interactions were completely normal one day she was to meet with him in a coffee shop dawn and some other colleagues christen worked in don was already there i think i had pretty much just sat down and he was on his computer you knows real casual oh i i saw some one on the inner nag she looked just you hem me show you when he is picking his tine pulling up this picture and i o god what a what s what as good as he going to show me and he pulls up just a picture of a completely make id woman a porn star o something was fake baton blond hair and i was that i cannot even imagine when look on my face must have been likely response was she looks nothing me christen stood up said mini gave a cigarette and i was oh yah cold o this you see every blond chick in the porn you watch for mines you have me great this behavior had a name sexual harassment christen did not doubt it i always knew wit was wrong it was not i ever a thought is this normal i i knew the now this is not normal and and is bat but having a name for this behavior did not some anything for christen it just made her angry because it iseemlike there was nothing she could do about it she had no previous experience no connections in the industry n she needed the job i ye always only vet know if i should say this i used to to talk about fan to sees of kidnapping him and torturing him and i forcing him to transfer money into my bank account and but i would just always joke about the things i would do to that man that would just make him feel uncomfortable and terrific i that is what i wanted to do more than anything christens revenge fan to see is very similar to the plot of the moving nine to five which christen has never seen because it came out in nineteen eighty before she was born all of which is to say this is an old story wrist is anger let i glad into her thoughts for for she remembers being at a conference and interviewing an older man guying his seventies about drug policy and at the end i said i was going to smoke a cigarette and he said you do not want get cancer in those boobs do you and i was just and got up and went outside and smoked a cigarette and told all the people off the conference an you believe at this dying a for man just did that to me it was the same thing i fell with then it was this older man he was just kind of ism going to force the fact that i have a sexuality on you tike ism going to force you to reckon with it by making you the object of my sexual desire lead her that day christen was walking with her alternate colleague can fall not don yawn yawn was at various points dons seconding command and we were walking down the sidewalk and he was on the ah he was on the last of me and traffic was on the other side of him and i told him what happened and he said oh it must that you must have taken it as a compliment kind of though right or something that and i just had this image of pushing him into the street that was vivid it almost freaked me out i was i came very close to maybe killing this person but that is how full of rage i was by that point i was just about to explode dial does remember christian telling him about this but does not recall responding in this way christen started talking she told the female coworker named laden about how don was treating her laden was of it older seemed together but she don't in what to do she did have one idea of some one who could help the woman laden actually just met at a book party the woman in her thirties who had worked with don in the past her name was liana laden asked the talk to wanna wanna remembers she started telling me about the experiences this new staffer was having with him this young woman wanna hadn't been with don for years at this point laden did not know they would ever been together but laden told wanna part of what hard about this is the new staffer is young and inexperience don went er when she was a student on the street at a protest i was you got to be fuckangating me i was fucking there i should have taken her by the wrist pulled her away with me and said do not i will find you another job you know and i felt such gilt over that wanna began circling through the moments all the choices she would made that she thought were just hers choices she assumed would only affect her and her relationship with don she thought specifically about a call she got years ago just two months after she would broken up with don it was a professional contact who said she wanted to ask liana about something serious and then the woman on the phone said that her organization had put on an event with internet and a young staff had just complained that don actually harassed her the woman on the phone said to liana you have worked with don dos that sound him wanna paused to consider it before answering i hae a lot of shame it a lot but my great shame was i i cannot pictured him doing something unwanted was what i said and i cut i defended him and it'd thin kind of him i tit i did not say i believe this person but was that was that true for you at the time that you could not imagine him doing that n ye but i there was a tiny part of me that wondered if that could be true and i just what a deal with it and nothing was ever done i that it never went further donna and christen went out for drinks liana listened crisis talked liana said she wanted to help in whatever way she could and liana prayed that crisis would not ask her what happen to you everything felt it would blow up everyone would know that i was complicit that i helped him how could people want to be friends with me after that how could people trust may professorial entreaties after knowing that about me how could what would my mob think there all go to think of a fraud that i i not till ted that ism not that these i dead are my own or something and i rule just have to to shrink away wanna helped connect christen with the layer the lawyer told christen it would be very hard to win a law suit and keep her job she as said she would pull need more evidence not to when christian thought to ask wanna she knew don had been harassing her too crisis does not remember tons saying this is not news that this happens she remembers tons being kind and thing she did not want o betrayed don he would given her a chance and a career when no one else would have she said she did not want do it and then what did you do i i just kit gave up chitin's apartment fretted and she got a pay out from her landlord when the money came in she quit alternate without ever using the words she believed to be true when i i when i laughed i did not say to him and living because you sexually harassed me and i hate you i was too affected by the idea that he was giving you a chance e that and it is true he did give us a chance that no one else did i mean but i guess i i thought li i i had paid my do and and it was not that the pay off was no longer there i seven vision four years after tana told christian that their experience was not news to any one suddenly it was news a reporter named quorrolewis at busted news reported a story about sexual harass men allegations at alternate she talked to christian and tana and wanna and she talked to other women you have not heard from here don denied most of the allegations in the bus feed story some he said were is characterized for instance he does not remember twisting tank's arm but did say he was rubbing her shoulders and stopped when he saw it made her uncomfortable he does not remember showing tana a photograph of his penis but says he does half such a photograph and some women may have seen it he said he often took friendly photos in the office and when he commented annals body it was out of concern that she was getting too skinny telephoto he showed christian he said was not a naked polestar but a clothed move star when i contacted don he said he told wanna about his relationship with vision his partner on their very first date and that his memory of their time at big sir is different from hers been that he did not respond to specific questions but asked that i include an apology from him in which he says along the way i strove but apparently failed to treat every one with the respect an consideration they deserved i regret causing harm and am reckoning with it some of the accusations against me are untrue but i deeply regret those that are i apologize to any one i offended and treated badly before the busted news story came out vision says don told her he needed to talk to her about something to prepare her vision told me she knew what it was me two stories coming for don she pictured how their conversation would go when don sat her down it was not what she would imagined he told her ten years ago he would hadn't affair with wanna o an you de you did not he had not told you about it before he had not told no this is all i am assimilating all of this in the pastmonth well yet i what case i me bi just sort of screamed you have know what to were do immediately you did oh god yeses wanted to understand why he did this she tried to remember what was happening in his life around that time and it was a lot moving his elderly parents trying to take responsibility for a sister who was ill and suffering a tactic break his own health ashes vision is a therapist and from don vision solicited details assembled details as a therapist does for myself me this was replaying thorough as for him this was just i have got to make sense of this somehow have got to a ism still working on that do not get me wrong he is limo two why do you have to make sense of it is what i do a who i am he feels the only way to be a person with a hisstoryththof feels coherent a person with the history that feels coherent with him your history him yes anal absolutely it is hard into great are you going to stay

wonderful partner with whom she shared a joyful life shared trips and friend an intellectual interests a partner who took loving care of her last year when vision was in limo therapy for brescancer to stay with him and to make her history coherent vivianis trying to figure out what she needs to know and how to resist asking about the things she does not need to know i wont i know about stupid

i tunes right after the game's after ten days of pure magic it is still the number one rated hippo song in america on i tunes but rap sonic is officially over and with tears in my eyes i have a big announcement to make tall the little home's we have been lifting me up since i began this journey it was an inspiring moment some of called it a musical supernova but now the time has come for me to

heart are i pee doctor drawl i know i know that have ben getting a lot of sad messages from people people who grew up with my music people whose lives were changed by the by the beats and by the flow but have decided to leave the industry too a young generation of truly great artists of truly great rap artist artist ice spice she of the chiming name have been informed reliably that ice spice is a human and that ice spice also has a bran new charting the song out no she is not our pass fact on the charts yet but we can only hope that for the sake of western civilization eventually she is widely appreciated by the masses in the way that shes richly deserves ice spice as a banned song out and ism the nature of this song is give think quite deep and requires a bit of explication and we have deconstructed the culture on this show before in fact twas probably my extraordinary rendition of was that legend eventually to my hippo start and then of course to my short lived but brilliant career in the industry and we have to deconstruct a little bit of the culture that i am now leaving is i od be ones i was been drawn into i in that week in that week where i was the top charting wrapper in america you i i have to say wen to the clubs sipping on some penny is wherein the bang my wife she was really ism get in toe lifestyle as well but ay again i have to leave it to the prose prose ice

charts is a song that is called to to to or bow bow bow f my baby dad i and a apparently is an older song young classic from our friend sex red she of the multiplastedy bouts and tum she apparently did ay rendition of this rap f my baby dad at a hospital after having her at is baby because nothing says lucky child quite you are pushed out a mom and you are immediately making sexual videos in which you say f the dad of your child that is that that that baby's going to live that is that is a happy life for that kid getting i well all ism just absolute cultural genius happening i cannot imagine why tom mac donate i rapes about the short comings of rap culture because it seems it is in it is doing well it seems durian sensitizing excellent behavior here these pictures are in sane by way she is literally in the hospital bed and a she is posing as out and touching herself in the hospital bed i got i got a say that the definition of sexy has radically changed in america if people find this attractive in anyway shay perform in any case here is some of the video she literally cost a music video from her hospital room after having a baby about f the baby dad good stuff happening here sh n nosfurging round dollars in the hospital room presumably in not come insurance i shes working on her hospital bed after having a baby points for durability i suppose i so there there is at there is a lot to say here one thing i will say is the do if this lady does not get to take a maternity leaving why does pop lo tacet get three months off for a pattern you leave ism confused about that i mean she is back to work if thin seconds and by work i mean tow e array work the this is this is solid stuff guys i know i understand that i had a place in the rap culture i understand that i was an inherently important part of hippo but i have to as i say i have to leave it to the prose the real an cementite on the step by the way is i think folks need understand do not we talk cover politics a lot on this show the number of people who are drawn in by pop culture is insane pop cultural engagement in america is it levels not even remotely charted by politics the number of people in america who watch politics is extraordinarily low it is really really really low in fact if you look at thou latestatistics with regard to for example news websites in political website's being visited the answer is that the numbers a way down waywayway down since the last election cycle and if you look at big political events for example the fifth republican primary debate that is to two point five million viewers drums competing town hall ad about four point three million viewers aggregate all of that in your talking seven million yours total and then if you ad in people on the other side of the orate politically engaged you are talking a maximum of fifteen to twenty million people who are politically engaged on anything a regular level and even those people are not engage the way that you probably are listening to the show listening every day the number of people who'll engage with content in job culture is much wider and much iced i speak as a charting artist as the number one rap artist in america as a hot one hundred number sixteen recipient on billboard are without any radio place i speak as a great artist of my of my gonna and let me tell you job cultural engagement is much more important in terms of how young people think and the values theater shape then actual baseline posit tha'swhat we spend time on it it is why we've under constructing the culture before and it is why it is sort of matters that garbage is being paraded every day by people a spice and sexy red as our culture gets dumber and dumber and stupider and stupider oka meanwhile on the political side of the isle the is a lot happening s i have to say that donate trumps take over of the republican party there's been some interesting things about it i the lot of his policy as president but one of the negative things about having a singular figure a top the political pile for any party is that there is a tendency to follow them to stupid places and to day i have to examples from president true example number one president trump came out yesterday and he suggested that conservatives go back to bine sunlight now you will recall that it was just last year that sunlight decided they were going to sponsor as a as a face of their brand telling lullaby a man who mocks womanhood by pretending to be a girl and they made a sunlight beericannallist and people the us at to show myfrand it wash they daily ware personalities uremic teverody on the right said okay will word not then by sunlight first all takes cornetist and then beyond that it actually is promoting values tat we do not t o great america brand sunlight not not and heifer bush which is now for own but the actual sunlight brand is a deeply america intertwine brand and they are sacrificing their brand which is basically blue collar people in favor of upper class train's politics and it is stupid and it is bad and is bad for the country and were not can doing but light any more an sunlight to get directly on the chin the sails went directly through the floor and they are they were in fact reduced to not the number one beer but the number two or number three beer cadelle actually overtook them for example hell mow president trump is calling for an end to the boy cot on sunlight which makes no sense if you have a successful bug if you successfully destroyed a large brands in order to make a political point you then do not destroyed the brand before they have actually apologized for the thing now sunlight is trying to make some sort of basso's to the other side of the isle to our side of the isle the conservative side by going in contracting with a data weight over at them manlike don't ism friends of data but the the attempt to for beat conservative love i hiring can up that does not make up for what you did in the first place when you spit in the fa are of all of your consumers well now dona trump its calling for an end to the boy cot he put out in a e a missive last night on truth social he said the sunlight ad was a mistake of epic proportions and for that a very big price was paid but achier bush is not a woke company achier bushes a great america brand that deserves a second chance what do you think perhaps instead we should be going after those companies that a looking to destroy america now why would he do that why what why what wouldtrive president trump one most vindictive voices in the history of america politics to suddenly inside that it is time for forgiveness for bud lightwell it could be the fact that apparently heels about five million dollars in anheiser bushstock it could also be the fact that a top republican lobbies for the company its hosting a fund razor for trump next mump with some tickets going at ten thousand dollars each maybe it is that don trump tuner has also previously defended anheizer bush saying the company donated mortar republicans than democrats and holp cave my carte is ever to assume ant control of the house now as my friend mat wall says this he most effective boycott brolly in the history of concerto politics why would you ended on the base of dona true jussessup he's a more on this in just one second first well

does for many america in their track reckon over the years it made a huge mistake in a pay ta large price i think it is time to move fort i am saying we should focus on the big picture agreeing with forty five the big picture is that fortyfive of courses president trump with the forty fifth president the big picture is nonagring with president true it is never been agree with president trump i truth president trump when president trump deserves to be agreed with and i disagree with president trump when he deserves to be disagreed with this would be one case where he deserves to be disagreed with there is another case where he deserved to be disagreed with and now as on robot homey my dance let me tell you the tragic story of mono money my dance who now goes by dona my dance the reason she goes by dona my dance this is not a to o is because dona money mcdaniel who is in fact related to it money of course she used to go by she issues his need she used to go by dona money mcdaniel and then it turned out that when she became aren't chair and dona trump was the leader of the republican party she dropped the round because trump hated money much because that is the and of obeisance that is demanded by many people who really love trump and trump himself is that you have to somehow drop actual parts of your name because he does not their uncle which is wild in that is wild it is just good jabberers of job and then turned out she to crappy job ronaromny my dance is historically the single worst are c chair of my lifetime the only possible exception being michael steel she is a real aren't chair truly a horrifyingly bad ante chair in fact her senior as aren't chair which began canary nineteenth twenty seventeen just preceded by rings previous when that up going into the administration briefly when she assumed office in twenty seventeen she assumed office with dona trump having a housemajority and a sent majority how as the state of play when she took office she then proceeded to lose the house in twenty eighteen and she proceeded to lose the house and the senate in twenty twenty twenty twenty one and then she proceeded to wildly under perform in the twenty twenty two election cycle and now the aren't is flavor the art has no money the bank she has sacrificed whatever principle she had including the political principle that the pretty should be involved in choosing candidates on the primary level who can win and then raising money for those candidates and then booking them to victory instead she easily defend that trump could have are rain of the place much that the arena any time there is a conflict inside the republican party between trump an any other candidate in the primaries not in the primaries with regard to the senate with regard to the house the aunty always coded with trump because my dance knew where her bread was buttered and unsurprisingly bunch of loss its huge string of losses foronoromym dance to the point where after the nonmember twenty twenty to elections the republicans by pulling bitter were supposed to clean up republicans were supposed to win a broad majority in twenty twenty two bought the aren't did not do its job the avenses is a vehicle for victory one of its jobs is to work with the senatorial republican campaign committee and the narc c the national republican campaign concongressional campaign committed and all the rest of these groups in order to select good primary candidates particularly i purple districts and purple states in order to loose them to victory the aren't completely abdicated the arrange insteadspent re spent a bunch of money on perks and flowers and nice dinner's and limos and then the twenty twenty two elections were a full skill disaster area n which the republicans not only did not regain the senate landed up retaking the house by a handful of votes and that handful of ones is small the republicans can no longer do literally anything in the house of representatives with out making serious concessions to democrats those all on out money my die in canary of twenty twenty three in the pear between nonmember twenty twenty two and canary twenty twenty three there is a serious suffer to oust on out money my dance in fact you will re call the right after the election in nonmember twenty twenty two i openly called on the show forth replacement of robot money my panel becauseyou do not get to lose this many times and still retain your job at any job if you if you fail over and over you fail once o we that is call life you fail twice o can make you need a serious corrected you fail three times now you are starting to look pretty bat you fail four times you should lose your job and she fell twenty eighteen twenty twenty twenty twenty one twenty twenty two she gelt four times four supper times just complete failure and now no money in the bank and the hominy of the party for good or ill is the person who basically put her in place donate trump in dosed her again to be come the araks chair over harmed killed who is a far more credible far more serious candidate full disclose your army dollar has acted as our lawyer in suing the federal government for example here at daily wire hardest is great there is some other people who have been talked about has rain tea her her be good now donate trump a couple whichsto go after having boosted my dance back into place just in time for the primaries where the ran see every time at proud put its them on the scale for tonal trump now that she ben the knee to trumpet every which way literally to money out of her name bent the ran see you trumps will at every possible point now trump is going full jowfre and cutting off her head now she is going to be out of a job is it again directly after she was in dosed by trump and one reelection as a inter chair now on out money my dance is is gone she is expected to leave according to the washington post quit ronaromney robot my dance is expected to leave her rob the spring after former president oral trump had increasingly grown write can of her leadership according to people familiar with the matter oh did he you mean after she in short that he got everything the he could possibly worth in twenty eighteen twenty twenty twenty twenty one twenty twenty two and twenty twenty three basically she did everything true her possibly wanted now he is defenistrating her said he can blame her for all the problems with the iron see despite the factual again he boosted her to that position he's for on this in just one second

sent you spall b a m b e dot tom am b dot tom typing ben shipper right now to get started again it is ism glad she is leaving shoon competent held hare bad job ye only point that ism making is that you should agree with donate trump when it is good to agree i agree with him about arsing ronarony my denial i also agreed about lasting her before she was even the a an t chair and i disagreed with dona trump when he was attempting to foist her into place the decision came as she visited marolaga and met with trump on money but the situation remain fluid according to people who spoke on the condition of unanimity the news of her departure was first reported by the you times which reported it was likely to a car after the south carina primary on february twenty fourth shows expected to servant twenty twenty firebug has considered leaving for months her relationship with trump soured over the re publican primary debates featuring his challengers this pass to fall trump wanted her to council them and shoe does she provided much felt to him i mean she really tit during the primaries if she didn't force him to sign any pledge thing he vote or the other candidates despite the fact that you wanted all the other candidates to pledge they vote for trump if in fact his on the nomination she made room for him at every possibileturn butt she would not just outright hand him the primaries and got pissed her and now he wants her out and now she is leaving the point in the matter is that if you wish for good policy to emerge from donate trump or any one else that does not mean listening to trump all the time it does not minis not in trump when h says and the budlike boy cot it doesn't meinlistn't in trumpwhen y tries to boost dona mac annual back to the agency chairmanship in canary of twenty twenty three he mean some times his right and sometimes he is wrong your independent human being andyou should have your own thoughts on matters and you should not just follow any politician or people m any one literally anyone blindly you should actually think about these things and then decide whether or not in meats with your principles oh meanwhile speaking of the consequence of having a very narrow house majority yesterday the house voted on impeaching athehon throne mayor's the secretary of home then security now too be fair to the republican congress people who voted against i teaching alehonder amorous know his crime is de eager was actually alleged e there are some members of the house who argued against donate trumps impeachment including my galliard of wisconsin is really the representative i know mike i make e ma galliard voted against i teaching mayor's why because he said less and i voted against donate trumps i peaches because no crime was alleged turn crime as ledge som also voting against impeachment now the least i would have voted for i percent if i were in the house and the reason i think it was good that people voted for i preachment is because the i preachment is obviously a political tool a impeachment has obviously become political tool trump was i peach twice without any serious high crime or mister meaner even being charged in the in the impeachment documents and now that that is what it is everybody's fair game because if the rules apply one way for democrats and another way for re publicans then there are no rules no double standards a if impeachment is a political tool all then should be political to all the way and then we can make a deal i go back datisko any where you only get impeach for actual impeachable offenses but until then you cross the line and we will treat it just a political remedy in any case the reason that the republicans could not get together a housemajority is because at their house majority with narrow that goes back to the twenty twenty to elections in which the intervention of the ran c and all trump and bad candidates ended up blowing the possibility of republican fifteen or twenty see housemajority and republicans ended up with a tiny slim tiny house majority and ten course gorge cantos was just t ousted by congress which left them with one fewer republican vote and the house ended a voting two sixteen to two fourteen against impeaching alahondro mayor's only four republicans voted in favor of keeping maracas or not impeaching ham the republicans who voted against the impeachment resolution said the media's conduct dis not rise to the level of impeachable offense the what tomiclintocks at to tomiclintuck by the way is a is a bordereau tomiclintocking californium he is not some sort of of for of esianimagrationaranything he just said the same thing that alegar said he said the impeachment articles failed to identified impeachable crime that marcs has committed democrats for accusing republicans of trying score political points which of course is true but that is exactly what they were doing when they impeached dona trump twice represent of kenbuck of colorado indicated another vote could take place once the house majority leader steeve scoleesh returns to work screes has ben working remotely as he under goes cancer treatment in the end probably various will be impeach they do have enough votes to dit but barely the democrats did wheel in people who are literally sick to try to get the vote to turn in favor of mayor's representative agree tried to vote on a second resolution targeting orcas but he backed off after receiving assurances from house leaders that the earlier afar proceeded to committee level and then who is actual wielding cause he was sick to vote against impeaching mayor's we get to more on this in just one second first our friends a ziprikroter conducted a recent survey they found the

publicans at i not mean just looks again republicans cannot count votes but we have known that for quite a while and in in yet another element of republican stupidity it turns out that banging your head against the wall does not and of being very good strategy they got ready come my earthy as i said at the time my earthy a hippo earthy my earthy knew how to count votes what is happening now nobody knows ha count votes and the deals ain't getting any better slow club for all the people who thought getting rid of coming my earthy s gan affix the problems in congress we butt in the end to america as we say watch politics this gradual little level or they care by how the impeachment vote goes ran no thrust get a general sense they get a sort of general gestalt of the election and then they vote accordingly and the general gust all right now that the border is i disasteraria and jobidon is the president and to republicans where not passing this bad border bill they are winning a political victory right now the me yore trying to turn this into republicans will not pass a border bill to give join the authority he needs but the border was considered a non problem by democrats and told this very moment suggest to follow the democrat logic for a moment the border is not a problem at all but if ye do not give job an extra power to shut down the boarder that is when the crisis emerges ism not need an explainer on that if the border is in crisis wish jobidon doing something about it he has the authority to do already as every one legally acknowledges jobidon however is trying to play the hand that he is dust himself again he could just shut the border and take the issue away from trump but he is afraid of ticking off that left going base and to now he is trying goblin publicans for all of this he says the border is not secure beaus of trump in his friends this this is not going to play at all in any way they perform this why he is thorite points behind trump on emigration every day were now remember toe me c peopleitenn now it the only reason the border is not secure is down true agar publican transit ism no that is not going to or if you really think the mama is keeping the boarder open that is wrong jobidon is the president of the united states then join wish suggesting the re publicans been to show some spine and pass the bill ism we all know what is going to happen if that happens if republicans pass the bill the border will remain largely open because join will make sure that it remains largely open and then he will claim that he is ben able to create a by part is in deal to create responsibility at the boarder and then he will border is left and say that he basically put one over on re publicans and whatever are the future border problem will be colone by the republicans that is the politics of this why mouthing democrats re to desperate pass this thing the reason the democrats are desperate pass this thing is because they see it is a political win here is job trying to force republicans and devoting for it is not going to happen now all in the cases o this you w move forward to the sent for why a simple reason don trump es dow cut ticks bad for him politically therefore he does not we not help to the fancy he is not for he would rather recognize his is he din actually all for the last twenty four hours he is done nothing no told but reach out the publicans in the house an a senate and threaten then o try to intimidate them to vote against this proposal and looks their cavy frankly they ow it to the america people to show some spine and do whit they know to be right i got to say the two problems of this nuder one is the argument the other is that i swear jo biding at this point he looks no joke sultan glover as water donofan at the end of india anyone in he holy grail he looks you drank from he chose poorly literally every video of him is a state of further physical in mental degradation he is degrading before our eyes every one can see it it is impossible not to see it i jobidon is admitting by the way the bill will actually allow people to enter the country more quickly well know what the real agenda is here here is present inviting admitting this yesterday the stilled disestablish new efficient an fair process for the governed to consider in a slum clam for those arriving at the border to day the process can take five to seven years as you all you he shoot the border get a braced to tickly come back when called five to seven basion i in country that is too long in stop ration with the new policies in this bill and the additional of four foulicen three hundred more a asylum officers who spend hours i might have with each emigrant to consider their claims a they core qualify will be able reduce that process to six months not five to seven years we again he is trying to reduce the time period between when you apply for refuge you status and when you are granted refuge you status his goal is get more people into the country not fewer people into the country the only thing that the bill does that is presumably good is it changes the definition of asylum in order to have a legitimate asylum claim you now not only have to claim the iuffeure go back your home country you have to have some sort of credible fear that you cannot such that you cannot relocate inside your home country or in any country thatyouhave pass through before but how do you establish that sort of thing my seriously you think that jo bison and his processing centers you loo come and the just cone to say that there is con to say i cannot move inside my own home country people are pursuing me how do you confirm that then they are going to say mexico is not accepting me in over to live there and the gangs are following me and there is no place i can go and then they s a new matrix words listen i got by border patrol agents some of them are in support of the bill thy think that it gives them him additional tools if they are allows you their job ut the i think there assuming that turbine's going to allow them to do their job and that is ant assumption as we say in the law not in evidence and meanwhile jobidon has tied all of these issues together he is tied his version the border bill together with you crane aid together with israel aid which is kind of amazing because he does not have to do that it demonstrates his failure of the power of the of the bully pulpit if jobidon actually had any level popularity he could probably force each of these shisshues through one at a time that's say that he wanted crane ad he rely forced that through he can make an argument to theamerican people he could say listen cranes can be overrun by russia if we do not give them the aid then vlanerpoutans can be standing in keyed by the end of the year wen they need the aid most of the at is him go toward paying our military contractors anyway be new to restock our supplies an all the rest he could say all that sort of stuff but he cannot his really really unpopular and he is trying to lump that together with a significantly more popular proposition which his aid to israel in fact he cannot yesterday and said he would not even sign off and an independent did to israel clean bill which is totally crazy he says he wants that he is the of who proposed it he saying he wants fourteen billion dollars in military aid to israel and ten billion dollars for the other side he wants ten billion dollars in called humanity dato gaze say called his compass and terror is hi jack a huge mum a huge amount of that and then use it for weaponry that is what he says he wants the republican to o cabin will give you fourteen bill for israel and no ten bill for gaze and no sixty bill for u crane and bines all veto that he has to tie everything together he has to turn it into a crapsandwich it is his only hope of passing his man priorities at this point we get to the situation in u crane in just one second first i need your attention have a major announcement markhor calenders the epic return of back stage after almost a year away filling the pendragon cycle jerry boring his back he is joined by awash candid owns michaelmuls andrclaven and of course me join us this tuesday seven am eastern sixes central as we go behind the scenes in beyond the headlines there is a lad happening and o can one is a minute watch the show live exclusively at dailywire plus tuesday night at seven am eastern sixes central are not on a want to missive and meanwhile the situation in new crane continues to be rather did best report suggests the cassia's going to mobilize another all out assault on u crane some time later in the year and as western support for u crane declines youcranians are very much in fear that reeve theoretically could be overrun according to you cranial media the crane in parliament has now pass the law proving a presidential decree to extend martial law and you crane for another ninety days from february fourteenth until mad thirteenth apparently this is basically a unanimous legislative act because of course the country is still in fact at war and all of this is again coming to a had notches because the united states is unlikely to grant sixty billion dollars and ages you crane based on the can voting constituency in the house of representatives but also because tucker carbon is now jet setting over to mascot to interview ladmarit pouted hurts tucker confirming that he is interviewing patent and here he was explaining why he is doing it warn moskowtan i were here to interview the present of russia lad in er patent will be doing that ton almost three years ago the bid administration illegally spied on our ten massages and table condense to their servants in the news media they did this order to stop a p den interview that we were planning last one for pretty certainly did exactly the shame thing once again but this time we came to mascot anyway we are not here because we love later were pretend we are here because we love the hated states ut we wat of german prosperous and free a the entire the entire case that he is making is that you are not getting the full information and that we needn't interview with pouted it'll get that that is all find and and i mean ism ism fined with anybody interviewing patent hell have loved interview patent good for tucker for getting the interview i will say that the only thing that is going to matter about this interview are the questions that he asks meaning that if he goes in and he basically just blows pouted to spout about notification efforts in you crane and about how you crane's actually a country that is filled with wild left liberals we are promoting leg b t k values but there also notes an that is why he is invading andthat is why he means to take out bloomer's lens or never that will not in fact be public service that will not in fact the information that is added to the information that people need to hear the the questions that need to be asked obvious there what are the affrays why are you holding a medical journalistslike am gerskevitch in jail why why is that a thing w tucker says in the video that nobody has as actually wanton interview put snot true a in a huge number of people have requested interviews with paten in the legs media putntjust has not granted any because he feels that the last media in the united states are very much opposed to him and there is truth to that i think for some pretty good reasons number one that vladmerpouten has sort of on a various history of having his political enemies yelled end or poison and or pushed off a buildings but in any case if tucker wont provide another said it is the conflict that we can all get morn fresh of be great but ring in a no exactly how that goes once the interview actually airs and i can a prejudge the interview i certainly of no problem with tucker interviewing lodger pouted i hope he does not do the same thing that he actually did with conga west when he had on cone on his show and proceeded to cut out all of the crazieskuctions of the interview with copying which he was outing even at the time wild tan smetacan a stuff in tucker cut id out and then put out the interview with cone and it may cone look he was a lot more saying than he actually was at that time no again and tucker's a supers mark my i think that he does care about the country and i with love to hear him ask some really solid questions of lamerputents ism not atonement will see how it goes i will say that the kremlin is expecting that they know how it goes according to d and why you z parson's trip is exciting a lot of people over at the kremlin on tuesday elecsay then indictor the former editor of ego moskovy radio station said as i understand tuckercrossin got what he wanted apparently a source close to the presidential administration told the mascot times that tucker's been expected here for a long time he is welcome here under scored the depth of parson's commitment to the russia cause state media programs pointed out that in america he is called out as a crater and strip is being compared to jane fondu's visit to be atom in nineteen seventy two now again the it is not jane fond unless he is actually a propaganda for the drumlin let see i soft want a are judge anything in lives not con free judge tuckers interview i know lot in the media are already doing that ism not going to do that until i see the questions that he asked is a mass of opportunity obviously o could it have an impact in theoretically opening eyes to the possibility of a future solutions shore could it also be a propaganda and real god in presume lass why paten is doing it apparently during an interview with the evening with vladimerit sol viol political scientist sergeant mheiev said quote a rewords about tucker since he is a popular figure is as if tucker dares to broadcast this interview in the united states first and foremost this will blow up their informational blockade from within he said that ta in interview of paten will have some interesting consequence is quit it will blow them up into pieces this is a the united states and then he said god willing there will b a civil war in the united states because of it now again i think that some wishful thinking on the part of a some russia propagandist but it is worth yo pointing out that the only thing that is important about an interview is the contents of the interview not just the faces of the people ware in the interview and by the way the united states does have a very strong interest in you crane not actually just becoming a russia protectorate as have said since the since near the giving of the war that the solution to this conflict was going to be in simply recognizing the frozen battle lines that are already present in the donnas and in crime the areas of the donnas that are currently occupied by russia and in crime the are currently occupied by russia a largely russia speaking those or areas in which lodgers lens did not win when when it came to last election cycle those are areas that did not vote some of them in last selection cycle because that army been occupied by russia in twenty fourteen but those are areas that did not voted for the the more european mine did you cranial politicians they would already voted for there pro russia politicians in those areas those conflict are not likely to be undone those arrears are not likely become sovereign u cranial territory again any time soon thou battlelines hive to move for a year and the idea of the all frame is america and european security guarantees to u crane more military memory all put in to prevent a future invasion and setting of the of the final lines kind of where they are right now every one knows that solution the question i hopetucker asked paten is is that he solution for you right because otherwise there is no offrampan et just continues paten is counting on the west to just get tired eventually just give in reeve that is effect of what paten is waiting for it now o him meanwhile gene corona our friend who of course stared and terror on the prairie for us we hired her after she was fired from the mandolorian for the great sin of saying that people shouldn't to humanize one another that is really why she as fired

a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beeps version you can find that at our weight this america life footwork this dis storing my mam us to to tell moos sister randy was eight or when this happened it thin hame a bit do school that randy did not understand and she came home and she asked my mam where do babies come from and my mam just felt greatness as great she is bring this up on her own i don't hove to sit her down in some awkward birds and bees conversation some day we can get this at of the way now when she is young and she is really excited to tell her the stuffing she explains the whole thing right where babies come from what sex is and the way my mammals es tell the story she said tat she felt i am doing such a good job here i am such a good mam to day had a the end of it she asked randy okas that is everything you have any questions and then randy pauses for a long moment an she ask to birds really my and my memorializes of course oh she was not ready she absorbed nothing in sure enough a year passes and randy comes back to her i do not remember why and asked her again where do babies come from and it is the first time never happened she remember none of it and i think of that story sometimes when there debates over what is suitable for children i think there is a whole category of things that kids protect themselves from they just do not won or en gage o that stuff at dolts do not need to keep them from it be then there is other stuff stuff that does seep into the world that they take to hart and they mull about and they make part of themselves and the think is difficult is that it can be really hard to predict what those thing you gang t be what a day in our programmed things that kids here things they see things that happened to them that affect them in ways that they only understand later as dolts friend sends what it means to give little black kids toys that celebrate the confederacy what a drag than age boys into the desert to watch comic bombs go off what a bring your kids to work when your work in waves breaking the law id even quantify exactly what that does to a person what a day we try to figure that out deveryudy easy chico is this america life i mare a glass they with us tat one stars and bars and bars we got the idea for this week show from this thing hat happened one of our producers near drumming a realization that he came to in a adulthood about a show that he watched is a kid here is now the hithievos show the dukes of hazard ran from nineteen seventy nine to nineteen eighty five it star john snider and tom boll pat this born look duke to rakes good old boys iron to stay n the right side of the law and world georgia but if you ask any man my age who was a fan of the show the drop hazards true star was a bright orange nineteen sixty nine dodge charger nicknamed the generally every week on we be the generally would roar through country back roads leaping over virtually everything the fine laws of physics and blowing little boys mines across america ad generally in what i match book at a straight up the plastic genoa a big size the big silo what eve go a traveling a can to is foot get angry i that is that that is this is one of my favorite rappers create bruin yes from the bronc me he watch the dukes of hazard faithfully as a boy we both had dukes of hazard once boxes and we were both proud on ears of miniature versions o the generally back then it was probably one of the most coveted toys any kid in either of our neighborhoods could possess i remember a bully of the neighborhood stole mine to to pretend was his i er a is in i i noentli the the generally was remarkable not just because it was both fast and furious before that was a thing but because this roof top was em blazon with the confederate flag as kids black kids pushing our many america muscle along the carpets an concrete of new york city either breeze nor i saw anything bothers him about that bold symbol up top in fact for us at the time the rural flag was just part of what made the car damp cool there was a kid in my neighborhood iris kid i he had i orange dodge challenge of full forty no flag on the top member lot of as that e but he need a thought a flag as a wat a real cops a to no ye drop i you heard i commit out obliges like tat can would be dough a call be do if he had that flag on that bath i got the idea of talk to breeze about this because in two thousand in one as part of his group the jugonats he wrote and released the song called generally e spell the adverb but a play on the name of the duke's prized razor soft remember exactly when i heard the son but by than had been over fifteen years since the dudes of haar on up the air i hadn't though about the show where the car and age i a wasingut old boys a me wish a pretty sure that when i was in my twenties and heard generally but that was the first time i put onto together and realized await one my favorite toys going up actually borne on bastion of front to my humanity and freedom the flag on the roof i he helped i m is that listening to the song again recently i thought maybe was about breeze himself coming to that same realization we are the same age after all but one he and i meant to talk about it greet said he would recognized the inherent put down in the generally paint job by the time he was in high school he was actually inspirer i generally a few years later after he had kids of his own one day he took them on a shopping trip i was literally into of us probably on until road her coobsity all the an a yorkers or send you lave and kids loan is looking for says and me questioning was up with these toys and then i see the generally the iconic roadster was back for the shelves being pushed on a new generation to promote some teeny move relaunch you remember what the soothe you defy he tan me through it you will not boy yet man's tog forty three he do me that he that my survive be seeming slimming screaming women o the sound be for join the thing i love about breeze is that he writes these dense clever impressionistic grimes that sound words tumbling downstairs in this first verse he is telling the story of that trip to this a was building the scene of a frustrated parent overwhelmed by toys and demanding children banging all hes was toys chon a lack noise peeceand quiet see o diet constructively then what i see the generally and i said what i i need explore this idea why did they think that was o kat why did he think that that they could show this image an and and make us champion that image why is it od say to make i will pan this pop i a who was it o take i just wanted to attack that you would have the audacity to do that i was i was just thinking now we mac kids then you go then is the chorus out that are the the cousin the general represent for your clan the generally for real somebody pulled the fast one the general lee now starting the one stand the generally was not the first will not be the last one i love that line that somebody pulled a fast one just cause is nice the car is fast and it it is a really it is a really nice e i apprecivery slip i mean is pretty blain it is the hood winking it they got over you know then they normals for better for work is is i a huge scroll you it's i sake we going to do this you noggin say nothing we will not put in on prom on levy we will not put it in toys or us in fact you go not by was i in e i say but see miles see my lots of course at seven eight nine years old at wasn't breeze i controlling the chevy remote we spending hour harder and cast it was ultimately our parent who let us watch the show and bought us the to considering that both my parents were born and raise and re south caroling and experienced shilling races and first hand you think they would have objected to the dukes in their generally but they did not breeze's parents who ere from the carabin they did not either he as a theory as to what our parents were thinking i think is it is a lot about i don't an my cads to be left out i dot ant my cares to be wed it was a humble one show it was why deny them that because this is important on to the doors on the general lee were well tat shut as is common with a lot of stock race cars rowan look duke were constantly hopping through the windows it was the only want in er out of the car he was created with he songs final very disturbance to see what we was murder to when it could as should ha been a convertible i started off pul what you was constantly jumping in an out o the window it would a made more sense and been more practical been a convert dis cut the top r shot the top o bat you needed it you needed a top to the car you needed to show that image but cased out the peppery that is the gan i get it you not to see it merit is bocage taming you have disturbance to see what we was murdered to wiener could a should a been it convertible say that the climb to the windows an go ma better simian do to pro hopping but no stopping commercial use to issue say get you pul de cops match to lunch box but jokers you want ta snatch the bunch lock the be wile generally praise the stuff crave the stuff slaves to stuff get it for me begin please now with tout i soaked about how i would beg m parents for it a but then its just sporting a pain i mean you you was sport my pain an is literally a comedy sporting the pain show was a brain wash kid but never had a fab would rocking a saw stick of course not see wit that i rather not see the closest that i got be seek highly salary but sell mile see is nothing damn this double stranded trouble be is some candid of the subtle on to flag down what no heard saying got a regulation fuck legislation but not some yo walking around for same word is o wonder what the murders a names burden tout about the generally in nineteen ninety eight names bird a black man in texts was badly beaten and pissed on by three whites o premises the men then chained bird by his ankles to a pickup shook and dragged him over assault for roughly three miles bird died when his head and arm were severed from his body the white's e premises who sported various not seeing confederate symbols dumped bird's mutilated body near a black church this atrocity was heavy on breeze's mind when he wrote generally which is one the last first ends in anger as he says on the flagon no hesitated i conned was l like i know some people of on to be like breeze will we told them about shooting down flag you should go to right channels this legislation well lag word well what what murder is a gamester think about the generally you knot i mean is dis us sum for we got a kill your idols we got burn your idols to you san you told me the you ere on you bee think about the song lot lately literally a week before you call i was lis in the the song an almost gall cook u come lie god did i mean the site sixteen years later why as its still in issue i to think come on you better than tat m that said i cannot help build harbor a little bit of mistaker for the generally not much for the thing itself before what it represents for me a time before i could possibly recognize the insidiousness of its design before i really understood its origins or held that history is shape in the people i care about tact won all i really had to worry about was who have the coolest or in the block new dome these days you work sat our sister company serial making podcast did he shows ardeb on i honestly believe they change the name soberly high school very long time ago probably after nineties early two thousand theta garland pardon when we talk to servery to days program she was sixteen years old remember of the drillteam that robot e we high school antiratexs us a black girl with blond after i con fridges would be locked under a white cowboy hat what ever drop team uniform ghoul to to be a parked i love being on the seem i left that girls who were on here but the is terms till its her back o my mind and i know on o be don really to the that many people but it still save din that i find that gets ti to me that history is that robot lee high school was founded in nineteen fifty eight four years after brown for board of education as a place for whites students to go to avoid integration town gave it the name robot fleas away to give the finger to the civil its movement school prided itself on having this mass of confederate flag ut lovely the second largest confederate flag in the world took twenty people to carry it then i the nineteen seventies the court sorted the town to integrate the high school these days sixty percent of the school was black and widen them entire it is still referred to is the white high school when the nonce e name of the school at the beginning of games girl and says she just kind of blocks out she found out about the schools history a little while ago i learned this last year i believe was we have memory books and it dates back all late an when we first open and we were living through one of the very first one and dow was wend i saw the uniforms and all the traditions to these have ten seven dell poult and a bell cards they recall the rebels in the rebels and they did were conbetterate uniforms all clothing an things than they probably dismay than conpeterin blag and it just shot me and all i can think of out was w for yelling gin me right now do you have to single schools they try to make us learned that i never as tschoolsongs start of the lyric robot w we raised our voices in praise of your name may honor and glory here guide you to fame have you eleven to look at the her o have looked at the salaries which as li haven't this however i would you ever sing never in my life neveberis on her cane school song our memories will bind us to robot l that part definably seems true back when we first armed this story in twenty seventeen then in twenty twenty one year after german graduated the school district try change the name of the school to tiler legacy high school berlin by the ways not crazy about that name either she says gay is a not to the schools confederate legacy she says she would have gone with something neutral for instance rose city high re down on the la an old an an a taken man es y for an a on o moon li a an them all while i the takes e a e l was that the stand was at e san the a they la an om o on e saw an it is the good ship ran s a e garb the gat away i to to history is not a toy to the river two hundred public schools around the country named er for confederate leaders and over seven hundred monuments moralize in the confederacy in public places there is never come from a day base from by the southern property last center for its many other statues have been taken down in the last few years the stature robot ya was removed just this week an richmon but for all this commemoration of white experience of life in the south before and during the civil war is actually not that much out their memorializing the black experience one o the few voices is in baltimore give to say i was surprised to honor was there i grew up in baltimore and ora this came into e distance after i midway but ism back in baltimore regularly to we family though never heard of it to b a parked who was a producer at our programmed and who also grew up baltimore not far from wore i grew up tell me about it here she his every black get in baltimore knows this place most was went there on field trips when we were in school were taken there by an earnest parent its call the national great black in lack museum that is great black and they are rendered in wack it is the first black history wack museum in the country i first went there on a field trip in the third great it for better worse it is men stuck in my memory ever since to be honest i scared the said at my it is violent and graphic and unlike any other museum have ever been to and as mainline tell was children even to day i can talk to anybody who grow at black and in baltimore and if you bring up the black and lack will be ye that was mess at bright pectin with friends an family about this last went i got messages i had nightmares and i started to tear up and i can still see to my head i want to go back to the museum the befools as bad as i remember there is the crowd o people from was coming in there is a cupric kits it is allow back there recently with my colleague show your the museum itself is an old fire station and three row houses fused into one building in the lobby the wax figures of to boys and cottage poison are there to greet you next to the take booth is the figure of the great military general cannibal writing a massive elephant and up overhead is the first black female pilot tat my coral rainy incise as a emplane above us there i in bat as a cool chicken it with e shades on ha she is taken no one's mess the lobby's all inspiring in stuff then you by a ticket and actually into the museum the everything changes a quick warning is a lot of violence of all sorts in what follows it might not be for every one when he see inside the museum it is dark immediately to the right there is a wax figure of a slate he is on his knees this teeth knocked out and he is being held down by two white slavers who polished bath they have shoved a long funnel into his mouth and our porn gruel through it force feeding it brown rule spills out of his mouth is fact of rebellion some slaves would not eat the slave is made them this is the very first thing you see and then to the left is one of the museum signature attractions i said he onto go into the spaceship they built the fact social of a spaceship and to the museum it is not that bit bout the side of a large trailer but when i was eight it seemed enormous back then walking down to the hold below was walking onto amusement partridge one of the opposite of fun at the entrance there we two white wax slave merchant both comparably dress one said behind to does it used to be that when you stepped on to the stairs of recording with play one of the merchant announcing new load a slaves come n aboard now at eight i understood they went me i was i to be an you slave i burst into tears at first i refuse to go all the way down to the ship but the other kids did it its i did it too and what i saw when i got to the bottom of the steps as what i was seen now another vicious looking white man and he is branding a slave woman who has a chain around her neck and placing the brain on her shoulder as she is fully need and covered and blind cheese its pure agonies on her face and he looks keys full of hate and anger and is just ready to torture someone not of this is chased those collections on shelves of portbodies body by rats that should be noted this one under below that is this remembered in being eaten by rats the museum goes for an intense realism it does not leave anything out it is over the top and away that is almost campy this probably because the wax figures all the we main in the nineteen seventies the slaves have mutton shots the feel of the slaves looking white there from good times an from routs but the scenes are always based on documented atrocities at a certain point in the spaceship i turn around and i see the entire wall behind me is one huge mirror it did i see the chained up slaves and ism forced to look at myself and it comes home to me in an instantthat these people on my ancestors without the torture without the sorrow without the misery that the endure during the middle passage there would be no see what he remember from when you were kid a seen this i remember being confused i an being scared the fact that it is someone whose my my skin my you do not have the language for it but it is a a pass in reflect and yo eyes grow wide ye turning to understand whet it means movie is got distracted by them trying to shove the guy not and what what no be on tegroundrailroad is a fakofin o tire was not exhibit behind show of a white man helping is runaway slave escaped through an oven with a door in the back allowing him the slipped through from one house to another and another as i kid it was not i was in familiar with black history it he third grate id already been to the plantation in with caroling where my ancestors were sold i obsessed with thermos marshal i wanted to beat him i wanted to marry him everything and may elementary school me such a bi deal anon martluther king every year at it once got to play one o coediscot king's bride's maids an an assembly but it was exactly that the elementary school version of black hes run doctor me nelson mandala rose part the coloring book of greatesfets not the brutal reality but none of this companies what you see in the museums baseman the baseman is intense that the museum has posed to design outside of it working that you should not go into it until you re ad least twelve under sixteen neat chaperon we hi it there pass henry box brown the sleeve who mailed himself to freedom in a box hen i was a kid et bop out in wave but his startled too many kids and they do not do that any more we walked past henry to the top of the basement stairs a sal we on to go downstairs to i the the lunching exhibit i did not see the luncheon exhibit when i was eight i shut on a second field trip when i was a freshmen in high school i son thick i was ready o thick i was ready now he start off wen you're still walking down the stairs with a stoical photos and newspaper clippings of actual lunching as recent as nineteen ninety eight black people hanging from trees sett on fire dragged by trucks follows of the did surrounded by crowds of white spectators all decked out in their sundae best smiling little girls with h ribbons in their hair looking at the camera some with pride a man having from a tree behind them then at the bottom of the stairs as soon as you round the corner a ye an you men on sling god go men to describe what is happening here in front of us was a husband and wife named hates and marry turner they lived in georgia back in nineteen eighteen a local black man had killed the plantation owner i when the sheriff's office went haunting for the killer they an a mob lunched practically every other black man in their path hays turner was one of the casualties in that massacre a warning the kits especially traffic just as i was about to describe what happened next to shine the museums educator bonnie hands walked in and i was grateful she did because she took over he had nothing to do with the situation and unfortunately he was lynched afterwards he was castrated what your then in this scheme in m exhibit is turner n lynched om he is wearing overalls and we have his overall opened up in is private region blood dripping down next to haze is his wife marry after he was lynched many bravely went seeking justice for her husband she was eight much dragnet at the time they lunched her to in the museum exhibit she is hanging from the neck but in real life they actually hanged her by her feet settle on fire slashed her stomach open and pulled out her baby which was still alive that is whats depicted in wax then they stopped but it is hid the sat on the wall adds to the story that haunted me it is all slowly part that historians cannot fully verified it reads water wife describing the lunching of marry turner and her husband hates turner depicted in the sene said that it was too horrible to describe the man taking the time to sow two cats an missus turner's stomach in making bets as to which one would climb out first till left of the turner's bodies is a mantel piece with souvenir jars sometimes the lunches would keep pieces of their victims in these jars a were supposed to be the ears locks of hair and genitalia of black people all next to kids base ball trophy ism not sure why that air except to underscore the point that these body partnered trophies too is it differ all room to process when i saw this at fourteen some my class mates to even know how to react a few of om stoic others ockuilly toflacting with yo i member feeling angry because you couldn't escape it they signs round the room that anticipate your distress they say i identify with the victims and martyrs and never forget them but do not o biter or despondent over what they endured doctor join martin found at the museum with her husband elder and nineteeneighty three and when i told her all the kids an my they greed were crying and freaking out and holding hands she was fully aware that happens in fact its intentional for me that is that is the point when they leave shaken when they leave crying and that's often on the the reaction i have no problem with those tears and it is what people a going to talk about on years later is going to be our spaceship and ted one to say i never forget your pinching exhibit oh and everything else it seems a move if you do not if you do not haver sense of exactly what people wore fighting agents if mouthing that rolls a parks the what she did had something to do with the seed on the bus and you do not understand that that et was i ism going to get her bald but it could have got in her bitch is well when joannes and her husband found at the museum they self to create something they wished existed in the world a museum that celebrated and preserved black history created by black people four black people an a majority black city they were a professors at istorcly black universities in baltimore floor at organ state an joannes coin but they wanted to reach more than just the academic class when they visited a wax museum an saint augustine flora they thought yah wax fingers that is the way to go they had money save for a house but instead wat towards black figures it still was not enough wax figures are absurdly expensive forty five hundred dollars then but tens of thousands of dollars now heaved up with their first four black history figures frag doubles john brown not turner in mama lad button floor and joannes would tore round with their parts at lac figures at different schools an churches and expos we just would take e figures om set them u as exhibits throw the in to back ponies take them back home to our too bid room apartment and if you look into the gest bed room ago or too bed room apartment you would a an marrymac tat with them say it on the dress er in i every that wit is part sour in the corner an ted to for and i just gave in in o the mad am marrymac ta with the has gat to go you gear the place for very mcclav with them doctor martin told me they are thinking of expanding the museum and making it more child friendly going down the violence which surprise me it does not see permission at all they were only make sense if our history were a little more child friendly which definably is not the four little girls kill of the nineteen sixty three church bombing an albata they were all fourteen an younger the kids who march on bremmingham children crusade were beaten in a dogstit on them they were as young is twelve an new it till was fourteen he as mamorgiall in the lunching room but he would even be allowed to go down there without a chaperone even though the museum upset me i respect it got through to me even as an adult watching righting pendents discuss the greatness of america a sol think of many turner and her baby but i left the museum i have the same feeling i did as the kid come was i on a secret about what the country was really the call the malice streets when a batsmen of northaven be a larger tod we heard of the outcast the cat from new york magazinecoming out seven greater gets taste o the family business which means breaking the law with mama dad it is in minute jecogobublic radio when our

have arrived at at three of our program at three take your kid to work day in this have of the shaw we have stories of kids seeings if that really maybe they should not see and we begin with the story from to bingo my teens about tagging along with his parents when they were on the job his tat at a trucking business an acts us that it to worse som worse over the years by eighteen eighty six dad had become a truckdriver with nothing left to hall but marijuana through his early thirties he could do little with the trucking business he would inherited from grandpa except watch as it crumbled around him back then he began his days by throwing open the door to the bedroom my shared wit my brother can he would stand there and is underwear looking a tall diner child and say you too get up he would in the day drinking a lot of dollar fifty budwisers at the shanty bars that littered the port of townsman at home mom kept the bookkeeping she watched the flow of money slow to a trickle and then stop outright when i was in middleschool my brother sisters and i new things were dire when our mother stopped shopping at else central supermarket the nice grow restore as she would always told us an started bringing home bags from lopes supper market the poor people growserestore tone morning most surprises me by showing up at my seventh great algebra class and removing me getting us on the road out of brownsell ate north there is no explanation sit that the yakaye the she snaps at me sit down and shut up anthem do not know why i did not guess what we were doing that morning that mam and i were look outs for dad who was on the road somewhere behind us and one of his flotnofs tractor trailers carrying a large old of marijuana and headed north i had heard the stories you some of the tactics of smuggling by this point but it did not make the connection that mam and i were driving ahead of dad to make sure the custom station was closed and if it happened to be open we were supposed to turn back and warn him this was back at the nineteen eighties before the patriotic and there were two you was customs check points blocking the migration of drugs fruit people reptiles and parrots on the roads between the united states and mexico both about one hundred miles north of the medical border at highway choke points the station on highway seventy seven and serena was the busier and the better finance the check point in hebronvilleeu was an use team trailer with an attached carport to protect the agents from the sun and it would often close from breakfast for lunch we were headed towards that one this morning going north on highway to what he won driving through the scenery of astatic plants and stunt trees the car is hot nowhere condition my mama and i are saying nothing to one another we have each decided that the other is unworthy of conversation we stare at the windows and think very different things mam is thinking about the hundred dollars she and dad at set before six o'clock that morning one hundred dollars that would help them make tooth as college if things went right because her first stop on the fill in the excursion was to dad's gudondetta whom we knew as lasignota days personal which doctor for an emergency session they were let right through at five in the morning and they had only one burning question will the check point be open after years of sitting through precessions with my grandmother i did not have to be there to know exactly how it went in the gudandetta's office a signora is older matronly dresses in the thin frock with her hair pulled back in a bun she has my parents sit across from her desk in a black leather love seat with come handles a panorama photos hang around her office some wallet us eye others larger and in portrait a pencil sketch of a camera by one of her grandsons hangs next to a window she listens closely to their question nodding sleepily at the preoccupation sympathizing understanding they have reached a decision and the cannot turn back they tell her they knew to do it no other choice any more she stands up abruptly and walks behind her desk which has clutter with meets of nope of paper crawling with ink illegible notes names the people sets of critic numbers home addresses of saints she closes her eyes and scribbles something on her yellow legal pack nonsense to any one else reading it on her desk are two cheap leaded crystal bottles each filled her the clear liquid she gently reaches for her matching shoeless and lifts it to the light making it sparkle she places the glass on the surface before her and port from one better then the other when the two clear liquids mix they turn a deep crimson and thicken plasma she nods her head as if her suspicions have been confirmed she produces a glass orb filled with water sitting on a black plastic ring she sits up straight closes her eyes and regulars her breathing into a loud rhythmic inhalation exhalation that unconsciously forces mam and dad to do the same after a few seconds she opens her eyes suddenly and strikes the glass orb with a metal wand making it ring in the clear morning air then she lifts the orb be tween her two pudgy hands and stares deeply into the inverted image of the room around it sitting opposite this chicanery and watching everything she does your drawn to the rite and you cannot help u try to figure it out too no she says with certainty the checker er not be open this morning in peace god me with you when mom and i reach a check point at eleven forty five that morning it is very much open for business a line of cars five deep stretches back from the underbudgeded airstream trailer our job now is to go through and then turn back around and reported dad that is doom was indeed imminent mam is visibly shaken she turns off the radio with a hard click and considers this considers her options from the car we can see a skinny middle aged white guy and green border patrol garb sitting on a reclining chair and the open doorway of the air street trailer he s facing the cars as they pass under the tin roof it must have been a hundred ten degrees inside the trailer a hundred in the shade from his position never bothering to get up the agent sits founding himself with the newspaper and sleepily peers into the cars asking if every one is in america citizen waiting for an accented answer smiling and then waving them through a sympathetic priest branching absolution hi we all going to today asks the skinny little man man's window is now only half way open and in her nervousness she rolls it all the way up hi sorry i mean sanantonio as she opens the window all america citizens yes she says and she leans back he could get a clear look at me nodding my head i do not say anything except the quiet yet when i odd but he has not heard me there is an uncomfortable pause i think because there supposed to hear your accent there is an anxious beet and he still has not let us go when i say yes i am a bit too enthusiastically mam laughs nervously she had been hoping our light skin would exonerate us without a problem you will have a nice day he says he has not noticed anything awkward we drive through and i feel her seethed for the next few miles that was about noon somewhere behind us at a road side rest stop dad and my older brother dad are waiting in dad's tract or trailer which is attached to the trailer with the marijuana the two center beams that men the length of the trailer make perfect housing once he well metal plates all along the underside and at the tale end it creates a long rectangular box sealed at the rear end with the excel of the rig where twenty forty pound blocks of marijuana can be hidden this is went down and down or can o i wondered dimly if can his figured out what his doing out here on the road north when you should be in high school but can has always been more street piss much savior than me i figure that if i figured it out heed a figured mouton mom and i drive on to abenville ism de highdrated i want to stop at a store we cannot she says to me we have to turn back i think where behind still ism hungry and really thirsty i persist certainly we have time to get tor convenient store the cannot have schedule listing to hinge on a few minutes certainly they have devised this more cleverly than that please i plead just stop at the seven eleven grudgingly she plates the noisy car around the small town and finds a convenient store i get out with he couple of dollars and come up short when i try paying for some donuts an a chocolate milk i returned to the car for more money just get in she ells and i do leaving the food of the counter mom wipe the car around and in intriguing use to it by a we travel that for a few minutes and when the check point is back in sight we hold our breath the guy will not see us and right then we see dad and dad and the traitor heading right for the check point dad had become nervous or may be brave or maybe he was blinded by his hundred dollar faith in uts good vendetta and ha charged forth without waiting for monster point oh god my mother says and all the blood drains from my face from just ta tone in her police i had never heard her voice charged with fear oh god she says again with her left hand she grabs the knob the controls he headlights and flashes at dad who's only a few hundred feet from the check point she flashes for times and clear view of any one who is paying attention i wonder if that is her signal that the check what is open ut question the wisdom of doing it while he is next in line in full view of the guy a the check point were he to look over his shoulder and see the noisy southbound car that just drove through not thirty minutes before she slows down sos terrifically down going less than twenty miles per hour on the highway and for a moment i can see dad his driving i can see that the blood his drain from his face too making his eyebrows stand out a rich black on his pallid deathly white forehead a mask of some one are tending desperately that everything is a o say but doing it terrifically badly i see can in the passenger seat holding one the hand rail above the door as hit means to steady himself to this craziness through the stupid unnecessary risk and he looks calm collected uncaring he is not there there are no cars ahead of them now the trailer is next in line it is lose to a crawl and i could see dad desperately trying to ignore the crazy flashing noisy boniville rattling through the south bound lane keeping his eyes fixed to the road pretending he is not smuggling anything in the empty trailer behind him this empty useless trailer with the eyebeams all sealed up with the two medical men driving it with no obvious destination no paper work no affiliation with any hauling or trucking company no sir not trafficking drugs just driving through to button probably looking for work oh yes we are america citizens that is not what we are nervous we and prove that that is nothing we are nervous because of the pot we are hiding and because we are only getting two thousand dollars for risking upwards of ten years in prison is not that funny is not that just hysterical but the skinny while eye is having lunch an campy gathered and one of the weirder moments of this hold o bocce the bondeville the air stream and dad's tractor line unlike some cosmanen vent and we see the skinny border patrolagiont with an white napkin to under his chin and dad's bloodless face up in the trailer through the window of the air stream as the agent waves this through with a fork like his conducting an orchestra go on through go n through macletoon is driving south stone by what has just happened and i am careful not to say a word we almost reach raymonville and stop at a waterburger to get a quick wordless lunch and spend some time sitting in he parking lot waiting when she feels it is safe to return she turns a car around and heads back north back through the same check point are you sure this is safe i asked she does not answer when we pull up again to the check point and it back to hebenville round three o'clock there is a different boarder patrolationt at the air stream he is a small clean cut militant medical with the southern drawl you all america citizens he demands instantly leaning into the car through the window clearly smelling for marijuana smoke oh yes says my mother who is probably quite relieve the hard part is over and it looks we are getting away with it haw bought you son you america citizen he gives me a direct glare through reflective sunglasses there is nothing more potentially hostile then the indigents ego interpreting the loss of his conquer upon his own people yes sir i say careful not to move or fidget or look away have learned he looks back at my mother then at me he smells the nervousness of earlier something tugs at his intuition wereyoe all headed the sunglasses finally asked this catches payoff guard her subterfuge had ended when dad had driven through the check point she left all her answers back in raymonville we are going to hevrenville she says unconvincingly had he asked one more question had he pressed it we would have been in some sort of trouble but he does not and he backs off in motions us through mom drives the noisy car through habrenville and we are got to get the open highway again when you noticed tad's trailer in the parkinlot of a cheese hotel by the side of the road my brother is lodged between the most tires working on the break likes that i ridiculously out working mom is his alarm to find them there as i am this confirms my suspicion that there had been no planing beyond the consultation at the crrondetos this hold the buckle had been based on nothing more than a hundred dollars worth of face complex of next of the trailer and i think she expects the vice tortious reunion when he sees her at suddenly looks his about to punch her t stupid fucking woman heels at her in punish mom stops cold wit the fuck were you thinking if they would have just turned around for a moment it would all be over and itwoul all be yer fault he spits at her in finish we realize what he is upset about the flashing headlights this words continued to snap in his surround her bullets in a fire fight that she follows him forward to the cab of the truck kowtowing to her punishment lucky for us lessinot i was right dead was walking back with mom now excited and seemingly over his anger she made them blind and we were let through they were closed when we left them later that evening and was doing the driver they pulled out of the barking lot an headed off to button and the pay off the break likes temporarily fixed on soups of block electrical tape o watch is a truck disappears it looks every other piece of now broken down equipment we have ever owned rusting miserable and totally criminal mom and i turned south actor brownsvill mom as her usual quietself except this time she plays the radio louder this mean us think in that is getting dark and om sleepy i sleep she will get us home she knows the way for that i could truster the minor myteenas reading his story from his collection the boy kind of texts which his a memoir and was a finalist for the national book ward at for racket boy soy because i pop him to day with somebody was just a teen age and the army ordered him to report to camp desert rock which as next to the atomic energy commissions boy testing range in neat he nineteen fifty five did he saidthing he was totally in prepared for though i think maybe nobody could be d prepared for this is nineteen his name's pal's i me he g had to be a right er and to poet and he wrote about a what happened there he read this account back in the first year of the trumpedministration if you remember when north creeper was doing test launches of intercontinental missiles and present a tromp was threatening retaliation demanding to stop am ma pass account was red for us by an actor john convey it'd paid attention it'd seen the news reals o her she i up but just watching a tombac bombs go off i thought it was going to be kind of cool thought the story be await interest girls they did not tell us anything about what was going to happen no initiation no training in the first time i had no idea what to expect we travel by convoy impulses in the middle of the night to assemble at the sight hi shuffled run the cold chain smoking till we were ordered into the trenches the trenches were long thin slits in the desert earth only wide enough for it to line up single file we wore our steel helmets but we are not his she to your plugs eye covered or any protect i clothing then they told us to get down d not become fearful until the count down was broad cast over the loud speaker and i only became terrified when i saw the flash right enough were even with my eyes closed i could see the bones of my hands over my eyes shock was have crashed over the trench top and we were ordered to stand up and look we did and saw the mushroom cloud glowing purple f the changing colors rising rising out the saw eight atomic blast and total all in different t days some devices drop from their plans of some detonated from towers there was an trial burst in under ground blast as we some times during the show wave the trench sides caved and buried us alive we had to claws way out from our own graves some poor doggies and jeeps were assigned to drive forward it gagger counters and radio transmitters when clearance was radio back we ere ordered to walk forward into the blast great at bar witness far as i could tell bearing witness was the entire reason we were there largest on my witness was called turn and almost three times he size of the herishemo bomb it was dropped from the five hundred foot tower an our trenches were approximately two and a half miles from ground zero the blast yield was a bigger than expected he brass ordered us to retreat to the busses where we swept each other off with kitchen brooms and hustled into our seats the next morning some of us were bust back into the area and our fatigues and order to walk forward tho bear witness there was still a heavy smell of ozonic there vegetation was shredded scorched torn out by the boots and small animals an birds for scattered dead crippled and bind urchin about from still trying to find a place to hide we walked past crumple the across an our sorry pieces that had been placed in the help and he magical staked out cakes torn apart and melt that partesqly cagecheshor pigs that had been dressed and specially fit in army uniforms or dead or mangle the latter still shrieking there last turds of blasted sheep and cows mangled together dead moaning staged houses and barns were splendid scattered we never had to wrist reports nor did any one ask us what we saw cause it turned out they were looking at just they wanted to see our young men reacted to an atomic blast apparently that is all they wanted to do i was not selected because i was special i had no need for qualifications side from being a nineteen year old boy over the years of america open air atomic boy testing in neat a few thousand army men participated is not matter any more that only feeble attempts were made by the government to find out how these experiences effected us lately i begun to realize that i am one of the last people living in america to have actually experience close up explosions of atomic bombs we are all dying now most of us are already did i am not aware of any one's health being effected by the blasts but some years ago i did check with the veterans administration about the possible radiation to age i receive during my participation i was in formed that the radiation fix badge that i for throughout my four months at desert rock had been burned up in a government warehouse records fire and saint louis some decades of tho now in my late years when i can conjure that brief we real period on my youth i try in vain to make some sense of it and some ways at is become my rest nobility at least recollect and tell how that great flash and blast permanently reached into my very young mine and heart how this enormous sounds deaden my ears and still ring in them to this day how the crush of shock waves sometimes buried us alive in our trenches i feel it my duty to tell the reckless absurdity of it all an august our president threatened to unleash fire and fury the world has never seen we keeps threatening unleash these bonds and i suspect that one day we will most of us have forgotten what we are capable of have not john could reading an essay by paulzemma version of

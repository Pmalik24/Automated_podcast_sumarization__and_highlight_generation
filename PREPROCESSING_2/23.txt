basically acknowledging the facts which is my rap song with tom my donates or more accurately tom my dona's raptor rasing featuring me billboard is now acknowledging that it is likely to make number one on the billboard charts which is hysterically funny and they are freaking out about it they put out a piece yesterday over at billboard at dot tom titled next weeks hop one hundred wagon these stallion verses nick manage verses ben chipiro and they are freaking out now let us be clear the hot one hundred is not actually the list that we are seeking to be number one on the onethat we want to be number one on is the digital song sales which is who should head on over to tunes does the only sales that are currently being counted in terms of the billboard digital song sails list hat onortituns right now if ye have already bought the song and go do that over there but billboard is freaking out about this and the feeding out about this for very simple reason which is they have attempted to basically bar people tom my donate from the charts the hippo industry is very much infused with left wing thinking on everything from social politics to drop politics to all the rest of him we all know what hiphop has brought to the world in terms of her its moral compass that is to say in large part not much and a song facts which is very much directed the other way or as tom my donald' raps in the song were not on to turn your sons into thugs your daughters an to hose that is something that the industry simply cannot take they do not it at all billboard is freaking out about this billboard put out this piece yesterday sing yes really after right when punnet ben chipiro help propel multiple songs to number one this decade including pagan these stallions on was back in twenty twenty with either his indorsement or his disavowed he is now in pursuit of a hot one hundred toper of his own even admits as much on facts is collar with antidote rapper tom my donate as he directs audiences during his own rappers again yes really all my people demo this let us get a billboard number one as they point out we have had no radio support we are not a big corporation that is dedicated to music and and manipulating the charges techy go look hate the charts over t stuns what you will see is that main the stallions hiss which is the top competitor for that number one slop right now alongside nick mannashas big foot both of those tracts have now been separated into about eight different versions of the tract as to aggregate sales to have a bunch of versions of the same song over and over and over being pumped by these massive corporations in an attempt to prevent tom song with me from hitting number one the billboard chart gill make it happen right now folks us get that billboard number one this sort of your last opportunity to day to get in under the wire id on over to tons and get the song it is also again amazing how the media are deliberately and militantly attempting to not get the joke they cannot allow the joke to happen the joke is the funniest joke in the history of pothunter ism sorry it is me at the top of the rapcharts is indeed be funniest joke in the history of pop culture in the united states i do not think there is a a big competitor to be frank with you and they really do not want get the jokes o washington post has an entire piece to day title benschippirofs new song number one on tunes how did that happen and here is what they write humorlessly absolutely humorlessly he's democracy dies in darkness and the washington posties in father darkness quote benchipiro a right when political commentator known for his incendiary takes just made his rapdabiew with a spit fire song called facts it is sorts on number one spot on the tune's store sitting love recent pop and hippo hits from the lights of pagan these stallion just in timber lake an jack halo the song a collaboration between chipper and canada rap artist tom my donate to be fair tom is the chartist can gan ism keen mentioning this besom is the one he's actually good at this again tom's being overlooked by some of the media because of the hysterically funny headline that ism a rap artist now tom actually is in any case the song is pat of lyrics that tame take mat critics the culture words the rapjoner in general and call out rap artist nick manas and leno by the win side track rather hate to nick mango who is who really i think enjoying this whole controversy nickmanash actually tweeted out this morning quote wait till they wake up and listen to what benshipero is saying in facts the outrage on this one will be a tad bit delayed the the i ism enjoying it nickiprichet in any case there is the washington post not understanding things quote being number one appears to be a big deal worshippers who founds in the daily wire in twenty fifteen and colonelcy hosts his own political podcast an radio so he recently changed his by on acts formerly twitter to read worlds number one wrapper he is riddled one of his recent we to podcasvidos i am america number one wrapper in which he played the entire fact music it while praising the success of his hot wait yum wait it is a big deal to me number one as opposed to all the other people in the music industry who are a tempting to be number three madly i love the washer it appears to be a big deals to we number yes that is why you are writing about it i notice that's why your pang it tension to it a golwalle oik he seems to care about being number what a my you you losers truly you losers refused to get the joke is it the song success cures that of other songs that avenues to america politics but mason you deans try that in a small town and over anchovy's rich men north of richmon from last summer and then this thing goes on for hundreds of words talking in very serious terms about what happened here wat chipper has an noted history of criticizing rat music and explicit lyrics ins twenty nineteen he set on his his so the rap was not a real joker of music igniting a splash on social media well i mean i said that because i make classically trained musician and let me just explain what that means for folks i on atrial understand the inference between say rap and hippo and classical music to be a classically train musician means you will spend in your life tens of thousands of hours practicing at an instrument see can plays for the greatest music over written to be it number one charting bill board rap artist means being featured and a tom my donate song where i rap forgive thirty seconds and my lifelong preparation for that was talking that is not the same thing remotely in kin but again the media are militantly refusing to to get the joke and to that maces the joke even funnier of course and we can only hope that at the gravies you will receive some sort of recognition for the fact that we are in fact the number one song in america and we need your help to day to make sure just a again filbert's basely acknowledging we will be number one on the digital download chart which is the one that racing for we need our help wit that to had on over

now gone viral and it is indicative of the chief issue in the two thousand twenty four campaign and s can remain the chief issue in the twenty twenty four campaign until some other issue takes precedent and there is a long time to now in the election but right now the big issue of this campaign an the big issue of our time is human migration human migration is the big issue of our time it is causing a vast turmoil in european politics it is causing vast turmoil and africa it is causing vast turmoil in the united states is turned out that large waves of human beings crossing borders willy silly causes conflict and to what we are seeing in the united states are the results of that conflict here is a video this came out day before yesterday it is a it is a migrant mob in yo legal immigrant mob pounding a pair of cobs near time square over the week en here is what that video looks o my goodness oh my goodness say you can see these of these guards jumping these two cops i a bunch of them there's jumping yes who cops the beating them down on the streets the this has to be what ten twelve i legal immigrants apparently police initially busted for of the asylum seeking dots now remember there sing the slum what have have ben saying four weeks a may the s documentary about southern borishgo checked out it daily wired to comic is to fantastic documentary talking about exactly what is happening to understand what is happening you have to understand the chief signal thing the bide administration did is the said you now have a magic word to get into the united states to america you walk up to the boarder ifindaborpetral agent you shout i fear to go back to by home country this amounts to a legal asylum claim at that point you are not held in mexico pending a hearing on whether you in fact have the right to seek asylum you are not actually held in the mention they process yo in they release you to the interior where you go to new york n beat the living shot out of cops that apparently is is the the way that emigration is working in the unites his course the vast majority people for crossing the were are not doing this but why should any of this be happening literally this would not be happening these these people were seeking asylum and what they really are our criminals par seeking to participating criminality according to the yeropost the footage shows and wipe officer an lieutenant initially telling the migrants to move along around eight thirty am sturdy on west forty second street in manhattan which course the heart of manhattan that is before things quickly got route as a scuffle broke out between the cops and suspects was wrestled to the ground and then the rest of the illegalimigrans converged on the officers and star being the sellout of them the video shows the wo officers left on the ground as the pack runs east on forty second street toward seventh avenue and gets away but not for long police initially busted four of the asylum seeking dogs identified as german on this comes iscayo nineteen kelvin sedvatarocha nineteen wads willow twenty one and woman raven twenty four adding to the rich diversity of the united states all four were charged with the fault and released without bad according to sources perfect new york story ileglemigrans on thestreets being the haloticops released without bale a fifth suspect yon balata twenty two was arrested money night and charged with the tempted assault of the police officer the manhattans the asofficay they a still investigating the incident in reviewing additional video of the allege assault one of the men has two open cases in manhattan for assault and robbery sees been arrested twice before is anileglemigran has not been deported got arrested again for assaulting a cop and then got released from jail immediately without bail in nonmember he allegedly put pushed punched and bit a forge from rack employ who caught him lifting one hundred thirty dollar item from the union square stores display rack according to law in forcemeat sources also last month reverse also punched with a closed fist a loss prevention officer at the herald square babies after trying t pullout robbery with two other suspects that is gets just a career criminal in the united states pretending he has an asylum claim this is jo bidet's america this is jo bidesemigration policy is is jo bidet's choice to let people this into the country he has the law on the books that would allow him to stop all this this would not a happened is it i under donate trumps emigration policy people this would be turned back at the border the what been remaining in mexico awaiting their asylum hearing the shocking incident is just the latest example of a asylum seekers running a foul of the law in the big apply according to the norkpost again this is you should not be shocked by thingsthat are perfectly predictable in fact as yon bald who is the last one who us cotarested was leaving manhattan criminal for without bale he flipped off the press thereby walks out flashes two midday fingers at the press as he walks out and why petty chief of patrol on cheltshold reports you saw the city reprehensible their cowards you've eight people attacking lieutenant a cop running up to them t kick them in the face ally meanwhile this do to just walking out free flipping off the press why our people this in our country why there is no right to be in our country if you're a criminal there is no right to be in our country if you are i a citizen of another country and you are not legally claiming asylum if your aside not claim is bull crap and yet the the wild left as captured the democratic party to the extent that they are refusing to say the bodies which is these people should not be in our country they should not be in our country wet's more on this in just one second first it is a struggle findtesty healthy food of the grocery store these days everything seems to have more labels than calories fortunately for you my friends an good ranchers are extending their new year new meat offer but only for my listeners you are not conto find the steal anywhere else here is what have to do go to good ranchersdot come subscribe to any of their boxes use cod ship per a checkout through out over two pounds of chicken press it is a hundred eighty nine dollar all to every order you receive for the next year that is over twenty five pounds of free trimmed better than organic chicken for free i actually've had a cosherstake from good ranchers one cosherstake they made it was amazing and everything from good ranchers is that good my people telling me they sent me summon from their wild cot shoebox that was also amazing by thewy good ranchers only sources from the best meet america has to offer completely anttabaatic common an alien free you are not shureich box to choose you try their brand new weekly essentials box filled with free trimmed beef and chicken saving he time on meal preparationwithout sacrificing flavor stock your fridge with good ranchers to day go to good ranchers dot come use my coshippero to enjoy free chicken for a year that is good ranchers dot come cosh per claim your free chicken good ransherstot come america meat delivered how far left is left move anacasperian who eve had on the shell i over the young turns she made the signal error the other day have actually saying on the air the people this should be deported and people went nuts on her how could she do this here is a clip of anna hes there not people you need to provide cover for the our people who are in the country claiming a asylum they do not have a right to be here it is a privilege to be able to take advantage of our asylum program for this she is been receiving extraordinary black because the somewhat rational left is being completely expelled by the actual radical left that is the current state of things and you can see that this battle inside the democratic party now i know everybody is sort of giving up the ghosts for the moderate democrats an thin you little early for that there is a battle that still has to be fought inside the democratic party because the impact of a legal migration in blue centers is finally starting should be felt here for example is the massachusetts governor for help crying as she announces she is converting a recreation center into a housing facility for legal immigrants also i to committed to this little kits need to be able o breathe clean air they need to be able to access blaming pulls they need get life are there who can teach him has swim and they need to have activities i do not now what were going to do for a couple three months o collins university to color their places oka now here is the problem this s going to be used as an emergency shelter for people who are sleeping literally at lognairport they are literally sleeping in elegolimigrans at logan international airport the was recreation center is the center that is going to be used as sort of the overflow center that is going to accommodate four hundred people are about one hundred families but local members the communal what the hell ex heresy what to help why do we have a a an extraordinary number of legal emigrants who now taken over the rest censer the we pay our tax is force that we can use what what what why is this happening and meanwhile you have this radical governor masters its crying over it what good luck good luck if if you can get to winning message good luck to you meanwhile here is democratic den for mayor my johns pointing out that the city of denser is completely filled up that every hotel in the city of denser has been taken over by legalimigrants we have always have a can say policy here i gentry in individual you t this forth a i thy her see ewe pas ta er about for six we her very very or o ever sever everyone we have the for o to r to er a for e eery i think our city is very close to s forcing point out is it is that is right that is right and and many democrats are starting to see it an people ranging from john federal to the democratic mayor of denser a they they do see it in these other cities by thewy epic madam sees it new york banyan johns sees it in chico i meanthat they are all seeing and there just pretending they do not see it and you can only pretend that reality does not exist for long before even your typical voters stark to turn on you and that is what is happening with regard to emigration and jobidon which again he is losing that issue by leaps and bounds his only response to this is going to be abortion by the way he is not going to even deal with emigration issue the emigration issues just in a simmer the entire year he is instead going to redirect end abortion and try to get suburban women to not against only trump based on there suppose it need for an abortion despite the fact that suburban women arenactually having that many abortions in the united states at this point an time but the emigration issue for a huge number of america is going to continue to grow insides as well it should by the way all it would take is god forbid one serious terrorist attack benin legalimigrant crossing america southern border which there are countries that reattempting to funnel terrorist across america southern border given that it is wide open at this point all it would take is a serious attacked completely shift the nature of america politics perhaps for a generation because it turns out that we have america that the great promise of america is free markets and security just in terms of what the government is supposed to provide you property rights and security those of the things that america historically has done incredibly well o feels both of those things are in danger that something that america are not going to react well to according to the new bloomburg swing states pole the question was how responsible if at all is present imbidon for the increase in migrant crossing the one medical border sixty one per cents ay responsible only twenty nine per cent say not responsible that by the way includes thirty eight percent of democrats who say the jobidon is responsible for the huge increase any leglemigrations border that include fifty nine per cents of his panics forty seven per cent o blacks as suppose o thirty six percent who say that he is not responsible for all of that fifty to per cent of america trust donate trumping emigration compared to thirty per cent of america trusting jobidon by the way on the economy the numbers are fairly similar ondthe economy trumpets trusted by fifty one percent is in the swing states first thirty three percent for jobidon serving now your being some national polling data that suggesting the bison has open up a lead in in a head to head quinipiac university put out a pole yesterday they put out this pole and they show a lead of idea significant lead a fifty to forty four per cent lead among registered voters and a hypothetical general election macro not there is a difference to registered voters and likely voters likely voterpoles ten to be better register voterpoles ten to be work the reason is because again a the a lot register voters ware simply not going to vote the up coming election is the big problem for jobidon he one when you have the biggest spike in election votes in america history when the number of votes in a presidential election shifts by extraordinary per centares in twenty sixteen therefore proximally a hundred fifty seven million voters and thereabout a hundred and thirty six million votes cast in twenty twenty a hundred and fifty seven a hundred d fifty five million people shut up to voting twenty twenty a hundred fifty five million people that is an increase of again eighteen twenty million people in one election cycle that is not replicate this time it is going to turn out is con be down in twenty twenty four it will mainly because all of the voting walls re in a shift back to normal and a look people can be expected to god to a polling place in actually vote you are not going to get people voting five months in advance of the election by mail something sixty per cents oval democratic voters in t e last election kcal voted by ma that is not going to replicate this time while your seeing a lot of poles that are starting to emerge nationally in the states dona trump dos in fact retain a lead donate and that lead is going to be durable long as jobiton continues to destroy the situation on the border and he is doing that single handed by the way this is one reason the border deal is on life support if republicans actually thought that there was a a chance that jobidon was going to shut down the border if job actually just to day cammountiusiliscem we don't remain a mexico and we are also going to make sure the info have an asylum application they you have to stay into mention until that is dedicated if mobile made those two changes to day the chance of a border deal would go up significantly not just because republicans might then behead that they had something a credible partner in shutting the border and maintaining a border at all but also because the political in centimes which would witch then who id move from if there is a compromise on the border that bales jobiten out to if there is a compromise on the border that shifts the law in a direction that we that is a cementing of actions that jobidnes are to taken what re publicans are are afraid of is that they are going to sign on to a border deal and jobidon is then one tho absolutely screw them in terms of the executive implementation of that deal and they are right to be prirticlarly frightened of that when he sell these republicans on ears who are out there right now saying thingsabout the bill big great in this we have not yet seen the text of the bill i cannot adjudicate whether i think the bill is good or tell you whether i think the bill is good in willie actually seen the bill let us more on this in just one second first balance of nature fruits and

the bill's contents to pronounce it d o a sernjams landlord voklahoma said he is bee meeting with republicans one on one s clary in formation about the bill sewer craton senior she says the rumors swirling about what this down does not to are wrong the question is why not just release what the deal is wont one once we know what the deals than we can decide whether or not it to give the deal bottom line though is that the is only one person who can bail obit an out of the situation and is in fact jobidon meanwhile jobiton quickly trying to backfill many of his problems with his own domestic was particularly among blue collar white voters that is the the constituents he believe or not that job nectioul cut into against dona trumpet twenty twenty dona trump over performed with minorities dona trump over performed in urban areas dona trump under performs with blue collar white workers in two thousand twenty statistically theactually under performdwhat ye done in twenty sixteen in twenty twenty ant's we are to set up that actually is the statistical truth wheat a lot of those voters are now turning again back to dona trump and a way from jobiton which presumably is we jobitden is now pretending he cares but east palestine oho thourecall that he is pain oho was a place were there is a major trains a railmenters toxic spill and and jobinston go the fer a year and peep but judge did not go there and peep but judge was on t v talking about why it was necessary for hi m to take paternity to car for his a his husband who obviously was egregiously physically wounded during the birth of their of their child in any case screen johmpierre is ex planning why jobidon is visiting his placing the answer is the jobidon is trying to shore up that for rush belt base that he thinks he has here hot why o whitened tithe the a i cop and s no on up on pardon go the mayor and a community leaders invited the president to meet with is pakistan a resident an also we o the recovery a progress tats been going on for some time now you all know and the president had always a that he would go when it is most helpful to the community and with this invitation obviously a very recent and the current fates of therecovery we felt that the time was right again we got an invitation from the main communicators to to come and very very recently and we are working a with tom to figure you the best time to do that in february oh is it is that when you received the invitation very recently by very recently you mean year ago because that is not usually how he keep time in the real world is very recently as a virago my of if if i say that i took my wife out to dinner recently what i mean by that is in two thousand twenty two that is not recently that is not how it works again join has to shore up that martial base because he is just campagniin crazily week his pull numbers are really bad and because they are bad he is trying prtymuch everything in the book which is presumably also why jobidon is now a tempting to buy off michigan muslin voters that is effectively what he is doing right now with all his idiot talk about the dailies i got to say his middliston policy has been a complete crash since he took office whether it is real orienting away from salyorabia reorienting away from israel orienting toward iron being incredibly conciliatory toward the into was declaring the who the is a non terror group trying to undermine the salty regime what jobidon has made nothing but missteps in the middies over and over and over and now they are looking it may be doing the biggest is step of all n the reason the they are doing that is of course because jobidon's radical was is procomass there is a radical part of the democratic cate not the whole democratic party there is a radical part of the democratic party that actually kind of warm torcomoss ho o to sea israel disappear and that radical base does existing places ranging from chico to michigan last night the chico city council there's a twenty three to twenty three ti at the city council and was broken by the more on mayor of chico abandon johns who is presided over the continuing collapse of one of america great cities and om chico voted for a ceasefire in gas which at this plaint i should note there should be the they should actually vote for a ceasefire in chico that be more appropriate considering that there were six hundred and seventeen murders in chic ago last your alone and the in twenty twenty three there are two thousand four hundred fifty two shootings in chico may be the would work on the sense firing chico before they work on these cease fire in gaze but of course this how you please your radical left base in abandon johns is in fact radical leftist idiot you you a were for reive we did it we i it we we we got a sense fire and you got nothing you got nothing ism tired there is no sense firing gowan nor will there be casease firing gaze but you have a much of procomas terror supporters for extremely excited about chico voting for a seas fire and gaze well good news folks i have singularly to cleared world piece it is all your

essay find your path to financial piece of mind that t n you ss ado come slashshipiro that radical left base does matter to jobidon which is why he keeps miscasting the soldiers of people protesting him and shouting about how much they love radical terra groups that murder news and rape women in killbabies in fact hollow radical a certain parts the democraticparty last night in the house of representatives there is a votes the vote was a bill to bar from the united states all comes members and any one involved with these lost terra group october seven the tack on is to that sly a pretty obvious one right like you don't got to come to the united states if you are a member of the terrors group comas seems ration all right or if you ere involved in a direct terror assault that killed twelve hundred people and took two hundred forty people into hostage situations into tunnels if you are involved in that it seems a poison enter the united sit is a base line stuffright there were in fact there is near unanimity in the house for this for this very very easy notion there ware two voters who said no you said no if you are member of comas should be allowed to come into the united states if you are you're involved in in actual terror attack on october seventh you should also be allowed into the united states who er these a truly evil human beings wait for it it is coming representative quarry bush who when she is not expending allegedly tax per dollars to pay off her various relations is is voting in favor of compass and rushed to leave your democrat from terror island over here it it is amazing in a statement to lead said the bill incited hatred against people her what you mean terrorists i i am confused i do not thing wersh a to leave is a derris to she declaring herself in total solidarity with compass terrorist because she saying the quart a loud if she denounced the bill as another grope messaging bill being used to incite anti arab anti palstonian antimuslem hatred that makes communities ours unsafe i should point out at this point that she says the grope messaging bill it literally passed four hundred and twelve too two sir four hundred twenty two two two was the actual vote four under twenty two to two was the actual vote here yet that is hat that is a grope messaging bill in which four hundred twenty to people to one way and she and quarry bush wit the other i again your sort of saying the quart out loud if you say we cannot discriminate against terrorist because people might think the terrorist are museums or that it is inciting anti arab anti palstonian antimuslem hatred to discriminate against compass what are you saying exactly the argument that if you if you pass a crime bill that this going to incite anti black violence am ism not the one saying that crime is black and ism not saying that terror is muscle ism saying terror is terror in compasses compass but richititoly these people to hold sway in this administration they do which is why and the washington post an the media are fully in the scamp the washington post is truly a despicable publication truly despicable they the pease bite personhime yes mean abutaleb in the washington post called michigans grabs and museums pushed to de feet bison in critical state and this entire article is about how terrible jobidon is for supporting israel in its war against compass anna many arab america and muslin voters in deerborn where arab america make up majority the population you remember them doing a palistonian march early colic before even is rally retaliation for the terror attack in which there were actual terriflaxh being flow is resolved not only t with hold his vote from bison but to actively campaign against him some michigan grabs and muscles have launch in abandon biding campaign part of a broader national movements still getting off the ground to insure those in their communityship to cast their vote but not for bison then i con voter tonal trump obvious lake his trump is anymore pros roll then jobidon by every available metric but they are going to yellow jobidon cordon is very scared of the yelling and he has decided apparently he and his statespartment are trying to imide on a new strategy a new strategy for the middle east this strategy involves full scale surrender two terror organizations full scale no stops

surrender the state department is apparently now according to brach ravine reporting for action the state department is now being asked by the secreterstate tony banyan to con duct a review and present policy options on possible guess an international recognition of a palistinian state after the war in gaze according to two es officials briefed on the issue that is insane i m explain why that is insane there is no government the pain an authority does not even govern the wetback it has the approval of zero per cent of the palsnian population by pollingtdad is non zero but it is very close to zero which is why manhood was the eighty eight year old cleptocrat who is stolen billions of dollars from his own people same thing with thismilhonea over in coastland as living at five star hotels and cutter while the rest of his people are living in rubble but the palsinian authority it does not have the approval often people bachmoodbas is currently in the if my mouth is correct nineteenth year of a for year term the last election the was held the was i believe two thousand six in the wetback and it was rigged in favor of machmoodbas that commas would not win and he still serving as unquote president he also rapist be a halicosto lying curator who is walked way from the table on multiplications when presented with a special most recently by a hood clear most generous piecing ever offered to the palsonians you simply walked away from the table to counter offer that is one parity in be governing structure of the palistinian out of t palstinian areas other governing structures is lomatyhot a full terragroup come ass a billon terragroup there is no government there is no government not only that there is no territorial border no borer has been decided upon if you take a look at the wetback it looks in and marshall painting it is all over the place the reason it is all over the places cause you've inter mixed populations because there had never been any sort of state settlement after the sixty seven war now member between nineteen forty and nineteen sixty seven the crab's controlled the west bank and the gasastrip join control bells bank the gastric was control by egypt at no point id egypt tried to care to palistinian state in the goes strip and at no point to organ try to prat to palistonian state in the west bank the grabs do not care about a palistonian state any of these areas in fact they know full well that if a palistonian state were to be created these areas it wold immediately be a terror state directed at them the jordanians are not really in favor of a paten independent palistonian state governed by the palistonian authority o commas the is a direct threat to the hash might regime in jordan the egyptians do not want a palistonian state in the gosistrip that is why they have a border wall that makes israel border will look nothing that called raft gate down the bore between egypt and the gasastrip in other words a palistnian state number one is in no one's interest in the region literally no one a paw including the palistonins because there governing structure would not exist it would be garbage and it would foment terrorism and lead to fullscale war if a palistnian state were actually to exist and then they were to attack israel is would have no humanitarian obligations at all because now you are at war directly with another sovereign state at that point all bets are off but the worst thing for the palistonians would be to have a palistonian state govern by either of the p a or compass there is no governing structure saying that you are going to preemptively to clary palistonian state with no borders no government representative of the people no power powerful enough to even govern the areas that are supposedly governed and no rational for wed this state would somehow make the world a better place more solid why this place would be governed in allegiance to anything fundamentally decent principles as suppose you just becoming a horrifying chorea law state which is what commons wants for example what the hell is jordan thinking what the halls he thinking and mean it is crazy not only is it stupid and morally benighted it also happens to be utterly unrealistic i may as well declare a state of chi perostand somewhere in salty stasis ire many territorial holdings there i do not the borders are there's no government that is prove by the people there but sure men i whys why not manure well just care a state ship perostand it has all of the same qualities as a quoin what state o pakistan no government no government capable of holding territory no government capable of governing people and no rational for existing person but sure it will be great it will be get by the way notice the priority sere from the by demonstration met i can independent curtestand i noticed not are woman independent somalia land i notice not on on the list of p a of peoples who deserve a state right now in the sense that the state washing note threat to western interests an will not be a full on fomenting terror state the palistonian state idea comes dead last it is really low on that prioritialist why exactly is join doing all this and there wo reasons one again is to please his left wing domestic bate and the other reason is because the the state department is filled with morons and the is morons have a peculiar belief that if you simply give terrors what they want than they will be nice to you and that somehow this will foment peace in the region reading the way among these morons as tom is freed en homes freedmen is truly the stupidest person to write on foreign policy in my lifetime it is not particularly close homes freedmen entire bag is what if i travel around get find and dined by random regimes an the right rosy rose colored glasses views of these awful received he is done with a bandit with china it'll go all over the place ill be wine and dine by these serious recipes and that is what stay drivers and those say drivers will will bestow their wisdom upon me and then i will go and meet with jobidoan help to find hits form policy she has a piece today title a bison doctrine for the middle's is forming and it is big what exactly with this began doctrine being he says on one track would be a strong and resolute stand on iron including a robust military retaliation against morons proxies and agents in the region in response to the killing of three you us soldiers at a basin jordan by a drone apparently launch by a prooronian militia in rock case that has not materialized at all there has been no harsh response by the by administration to the murder of three america soldiers in jordan none zero there saying there is strong drone lets ah now we believe you you have high levels of credibility ism sure that you have just yet ism sure ism sure not stating a camel in the ass or blowing up an empty building ism sure jobidon is is taking harsh meatus on the second track says homes ramen would be an unprecedented you us diplomatic initiative to promote a palistonian state now it would involve some form of use recognition of a demilitarized palistonian state in the wetback an gosestrip that would come in to being only once palistonians have developed a set of define credible institutions and security capabilities to insure that the state was viable and that it could never threaten israel oh well i mean under those conditions ism sure palistonian staying pursued right now is definitely going to happen when unicorns are fading energy sure that tat'seumgs that is right around the corn by the way the the message that jobidon an the sates barmen our sending right now but just look at the time line here cordon in the states partner were not pushing the immediate recognition of a palistonian state because its idiocy then october seventh happened twelve hundred news get murdered and now the bi administrations what if we just give them what they want what what is that say what s the message the messages if you kill enough news jobidon will give you a state that is the actual message the actual messages if you murder enough news jobidon will conciliate to your position how dis that strength in the west exactly seriously how is that good four america how is a good ilea because the same logical apple to america presumably that if he kill enough america jobidoenwil just give you what you want is is the most appeasement orient to pals have ever even remotely herd of come ass murders twelve hundred news the palisonian authority has on its books laws that paid people who murder news and the administrations what if we uphold the you and our able you it which the comose front group what if we actually give the palistonian authority a state what if we do all of those things that's be great according to homes freedmen bide administration officials have been consulting experts inside an outside you us government about different forms ut this recognition of palistonian statehood might take has again no expert can simply miscast a palistonian state that is moderate and not a threat to its neighbors into existence they tried to wish c asked into existence during the slow cords that was literally the slow cords and for thirty years we have we have operated in the middle east under this delusion and it is a stupid asinine foolish nincompoops idea ridiculous on the third track according to homes remain would be a vastly expanded you us security lines with soutyarabia which are also involve south normalization of relations with israel if the is really government is prepared to embrace a diplomatic process leading to it militarized palisonian state led by a transform palistonian authority well oka again when the rainbows far when when the unicorns far rainbows i guess that were there if the administration can pull this together a huge if a biding doctrine could become the biggestrategic refinement in the region since the ninety seven nineteen seventy nine camp day v treaty well and and if i could and if i could somehow solve the problem cold fusion energy would be free what but by the way what is amazing about homes freeman's idiot plan which is now being embraced again by the idiot by d administration of use lord t idiot horologic truly these people are are mentally deficient the what what funny about this is that pursued two of these three tracts and was successful dona trump lash took harsh antimonial action dona trump he killed custom solemn the had of the floods force put the harshest sanctions in america history on iron a no did it contained iron he made clear that if a on crossed lines they would get clocked in the face a noderondid they shot up meanwhile your call the true administration made warm overtures toward the sorties and toward the a eon bahrain an dor morocco a you they did they'll may piece oft itzrel and sold he was going to do it too in other words the centrality of the palistinians to anything remotely piece in the idle east is not only a my it is a pernicious and counter productive y but that is exactly do bide administration is now embracing why because they are wetted to their own stupid form policy they cannot separate themselves from a number one and number two they are getting black mail by their own voting was in they do not have the strength of character to recognize that actually not supporting terror regimes in the establishment of state might be good policy meanwhile et yean musk has come under fire because plan musk is not of the left a plan musk is the most creative ontropernor of our time by far which diced the richest man in the world he start a multiplicity of unbelievably interesting companies ranging from tesla which is a great company to spasms which is in my opinion even a greater company a e hes is simply a singular figure in modern western wife is is an incredible figure which is why peopleare coming after him they are all fine with him he was he was the ontropanore who is interesting and fascinating and quirky an all of the stuff until the point he bought acts as soon as he started making sounds that he liked free speech and wanted to open up the auspices of of social media two various all turn of opinions the world came down around his ears and what we are watching right now is a political bice against melon musk turned into a legal bice against learn musk the legal system when we talk by the legal system being perverted i mean this is a natural perversion of the legal system according to fox business a delftware judge ruled in favor of tesla in vectors who sued to challenge a fifty six billion dollar prepackage for la us the decision dares to boldly go where no man has gone before or least where no delftware court has tread the opinion states the collection of feature's characterizing musk's relationship with tessland its directors gave him enormous influence over tesla in her ruling the judge said that the plaintive entitled to decision meaning that the shareholders tesla sued to basely call back a fifty six billion dollar prepackage to musket get into the paypckg in a seconds of sis bigger prepackage anybody's ever heard of why did that happen a get in then a second shoe directed the two parties to confer on a final form of order to implement her decision and submit a joint letter identic lying all issues including fees that need to be addressed to bring the matter to conclusion at the trial level she added that vessel was put unable to prove that the stockholder or vote was fully form because the proxy statement inaccurately setae described key directors is independent and misleadingly omitted details about the process now the problem is that the prepackage that musk negotiated with tesla was widely deride it at the time as basically empty verbiage that would never materialize because effectively speaking musk deferred all compensation to a future pay package tied to the increase in the stock valuation of tesla plus earnings that is what happened and everybody knew about it because it was h most widely remarked upon c e o this is is most widely remarked upon c e o pay package literally in human history vessel's agreement with musk is the largest compensation ever provided to an executive to major factor and making one o the world's wealthiest individuals what happened is that he was not guarantee any salary this is commented upon by drew to work and back in twenty eighteen and here is what hero just to make clear what the judge is doing judges takes muslin as decided to scrub but here is wat at what actually happen here quote test's plan musk may have the boldest pay planting corner history for the last several years there is been speculation about plan musk's future at tesla and whether he would step down as chief executive in the next year or too mister muss stoke to that speculation as far back as five years ago when he said he wanted to stay through the introduction of the model three and then in twenty fourteen he said it'll have to we how things are going at that point with the success of musk varia souther endeavors spasects who only natural that investors would expect at the model for sober down junior's tony stock might move on to a different role a tessera four years later and musk has now decided to stay friend for a declare by the way was a decade long contract this is twenty eighteen what exactly was the compensation plan again the zandrosorkan quote mister musk will be paid only if he reaches a series of draw dropping milestones based on the company's market value and operations otherwise he will be paid nothing in other words the compensation package o the musk is receiving was solely incentive base it is not as though he find a contract with tell with all his friends with he just gave him fifty six billion dollars at the time that all this happened the valuation of tesla total was sixty billion dollars twenty luxe share there's the valuation of test when the some the steal it's a prove by eighty per cent of test shareholders the plan required him to grow market cap by fifty billion dollar increments with the first milestone starting at a hundred billion dollar valuation the final milestone with six hundred fifty billion dollars melon musk at a time when the company was valuated in public markets at sixty billion dollars signed a contract saying i only get my pay package if i hit ten if i if i hat eleven as basically if i take the current value of tesla and multiply by eleven then i get this pay package now if you are a shareholder that is a great deal because if we hit that ism habit pay him and we do not hit that then we do not pay him great deal right would you make that deal with your boss to day or with your company would you make the y'all you'll take any pay tit at you you defer all your wages no no payment of anything but if your company increases by eleven times in doll then you get a big bones eleven notice not three times eleven times in dolly would you take that you very few people would musk is a risk seeking dolly and tesla shareholders the again what is the problem here this is a great deal teslas said a dozen targets each fifty billion dollars more than next starting at a hundred billion than a hundred fifty than two hundred all the way on to six hundred fifty billion dollars also the company that he down revenue and adjusted profiteroles muscle receive one point senate million shares or about one per cent of the company only after he reaches milestones for both but as anverostore can wrote of the time this is twenty eighteen to put these numbers in perspective tesla is only worth about fifty nine billion dollars to day if muster somehow able to increase the value of tested a six hundred fifty billion dollars a figure many experts would content is laughably impossible and would make vestal one the five largest companies in the u s based on turn valuations histocka word could be worth as much as fifty five billion dollars musk's critics actually at the time complained that it was a publicity stuns that there is no way he would reach any of these numbers until the whole point of the exercise was to suggest the test is bigger then it was it is impossible for him to manipulate the systems said and boss organ by trying to prop up the stock price for its temporary period because even once his shares vest yest a hold them for five years before he can sell them we cannot actually gat the shares that were fifty six billion and then immediately turn round and sell them and under cut the value often company cannot do that the judge struck down what is again one of the most risk laden pay packages in america history because musk et his marks that is insane its actually quite evil if you take a risk a new benefit from that rest by benefiting all the shareholders to the extent that everybodywho bought in it twenty this a person who on not the person wo start f this owned nine shares of tesla nine those shares of tesla at the time the musk sign this pay package those shares of tesla were the price at twenty dollars tesla shares to day our tradetongat one hundred and eighty eight dollars youron't get to wine about that ism sorry you do not that is an absurd contention and just demonstrates once again there are members of the judiciary who do not give any raps about property rights or the rule of law of kat just one second we will get to social media hearings on the hill which again it is fascinating to see the sort of coalition that is built against big tax from the right the creative make sense from the left

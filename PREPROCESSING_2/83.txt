polistinin people have been subjected to fifty cixcias of suffocating occupations this is simply put jaw hatred full stop jaw hatred it is apology for terrorism it ignore reality the vasomotor palicinians live under the direct palestinian rule whether commas in the got a strip or the palcinian authority in the wetback but worse than that it reverses reality it lavs the blame for a genicitle

likening military operations to killterras toter operations attempting to kill villains all in the name of international law and human rights these are lies and they are disgusting lie and that is the point if butters and the international community can somehow acquaint israel with its terrorist enemies they can achieve their actual gold which is the survival of the terrorist group commas once

israel from defending itself perpetuate the called cycle of violence make it harder for israel to survive continue the u ans mission to destroy the jewfish state the united nations is a garbacip of epic proportions is not merely a useless organization that cost the united states over twelve billion dollars every year it is an epic failure of an organization the provides covered for the world's worst human right trousers and actively foments u hatred and murder in the mideleast the united nations general assembly is dominated by nations who hate israel and care little for human rites which is we from twenty fifteen to twenty twenty two the u n general assembly adopted one hundred and forty resolutions against israel it adopted one against north core one againstaffganistan zero againstvenzuela zero against comes zero against china in fact the entire rest of the world combined merited a grantor of sixty eight resolutions of condemnation israel supposedly merited a hundred and forty the u ans particular hatred for israel has been a long running theme which of course make sent some fifty six member nations are also members of the called organization of is gamic cooperation the vast majority of which are directed overtly against israel but it means that u n has served as the propaganda arm for curators lover the glue for decades in nineteen seventy five at the behest of the movie union for example the united nations general assembly passed a resolution to claringzinism the political movement for jewishome land racism prompting u s ambassador to the u n dance iatric unhand to declared that u n had made antisemitism international law one hand added a great evil has been used upon the world nothing in the nature of than has changed since the united nations has an entire department dedicated to forcing anti israel propaganda and terrorism the united nations relief and work agency was founded in remember nineteen forty nine with the purpose of dealing with refugees from the nineteen forty eight israel war of independence arab refugees that is the eight hundred thousand news expelled from arab and muslin lands in the same time period those people ware simply taken in by israel the arbnationsof course took in none of the palestinian refugees the u an a la is in fact the only agency at the u n dedicated to one specific population and it has helped keep that population refuge he camps fort seventy years the u and our ta is almost entirely staffed by members of the palsinian a community it is in fact a global sponsor welfare organization with twenty three thousand palisinian arab employs and just one hundred can professionals from elsewhere it is not u n organization it is a ma work organization that works very very closely with compass is loci g hod the palcinian authority you an r w has never condemn comate agenda e routinely hers members of compass and is logic g hod one of w and r is chief tasks is running dozens of palstinian schools you and r w s might predict then helps in doctrine palstinian arb school children in u hatred according to a marks report from united nations watch u and w a has overseen the broad

which is we comma's political leader is smalcanea is a and r w graduate as b rs r ones the forme comas chief sos ham macadamia he master mi behind cosses military structure you and r w resources are also dedicated to helping terrors groups more directly you and r w vehicles have been used to transport terrors and weapons that includes ambulances u and r w a schools have been used by compass to

purpose of this is that if israel tries to strike a terratunnel it has to hitoschool for all these reasons the trump administration cut off contributions from the united states to the u and r w then present bison in all of his vast wisdom restored hundreds of millions of dollars in running much of which undoubted wen directly to commas over the course of last couple of years the administration gave the u and r w some seven hundred million dollars of your tax par many the is why back in february represent of schipbroy of texts called for the defending of u an r a noting quote you and r is lengthy and detailed history of promoting antisemitism violence and terrorism through educational materials and its continuative to compass should completely disqualify this corrupt entity from

teacher same ahead on sundae morning as compass terrorists invaded is really towns going to hillanur he celebrated allay is the greatest above imagination have out you and aril imitate tuition by sheer hams gang right after the massacre he share a post praising the murderers ask quote martyrs of the agamic anarabnation were marked in defending their home land and nation in none of this is a surprise this is what the can is all about it is not an exception it is not a few bad apples the n as been run as an antis metic organization from basically a few years after its inception until right now the united nations is the disgrace it has never fulfilled its commanding the purpose of the can was originally expressed in its charter quote to save succeeding generations from the score of ware which twice in our lifetime has brought untold para to mankind and to real from faith in fundamental human rights in the dignity and worth of the human person and the equal rights to men and women of nations large and small and to establish conditions under which justice and respect four obligations arising from treaties and other sources of international law can be maintain and to remote social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom the can has achieved almost none of these goals the united nations was establish primarily by the united states in the aftromafabl record to an an attempt to creating a called family of nations it has been a full skilled disaster area ever since serving more as a propaganda tool on behalf of third world autocracies then on behalf of the institution for defense of democracy that served at its initial mission the united nations should be disbanded the u us should defended thou and building should be fumigated and rededicated to something more useful manufacturing manure never again should anyone pretend that the united nations has the power of the moral highground in fact it really never did in just one second we will get to the latest on the grounds in israel and we will see the rest of the middle eastern autocracies again hiding with camass that is one of the things tat is happening right now which is prompting a call for was fires a in moral clarity disappeared that as magic first last month ha g twenty announce to plan to impose digital currencies and digulizies on their respective populations the g twenty or

their part obviously they are fighting mad add the secretary general of the united nations making excuses for comas and suggesting that basically burning babies alive in their bad that is just the predictable response to land disputes as effectively what the can is is now claiming glad er don who is the usually ambassador to the united nations here is what he had toss the you an the fain in you is the secretary genera have lost old moradathe and impartiality because when you say those terrible words then these hands the fact did not happen i of oakum you are tolerate thin terrorism of course that is absolutely true hat's absygbut of course whats happening the can is in happening in vacuum either meaning the constituent nations of the can the people have to vote in you and general assembly the people just proportionately comprised the you and general assembly are in fact nations that are either autocracies or sympathetic to terrorists and that is just the reality of the world an notes an ugly reality for for us in the west to contemplate is the fact that not everybody things us that people do not agree with us that we canal talk it out over a cup of tea across a table but the reality is that many of the same people who you see folks suggesting are rational actors in this region are in fact dedicated two the destruction of the west they do not the west they think the west is bad one of those people is the president of turkey the dictator of turkey recreate pay up rowan rowan who shifted turkey away from being a a secular quasi democracy in the early two thousands and toward being in atomic fundamentalist tutorship rowan is a sponsor his a statesponser of terrors i he sponsors comas you will recall that just recently there are some commentators who are suggesting that he ought to play honest broker between israel and comas which is a joke it is ridiculous well yesterday he just came out squarely in favor of mamas he said the mas is not a terrorist organization instead they were a quit liberation group fighting a battle to protect their land which is weird because i did not realize their land included far ora and realize that their land included but berry but apparently according to rowan it s of because worse all of that is islamic land rowan then claim that israel had taken advantage of turkey's good intentions and the he cancel the visit to israel because he said the israel is fighting in inhumane war against camps that is rich coming from the same country that return violates human rights whether it against armenia or whether it is ins others in the region he said comas is not a terrorist organization of course this the it t that he says to is own parliament one of the i things to understand i at least is that what many of the dictators say too western media is not the same stuff they say in their own language to their own people but they casually mean is the stuff they say in their own language to their own people he then blamed the united states suggesting that people outside the original quote on quit adding fuel to the fire in the name of supporting israel turkey is suppose tore moderate states turkey you will recall is a member of dato which is ridiculous the idea that if their reverent tack on turkey that dato members would be obligated t come to turkey's defense is insane that is totally crazy it is not of course just croon seaman last night had on queen renew of jordan let us be clear about the hashemite kingdom of jordan the hashemie kingdom of jordan exists because the wet the weapon you o by a colonial outpost the hashemik kingdom of jordan is colonial almost her literally a tribal family those elevated to royalty in a made up country call jordan if you think that jordan has a historic basis with hashed kingdoms it does not it does not it was created from exactly the same cloth it was it was brutish and a palestine and the jordan was carved off and the hashemites were given control of the kingdom because the land disputes overt over control of syria for example and in order to placate the hashemites they were given control of jordan but the the land of jordan is populated almost entirely by on quit palistonian grabs meaning people who wore descended from people who were living in brutish mans a palestine at the time of the creation of jordan queen erne is one of them by the way queen renew is is a palisinian arab but she is also a member of the hashemite royal family if that hash royal family would cross the population the population would kill her and her had would gentle that is effectively what hat goes in jordan choose interviewed on tuesday night bysianan she is supposed to be a a quasi western moderate here she was pretending the commotion comittatrocities now do i really think that queen renew thinks that commas comittitrocty's course not of course not but truth does not have quite the same value in this part of the world as it does in say the west and she also knows that again if she were to come out against comas if she were to condemn comas there is a good shot that she and the rest of her family would be dead again the young talk about colonial outpost colonial outpost would be the kingdom of jordan hat is a colonial post that is a that is a left over from the britishmandate in any case here is queen renew denying that commas committed atrocities i am not arguing accuracy at christie ism arguing equivalence and and doubletandet here when the present of the united the is is told that the in e has evidence i in evidence of children behead o only to a try because the idheaccent e isn't proof of that that is confirmation by is even at your newer christangano the the thiamin website a at the beginning of the confident a report e headline of at is three children found busted in the stay to robots and when you read the story that's not isn't been independent they verified no my question to you would you p wish and fun an dancing yet unbar bar fie cane made by a petithinian o queen i i just any to sit up an you right the because the the have been pictures shown by the ladies and an o john its the been down the ism not looking about beheading ism token about babies bodies riddled with with bolts and things of course she is standing for compass of course she is but just the full on hollocoss level denial right there from the queen of jordan that is what this region is and if anybody pretends otherwise they are blinding themselves to the reality all get to for from queen renew ins they a again she is a western moderate work pop to where else pop to pretend that the this a moderate kingdom here moderation i is not quite the same thing in the middle east first god tell you mi sleep holiday lately has not been

ben case again back to queen renew this it this notion that the the world is a collection of minded nations just have to talk it out is ridiculous is why the united nations as a premise was always idiotic it was always idiotic pretending that the united states in china are going to gets other room in side on world policy is stupid it is stupid it is always been stupid that is the that is the security council been stupider is imagining that the general assembly is anything but a collection of some the worst nations on plantergalic sudan making world policy yet inland given the same vote as as tibia it is it is wild and insane and stupid n the fact anybody treats this this way is once again evidence of a cultural atone centrism that comes with the west one the great ironies of the anti hate centrism at movement from people toward sided who are the book orientalist suggesting hat the west had a a dim view of of quote the oriental cultures and that that had led them to colonialism and a partied an all the rest of it and really really that that is that those ignorant we should study those cultures from the inside ironically that has led to a new sort of ethnocentrism in which select assumes that everybody things members of the west and thus everyone can be trusted and treated as moderate e queen ria again is welcomed in capitals around the world as some sort of moderate while she stands for commons me here she was yesterday talking about its glaring double standard for the world to defend israel defending itself from terrorist in the last couple of winks we have seen i n ignoring double haunted in the world when october seventh happened the world immediately and unequivocally stop by israel and at try to defend itself condemned a the attack that happened but when we looker thing that as couple of weeks we have not was sing silent in the world and in od the countries ta stop a just expressing concern or acnoneging the casualties but always with a preface of decoration of support a for israel and e are we being told that it is wrong to kill a a family an entire family at gone point but it is o k to show them to death an in there is a claim to levant such trash i such ration as obviously morally equivalent trash by the way this is the same kingdom that massacred that massacred three thousand palistinians in nineteen seventy and expelled twenty thousand palistinians just to get rid of its radicals out em bring that up ever wherever by the way the tordanian security services are not known for being particularly nice to palistinian radicals you know likes if they were they be overthrown but again this is all it is all running games when the west pretends moral equivalence and that moral equivalence allows them to to pressure israel into cunquld two state solutions and all the rest pressuring israel to bring fuel into the gossistrips that commoscan use it by the way aerial photophore the common currently has half a million gallons of fuel available to it its using all of it presumably to support it is terraced operations meanwhile the called peace process partners that israelspos we are lying on a paliscnian authority whilst return today long before commossmilitons burst out of their gossip stronghold mask or scores of civilians with hand guns and assail rifles a rand on is allies that accelerated efforts to smuggle weapons into a different part of the palsonian territories the west bank using drones secret airline flights and allay bridge the traverses hundreds of miles ad at least four national borders the smuggling operation is raising the fever of a new conflagration in the war between israel and palistinians impose the growing thread to jordan a staunch yours ally which borders israel an the west bank and has been struggling to contain a growing flow of drugs and arms around once yo turn jordan into a transiteria for weapons going into israel at amen all sail you under why jordan is standing for comas because they are also held hostage bacomases allies that would be the reason and et at the same time it is the west promoting the idea that israel has to make concessions to these same exact people is the pain an authority which is allow all of this say happen and which pays by again they sign checks to the families of the terrorists with your taxpayer dollars by the way since your the one to a sending money ism sending money to the palsinan authority right now it is absurd meanwhile israel continues to fight an existential war for it is a them tat accistential war is nothing to end with the destruction of compass because that warsgoan continue cosbalon israel northern harder as have said before i is a ma is a much higher threat to the existence of the state of israel than compasses compass is dangerous to news causblaw is dangerous in the high existence o the state of israel s the israel is stretched thin that has to fight a war with compass in the gassy strip and has to simultaneously fight a war with palsinian authority n this comic good terrace in the called wetback and a has to fight a war with cusbalat in the north maybe with scrawl that's an existential threat for israel israel facing a long turn battle for its survival here benjamin inti a whose spokes person talking about comas citizen we least have to take compass of the table when i can live next to a genicitle threat here was bees spoke person at talhinreth all right now we have war than seven thousand and seven hundred pockets that have been firedthat is really territory since the outbreak off this war that we did not star the war that we did not not we did not even expect we were drag and drag into it by the comastereganization and we stand was a nation we have taken this very important decision that we can no longer live next to an existential genocidal threat this is the only reason why we are operating in gas right now and we will ring and ends to the comas regime in gaze whence we are done they will not have any kind of governing bodies for military wing a comaskan simply be no longer now the only question is when of the west is going to actually allow israel to do that or wit thegn tried to tie their hand far the by administration has been sending a few mixed signals yesterday in good signalling john curly the annas a spokes person he said that a the idea of an immediate sees fires i ridiculous and halls mass which of course is true in i an why ti o mind to t thin in a begin to speculate on that i know that that si that those are potentials steps that haven't happen yet and at may not happen all i can tell you is we are get tit continue to make sure israel has the tools on to capabilities that they need to defend themselves get tin continue to try to get the him inti their assistance an were en ti continue to try to get hostages and people out of gosaappropriately and as that think you heard us say a sea fire right now really only benefit tombs yo secretary state anyone blinking also added were not seeking conflict of the on we a on to back off but if iron attacks america forces obviously we respond how we have respond and let me say what were consistently said to baronial officials through other chances the united states does not seek conflict with a ronde do not want this for to wit but if felon or its proxies attack you us personal anywhere make no mistake we will defend our people we will defend our security swiftly and decisively the question is whether that is going to be true in action far the aronians have been launching attacks on america and america allies throughout the region according to the wall sure journal from more than six months aria back militia groups fore trained from launching drones or rock its against america troops in rock and syria that came to an abrupt end when you as official sent iron back grows launch ten drone an rock at attacks against you as bases you as troops use in rock and another three on space in south east syria the attacks were carried out between outtober seventeen and october twenty fourth in one of the attacks at all olid air base in a rock last week you as troops shot a militia groups drone out of the sky and then fellontobin of america run in destroyed it in yeomen ironing back truths fired five at eonian prided crews missiles and launch about thirty drone sort is real and attack those larger than initially described by the pence on last week you as sets carney guided missile destroyer which was operating in the northern red see shock down four of the crews missiles while fifth crews missile was intercepted by tautyarabia protecting its on air space the pens on has deployed nearly a don't a tired systems to controls a cross the it a least ahead of mistrals expected land invasion of got of thy move missile launchers to a rock syria and the gulf according to you as officials the pens on has also sending terminal high altitude area defense or that two salurabia and patois surface her missiles to quite jordan epoch saudyra about cutter and the united aerbemerats in the expectation that iron goes plastic if israel decides that is going to go in and wipe out comose compost obviously is in baronial proxy and iron does not want see them taken off the board the question is going to be whether iron tries to call the uses bluff the be worst mistake never made by the way a i i truly believe that even a as much as i am afraid of the weakness of bid administration as much as they send make signals if america bases a fully attack if you a ship ps a tax it will be the worst thing aronever did for itself the be a huge mistake which is why in the end i think the on is signalling about i do not think there action can in do anything overwhelming right now what they are doing is pursuing low level conflict sufficient to let everybody know that they are upset they are pursuing low level conflict sufficient to type is really forces in the north for example to signal to comose they want them to continue what they're doing but again i do not think that heron is irrational enough to step over the line with the united states in the region meanwhile the bide ad ministration again those mixed signals our wild yesterday i place to clip of careen job pierce the press secretary for the white house absolution compel en teriblator job being asked about rising antisemitism the united states pretending it does not existed that immediately launching into speech about is lamaphobia yesterday she had to walk that back because again she is terrible at er job i want her make something clear at the top cause i understand how important a more clarity is especially at this time when dues are targeted because of their beliefs or their identity when israel singled out because of anti wish hatred that is antisemitism and that is unactheptible there is no place for antisemitism full stop period this is important to the president it is important to me personally and to every one in the administration following the harsh teratacs an israel which were the delis for u since the holiest the president has been consistent and clear we must all do our part and forcefully forcefully speak out against antisemitism and we must injure that there is no place for hate an america may you now be a great start would be expelling or shouted to leap from congress is still have yet to see any members of congress actually asked about rescued try who continues to maintain by the way falsely that israel bomb the hospital in posit she continues to maintain that despite all evidence of the contract does not matter her be of course she is a pathological lie any terror supporters that of course is no shock ell one of the reasons that the world feels capable of slipping back into this ridiculous moral equivalents the the soft lukewarm bath water of moral relativism is because the media do it for them the me you make it superheavy last night for example see an en to earn brunette is talking bout the conditions under which hostages are being held there still two hundredpluss hostages for being held in bondage by heroes an again the world community seems to have far less words for comossholding hostages than they do for israel trying to kill members of homos an a is here is he earn brunette weirdly praising the conditions under which hostages are being held have never heard this before ones they've never heard a situation which a hostage is taken babies the elderly and the year yes but they do have sins what the what the at what then thinks stand out and there then lindane necessity right your talking about tunnels we know these tunnels and thantilation we now that they they known that there conditioning that this is all been wording that we have heard from the rails over the are but the fact that she sang she was held under ground for more than two weeks i that there ware shame poo the was ana politics there was a hard per hostage an the experience she had in that there were magics and paramedics and to this a she is elderly the other woman who is released also elderly and pragmatical means and that they had the medicine needed in an not something to similar to replace it i it is pretty stunning because you'd got a contrast that with what is happening above the ground right where there is not water never mind shame oo hoke they do not have water there is not toilet water there is no morphine for any kind of i amputations ana politics no right but omasa stock piled all that and has all that under ground and that is at we are learning from her that is that is we are where why we describing the object of the to tat works mean what what she should be saying an bereft the logical conclusion of what she should be saying there is because commons cares about keeping terrorist and does not give a rap battle pavilions but of course signal is never going to go quite that far again morel equivalents to hellvedrog by the way in a good move from the other side of the isle flora's university system working with governor rotosantis ordered colleges on tuesday to shut down a propalistinian student organizations be a promos organization the students for justice in palatine which is leading a lot of these procomas protests all over the place administrators have said that national eta identified itself as pat of composes attack and was a felling he under floral law to provide material support to designated foreign terrorist organization that of course is a positive move have seen some people claiming that to mantis is somehow not pro israel enough that is a bazar statement considering he is the most pro israel politician in america and the most effective on that score by an extraordinarily long shot and meanwhile your staring s e fall out at the university level the universities have always relied on these major donors we been giving to their almamaders in order to prop them up well now finally some of the liberal news been given lot of money to these organizations are realizing that actually they been contributing money to people who do not care about the murder of their to religionists at all d there starting to pull their cash well get to that momentarily first the regular basepelseason is now officially over that does not mean the for has to end last night

schematism all over the globe that is not relegated for countries the is very true here in the united states as well which is why you are starting to see some downers and major america universities look at the universities in realize exactly what it is that they have done the universities have full sale embrace the d colonization narrative than narrative started with people phronsfanone back in the nineteen fifties nineteen sixties claiming that the a that the third world was going to d colonize would have to involve violence against western institutions those western institutions were evil an they had to be done away with the is going be a violent movement there's a lot of sympathy for that in left wing circles marks a circles particularly that united with the intern sectional critical fury movements to produce the idea that d colonization was not just to project for the thirdworld of something at happened had happen here at home which is why you see black lives matter united with the fans canon revolutionaries this is why you see queers for pakistan for example that is what that is and that is the leading bleeding edge of the ideal logical revolution at these major universities it is why you see mass protestant universities in favor of commons in which you see again the local trains group marching and does not he make sens from the outside accept that gift understand this o deconcld coalition of the wretched the coalition of the oppressed and an they are rising up against the institutions of the west is not attack on israel and attack on western institutions as western institutions a lot of people who are sort of liberal hollowed fellow travellers we are fine with this for a long time out the tight came we we also we know weren't we do not love the institutions and and it buses us some street card wit the left wing if we pretend along and the the hollowed fellow travellers the people that the tom wolf described in a very famous assay written in the late nineteen sixties called radical seek that party at pennies which is all about heard burnsteen the left winger who hosted the black panthers at his apartments an the black panthers were telling clothe why you tat the want to kill him anallthe white people ware patting them on the head in posing for pictures with them because that what they do because it meant that they were cool tow that that that sort of attitude has lasted until now except for at a certain point exercising that these people ashy you want a kill run their not joking and that they are not actually car friends and that in fact they are perfectly fine with watching your compatriots get murdered unto your starting to see liberal jeishtowners and major universities and and other liberals we are not happy with the start to pull their money according to the waster journal heaved makourmen was an israel celebrating a holiday by dancing it t a tor in ingot when homes attack the country earlier this month when is all soda the university of pensylvania but out a statement a few days later that all the vassal terrific but did not explicitly con themhomas he was on cents he simply pulled his money top university such as hazard an pen our facing back lash from alumni angry about the schools reactions to the attacks and they are after math some say t was the final straw after years of going dis enchantment with the schools over what they see as they left word political shift that includes people president very summers used to be the the president of hazard university retell billion are leste

giant do not revolt for people road louder and a pliable management sieve executive mark roan they are pulling their money as well as hell they should it is beyond time all all the masks are coming about the only the only thing that i can say about what what has happening the last three weeks is thar all the masks are currently off all of them they are are more masks and that is why the world look ugly today and you see the west struggling to please put the mossback on please put it back on let's pretend that everybody's moderate let us pretend that the two state solution is really the answer let us pretend that was happening on college campsite just another fun aspect of free speech diciest pretend but just pretend but everybody can tell that is bulgrab everyone can tell all the masks are off and people are being forced to take sides people do not taken sides and again they are rushing for the moral equivalents they're looking there grasping its pros begging for any excuse to go back to stash duo any but guess what the world was never statisqlant is all got it wrong and a certain point you canto have to recognize you got it wrong if you wish to live in the real world and make the real worlds better place it turns out that the world of fancy an i lusionyou bit up in your mind where everybody is your potential friend and the introsectional collision there all o your buddies and all these people who have been openly calling for revolution against western institutions with t israel is the tip of the spear that all those people we are not lying they were saying in directly your face and you in your great sophistication and wisdom decided that they did not understand they're own little hearts you were more broad minded than they were you understood what they really really wanted and that was a lie you are pretending the some them were lined you some of them ere pretending that they what they we want its two state solution in israel what they really wanted was a little bit more lee way when it came to criminal justice reform but it turns out that loveless people they were lined you then's he they wanted it all anyway they said to their own friends is something very different than what they said to you and people are starting to realize that and and what maybe that is the only silver lining to horrifying situations the is is that reality tends to generate its own solutions a meanwhile the republicans continued to battle over who will be the not speaker of the house this battleicantinued yesterday when tom ever when down to flaming defeat tom ever of course was a minisota congress person who was running for speaker of the house he was considered by some people to moderate because he was presume sex marriage dona trump try to torpedo in but the reality is that he was going down flaming to feet anyway was not really trump that did it trump mistaken credit for it but trump back morning that and put him over the top but this makes trump happy according to political just ours after tom amen one the publican conference is nomination to be house speaker on tuesday former president on trump took to truth social to deride him as i quit a totally out of touch with e publican voter's globalist know heathen got on the full members to express his aversion framer and his bid for speaker by tuesday afternoon he said he is done it is over i killed him and just minutes later me officially dropped out of the race now again the chance is that that me was going to move ford anyway were pretty low not just was trumptan support hid but because he just did not have the the can m under the table friendships that enough people needed in order to to get to two seventeen the the latest hominy is apparently mike johns is my johnsongan gets tosentin who o the helm's first the republicans had to hold an another celebration about torpedoing another hominy math talk agreensias it is good that tom ever is out here was yesterday i you come to cate to him ta you your could not change your kinin your your sort of were lock i on opposing in i i car the man can the combats him i in our well call tat and a is axis ta let a er ma i there was for conversation that wit and when on an the compass bat i he the croon and and i think e pier e to the top he compass that chain and its changing toe play o maria first i and we publican papers tavern seemingly the per prasidat true and the toy combats anespeakera to i did the than c i mean that that is all on good accept the maccarthy also supported trump and true support od maccarthy and gets use end him anyway that was weird now math have agree who voted gainstousing mac earthy but for what is worth but there is no question that hurting the republican to this point as republican represented mike flood of zebras is had is hurting methridden cars not an an accurate comparison are you in was spear i was speaker of the brat an uni camera legislature which by the way is officially not parts tan i like train cap an ta than an o m an and what i got tho washington i thought be uni cameral follow me to the bra to washincan be the a no party that the let no party leadership a it it reminds me

for the job to day will get to h is chance is victory being the next speaker which are better than tom emmers and apparently him shortens and stevescaleses and kepmac cartels by the way we are only bout two hundred and sixteen member s away from getting back to kepmac career we go round the endless wheel of speakers get to that momentarily first city knows that i need to have my black rifle

seems to think maybe the answers yes maybe this long national nightmare fore publicans is coming to an end quote late tuesday night represented of mike johns became the latest hope conference hominy this time there is no backbiting none to me hims notes and army comments reports just cheers and an overwhelming cense of relief is not over yet three law makers voted present during a roll call pole of the conference twenty two hope law makers were absent is possible the might be decisive handful of never mikes hiding out there but the lack of vocal opposition and surfeit of genuine enthusiasm that was air last night on opposing sides o the house topee marked a significant shift after three weeks of chaos mike's the straightforward leader who can unite us as re publicans wrote represent him carols hyenas of flora was one of the sentries who has been who is been not voting for some the nominees johns is the right guys height time as represent chippy who is of course on the right of the coulis represent of kenbuck of colorado he said i think he gets it to morrow johns is not anyone's first choice far from it on the first ballet on tuesday morning he garnered only thirty fourevotes but he does not have a lot of enemies because the lot lower profile then a lot of the o the republicans far in the house all the other people have made enemies johns not much he is a fifty one year old three port native he came into elective politics into thousand sixteens he has men in the house all that long but he is the chairman of the republican study committee as the former arise chairman an current chair of judiciary sub committed he is sort of a worked guy he does not have a lot of outward ambition and he sort of the guy who they came to in the end he would be the least experience speaker in the history of the house he is in his fourth full her ankh's never served in senior leadership at all he is not big fun razor hehsome of some of things that can come up obviously is that he w as in organizer of an amigos brief in favor of overturning the the certification of electoral votes but it does seem the r publicans are finally tired of this and johns is the least offense of guy on the lock ism our he we find tat the job ism sure he well because everyone as the same on times of structure youknowho to find any of these people the one thing that has to changes if he takes the job hast get rid of this idiotic rule where by he needs republican unanimity in order to go forward he he he cannot continue to b speaker of the house with the rule in place that any member at any time can call effectively for no confidence but against him that beats to stop right to hell now here is represent of johns last night announcing his speakership bid what if they gall the restore wait it as been liter r de secrecy is messy sometimes be it is our system this concretthat you see this house ropopican majority is you hinted and well that would be nice because it seems their some things to do perhaps the re publicans this timewill get their act together and if not then the endless weed speaker candidates will continue o ki meanwhile the economy continues to cool down a in re publicans have been provided a target rich environment by the bi n administration e one the world on fire nearly everywhere you have the economy continuing to overheat to spites radically increase interstates right now according to the walls journal we have the highest bond yields in sixteen years quote the yield on us treasury ten your treasury touch five percent on money for the first time in sixteen years after climbing rapidly in recent weeks that is among many borrowing close including for other long torment government get mortgages credicards auto purchases business ones that could slow the surprisingly resilient economy rising rates come on top of other potential impediments for the economy those include the conflict in he middle east the long labor strikes meanwhile hire yields lift borrowing cost for the out government amid ballooning national at the economies rain strong over the past year if hire long turns rates persist they could increase the risks of a broader and deeper downturn rather than the called soft landing those higher ate are can a crime consumer spending but more than more than ever what this means that it just very hard to take out nu debt as the bond yields continued to increase what you are going to see effectively speaking is very difficult monetization of the debt that is we also canine money that is is now being shifted away from the took marking toward the downmarket when yields are this high and you can secure a five per cent yield on bonds that is u as a pretty solid yield on bonds are get a bed in the stock market on the other side the only reason not to is because you think that the federal government is in a raise the interest rates and the old bonds are can be worth less the they are even now which could happen all the suns certainty is crating enormous friction in the economy meanwhile jobidens plan is you spend more money not just on fore policy he is now calling for fifty billion dollars more on urgent domestic needs the my just he has one solution and more cowbell he us needs of firehouse with money and he sh can are fired everywhere the proposed legislation we will all for more running for child car high speedintern at access n natural disaster let and fire fightales fire fighters battling wild fighters among other domestic policy priorities according to the white house office of management and budget director cholansa young is the washington post reporting it is non clear how much running the president will propose for each program again the white house just recently on vile that one hundred and six billion dollar eight package primarily focusing on running for you crane and israel an includes titan aid and include some bore security stuff and now he is hating on top of tat another fifty billion dollars is why the hello it is non as though if we just keep spending into an inflationary economy the inflation will continue that the that that would that that be crazy that is exactly what he is doing by the way and it is going to continue meanwhile the u a w continues its strike that as now been going on for weeks and weeks and weeks unions all over the countryare looking at the by administration as a patsy and somebody they can play in force into a position of taking in anti management position and more and more unions are looking at the possibility of striking and creating

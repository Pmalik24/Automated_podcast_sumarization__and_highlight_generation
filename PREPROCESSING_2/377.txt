welcome to the supermen lad guest series where i and an expert guest i gust science an science a who pecan i mad your supermen and am o professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine today's episode marks the sixth and final of the sixth episode series on fitness exercise and performance and to day's discussion is all about nutrition and supplementation to maximize your fitness exercise and performance schools doctor into japan ism super excited to discuss to day's topic which is nutrition and supplementation for performance and recovery and ism particularly excited about this conversation because have been interested in supplementation and nutrition per performance really since my teens but also because in recent years we have witness a massive transformation in the general public in terms of their view of supplementation and nutrition first of all more people are thinking about nutrition what is good nutrition what is not a very barbed wire topic as but there are some truths in there that will discuss but also supplementation whereas ten fifteen years ago i think most people would either be really into supplements that was a small percentage of people but the majority of people a we are either told or were thinking oh younovitemens you mostly street them they're justexpensive urine nowadays it seems that many people including many of my colleagues an physicians all the way down to sports performance experts are taking and making recommendations about certain supplements and the way that i to think about supplements is that they are not necessarily just supplements which makes it sound they are augmenting what should already be there but you are not quite getting enough of but indeed a lot of these things we call supplements are very potent compounds that can transform our ability to perform in the short term to recover from exercise and that can really shape brain chemistry hormone patterns acutely and when taken long term am very excite about to days topic and to be able to trying sort through this call it a cloud hopefully not a storm but this cloud of supplements that are out there because indeed many of them are excellent and can provide us a lot some of them are terrible and then some just do not do anything and therefore are terrible because i either they recite a facts or because they are very expensive hen thy do not do anything and then of course within the realm of nutrition there is an equal amount of of confusion but that is why m talking to you because you are going to put clarity and structure and definition on these incredibly important topics you you absolutely nailed at there one of the major real an supplements can work is because you can consume nutria's in extremely high concentration such that you would not get in nature throughhaving said that you really do want a focus on the basic sleep nutrition hydration and ism going to get into very specific detail later with some of those things that said there are plenty of situations an car c distances whin supplementation can do exactly what you said also though because you are taking them in such high concentrations they can also be unproductive they can be destructive or they can be counter productive in case if your taking a couple of supplements over here it may actually be counteracting the benefits of some the other supplements over there in the ideal situation we would be able to work a snipers here we would be able to run full biological testing extend if blood work and saliva and yearn and stool and have a indepthanalysis of your got my crop om and your street patterns and your time of day an your carters all curve and all the things the we do in our high performance folks with that then we can get extremely high precision supplementation and in quite honestly our philosophy is we only give individuals exactly what they need even some of the standard a generally safe an effective supplements we do not really necessarily use them if there is no specific need a we talked about the consequences of this with things antitoxin ins but even a simple stuff stimulant and other tools that are effective for recovery we do not use them unless we have a reason that said that is not the reality for a lot of people they are not in beagle to do something that or works somebody can help them in that there are a handful of supplements that i would consider to be my my eighty twenty rulewits is sort alike the twenty per sent a supplements that are gong to give you eighty per cent of the benefit for the lowest cost and what i can act use the sort start there even know this burns my skin an my soul a little bit i absolutely hate this i am the context go ism their it depends its high precision guy but let us be real am there are number of supplements that are fairly effective and fairly cheap for a wide range of outcomes a this is for general public this is for people who want to do the three buckets right you want a look a certain way supplements that could in hands muscle growth and fatsos a none hormonal be supplements of course supplements that can improve energy or physical performance again from everything from yo squatting more to feeling better in your yoga class to having energy throughout the day to our third major bucket that we have been talking about throws the dire series which our longevity we can cover those first if you to start there yes absolutely let us start there often times when we think of supplements we immediately jump to high sport performance type of things or vigorous work outs or or muscle building tho the does not necessarily have to be the case a take for example creating eve spoken about this at lengthens wit the are gain canada whose done a tremendous amount of research i was to it up at his lab recently in canada and he has covered extensively in fact i i think i put up a post perhaps i could draw this up in where he laid out all the myriad of benefits of creating this is taken in the your typically three to five grams per day of those of creating on o highdrate which has the most restrict behind it a seems to be extremely low side effects in almost anyone and the benefits including course things a muscle performance and strength and things that and if you go back to our discussion are episode on metabolism and an endurance we talked about the phosphor creating systems e you can figure out kind of what this is going to do in trims of effect that is said there is excellent information and data coming out non on the benefits of bonmenral density in creating a there's a ton of work looking at a host of cognitive factors am from memory executive function a to effects potentially on even things depression a mood to all timers parkensons a all forms of of course generative disease a in fact it its pretty obvious the brain loves creating as a fuel and not only we sort of discussed in the episode as being the fuel for skillet o muscotraction but the brain needs to do that as well the atrocities around the brain need be o the right energy at citral it is very clear that metabolism in the brain is reduced with things t b e and potentially concussions a now to be extremely clear cretin does not prevent any of those diseases it does not treat any of them and the data are mixed but it is more and more our coming a some show a little bit o benefit some show you know may be none but ism not aware of any research in those areas that show it has any downside i for the most part side effects are extremely minimal if not not and then potentially some benefit independent on the specific study we could put up a if you a couple of lengths directly to those metanalsies d and books can go through those things one by one i i only say that to again may be expand our understanding or thinking about what these gypsy supplements can do it is not just about growing muscle a a no high performance its everything to garters an association with recovery a creating is fantastic for recovery from muscle from muscle damage i helps and incanpetentially are in fat lost and a whole host of things you can actually also even look at websites examined dot come i have you no affiliation wit then whatsoever but if you want a mistype in something creating on a hydrate i you can see a whole list and you are going to see thousands of studies of the potential benefits of creating that is is always number one on my list ism relieved to hear that creating sits at the top of your supplementation list because well first of all i started taking it when i was in college at that time i was taking it in this kind of loading mode where you take it in am anywhere from fifteen a twenty five grahams per day often causing some gastric distress often combining with fruit jets to try and shuttle into the muscles or and then called maintenance phase of reducing to ten or fifteen grams per day a nowadays i just take about five grahams or a the later i know your gin tell me why i should probably be taking more than five grams per day given my body weight and will get into some of those specific selubit later but in addition to experiencing direct effects on a muscle size and strength which i did t i do not know how it contributed to my connive function or if it does now because it's really weighted tees that out with it with standard am at home tests a scale a but it is very clear to me based on the literature a that you described and ism some of which we have covered on other episodes of the podcast that the phosphor creatine system is widely important for forebrain function i the forbranof corse being the the a portion of brain a broadly speaking the portion of brain just behind your forehead that is a responsible for planning action setting rules in contact am even as simple as if your going down field an a game of soccer basket ball and your own offense and then a you make an attempt on goal or basket and then it is switches and you go back now your on defense that it is being on defense is very different than being on offense and that goes excuse me that that rule switching is a prefrontal cortical function as is every contact dependent way of thinking or were acting and anything that can favor function of the forebrain i think it is good for a humans in general it suppresses anxiety allows us to interpret what is going on for us and ism very am relieved and gratify to hear that creating sits at the top of the list also as a sure you will point out again leader creating is for the most part of relatively a portable supplement provost people here we are not talking about something that's truly so ferric or that y auto flyte ism some remote location to get in infusion of ram but tho i apologize all you cause i know the price has skyrocketed recently really ye why is that i think it is us nobody knows but it is cornoncodo supplying and a demand issue if you will a those prices have gone out this also of course been shipping problems in the world and thing i every time i i talk about crating my now people just flame me fur o i got a silkespensive no mic i am sorry but honestly it is only expensive because you are use to being cheap when u when you counter the fact outer you right ye relative to the other stuff your probably taking relative to any other number of purchases a for the it still lands very high n my arrowiless my o mi ait twenty because of that is it is it can be taken any time of the day it does not have to be in magical combination you talked about contesting with carbohydrates the cannon hands how quickly can get into system in fact that it is got a work on the exacting as in mechanisms will probably i patient i talk about hydration but these things are shuttled any time your bringing carbohydrate that is going to be ship into tissue as quickly as it can i cretin than goes longs for the right and the it brings water for r that hi you in hands hydration that is why it is important to have carbohydrates when you are trying to hydrate you dos can take it in thread that is also why you get conicalself swelling which is a good thing i your it is just an hanging hydration we actual use at a ton in our post way in protocols an individuals have to cut watertight preachings a great thing to throw back in there is in i help you rehydrate it is also why when you take thirty grams of it it can pull a bunch of fluid in the intestines and and there you go it through little bit of i distress yet is a lot of fun things you can talk about there i just had to flag that because every time have been locking about a recently and i say it is cop people killing me for it i apologize i do not now how to make tin deeper but it is still fairly fairly affordable i would say relatively inexpensive compared to a lot of supplements out there and when thinking about the return on investment is a it is quite good yes ale actually sorry sorry coy up but i was also thinking there is ben a number of studies on i sleep tuprvtions wealth crating there can help obviously sleep reprobation will generally reduce going to function and creating can ameliorate some of that drop if you think about in that context i had a crummy night asleep well an effect enables you d perform a little but bettering your job than you make up the dollar or whatever you paid for that days supply of creating it is something i cannot on that note it is not going to work as an acute response is not somethingyofre i feel terrible and throw some cretin down the hatch it'll feel better that that is nock in a work it is going to take several weeks to have a noticeable effect that needs to be stored in tissue i need to be built up before you can action do much of anything it is unlike something other things stemulins or caffeine that haven acute response right now and if you are going to take it you probably need to consume it consistently if you cannot do that than really there is no point an doing it in the loading phase you mention distance were here it's something you can do again if you need you in hands the storage of it really quickly say for example we have done this in some military cases where's you get back to base and you have only got a week and you got o go back out we may actually have to i do the a bit of loading face than but if that is not the case i the loading cases unnecessary it is not really harmful other than may be mistress and maybe was but you going to have three or four week it is getting to reach full saturation plain time to to be there and that if you are not three to seven grams for day arrange ism glad you mention the slow accumulating plosive effects of creating as compared to called acute effects because the way the i think of health promoting a performance enhancing protocols viewing morning sunlight or am endurance exercise for that matter or creatine or sleep for instance is that while they can have effects in the immediate term you might feel a little bit or in the case of a good night sleep a lot better it is truly the cumulate effect of rasing your base line lovely functioning the there is another way think about is am these supplements our behaviors am and quality nutrition when done consistently over time and that does not mean a hundred per cent to the time but that is all the eighty per cent of the time our lead to a sort of a buoyancy in your system that allows you to be more resilient under conditions a where conditions are not perfect right and if conditions are made perfect or close to perfect and you already have that buoyancy that is when your really start to we the ultra high performance effects that are much fun but they have to be established through consistent supplementation consistent nutritional one takes to day i know we are going yo distinguish between normally the'recalled chronic and acute effects but that young the makes a sound chronic illnessthe women people here chronic while they might think of other things but but in the contacts of health they typically think of chronic illness answer not saying about that will recalling about is slow modulatory of facts in the body a lot of things in the body take time to build up but one they have built up they a the clearly can benefit us and then other things as you mention a stimulant for instance has a very acute a fact that is going to occur with unique within thirty minutes and wear off within four hours or can also have some chronic effects but typically it is a short lived effect we song to frame up the the language that will be using and ism really decide to dive into this toping that thin cretin as a beautiful example of a supplement that has positive chronic mental and physical benefits down the road i can come back and talk a litlbout more about cretin we can cover some other information regarding best practices for getting the most out of it as well as will certainly dive into some of the common scene of facts or at least a thought of side effects while were here though i also could throw in a few other of these high impact low cost generally safe thingsthat are my eighty twenty rule if you will the way i act use in of think about it is you want one from each of three categories and these categories are fuel stimulant and fatigue blockers creatine is actually in the fuel it is not a stimulant we talk about the chronic effect that we already knock that n another one from the a fatigue blocker is going to be anything bay to alleging or voting by carbonate and then from these stimuli use of course we have anything a bet just to a canine or a something of the equivalent we can come back again and talk about all those more detail a little later before we begin it'd to emphasize tat this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is also separate for doctor and galloping teaching and research rolls at can state fullerton it is however part of our desire and effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science forty tools to the general public in keeping with that theme wed to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is moments momentous make supplements of the absolute highest quality the huborman lab podcast is proud to be partnering with torments for several important reasons first of all as i mention there supplements are of extremely high quality second of all their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations if you are going to develop a supplementation protocol you are going to want to focus mainly on using single ingredient formulations wit single ingredient formulations you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regiment for your goals in addition momentous supplement ship internationally and this is of course important because we realize that many of the superman ladpodcast listeners reside outside the united states if you would to try the various supplements mentioned on the hubermanlad podcast in particular supplements for forgot health for sleep upplemization for focus as well as a number of other the nags including exercise recovery you can go to livemomentous spelled o u s that livmomentous doom slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a program that lets you see how different foods and activities affect your health by giving you real time feed back on your blood glucose using a continuous glucose monitor many people are aware that their blood sugar that is their blood locos level is critical for everything from fat loss to muscle gain to healthy cognition and indeed aging of the brain and body most people do not know however how different foods and for an activities including exercise or different temperature environments impact their blood locos levels and yet bloodlucos is exquisitely sensitive to all of those things i firstarted using levels about a year ago as a way to understand how different foods exercise and timing of food relative to exercise and quality of sleep at night impact my blood locos levels and have learned a tremendous amount from using levels it is taught me when best to eat what best to eat when best to exercise how best to exercise and how to modulate my entire casual from work to exercise and even my sleep if your interest in learning more about levels and trying it continues glucose money yourself go to levels dot link slash supermen that is levels dot link slash hubermento day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact ratios of the electrolyte sodium magnesium in potassium to optima cellar functioning for mental and physical performance most people realize that hydration is key we need to invest an of fluids in order to feel our best in performer best but what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our cells and nerve cells nurses in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios now of course people with prey pretension and my pretension need to be careful about their sodium take but what a lot of people do not realize is that if you drink caffeine if you exercise and in particular if your falling o very clean diet that is not a lot of process foods which of course is a good thing chances are you are not getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance element contains a science backed ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one gram of sodium two hundred milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium and no sugar if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc come slash supermen to get a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elm it doc come slash supermen to claim a free sample pack to start off i want o ask you about something that as soon as i say it some people might roll their eyes or wonder why r even talking about that now but that i have to believe is among them ore fundamental if not foundational aspects of nutritional supplementation per performance and that is hydration right i mean i think we hear hydration i go we we have to drank six day glass a water every day are your should be relatively clear if it is too dark yellow or not doing a job of hydrating enough how much of that is true is alkaline water worth while for changing the alkalinity of my body i learned when i was in college and graduate school that the alkalinity of the different tissues in your body is very well controlled in order to keep you alive and that you do not wanted to shift too much or you can enter pretty horrible states of seizure vomiting and even death tell me about hydration and woven into that if you would educate me on electrolytes and hydration because i think most often when people in jest electrolytes sure they could be in jesting salt tablets probably going some electrolytes by the way electrolier shooting mansion potassium through their food i think most people think about drinking electrolytes water and electrolytes i think it is a vitally important topic to kick this off with sure we can jump right end your alkaline water while there is perhaps much to say about this we can maybe re visit this in another seven part series along its own i would just say it this way there is probably a few things you should do before working about the allanite of your water animal just leave it at that meaning the alkaline the water is is sort of iurelement not that you will not will not go that far as just it is probably emerald store o started off talking about eighty twenty were this would be in my ninety nine one in terms of if were really at the level of working about the p h of the your drinking fluid or we have optimized many other things that then we can talk about it but until we have nailed months and years of work on other things this is is not going to make much of an impact great then perhaps you could tell us about what volume of water we should be drinking when we should be drinking that water relative to training and just generally and an anything else relate to water in electrolytes that can improve mental performance physical performance and offset any know ill effects i the fact that you mentioned physical and mental performance because it is clear in both cases we hear that weed to drink more water and i can give you some numbers and a will in a second we all seen you recognizes there is this is hormesis we talked about hormesis ay a few episodes ago and this is the case right whether we talked about food or hydration or i think i gave the example synced naturally occurring your food hot water is the same way if you are under hydrated or dehydrated then there is a clear negative effect on your body and as i increase the level or improve the level of hydration things get better whether this are physical performance whether is mental performance in fact we know that a bodyweight reduction of as low as to per cent the dehydration imagine you are doing about of exercise and your sweating and you lose two per cent of your byway that alone is enough to reduce accuracy in performance the classic study we talk about here was in basal players shooting accuracy free through shooting i thing a specific i they look at significant reduction in performance with as little as two per cent the hydration that that level you also see a significant increase in perception of difficulty of exercise and only right to two per cent ma goal i she two per cent i mean per cent byway lost that is what that means you strike getting toe three four five per cent the ideation you start having a significant reduction in blood volume and that is incredibly importantant for endurance your blood becomes viscus if it is hard to put through and you are going to start having all kinds of issues being dehydrated is again not only going to reduce performance but because of the mental aspect which we just walk through and neral muscular issue your gin to lose accuracy your lose total under performance and you lose sweden power we have the tryout there no matter what you are interested in its going to be harmed by being dehydrated that also is happening then if your starting your program the hydrated if you are already one per cent or some hydrate it may be a little under hydrate in the lose little bit of sweat you have already hit that two per cent and ere starting to see reductions a in performance there the same happens on the other side of that aromatic curve if you are notably hydrated in some large window but you start going pass that we can start running into equal problems remember there's a there is a need for an optimal concentration of sodium an potassium in chloride between your cell inside your cell and outside your cell i these are electro is is what we call molality and molarity is is really one to think of it concentration and osmosis if you are over those terms if we are trying to create a must contraction that requires an electrical gradient and sodium potassium specifically in masurium calcium are positively charge and chloride is negatively charge and we need to have a certain amount inside the cell and outside the cell that the positives in the negatives are balanced appropriately that when we move one we change the voltage we have in the case of a muscle contraction gad to skim through a whole lot of physiology there to say if you then go mess with fluid only and you say if i re to give you bollix of your three leaders of pure water right now you are going to dilute your blood and there is not going to be as many chemical there will not be as many e electrical signals and there could you have taken the same amount of sodium potassium t camera and put it in a larger volume of pure water that radiant is now changed that becomes a significant problem for contraction i man quite literally it can kill you this is what we call hypo anemia notremia m spelled n a hypo being low ism point o uremia if you actually go to the periodic chart n a is what we i use first sodium hypoxia cause the word is natremy actually that what that literally means is low sodium and you did not get that from sweating out on your sodium you actually get hyponatrema from drinking in too much water it is not that the total amount of sodium gets low it is the fact that the concentration gets low from excessive fluid intent in the extremes in fact if you look at the the literature you will see anywhere between two to fifteen per in of people who finish en durance races are are into hipontramian that that varies wildly if you are doing iron man and cover sis the marathon in denser and in october it is is gong to be totally different penning on what he conditions but these are all important ism will death happens that is sort of extreme if you back up just a little bit you start seeing the same types of performing sacraments but the symptoms can be identical brain fog confusion performance a irritation a i distress and you think man these are symptoms of dehydration than you drink more water andyoure just exacerbating the problem and i can actually i give you one little example of this we had can executive actually female see oh it'll say she is probably when her was in her early forties and she came to us and she thought man for sure she has some sort of got problem going on cause we hear lot about kind got health and how it effects everything and she us i have brain fog and have done all these things can i got blood worked on and everything's fine that's going on i think i must have some sort of god thing are going on whatever is of and we just tart going through her stuff and a she was i think about a hundred and seventy pounds a pluserminus and she was consuming two hundred fifty to sixty ounces of water a day that is a tonal water and we were coly she whatare you doing this for n she says i the sort my things but she did not realize s more a nervous tick than was anything else right she just sipsibsibsipsip water and my man how often you go pen she is ye at every no thirty minutes for something and my fantastic sleep problems focus and she smashing coffee and she was at nightcaps of coffee to day which is a good anus to excretion or do you at totally right it is of we do not really need to come in and run a sleep study on you words can to lower your water and she was what we dropped her down to one eighty basically can ounce our pound of bodywight which is till i cause she did train under an eighty ounces correct yon she does work out she need you replenish himself n will cover these numbers in a second instantaneous ami two days an she is o my gonna i have not slept six straight hours and years and then after that it was basely tears coming back to us right my focus my brain fog is gone she isn't a very high pressure job a everything's coming back now she was down to three or cups i off yo day but a the whole thing digestion improved all of it she was it her only problem after all the analysis was she was just drinking way way too much water and adding more salt to her would not a solved the problem cause she would ad just had simply way too much fluid er system she was having all kinds o eighty eight problems and a deuteron the whole thing in that that rolls in a corpus all the whole system gets goes into chaos i it is important that you pay attention ideation ism even know as you sort of mention people tended kind rule their eyes around it because if ye were in the middle it is fine but if you are anywhere past not even the extreme extremes but just that first stand er deviation away i you can have problems and you might be thinking i drain of fatigue you might be thinking you are just out like you are to think all these things and you simply just have an actually did than your hydration yo a i think people sometimes roll their eyes at the discussion of hydration because it just does not sound very sexy it is not does not sound u hero transmitter or hormone it as sound just stern or entered in ardiatier or open men but it actually is all of those things it sits at a level beneath all of those but not beneath on a hieraky beneath in in terms of a foundation it is anally the without proper electorolikht balance and hydration none of the cells of the body can function and then i think people also here that oh we are seventy per cent water and somehow it that statistic alone am or that fact alone does not seem to a stimulate any kind of action will take away li great i gravity also keeps us inform jumping is eye as we it what do i do and i think it is it is importing the people understand that every cellar process in the body critically relies on having enough soda magnet in patagium around and the the way that it is concentrated in fluid water is really the way that you allow every cell in your body to function as well as it possibly could and respond to all o the sorts of canquitic high performance tools yon they we are talking about the the thing have observed a many times over is that if people are in jesting too much water and also drinking a lot of canine and theirelectrolights a low they get shaky and they actually can have anxiety symptoms show when people come into my lab to to studies on anxiety in fear we ask a few questions and am those crushes include how much water they have had that day also a sort of bazaar fact but one that i think is worth mention is that when the flatter is full it stimulates a sort of anxiety if you ever had to you are enate very badly and you are in the car ore you cannot your name than you get to the door that is h talk about it anxiety am and that is because there is a direct nerd pathway from the flatter that registers the mechanic censors how much stretch there is on the flatter that sends a signal to the brain stem alertness arias broadly speaking locusserulias an others that wake us up these are the when we are awake it makes us more awake and when we are sleep this is what wakes us up to urinate in the middle of the night yet is actually why you can use a u night your nation has a a pretty good diagnostic of sleep disorders if you was a hazel present right almost exactly what you are talking about if you are having sleep sort issues an your staying awake and a valor present gets taken off riparian goes straight to the ideas your kidneys are supposed we torment basically at night in out most be filtering lotic in producing a lot of your in at night i if that is happening and an say you you have any number of apes kicking nor an in going on i very suppress and keeps going keep scanning signal skinny stritful tearing if you are waking up and peeing multiple times a nigh tit miscalled doctored i that is a very very good sign that you are one or two things happen you one you have some sort of sleep disorder or two you are drinking out rages amounts of water and that is actually bit of backward cycle that right because you are drinking way too much water you waking up and being all night that is actually ruining your sleep and s we have seen this a number of times with our sleep company as we go in an it is you do not need any this crap you just need to be properly hydrated alternatively if your hydration is sound and you are still waking up more than one time an night to p on average then you almost i should not say that but there is a potential that you actually have some sort of i sleep sorter sleep condition going in the rule thumb on the this her here once or night once a night or of your nation is fine ism if it is routinely or consistently more than two that young to make some adjustment start with hydration it is the simplest way right getting a full sleep studied do not just figure out hydration we who we have had this happen a number of times where people want to get more health conscious an the just get but hear things this i i got to get on my water and then they to start train rocking the sleep the waking it up if you are waking up multiple times and you are yearning and it is a large amount of yearn for you and it is clear that is probably not sleep any in duce ochrea that is probably excess of hydration if you are waking up ponce of times and it is fairly small amount o year an then it is probably not i the fruit issue it is probably the fact that the thesuppressin is kicking your knees into gear that is not a perfect criteria but it is just a quick little tool you can sort use ism that is actually want o h reasons why we measure almost always a your body weight at night as well as in the morning that that is a the combat sport and the you have see riders boxers we call that your float much you floated over night i to know that number cause i want to know as well you are first morning bit whenyou wake up you went to bet at two hundred pounds you woke up the next more and at one ninety five oh we floated five pounds did you pee last night yea yet three times interesting another case you woke up you went to bed a twiner pounds you wake up one ninety nine point five of et your dehydrated a you should have a i a certain amount of flue that you're just respiring out as your breathing throughout your nose throughout night ideally i guaranteed you not wake up what was your yearn oh ye little bit pretty dark shocker your de hydrated you can con a look at numbers that a general float is something a pound to two pounds for the hundred and seventy plus pound person as you scale up that number and go up a little bit you can kind use see to tree your little bit about what is going on ism with this kind of combinations everything is everything right shit is not just t one stem you can a pa attention you can also look well i do not we have you don't jump instill we can but there is a whole month o waves i i can teach you to signs hydration at maybe we can start there in then we can talk about hydration numbers yes i love to talk about diagnostics for hydration overhydration de hydration to start off would you be willing to give us some numbers how much water sure we be drinking the classic rule here and you are making me do what i hate and i want give all the caveats first will go straight your number half an ounce propound a body weight is a rough rule a you was again two hundred pounds that would mean you drink a hundred ounces of water a day most water bottles are twelve to twenty ounces something that your n o drinking sixth's are a day kind plusrminus which is not that unreasonable this does depend on a number of factors of which i count go over but that is a a rough starting place the only other thing to add to that is that does not account for exercise induced water lost worse on or anything that that is assuming just was old daily needs if you are a exercising or sweating at all for any reasons her work related i folks at work outside or in the heater a human environment this these numbers all change and you can slide the scale up but you generally want a drink about a hundred an twenty five per cent of the fluids you have lost during that physic activity back and how much you lose our hour of exercise it that number range is between one a five pounds depending on the perse and nicking even be high with some of our i at the o i can think of a number of and i fell players right now it is it in common for those guises to eight or nine pounds even not even craze circumstances if it is august and wore in jacks vile it is not wild for us those guises t go nine ten pounds but what about the typical person goes to a air condition him or goes out for a run on a day that is somewhere between let us ay fifty five degrees fair in height and eighty five degrees for you are probably looking out at pound it is not extremely height if you are totally soaked might be a pound and a half the two pounds if you come back and your pits are little sweaty another is a little bit of water cold anon your neck liar et it is probably a more a pound or in that case you might drink back a pound and a half water o case i just to review these numbers to make sure that ism on the correct page here a half an ounce of fluid expound o body weight is a a sort of a foundation for hydration and then you want to replace a hundred and twenty five per cent of the fluid lost during exercise and exercise very where exercise is done varies whether not people wearing uniforms or helmets is gonif pack how much fled they lose et camera in a very hot environment that the amount of fluid lost can be anywhere from one to five maybe in ten pounds easy per hour of hard hard exertion for most exercise done in conditions of fifty five dress fir hight to seven to excuse me eighty five degrees fair in height done with some degree of effort one might lose a pound or or a two pounds of water superheavy weigh to find out ill you have to do as weigh yourself naked go do your work out come back in dry off we yourself naked that will tell you exactly it you lost of you went in you re hundred and sixty pounds you come back out you weighty want fifty eight you lost two pounds drink back two and a half pounds water you good that is a is ad honesty fairly gold standard for identifying you can actually buy a whole bunch of technology for the us and they are using the exact same a question which is your body quite when you were there now if you do that though you do need to account for any fluid you drank during the work outer of that then offsesin the simple but i think important question were tie bout a half announce of fluid propounder body weight does that include things coffee tea soda rework out drinks midweek out drinks mate macho whatever the another bromate there is there milling things out there a or just water any fluid for the most part is an account and is it true that fluids that contain affine generally causes to secrete sodium yet o was do you recommend including elector powder or a small pinch of sodium or any number of other supplement type electrolytes that can replace that sodium magnesite potassium a couple things we ought to pay attention to to accurately answer that question will you also sort of ask about you may have not i realize is is affine actually in hands the hydration which is not really wit you ask but it is probably lot of people thought that is well affine can but coffee does not necessarily that because i remember your coin just that with fluid and will a we used to say thrall the time you coffee you hydrates yo it does not a might make your burin yellow and certainly gives offer i odor your yearn but in general coffee will not do that cops your justice if you were to now to be taking affine pills alone now there there is a bit of a dramatic effect there and you on to yearn it how much may be not enough for you be really concerned with e special when you balance that against the ergogentical facts and benefits o affine it is not something we are concerned about second by your question do you need to then offs at the loss o body ism not superconcerned about the amount of sodium lost a affine i am more concerned about simply the amount of sodium being correct because of the bigger circumstances how much is i talk in your system and how much you lost in the training sessions was not the coffin than i care about that much relative to a if you lost three grams a sodium because of the training and you added another few milligrams because the fine i do normally care or or did not ism glad you brought up the difference between a substance affine and the vehicle it is contained in mi coffee this is all really important and it also raises e question by individual differences in sweating ability and i call it sweating ability because have a good friend have known for ages really om ash work with him in my laboratory as well and he is one o these people that the moment he starts any physical activity it is a flood warning an id just soaks through clothing just the sweating adaptation is is exceedingly robust in him other people less is it true that wearing in our ability to dump heat through a by la loss of water something that am we tend very on in that also that we can build up that caps i know a number of people a writing i go owns why would i want to sweat more ut there is actually a huge advance should be able to dump body heat during exertion because body he in some ways sets the cap for performance an lot many many ways including mental performance or arability i stay alert often is enhanced by being cold and course we all want to warm up properly but am in terms of loss of fluid through sweating is there way to easily ben ourselves into kind of a a low sweater medium sweater a heavy sweater that is tartly a an article of clothing but in any case you it you know man another a lot to say here within which we had a whole series on this as in if we have to go seventeen hours we can do it just everybody his date well i think we have shown the listeners a that is a real threat that is a very real threat podcasting to failure you do not do every set in the him to failure but were were attempting podcast filler in it in all series of this am what what is the role of sweating ability and is the something that any of us should care about or train for or pay attention to ears this is kind of getting into the arcane never on you can train you are ability to sweat this is important for heat acclamation and why that matters when you sweat that actually is not what regulates your temperature you what you want to have happiness the fluid to hit your skin and that to be evaporated that is the actual mechanism in fact i if you stop sweating the you can guarantee within a short about of time you are to be done moving a very interesting i hope people heard that and really a a highlighting that in their mind that sweating is a process of bring fluid from your body on to the surface of your skin and then the heat dumping aspect of sweating is the evaporation of that of off your body which brings to mind all sorts of ideas about how to dress during exercise et camera but what you said is that if you are not sweating enough you are limiting your out put capacity sos not just about having enough fluid to sweat you it is also about being able to sweat and being a dressed appropriateleast to allow that sweat to move ut to evaporate off your body yet and he acclamation training is as simple as a sounds just practice more a if you are going into a process or you need er need to be in a hot environment for you need to improve your set rate eat is need to practice sweating and your body will get bets that a practice o on practice such acts just get in those things and you will a improve your ability to do that now there is a huge genetic component a i have one individual actually a you see fight rein work with i do do not mind mentioning his name he will give me full permission cot huntsmen many many years a he is actually a fighting right now actually to day he's be going he is the heat is you described buckets and buckets and buckets of fluids come off the sky when he is tying issues he just goes red and now if we have improve that i acute sweat too much we work on not a lot early in his career and we we got some movement found get him to hold on to t to fluids better that being said have worked the other individual ls in his weight category an it is the opposite right we can o have them literally do the exacting transmission to gather and scout will dump six pounds and and other folks at his size will dump to to an a hale there is a genic upon that is is there and you do noticed to worry about there miso can you identify if you are a heavy salt sweater or not will you've a whole bunch of routs for this number one as you can use the old free cost free test of just looking at your clothing and if your seeing that white residue all over it you you all have the friend who probablywars that same bast baseball hat that they have had for eight years if it is covered in the white junk all over the place that is a sign of a higher salt sweater if the opposite happens ans you can pull their clothing back and there is us nothing there i there may be elitist of a lower salt sweater i you can also use any number of a hydration tests i know that there is some coming out the market very very soon that can give you theoretically real time i measurements s a we gum would be although i have not seen any data on if those are accurate not have a used on yet but there number that are out a super cheap you ten fifteen twenty blows hall we up to couple of hundred dollars you can buy these patches put them on yuan get a reasonably close estimate again if those things are five or ten or twenty per cent off i do not know have to see into penetrate to come out first but even if they are you not you are not worried about this specific milligrams right whether you sweat out and twelve hundred fifty telegrams on work out or if it is thirteen forty it does not really matter you are trying to look for big big numbers right are you losing five hundred telegrams seen three and half grams wee yore at those thing will get you in the ball park to do exactly y to say to my high medium or low and there is a lot of them that that have used in the past that that is another way to go about it i then what you want to do is probably match your electrolyte in take to something close to what you sweat that is the ideal scenario i younger a lot in formation by hydration from blood m you can look it acute markers of dedication hero globe and hematigrit i if you are could you ham a globin is fifteen plus it is funny we have talked about this and if you have sos before but i see that on man that do superfix that is a fifteen for him a go be petty high fourteen or would be pretty good for a female that is also the exacting thing is the sign of acute de ideation camaticrate same thing if yore north o fifty per cent your probably hided you can get a lot there are also tho a lot of bile markers that can tell you more about chronic the ideation s you can run though those things as well good blood chemistry tests can tell you a lot you can actually get some inside n you are sidemen potassium it'll begin uses another fantastic wait on to measure longer term i ideations that's now when the amazing golobulance that we sort of talk lot about you can do all those things you can also simply measurer the body weight reimposed and use sweat patch or not and you see that for your version of your clothing test and get a rough idea of where you getting it from those are good places o start i one to go back though it make trawls over terrifying the audience too much on a sovapiece if you are performing a type of training or exercise or sport in which you are not losing more than two per cent our byway you do not need to be overly concerned about high drawing in the sport and we can actually get in the to ism some equations for how much water to drink during training right now but i to for again losing less than that is not critical you can have some fluids if like makes you feel better but you not o be experiencing tremendous amounts of perform sacraments if you are again out playing baseball game and is fifty degrees out you are find ism me drink some water but that is not go to be compromising performance or recovery we can actually then if you would i can go through the threesteps system for optimizing hydration but a those are it want to make triplane that flag peopleare is terrify that they got to be guzzling down water if they are going to the physical therapists for some scratching as that is probing superimportant i to see a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens it lentic greens is a victim in mineral robotic and adapted in drink design to help you meet all f your foundation or nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens daily since two thousand and twelve ism delighted that their re sponsor of this podcast reason i started taking athletic greens in the reason i still take athletic greens once or twice to day is that it helps me meet all my foundation or nutritional needs that is it covers my vitamins my minerals and the robotics are especially important to me it let greens also contains a daptogins which are critical for recovering from stress from exercise from work or just general life if you to try it lentic greens you can go to athletic greenstone calm slash supermen to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs and they will give you year supply o it i in see three cay to again if you to try it lentic greens go to athletic greenstone calm slash supermen to claim the special offer i would love for you to tell us what i refer to as the gallon equation understanding of course that you did not name at the galop equation listen folks scientist can have things named after them but in general it is not a reflective of healthy psychology if they name things after themselves correct sometimes yes nor anatomists use to do that but in any case doctor into galop did not name the gallon equation after himself i named it after him and the gallon equation for how much fluid to in gest during exercise is you want to take your body weight in pounds and divide that by thirty and you want to consume that number which would be in ounces about every fifteen to twenty minutes in the example of you being two hundred pounds you would take two hundred divided by thirty which is blitzes call that number seven to be clothes which means you would consume about seven ounces of water every fifteen or twenty minutes or now as little bit of a point while i also did not name and i also did not do the research it is important to point out that other scientists figure these things out i just read their papers and made that deprivation of their equation to make it legit easier forest folks who i do not work on the metric system k a couple of things first of all ism not two hundred pounds but it does not matter how much hit way because the point is it the listener correct should take their body weighting pounds divided by thirty and just that number of ounces in fluid every fifteen minutes and then for those out there outside the yours that are accustomed to thinking in mill leaders and leaders not ounces and kilograms not pounds what is the galloping equation in the metric system this would be two mill leaders prokilegram which again if you were a let us say two hundred pounds that is going be something roughly will call it ninety keels and if you did two milliard pedalo you would be something a hundred and eighty mill leaders of fluid again every fifteen or twenty minutes great and how should people in jest that fluid and of course i would imagine it is through their mouth o who there are other orifices that at it might slice but let us not go there there drinking that water consistently or s it every fifteen minutes they slug it back does it matter obey yet that is very good a handful of things in general you talk hydration the slower and steady you can go the better in fact the reason the this two leaders prokilegram number came out is because a number of trials were run wet they look that that every fifteen minutes just one bullet of it i in different durations in it is pretty clear that the slower pace one could do it the batter whether you are doing at every ten minutes or fifteen or twenty minutes the reason we actually give that gap is because you have to be also offset a little bit i i distress in fact con of them the four golden rules of recovery if you will a we use sort of three years you need to rebuild rehydrate and replenish but that really means is you mean to have a continuous luck stream head to have it continuous me asked stream you need two hydrate and you need to do all one two and three without disturbing your got too much and in this particular case it was sort of found that we can hit that level in general and be just find for most people mama little bit a contacts the example we gave there in both cases it is something six to seven ounces for fifteen or twenty minutes if you think about that there is sixteen ounces in a pound and most water bottles if you go by a water bottle of store here it is they generally come in sixteen ounce bottles if six or seven ounces is really a third of a water bottle maybe every fifteen or twenty or minutes it is not some agreegous amount of water that eve to some that now that is influence heavily by how hydrated you started the session with how higher you came in external factors heat humanity temper things that but hat gives you a rough idea that again in these are numbers that you would need to consume two optimize performance at the end of that then is when you would look to see how much i lost we talked butterier and then add back that one hundred and twenty five per cents taking into account how much fluid you injured if you are two hundred pounds and you drank a total of say a pound of water during the training and you tart off a two hundred and you finished at one ninety eight you actually lost three pounds not two pounds because you lost three you drank one during it your final net number is two now you do not you really need to drink back under and twenty five per cent of that remaining two pounds two and half pounds some that ism these numbers especially that one twenty five are they are just rough guide lines a some mature papers suggesting all the up to hundred fifty per cent ism he is is just an idea do not measure out whether you need five point five ounces or six point two ounces it just sort gives you an idea of a were to star are a few sips every fifteen or twenty minutes is close enough give actually start using a the galloping equation to determine how much fluid i need for mental work given the o robust did a they're out there on the relationship between hydration and mental work its am been very effective for me and again there previewed studies that the support the idea that hydration is important for a proper mental clarity and energy and focus and that even being slightly the hydrate can destruct that but if one is drinking much water that they are frequently going to the rest arum an cannot comfortably a focus on the work there doing that is also an issue am that is very helpful what are the three most critical features of hydration and then it'd to move on to am some of the more particulars about supplementation and recreation three parts start hydrated maintain hydration throughout part three is hydrate post to few at coquet we gave you the half sounds propound a body weigh equation you start the training hydrate we gave you the to militates for kill a ground slash body weight divided by thirty to stay hydrate we give the one twenty five per cent ism but i can actually just give you sort of ism giving you another list here ism sorry but it is my five step center guide from theorizing hydration for performance are a step number one drink a lot of water first thing the morning this gets ever in kick star to get you going it also saves you from having a drink a bunch of water at night which is then going two compromiseously what is a lot to penny an how big you are the general thing it'll tell people is one of the very first thing you should do throughout your day you wake up go the bathroom as you are consuming your sun light consume water this is maybe chugging a full glass it is on i see what i do is not the best or out but all to s siren ounce o sixteen ounces or as great it is fine if you are larger am you ism ism a hundred and sixty five to seventy pounds to penning once going on maybe the higher sometimes if you are two and a twenty five pounds maybe that numbers thirty ounces you a sort of scale up and down and the only reason i say lot is it just depends on on what you are doing and i'lsost yo clarify i do not really literally mean chug is sips cause the faster you drink water the faster its can expand blood volume the fast street extends blood volume the faster you get rid of it i i do not thing a lot people know that yet this is a babies clarifying this is also we sort of talk about earlier if you drink to much water you will delete the system well if you have a deluded system your body's first reaction is too rid of water to bring total blood volume down right remember if you are to go a doctor and they look to your total good volume there man you are five and a half leaders you are on to be holy crap yore n to be put on a piratic because you do not have a hart attack a good pressure i i wonder if people are drinking a sixteen ounce glass of water or other fluid all at once before going to sleep and that is why there way ye help in the mill the night totally given what you just said probably a better am protocol would be to sip on a glass of water in the finally hour o two hours before sleep you generally the umber we say is three hours in the three hours proceeding sleep you want a basely limit fluid and take to sipping as needed i think that is in to start that to night because i wake up generally once per night use vast room and i do drink some fluids before i go to sleep messachism pretty thirsty at that time e am but i mean to start sipping that water in the a three hours heading into sleep yet you you can actually pay mention to is am to go back the fact i love doing the stuff but if you are waking up at night and you have a very dry mouth not you me i cause it can be one of two thank you might actually be dehydrated and the the mistake people make us man my mouth o dry i keep getting up to drink water at night that makes you thin peat too much wit that also indicates is probably your mouth breathing a lot of ways to fix people waking up in irritating too much a night is to take your mouth and or use a a dilator over your nose and then what happens is you do not feel a have a dry mouths you get up to consume an extra water throughout the night that actually reduces your fluid intakes you do not have the rob of actually now having too much fluid to do it and does another reasons why mouth taping can really help i if you are having those issues a and or snoring those are not be nine that is a really that you really should get some work on those a something bourne you are not sleeping very well is the way it'll say its its does not does not necessarily mean something in threatening but it is not a he god thing i you got a run kind of your treating things back and forth if your om waking up to pea lot by my mouth is not thirsty to get great then you may actually have just a water consumption issue if it is my mouth is dry but ism actually waking up and ism caving's large your nations then you are not actually dehydrated you are just breathingtrough your mouth if you waken up and your mouth is dry and there is not a to of pee there then you actually might actually legitimate be i under hihdraded little bit of a game you can play there well e superinformative i think that am the point alone that gulping a bunch of water all at once it is going to cause you to need to excrete that water soon after am is a my important point also for people that are going you i give a talk or you do not want to have to get up to use the destroy ye but to it through a long meeting ye am clearly ism violating all these rules up until ray now have been not i turfallow the sea gall approach the to consuming fluids is glen in em enormous volumes among start stopping a fluids instead a what are some of the other rules of hydration you can awake up you to start your day n start hydrated you your consuming a larger percentage of your water earlier in the day then you get all the performance enhancing effects of water and you do not have to worry about a compromising your sleep that is that number one also now you to start your session closer to hydration i grab number too eat mostly real whole foods why interesting what you may or not have thought about is a huge determinate of your hydration satin is your food choices if you look at different foods for example most fruit a water melon water melon is ninety five flush per cent water fantastic source also by the way since we are here it is not extremely hind carbidrats not string extremely hind sugar it is my percentage but since it is almost exclusively water you are eating it is not o something that is extremely dangerous intros h sugar am i there alone probably all the things we have talked about the six six episodes o that common right there will probably blow the into at the pieces and all proleg hatemaile for life for it but from people do sugar r water melons ye ye ye my got going the point is that sugar is truly bad i think the point is that for most people they are investing too much sugar most people ye i and it is interesting oftentimes the people who are justifying the injection of sugar exactly the kind of people that should not unjust much sugar there is a no bit of a well i use er is the o here is if you are eating whole real food this is now r work on of splitting airs about they sing morning hydration beats to proud ya now important point here if you compare to other foods i at meat is is a very high percentage of fluid at depending on how well or long you have cooked it you will isn't rems you see earlier or seventy per cent water rights if you are eating meat you are getting actually a big chunk of water as you cook it of course you lose some on that but meat can be i would not call it a hydrating food item but it is not as low as something a biscuit which can be actually ten per cent hate that is why is dry in dense which does not means bad for you but there if you are eating highly process foods almost by association that means they've been dehydrated or partially right you are just getting less total fluid intent in addition they have also been highly salted in generalrightes an hour in this position were were under hydrated and highly salted bad spot if you now switch over to mostly they get just mostly whole real food is whatever that means to you then you are hydration is in sky rocket you cannot have a lot you are eating a ton of food in fact it should be a large percentage of the fluid and take you have actually should be coming from your food you should not have to be smashing water bottles after water bottle all day in that case tho you do need to add salt back we do see this a lot we people w try to make a transition for may be a suboptimal nutrition life style and the they give up a little other process food that come over they start having problems because here not actually consuming enough salt at that back easy way to do that you can use electrolights end we could talk about those numbers if you want if you just salt your food that you are making you in to taste that is into gate most people in and a pretty good spot start hydrated consume hydrating foods step numbertutes renumber three you want a are hydrate if you are going to do work out session and it is going to be hot and long or one of those things you want a look for that hat a pound a parody weight of ounces that is the number we are looking for to start our hydration session we do that we are pretty much talent care and then i gas it a just depending on life style humanity and and other factors that i you can use what is called the what system w ut i think bob kennifict who done a tons research in this here if you want o read more look up his research i it is simply weight you are in and thirst another check your body weight look at your yore in color and engage your thirst and actually you can use throne those three things and those a can significantly predict actual hydration satin independent of actually measuring osmoola or has or anything that those three metrics alone are pretty god indicator of were your to you can have that normal amount of water pluserminis if you miss that number for whatever reason you it distracted the number we typically people is something four hundred o five hundred millileeres of water i in the hour proceeding the training right that is thirteen to twenty ounces let your toga work out three o'clock it is two o'clock you realize a man i have not drink much water today i you do not need to go smash tons and tons and tons just look for something that you know call it a bottle of water if you will if that is not enough if your a really tough spot you can do more a five to eight ounces fifteen or twenty minutes before exorcise you want to be really careful about drinking a much o water in the seconds before exorcize because your just con to feel a whole munch of water balancing up and down in your stomach and nobody likes that one to three hundred mill leaders fifteen or twenty minutes before m that assumes you are in this hundred and eighty five pound a range is again if you are talk and people of much larger size you may be t increase those values accordingly if you do all that then you use a galloping a cation for your infra work out hydration and youren't a pretty god spot i what you want to consume in that is what i call set what i mean by that is you do not actually want necessarily consume water only during the work out you ought to consume something that is i saw osmotic to your blood something that is the same concentration that you lost in your sweat if you have done a set test you would then drink it fluid that is is of the same osmaolity a the short version of that something in the neighborhood of two hundred to four hundred milligrams of sodium most electrolights a products are n to be something that now i know element is is a thousand milligrams as a lot higher but most products now that you can find our two hundred fifty to four hundred milium and are typically in the to tho maybe up to three to one sodium to potassium range right coconut water is actricoolist it is basely opposite ism a cup coconut water i think has something two hundred a milligrams of soda be six hundred the grams uptassum a total spoiler but well we use coconut water lot of hydration disabled up into salt is to to ring the sodium way back up yet one note about sodium a obviously people who have presa pretension or hi pretension wont to be careful with their soda men take in time have suggested that people might consider in jesting more sodium younsoat's like putting a target on your on you are back and yet the date are pretty good showing that if people are not getting enough sodium their mental clarity their access their a mental stamina their physical stamina really suffers and then people argue well most of us are getting too much salt that often is true for people that are eating a lot of process foods and not training and not training but for many a people who are already s or of health conscious who are training their largely consuming where i should say they're consuming largely non process or minutely process foods and especially for folks who are not in jesting many carbohydrates and are consuming gaffer or no lot of people do not know that carbohydrates hold water a and that makes a sound bad is not silly you no you can get subcutaneous swelling of your body of for cog it is it is bringing water and your system in it holds water when you drop carbohydrate starches in particular you urinate a lot more and when you drink coffin you also your an ate a lot more as as you pointed out earlier you start combining a few things slightly lower carbhydred or low carbohydrate eating really continuo clean you not getting a lot of salt in your food and drinking affine and then exercising and then pretty soon those numbers that come along with a a gram of sodium in your electro likdrink are not all that outrageous and what you find his people feel much much better when they are getting enough sodium and of course i should am say that there is no reason why some one has to invest a a supplement element or something there are plenty of other ways to bring sediment your system me gives of a pinch of pink salt or him plan salt or see salt or even just table salt in water or just make u surethat your salting your food enough and i think that they are to salt appetite and salt tastes a pretty good guide if you taste something n if you taste really salty to you that is an indication that either it is really salty or your salt stores are and of tapped off your ora were as if your craving salt and you in your thinking cot i really want to put salt on this already salty thing not necessarily but oftentimes that means that your salt decision so salt appetite is a pretty hard wired set of neral circuits and hormones and i think an we would all be wise to learn to tap in to the or kind of intuition about salt and take but of course also to measure your blood pressure et camera leave of course if you think you have some sort of contradiction there the work if the medical specialist without without question i those situations you laid out though are very really lot people a living that and it is important for those folks to understand if you are going through symptoms fatigue i lack of folks a coin o function performance is not there then hey you may be under salted and again actually a a good amount of blood chemistry work can unravel tat a lot an i con sort of tell you if you are getting on a back there are a number of folks who are extremely sensitive do and trims of health risk and that that is a real thing again work with your i individual folks on that i do not work with any one for a disease treatment or management at all have said that probe four times will say it six more times i only take people who are healthy and trying to make a perform at their best possible level it is actually fen you mention tat because i was going to give people f my recommendation for sodium men take in general throughout the day and i decided ism not i say that cause all it is going to do is make all the rest the people who arrest coming and come after me for the water melon comment come after me for that all that the indicts episode the gold is that that everyone is coming after you but also aaeveruin as learned something of value already ism given us a tremendous a insights and in factional information on creatine and hydration and along this lines it'd id love for you to tell us about some of the things that we can do with supplementation in order to enhance training by taking certain things before train and i also have the question how long before training should we start thinking about supplying new trains and supplements for the training session ism not sure i factual finished my fiber maybe i was not clearenough about the last one all just wane tie at that bowman an will go here next one yet no who is drive my felt that ain addition to the gallant equation trims of amount i record give been a recommended at a roughly three to one me to mascon recommendation and i gave you some rough numbers things that i actually an honesty use probably six to ten different electrolight companies depending on the situation some of em are really good in he case again element it is nice about that is there is no car pirate however the downside is there's no arbitrate sometimes i want carbohydrates in the training cause as you mentioned they are significant evidence going back a actually several decades on the benefit of car hydrate during exercise if you aren't a situation where you are trying to again maximize actual exercise performance you especially if it is either longduration more than two hours or extremely high intensity and this has to be well north of honor present of your view to man and that situation as we talked about the endurance episode you cannot actually start having a detriment in performance because of a drop of muscle linkage a gliverliket in can car say coming down if that is the case augmenting with car dehydrates during the training tat is going to an hansperformance is guns do what we call spare the liver and it is gin to keep my second rule of my for which is maintain a glucose injection its got to keep that going in general what you can offend is the number is a five to nine perpend glucose concentration in your fled which turns out to be exactly the number that most restrings have as well as i think that is pretty much exactly wet a coconut water is the downside of sport strengths since we are here is they actually tend to be undersaulted and that they do not provide enough of them if you look at the numbers aregingto say something sixty to one hundred grams of car hydrate per hour is the target and now if you are using the sort of gounpangruation in your splitting that up into fifteen a mine intervals its something again twenty or grams of cars per fifteen to twenty minutes if you are doing again a an hour long plus training down admittedly a hundred grams a is a bit much for some for depending on your case i would recommend starting in that a sixty gram or arrange again per hour total as much going to get to and only in the situation which muscle liken completion is be coming a limiting factor to performance the other benefit of that is as you mention that actually drives water in to the cell and you going to be in that a nice sweet spot of you are actually keeping glucose going which disjoin n hand's performance and your helping hydration at the same time the other little part that is support to pay attention to here is the type of car hydrate matters so you can use actually whole combination of things called resistance arches which i will use for a long bouts of exercise but in the pitiable work out you are going to want to focus on glucose and fructose mostly glucose typically at least a two or three tone ratio of clucks to fruits and the reason is those actually get into tissue through separate transporters and it happens is once the glucose transporters full you cannot bring anything else in however since trucks comes in a separate route you can maximize total car hydrate intake by using two different unique forms the there is a lot always you can do this a but this is where the momentous fuel product is is but specifically has that exactly in it it is fantastic i you can use food no problem you can use a combination of things honey and different easily absorbable a and usable in things you can actually may be put and and drink i to get away with there's lots of rouse for it but you want a look in that that sort of combination a five to nine per cent roughly clucks for that you do need to train your gut do not do anything and is a generallyagood rule do not do anything in your competition that you have never done in practice try these food ideas try these amounts the carbohydrate numbers try the social numbers i try the total on water start low you can always increase what you do not want to dos have to run out during the middle of your spin class and spent to the bath room hope nobody's in your way i which in the lab we have seen well to say accidents that occur more than once i to she careful of your stomach it'd to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracers of personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood engine to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals have long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long turn health and well being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test one issue with a lot of blood stand antes us out there however is that you get information back about serious levels of lipids and hormones a metabolic factors et camera but you do not know what to do with the information inside tracker makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalize platform that lets you see what your sipped oil numbers are of course but then also what sorts of behavior old dews and dots what sorts of nutritional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you if you to try inside tracker you can visit inside tractor dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that is inside tractor dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off i realize that jump the gun a lie basking about supplementation for before during and after work out i because what ism neglected to ask about was training in the fasted state this is something that we talked about in an earlier episode but i think it is worth high lighting now m sometimes the best way to supplement if you will a work out or rework out is in jesting nothing ism one of these people actually prefer to do my weight training somewhere between seven and eight a m each morning sometimes he livelier sometimes all bit later i drink fluid water and i do in jest coffin prior to those a training days am on days when i do not train i do as i often recommend people do delay my cabin and take ninety to hundred twenty minutes after waking but in any event it is water and taffy in yeurbromate or coffee or some sort of stimulant for weight training work outs and generally not for carry of vascular training work outs although sometimes yes ism training fasted that said ism investing carbhydre the right before to make sure that my i have glikagen stores that are topped off and a it is fasted but with that coyote what are your thoughts on training fasted and what i just described is fasted overnight but some people are training in the afternoon and they may opt to not eat anything in the to to four hours prior to training or maybe even longer i personally find that affine hit is my system a lot better when ism fasted better meaning ti seems have more of a potent effect there is some reasons for that and of course we dissuade people from in jesting affine too late in the day caszill to strip sleep ism not saying fast hat at for three hours than drink kami but who knows maybe that is in your protocol the simple version of this question is what are your thoughts on training fasted and if people are going to train fasted how should they modulate their fluid in take if it all what happens with exercise in the endurance and metabolism episode we walk through in the fact that no matter what you are using forkful car dehydrates or fat or even a other potential sources the end product of all of those is e t p seal to and water right you are trying to make e t p that is the fuel for exercise now h t p is a decision try phosphates one to three phosphates on top of anedenisine well what you may have not put together is if you hydrealize a t p and you break off one of the phosphates you now have a d p if you do it again you have a my a denying monophosphite if you do it one more time now you just have a decisive and if you have then therefore run through a lot of exercise burn a lot of energy you have increased the amount of a devising that floating around now if you have a high concentration of a decisive what second make you want to do that is con o bind intern receptors and we know when those sipperceppers get bound to you fall asleep bang caffeine well competitively blind to those receptors therefore that is why affine stops you from feeling you want to go to sleep right we have a very clear relationship between exercise fuel in fact if you look at the literature there's a pretty clear relationship between that more cleric expenditure in different sports and the higher amount of hours needed for sleep there is a nice high between how hard your exercising how much energy you are burning how much you to sleep stimulates which brings us all way back your question of fueling do i need a fuel prior to my exercise about if you are going to be limited in your exercise about by fuel then fueling is necessary one way or the other if it is a type of train that is not than it is not going to matter and the examples we gave if you are doing if you are gong a go do a thirty second about of maximal exertion and your on to do at one time you soft need to worry about feeling at all were eating within your work out cause only tho re secthirty second you do not need to worry about hydration post exercise you'd endorse by recovery total energy expenditure is nothing if you are going to go you can to go practice going to go to the driving ran age and practise your cold swing you do not need to worry about it the total amount of energy expenditure is is not high in fact in that case you might want to keep it somewhat low because you want to keep blood glycols fairly even and you don not a binging n the system you certainly would not want you stimulants you may get over exert inside in all of these things we probably should ha started off our conversation with this in terms of maker new trade the total amount throughout the day is more important generally then the timing of them which is why you can do things have of munch car hydrate at night not eat the next morning and lift and be just fine it does not matter that you did not have them in a few hours before your muscle again is toped off your livers liege his topped off you are absolute find you plenty if you even if yoryour to wait a few more hours in fact even if you were to do conditioning your probably fine i have plenty about the prefer to to many other traincessions faster the morning for personal reasons not because in has is performance but if it does not enhance or i hermit then and it is a personal preference thing fine if you get to go do a session though where you are going to be really concern it muscle at in completion and again you go back that abode to learn i different types when those threshold bison what you were about then if feeling would be important you would either need to have something before the session or consume it during the session one of the other things we to stay here is recovery starts during the previous work out right if your work in out right now and you optimize nutrition right now even if you do not necessarily need it for the current work out if you can't get a head on recovery then your get to be lying the next day and the differentiation here between car hydrate and poaching's important the total amount of proving you in just throughout the days probably a bigger determinist for things muscle growth then the timing the posts exercise anabolic wind it does not necessarily matter care hydrate is different the timing of that does matter it needs to be around than available you can maximize both hydration and muscled age in re synthesis which is restoring the muscle aging you burn during exercise i i also work with split set train multiple times o day those particular cases a recovery window is had but you normally have if you rein a situation when you have two or three days before you work out again you do not need to worry about getting car a hydrate and before during our after because by the time you go to train again you will have restored your muscle tin levels easily however i you are training every day or twice in a day then the timing of car hydrate really starts the matter in that case i see no reason to not in just those nutria's either before during our after you don't need not need it necessarily do it but you can the general rulethum i give is something this i if you doing something where you are trying to really work hard whether this is hyperchry training or a lot of endurance energy expenditures can be high butsential muscle damages high and or energy utilization is high but you want a look four is a number something in the area of half a gram of care hydrate expound of bodyweight you a two hundred pounds you want o make sure that either premed or post or total you bring in a hundred grams of carbohydrate its just a very rough number to start proline is about half of that it is about a quarter of your bodyweight right those numbers would be if your two hundred pounds make sure you have a hundred grams of cars and fifty grams of proline i and again it does not necessarily have to be before or during or after and you will be in a good spot all you need to do then is alter what i do i should say is all through the amount of car a hydrate based on energy expenditure a lower energy and easier work out instead of having a hundred grams of cars i might tack that down to seventy five or even fifty and be at a one to one care preaching ratio if it was even harder more son hotter outside more fluid loss i might go from a hundred grams of cars up to hundred and fifty or two hundred ait closer a three to one or for to one car hydrate approaching ratio those are the numbers that i generally go by well as i take a sip of my doubles press americono you are id love for you to tell us about stimulants sure there is no shortage of these in most of our lives and of course you can cover the health benefits of it later you maybe you have an abode yes we have an episode on caffeine and it does have certain health benefits although one has to use canine correctly in under to drive that there is caffeine is the easy one o struggle with and we will not belabor the point here the evidence is strong it it has an ergeganc effect a you can take it at whatever dosage is reasonable for you and of course there is a bit of a learning curve there such that i see the more you take it the more you need to take even though there is actually some recent evidence showing even folks who ere a acclimated to it will still see an erogenic benefit even know if they do not feel a biggest of is typically that takes thirty to forty five minutes or but it is highly dependent upon the person some people can smell coffee and immediately feel better and that is probably working actuallythrough a different mechanism of anticipation but you can take it there it half life of it is you on four to six hours or something that i and wholly depends the person do not let it room your sleep but if you take it prior to performance it has a a noticeable a fact on a particularly in currant a maximum strength may be less all quit really less on in facts the date are mixed there on whether actually does anything for peak strength although i think most people would a rest would suggest tit no you are on to take it prior to trying to truly lift is is hi as trying to you'll lift a one appetitive mats or similar but most of the the document effects are on the the endurance paces activities yes my read of the literature in terms of performance in hanging effects of can in are that one to three milligrams i one make sure the people hear the unites correctly bits themselves out with at kafir one to three milligrams per kilogram of bodyweight about thirty minutes prior to exercise has a definite performance dancing effect it a has a definite mental performance in hanging effect especially when people who are regular coffin users have abstained from affine for anywhere from two to fifteen days and and that is an extremely rare circumstance but even if they have not it appears that one to three milligrams per kilogram a bodywight of affine taken about i can it is not superprercise as far as i i can see a about thirty minutes before the event starts am can really enhance reaction time and power output and as as well as as you mention endurance when i was researching the taffy episode one interesting any at it a i discovered was that if people are not taffy adapted they are not regular users of affine the sudden introduction of affine can really degrade performance mostly because people do not know how to operate at that high level of autonomic arousal haveyou ever observed that ye a hundred per cent fact there is actually dead to going up as high at ten milligrams for kilogram a bodyweight well which is in fact don't you cross the five milligram per telegram threshold you will start seeing performance decrements there is absolutely such as thing of ruining your performance with too much affine most people listening to this if you are thinking a they said coffin ism all in and d you just stop listening and now yougofir quad the press shop before you every time you go to work out a you probably a passing that threshold if you think about those numbers one to three milligrams for kilogram byway if you weigh a hundred hectogram that is two and or twenty pounds that be something to to five hundred milligrams of affine which is a pretty high amount a but a coffee is going to get you close and espressos going to get you somewhat that ball park depending on sources of you do not really need to go and blister your brain with affine in fact if you do is it is quite common and fact likely that you will actually make performance worse right yet the amount of affine in different coffees and does et camera course varies one thing that people ought to know is that the smallest of commercially available am coffees at the most popular commercial vendor a generally contain anywhere from two hundred fifty to three hundred fifty milligrams of affine what that means is that the called medium and the large contain as much as five hundred milligrams or one graham of coffin for you morning a large coffin at a commercial vendor a a drinkers if you are wondering why you get and a headache if your thirty minutes late on that affine or a if you cannot access that affine it all or even if you are drinking map coffee excuse me from another source you are finding though it is really not doing it for me it is because the amount of affine in the now commercially sold a coffees is exceedingly high it is about two or three times higher than the standard look up tables that you will see on the internet ism not saying that to demonize a taffy we can pretty quickly adapt to in form a tolerance to affine a some people never really can get over the gutters other people am are just fine well with a even a thousand telegrams of affine but only because they have been drinking a lot of affine consistently anyway it is also wildly inconsistent from location of location a the retype the functionouty ye that the see can be very hard to figure out what was happening there is only one way really to a objectively measure affine and that use coffin tablets and they work pretty well achy a some one i know a whose a prominent in the pod kappas uses one hundred to two hundred telegrams of affine in tablet form come lined with tea if they have now condition themselves to think that urbaltea any has is kaffanating a fact but a tablet form affine while ism not recommending it to to a outright it is going to give you the best sense of how much affine you can tolerate in how much is performance enhancing or s performance degrading there is actually another line of supplementation we can go down here which is not technically stimulant but it is something i use to help performance when you do not want coffin and that think specifically if you are one of those folks who have to exercise at night and you want a little bit of boost for your training but you do not one half kink is a messes up your sleep and this is when you can turn to the whole citral an arguing nitroso side a sort of rout and a will skip the explanation there but effectually what happens is that your cosine is this wonderful compound that causes nasal annihilation and of course that is going to aid then in transporting new trains in and out of the cell i it has an cryogenic effect the you have a number of ways you can go about this a some of them have more prose and cons an others and in there are more cordate coming out specifically on sictrlin a more recently if you look though in my opinion the most consistent evidence for the most consistent effect is in the supplement of beat rout or beat produce or extract or something that you can find those supplements and they tend to a again the pretty effective an enhancing perform specifically anything moderate to long er duration and turns performance and they are not a stimulant they will not ruin your sleep that much one a note of caution a tor those who e there interested in saturnine or or beat rule because they are in the argentine pathway if you are somebody who has a a predisposition to cold source am world cold source that is or other forms of cold source that a because activation of the argentine pathways an exacerbate some of the curl related aspects of cold sorts and that is because the virus is the cause those cold sorts actually live on neurons than you want to be very cautious with sturdy n especially high saittuuline i can really amplify that the colt sort response what about non stimulant yet am focus enhancing supplements things alpha p c for example i routinely use three hundred to six hundred telegrams of alpha p c prior to hard physical training typically weight training but occasionally it'll take three hundred telegrams of alpha p c prior to a mental work about am less often these days cause i kind of reserve it for physical training and i do not tend to use it every day i may be once every mum third or forth work out combined with coffee that commination is pretty a pretty potent i find and technically because it is a gallon uric agonist it is not a stimulant in the traditional sense but it has a am focussing and an alertness promoting aspect to it what are your thoughts on those sorts of compounds there's not much human perform exercise performance state a on those there are certainly a cognitive functioning tests on those you are not confined a lot of information no though there is not none we actually will use many of these substances you could global call them neurotics which is o any substance that specifically on hand brain function is it rough way to think about it will use them prior to more challenging bouts of training a this is something that will out say on sparring day only ore the most important training session or a session when you are trying to work on pitch command or we are trying to unhands a work on your shot and as a was small player or you really trying to improve a certain swing is a call fir something that but we do not use them every day we do not use h with every person yet we will use those a they are not stimulants but they can be performance enhancing and another con a way to think about this is if you are in the case of colonic restriction whether you you are trying to lose weight or we are actual on a control weight for weight purposes in terms of a sports we have to be in a certain white class or something that well we may not be able to give you food in fact we may not be all to get you stimulants because of the sleep thing or because we are already man on a sipulancs a now we can go this outman you least mentally you are little bit there and you are more likely to be a let focused and you can train harder despite the fact that we in actually change fun then that is a little bit of a short game in terms of that is not your permanent solution you eventually need to bring calories up whatever other train your training whatever going to do but it can work in a nice short pinch ism very interested to learn from you about fatigue reducers and ism hoping that roseola road will come up in the conversation yet great let us costar right there then there is actually a lot of research on this despite a most people not having heard of it ai being of m mention o previous episode have used it a lot over many many years you have to be lutobite careful of a there the first of all no we only should have said this at the onset the no supplement is ha panacea i nothings for no work forryngand rode is no no different it cannot have a number of effects if you look across e literature you can to find generally somewhere between a small benefit to little benefit but not often is it detrimental with a few exceptions i know of a handful of papers that would be to specifically where it may actually reduce muscular endurance no i fine if you think abut what is happening is one of the benefits that has been seen far with roseola is it is helpful at managing cortical but cortical suppression is not a necessarily good thing we talked about how if you do in acute about stress cortical will go noway up and that is a sign of of acute stress however a sign of long term excessive stress is cortical suppression and this is a thing to be really careful of you see you are feeling down or lethargic or tired and you think you are adrenal were messed up and the you start taking cortical modulators you could be making the problem worse because now your cuortisallis actually suppressed and now you are taking these things to blunt or keep it low and and your you continue to feel lethargic and and lack of desire an libido and focus in the sort of all the thing cortical is not a bad thing we want this to be going up and down a any amounts at we want if we were for thinking about for example waking up you would want general something a fifty per cent reduction in the first hour and from cortical concentrations however if you are extremely suppressed already going down is is only going to be a problem roseola is is has a a good evidence base to support it for that you will see actually a number of of studies that if looked at it in a whole host of arias i for benefit something good to do a the difficult part with roseola to be quite on us is getting it for my high quality brand and for it is difficult to get as a single source which is a very very important thing to do with supplement to try to get them sourced alone i rot all it tiffically comes in combination with any other rubles or other stuff a drink support and tetra camera that also then getting him then third party certified which for most folks is not necessary but for any at theta tat need to go through drug testing systems you should not take any supplement at all that does not have some the sort of third party certification those of the challenges that being said if you have ever renting it somebody who is taken roseola and i did not do anything for me it it is possible that is you've nothing worse forevermore it also could be just very poor quality sourcing if you look at a the there have been a number of papers on it is perception of fatigue and use sort of mention that you felt pretty immediate effects have taken in a few times yen's fairly sens motive supplements but have started take in a roseola be work work outs and found that i could push much harder much longer through the work out normally it or typically before taking it am that is in sessions where i did not take it i would be able to work o very hard for twenty minutes or than next ten minutes i could get some work output and then the remaining o period of time it was kind of a tapering off now granted these are very intense training sessions these are not the endurance training sessions these of the way training sessions that one one time for week parody part type sessions ah what have notices i can complete the entire sixty minutes with with minimal fatigue now may obviously i get fatigues within station of course i you remain human dust by taking it but m i found to be very useful and have been using it whenever i use alpha p c prior poor to work outs and have been impressed by by it over all i do not a highlight something that you said because i think it vitally important which is that using single ingredient formulations for most things is critical to figuring out what works for you what does in what dosages you need being able to take things a two on one off i two days on one day off for instants being able to a increase dosage in the morning and then may be reduced to doses in combine with something else in the afternoon singleingredient formulations or much the only way to do that there is perhaps only one supplement that i take at all and that is athletic greens as they've been a regular potcasponsor for a long time that is a cocktail of many many things and those are all adaptagens as well as son robotics in fitments and things that ism not opposed to blends were the blends include a lot of neutraants that are synergistic but for all pill capsule a based supplements where ism looking for very targeted of factions not just about a foundational nutrition i really believe strongly that single ingredient formulations of the way that you can build a rational approach to supplementation and also make adjustments if something is it making you feel better and also make adjustments of something really working for for instance some people might take alpha p c three hundred milligrams and not feel anything go up to six hundred telegrams not feel anything may be just feel kind of a they do not it other people myself took three hundred milligrams of alpha p we the first times while this really puts me in the zone but i want to be really careful how often i use it i did mention i go up to sunder milligrams occasionally but that really puts me on the outer threshold of can of over all levels of focus and camped up such that if i drink too much affiant can tell me over the edge i encourage people to become scientists of themselves and the only way to do that is to try t limit the number of variables and the final point is that i think that single ingredient formulations are by far the best in terms of changing things over time this could be a a women during their menstrual cycle might find that during certain phases of the cycle they are more sensitive to certain things than not others am and for men and women it may be that you are certain times of year even and a certain supplements might go better closer to sleep some earlier in the day en on and on and on there is just no real way in my opinion to have a supplementation protocol that involves lots in lots of blends one or two bless o k but blots of blends i think that is a i shall think that is residentially dangerous territory yet i mean just take roseola as god example i know a a new metanalisies came out a just in the last few months looking at it and they found in general you see again a slight to modern improvement and everything from a power output to fatigue resistant and a occident effects a to injurious performance it is like oke grit maybe this little bit here now let say you went to do it in the only way you could access roseola is in combination with that and a some blinds man and some other of these adapted ins for a cychell wait a minute i just wanted to take the to get a better work out but now it also came with the stimulant or this corosoll suppressor or coral activator well now also you cannot take it at night or you cannot take in the morning cause you are orgy you are to head coffee your yuroptions ares way limited i think the biggest part of all that if you if something does not feel good you have absolute no idea you do not now if this polio you soft know if is the bostuellian insaner you do not know if it was any the other things that were smashed in there or it could be something as simple as the a the the nitric acid they use some other combination a thing and now here you are thinking that some supplement that actually works for you does not and you throw that out of your repertoire a for the rest of your life which is you not the biggest crime but it is not needed and you are not really going to know yet i fully stamped you can look back at my course lectures r last dead and you will see stamped number one on the supplement let sections is make sure you are taking single ingredient supplements at all costs the last part about that too is you are more likely to in sure the amount that is on the label is correct if you are taking roseola and it says in its a hundred milligrams in there and if that is only thing lit is in there you more likely than not to actually get something close now they are never perfect but will be close if it is in a combination of twenty other things you actually do not have any idea that is in there i in fact there have been many papers on a melatonin and it em indeed and a number of other supplements in which when you actually pull hem off the shelf these are the standard studies wet they would going by say twenty to twenty five different supplements in case of meletonean n will actually measure the mount of melton actually in them n despite the fact that the label says five milligrams they can be up to a five hundred to a thousandfold actual concentration in that supplement and then you wonder why some people react great maltose an some people absolutely destroys you and this is also i w will action will see this constantly people will have five hundred times the upper limit a melatonin the morning after when the half life is supposed to be more ninety minutes it should be totally gone give there seen extremely i non not even talking double ism talking ten twenty thirty acts the upper limit rain for melton the next morning and an as lychee a what ye taking is i got got this melatonin at store or ex website yolk wholly cow i ism of not a posed to melatonin theoretically i but you have to be careful without one in particular any supplement has that to be true you want to by them from as many places as you can that our high quality and if they are a third party tested even if you are not a performance athlete i mistresses even if you are not a performance they third party certified and test the supplements are you are less likely to just just get wildly high concentrations or low concentrations of act of ingredients relative to other ones when you might get for keeper but you could be totally rocking yourself by getting fifty telegrams of melton every night and not realizing it that of course the next morning you drown yourself in affine and then you can see what death cycle your in now i am people could look forth their party certification on the packaging and am someone besides will lie cumin on the bottle beforehand i you it is largely listed on on certain a vendor web sites a brief point about supplement cost an blends an i promises will be a brief point different ingredients meaning different types of supplements have widely varying costs in order to car to i on enrtomanufacture them all is grate you will find is that blends well am included the least amount of the most expensive a ingredient right am not always the case the some their certain exceptions to this i mention some blends that i a few minutes ago that are for foundational nutrition adaptations in robotics i petty groans of worships being one of several examples out there but when it comes to say a sleep blend or a rework out blend there are some decent products out there but a lot of them tend to put in more of the least expense of ingredients and less of the ones that you are actively seeking and those tend to be a kaffiintends to be a kind of a buffer against the other things meaning if ye rework out putting caffeine an there isn't necessarily a bad thing but if has five other things in there oftentimes what manufacturers will cheat on is the actual amounts of the things that are costly am again singly gradient formulations for eighty per cent of your supplements think is really i the way to go and the other thing the knows can come up as we are talking about all the supplements is h issue of dependency i often get this question and when i solicit to for questions on social media in anticipation of this episode number f people said o case if you would take a sleep formulation do i need to take it every night if i do not take it while i have an incredibly hard time sleeping if i take a rework out every time i train will i will i need it m its a great question am some people will take supplement holidays as they may be called a for a couple of days each week back to back some people take them straight through i myself take us asleep cocktail we have described his magnesium thespian an things this is not one ingredient these are multiple ingredients in fact precisely because some people who have sleep walking in vivid dream issues cannot take the inion before bed in any case have had times when i either forgot my supplements that is rare where i just did not have what i needed were just simply took a break for a night and it was not a problem but wen terms of are work out i do think that people become dependent on being in that really ramped up state but i do not think we view all this as lace dude dependency ism a diction tot right i mean i define addiction as a progressive narrowing of the things that bring you pleasure you like i suppose people could get addicted to are work out but it seems a little unlikely more likely there would be a dependency such that if you did not have your rework out might feel lie i not motivated to train what your thoughts on ism taking little holidays from supplements and varying frequency of supplement in takin particular as it relates to stimulants and fatigue reducers the end goal any time i coach somebody is to get them into a physiological state in which they require no or close to no supplementation that is the target we should really be any position to where our life style our sunlight exposure our stress management our physical activity our sleep on our hydration and our whole food nutrition provide us almost everything we need now look again there are some foundational items that we can give people we put to get a little bundle actually for this a basic things even go look out but the that is the gold right the target is to be get your physiology running your physiology is way smarter then we are even if i take a bunch of bile markers from you you physiology still knows better than those few markers can tell me that is always were ending up i actually personally do not people being in a position that they have to take a supplement for anything i do not it if you have to take a supplement to have a good night asleep i do not it if you have to have a supplement to train we will use any the stimulants very very carefully with any the ethics we work with and certainly for the non ashes because at least they anything we have an enate we have a fight schedril we have a season we have a gameyour en a pitch whatever wen you do not have that it is sort of you in this endless psycleif oh you us going to do that all day every day we do not really need to be in that spot what i the way that i describe my philosophy is i will use those short term tactics too symptom manage if i have to if somebody comes to me and your feeling awful and we have got i get through the get get maybe will give you something for sleep immediately to get you sleeping that allows us to then come back and work on the cause problem right this is what is why are you having a wartime sleeping anyways if you have to take a a nine cocktail supplement to sleep then all we are doing is is blinding the reason why you in that position to begin with right we see this all the time whether it is sleep problems whether this coatis all at tistostron the question is why is that low now we may give you something age to manage it immediately but the task tithe mystery ism going to try to unveil is why why is it there to begin with this could be something this is natural for you and your lack of energy is something else or could be actually it is not a natural level for you but something is suppressing it any number of you have got some infection going on there's some i we large c reaction is something in your environment there's o you a would a mercury that one comes up a lot you will see mercury in folks an that is causing a lot of problems i or any number of heavy meals or toxins i any host thing psychological distress bad daily habit you do not ever see the sun you soft ever sweat you do not never drink were talk about many things ism always going to hunt for that an i hate using this phrase it is highly maligned for a good reason but route cause in we are trying to find that its are we making sure that we are not causing this problem and ism not going to want to give you a supplement to cover up something if we are not even trying to solve the problem of whilst being there that being said an i that concerned about people taking an mufti vitamin just all the no not really an mi concerned about people taking treating no go ahead tho those ones are generally a pretty fine to to just take but anything else i want a reason i really do not giving people anything in a superphysiological concentration ore a super food concentration right get an amount you would not find in a normal food dosage unless we have really a specific reason some of these things are more problematic others are less problematic when an ant to answer the question of dependency you have a combination of actual physiological dependency canine that actually creates a physiological dfinnecy versus a an emotional ore psychological dependency or just a i drinking this that is my habit that is my routine there is a fancy scientific craze for that but it does not matte yet we want to get off that and again my personal philosophy is i do not want you dependent upon anything i want to create extremely resilient people and i want to create physiological resilient we actually have a fancy little sugar than we use to to measure that in people and s we can actually calculate that number and the goal of us is to push that number higher that we do not have to have anything ism many situations pop up in your real life you are not can have your supplement or your no can have your routine or you no can have your journal or whatever but also for the long term i do not want to create a situation which this is a short try success that you have to now do that the rest of your life no let us us get out of the way that is fix the problem if if there is something some to management that is real while we are actually searching for better foundational habits ism the last thing i want to say about this is if you are only covering symptom you are really missing signal chichis if you are constantly tired throughout the day and a we your doing is giving yourself a a number of alpha p sees and coffins set a even others good litesoger are you really disusing that to allow your poor see begin to happen if they took those away i beth you you would actually tart addressing your sleep if that is the cause right right your interest sir you're poridration you would go hunting for the problem and the you want walk a fine line here going haycock is an pathetic greens supplement that know probably not but wait an am i actually now covering up the pain point that is maybe needed it is the signal to actually get my ass and gear to go make one of these changes am whatever it is to be i know i tit a little bit met on you a little be off i that is honestly how i approach yet i think it is really important a friend of mind whose a physician has a great saying which is better living through chemistry still requires better living bel that is cod that is you knowing it pertains also to things and to depress and and get it drugs and things that sort most all of those things were developed as tools to allow people to move from ay a maladaptive state a maladaptive is hard to define but think about in any domain of life you can either be back on your heels flatfooted or forward center of mass and there are times when people are compromised nor chemically that they need to use farm apology in order to get into a flatfooted position on there really back on their heels flatfooted or forward center mass but the idea was always that those things were developed as things to allow people engage in the sorts of behaviors that can produce the same sorts of petrochemical shifts and the people are thing well what sorts of behaviors can induce season or chemical ships it'll just fume out myself for a moment here and say i am a big proponent i believe you are as well if i may in doing behavioral tools first whenever possible really establishing good habits the us and do not they've talked a lot about in this series and in this episode then excellent nutrition which involves us and dots volume from choice timing all the factors and then also supplementation and also there sometimes a case for prescription drugs certainly and often bring machine interface or body machine interface measuring stuff using devices but ti the foundation of behaviors and good nutrition are really truly foundational and it is hard in anything to skip steps but supplements and prescription drugs are one place where people often skip steps and then that they do not actually learn how to cultivate the best a behavioral practices including the do not as you mention and then just one more point along these lines you takes about taking anything for energy is really a disruptive to the system and it is because especially affine while it has its uses and even health benefits it is truly borrowing it is against the adenosine system with interest and because caffeine acts as in a benzine antagonists effectively while affine is present in those receptors you do not feel a sleepy you have more energy your we reaction time goes down memories hands folk as performance of all kinds yes but then when that affine is dislodged from the receptor then the adenosine can act even more potently at those receptors sort of being able to borrow against the normal variations and wakefulness and sleep and this is why we encourage people if they are not training first thing in the morning to push their canine and take out about nine to hundred twenty months after we sing they can clear some of that a benzine in the morning which tends to happen even a after we wake up u people can listen to episodes on master sleep or perfect sleep or the canine episode to understand more about that but the the final thing i just want to say here than it it impromptu a question is you in been thinking about supplement protocols i think a lot of people assume that once they start taking something they are going have to take it all the time and one idea perhaps is that people have some a alpha p c around that they could take and granted be great if people could try things without having to buy a whole product i think companies hopefully or listening to this and will ism give people sample to see if something works for them and then give them an opportunity o try it to have things around but not necessarily assumingyou into take it every time right some things you take everyday foundational nutrition a supplements for instance but then also to take a look at how well you are eating or not eating right at times when ism eating much better i consuming this sugar fermented foods which are great for the got microfilm i can sun less robotics if ever have been really compromised for whatever reason then i will take piliform robotics but done take those all the time i because i get them from foodie from certain green long green strings athletic greens and forth i think that nutrition and supplementation are are tethered in this way in my mind and i do not think that ism most people think of supplementation is something that we can introduce a lot of arability and when and how you take them but as far as ism concerned as all are single ingredient formulations you can be ism you can u supplements once a week on want you use hem seven days a week you could use them ism twice to day four times a day everyday or you could use them not at all agreed yet some of em a we will have an effect handily that others will not and we talked about creating being one of them its if you are going to take at once or week than there i ma base it no benefit that is a very good point very you creating i bate a fallen is another fantastic example of something you need to take consistently if you want some sort of benefit a it needs to be built up in muscle when need to use that to create a caressing which is what is actioncan help us with our fatigue management that is why we come up can asset buffer ism in our previous metabolism ups we talked about that being a major cause of fatigue ism the wonderful part the erewhile lies is we bade fallen work effectively is it blocks that build up that is a example of another won you would want to take other things fish oil you could certainly skip a day here and there it would not be that ideal i also do support your comment if you can take absolutely none of these things and and be just fine i in terms of and i will not come back may be to bat alley a second in terms to have some other funds toff might cole great sky ran a really cool number of studies looking at how exercise actually alters that got microbyon this is action area that we have probably have three hundred stool samples sitting in my freeze room i goodness another reason to pause before entering your lab ye another reason to not applying to come be one of my graduate let you won to do it that i l act ho have a number we have applied for a couple of grants to look moments a specifically with females is hope full even get that funded but nonetheless i you cannot she sees tome i party from magic and i say that word on purpose changes in the got mice o by this one in particular study was thinking of that great did is he looked at the the changes report an alter marathon in even within a single bout of exercise i i can real the somebody markers but i know one of the markers i was specifically increased by fourteen thousand per cent after a single bout of exercise now this is an most marathon this is i totally absurd amount of exercise relative to a normal people would do would be but that number i remember it was fourteen thousand two hundred twenty nine per center something some ran on hm o that of something meaning full yes something mean if like cannot remember which marker i that was that ad changed a i now strut a coccis was in there struck a coccis went up k maybe something more thirty or forty or fifty percents the point is we have not even had the proper time and we do not to even launch in the go micro boon i supplementation there needs to be ultra specific i you would not be best served to just jump in and take random things there that is it is a whole area of emerging science we know very very very little about it but there is a number of actionable things one could do i there probably something to not mess with i would certainly work with a qualified physician if you think you have something going on clinical er you have some actual problem there do not work with some one is not a specialist i melodic there but i just randomly assigning much of robotics or free bionics without intention is is may be the next for front of human performance research but well have to me be come back in a few years and even that in detail her perhaps you can bring somebody out as an expert in that to discuss that yet got mice boom is fascinating i think of sleep as the most powerful performance enhancing activity a of course you still have to do the activity ye eye considerate foundation like the busy work raises the tide of mental health physical health performance of all kinds am there is recent data that during sleep your body goes through all its various forms of metabolism possible ye the which is a ma aging sos measured from breath in human subjects at breathmatabolites in human subjects obviously a if one is thinking about supplementation and wondering o were what is what is the best supplement to enhance performance you gave some a great rational for why creatine would be an excellent choice provided your eating well and a hydrating well and then to my mind the next thing on the lest would be anything that allows you to improve the quality and maybe even the duration of your sleep although if your wake up in your feel rested throughout the day and only need a short nap in the afternoon not everyone needs one but then generally that means your feeling of people sometimes get flipped on to this idea that they have insomnia in sonic is excessive daytime sleepiness we you are falling asleep during the day that is insomnia could also be narcolepsy but that is insomnia but supplementation to improve the quality or duration of sleep for both seems to me the a most direct rout even though actually technically its an indirect rout to a performance enhancement and then thinking about things that increase alertness and stimulants and fit and fatigue producers mouthing that is a good logic ye we go to absurd lights to die sleep in as much as we can an the honest answer is truly absurd this is a conflict of interest that might my company ism apart as absolute rest is it y in that company we actually go out to your house and run a full clinical grade sleep study in you your bedroom on you run that oeremultiple nights the o having to go to a sleep clinic and and have it done in this heard hospital room or sort of setting with this people looking at you through a me it is tolicreepy a that is important because that is the only way to truly determine how you are sleeping now that is said the technology of wearable tracers is getting better in fact i would actually predict those things will reach a level of accuracy equivalent to the piety in the next couple of years and probably will get after a approval to be able to dag no sufficiently sleep disorders that is my total my my prediction from some ins id formation i do not know that to be true but it is getting a lot better right now those wearable are not occur enough to meet that threshold that we do is we bring out basely all the equipment i to do that we will come in and do that now once we understand exactly how you are sleeping the next question is to answer why are you sleeping that way and this is a full fourfold system a number one is wrong to look at biology what tang's going to take saliva and blood and we'elooking at everything from a narrow transmitters concentrations to a fitments be six be twelve at camera that are important for sleep performance run to see is that it isn't a physiological problem is there something happened is sort us all the tie ratio that we previously talked about or is something that off if it is not physiology they were going on the next one which is environmental we re in a full environmental scan of your bedroom during those nights of sleep that were there and that is really important because we can look at everything from dander and fallen and cordons hat are in the air a hat quick tip here is wash your sheets at least once a weep one of the common most common places that people i get allowing in the air is actually from accumulation on your sheets if you clean those more often i you will be in a better spot an next one the next one there also is that keep your ism sorry this hurts my heart i do not even by i and in truth fulness i violate this but keep your pets out of your bedroom n certainly keep them off your bed our our ghostface killer is my dog and melkkees my other one they do not go on my bed but they're right next my bed i we violate that one but full an iron outspan includes all those things of course there is we measure light and temperature an humidity and everything else is going on the room am solid organics that are coming out of the mattress from moll the hide lead out o out of the wall all these things that could potentially just rupture sleep and we want to make sure that none of those things are kicking on a we see this constantly people will have things trying to be cool and they want to be cold at night cause it's important and the will turn air conditioner n honor of fan but they air conistior kicking on and off a night actually can couth you out of various sleep stations you want o be really careful that is going the last metric on that is actually seal to and what you remember from our metabolism discussion is when you hail yourebreathing out seal too well if your room is closed and the ventilation is not great the amount of we two in your room starts to build up and we actually very specifically no the threshold a baste one information collected from the national spacestaction actually we know the threshold of which seal two crosses and starts indistrupting sleep we want to make sure that you're not sitting in the seal two bath in fronting your face and then breathing aback in and indistrupting your sleep environment is the sect one the third one his actually now psychology a one of the members on our team is a hazard empty and psychiatry an and put together n entire sleep scan a survey we run through all that to we if there is anxiety depression anything that psychological going on and in the firth fourth one there is if you have some sort of actual sleep pathology and this again well include some i tracking stuff that we can use we take all those data they go back to our team a we work in commination with with steep lucky a from harder who is done a tone a stuff ye act set up a lot of the circadian rhthmstuff in the natural spacestation as well i himself every durmoran empty oh d et camera and all these folks in a room go over your data identify what is going on then to build action plans off o that occasionally those action plans i include supplementation but only if necessary were really going to try to come back and work through a system i to improve the sleep however is need i realize that is not a totally accessible for a lot of people but if you really need to go to the end of the earth to figured out sleep i that service is available absolute rest sounds an amazing tool given the most people will not be able to use it am we access it although we will provide a linking case people or interested in it and do want to try it you mention a few things that i think every one should a assay their sleeping environment for and ism determined whether not they are hindering their sleep a without realizing it for instance the a air condition in going on and off or this could be heater going on and off or ism central heat heating or cooling unit i this could be i keeping the room dark a this could be a cleaning your sheets i certainly that does not require a a that one send out for absolute as cleaning one sheets routinely keeping pats out of the bedroom as a you would admitted you do not entirely i differing opinions about that but if your having sleep issues the dander for animals may may be part of those issues and then one that it'll just add which i think it is pretty interesting is t there some beautiful data out of michael terminus lab at a colombia medical school in new york ism o negative ionization and the sounds pretty a wacky kind of new a ism sure some your negative ionization but is in the vermin lab as a serious laboratory focus on creating biology for many decades now negative i on concentrations are higher n year coastal locations is if you have ever gone to the sea or gone on vacation and you sleep better near body of water that is actually a real thing and there are negative ionization machines but there also somethings that one can do in order to increase the negative ion concentration in their sleeping environment that are a yearly's hero cost if not zero cost you can look those up on line and we probably will do in entire episode about this in the future but i think what you describe for absolute rest really highlights of more general set of themes that i think a really important which is your sleep environment is an environment it is got a lot going on in it and it is worth running through the check list that you described in asking you don't were we things may be not optimize but where my really getting in my own way in terms of sleep all of this again being relate to the fact that getting excellent sleep consistently is at come completely transform everything that you do and not getting excellent sleep consistently which is a challenge for many people i will also transform everything that you do and think and feel but in the negative direct yet i can also offer a few tips on sleep based on things we find most consistently for those that no cannot go through a the protocol ism one quick little actually a called time shifter is really cool for anyone that is dealing with consistent travel and gentle you can go an enter your location your time where you are going the location and an it will actually back calculating it'll give you full light a stimulant food hydration its of protocol and you just fallow along with that and we have use that for many years actually especially when travelling on opudobby for nice and a mongolia and brazil for the epics and it all over the place ism that is i think that pistole available i hope i it is it is great i a nice to i a couple of things were found major if you are dealing with acid reflect if you are someone who has problems that you can just elevate the head of your bed by six inches if you you put little piece of wad or something underneath it i you can also buy very inexpensive pillows i that can elevate that now that is not solving the problem but at least can help you sleep it whether it is just that night or if it is a consistent problem you can do there i if you are snoring i said that is not really benin you should probably take a look at that you are first stop there is mouth ten i if that does not work you can go through its called mile functional therapy i which on non if you have cover that before but it is basely tongue exercises i that can be quite effect of specifically for people who have problems with red sleep mount functional there e i it is vista can it is catlike you do depending o the protocol a some tongue exercises kind of the morning afternoon her night and that takes a while to be honest you probably going to need least six weeks before you start saying anything but that actually is is pretty well demonstrated to help lessee you can probably bugler could find a link for for exact protocol do not want a described be them but yet you can strengthen your tongue that it stops falling in the back of your neck and waking you up at night that is a really free easy freeprotocall to use i if your struggling with i it could be in sonic but i could be just things when you get in to bed your supertiren you cannot fall asleep or things that kind of a basic grub humbly use is only two things happen in your bed and if you can make sure those the only two things you do in your bed the problems of falling sleeper and somyou attend to go down those two things are you have sexton you sleep and nothing else goes down in your bed and you can make that environment ism very special and thank can help a quite effectively improve your ability to fall asleep i then not wake up early keeping that environment specific to what it is for i can be effected the only other thing i could think of is and i i can't to say this is not superpractical but it is just quite clear at this point sleeping with a partner in your bed it is just not very good for sleep you look wit that one i know i you can do a couple of things if it helps i you can get two smaller beds and put them right next to each other if you can actually have separate sheets that alone can be helpful ism if you get you may if you are hon i king sizes better something man again i know some people it is there is no chance but if you want another the cost for your the if ad your relation not your use your loved one i really is do we to o i yogis i the only lasting i want to mention here is something that is popped up just a few times recently but you are going to see for a which is called orthosomnia is that is a term that is people are growing concerned over a which is enables and sleep trackers causing sleep issues people be basely become too obsessed with optimizing maximizing scores and that alone will actually its text you you learn when to wake up and you have actually y and ittistpatory response when many hours fire to waking up if you actually learn to have a little bit of a what is a little molecule excited an and what oh dopa mean that is the one if you start getting that could you wake up when you get superexcited the check your score or your faulty bus the something if you check your plan or twitter whenever in met morning that all act you start carving back your wake up time because you start launching it it can ruin sleep becoming to obsess what it'll say is if you are going to use a sleep tracker and you just do not carry you on check an you have fun it it great but if you are really really really interested in it and you pay lot of attention to it do not check your sleep score for at least the first sixty minutes after waking up an any that should help you that is a great totally i think they'll a and piece of advice i thing generally because i thing lot of people are waking up the mill the night checking their phone two or three times per night kind of wondering why they are doing that and ism guessing its this anticipatory wake up circuit yet you absolutely shut use either your night mote or do not disturb or air plain motor something over night or leave it out of the room yet i mean if you have to wake up and some people have a a family member whose may be on great healthiness they have to get your phone around a cease they call or things that i get it your i cannot leave it out you leap it in the leave it and do not disturb and enter and their who number whoever number only they can get through but keep it black and white if you do have to look at your phone at night you see black and white and you do not have notification make sure that here is no notification for no meal in anew dial get a that self off your screen and you look at the did anybody called anybody tests of importance am what time is it no emergency going on black and white of right back to sleep that can help a little bit one of the supplements that have found is extremely useful for being able to fall back asleep if have woken up in mill the night and for some reason cannot and is also very effective for enhancing sleep when one is investing fewer cargo hydrates issued the lot of people run into or for people that are fasting for many hours before sleep in o people or trying to not eat anything within unsure of four hours but is it nositall nine hundred milligrams mi my o an stall i i find again this is panic data to be clear this i wake up in the mill the night and have taken nine hundred milligrams of an coital before initially falling asleep that i fall back to sleep much more easily that is why have added nine hundredmilegrams of an hospital to my called sleep stack v also tried just taking it alone and it works well alone but t works better gorse with the machree and eight a apagenan thing sleep stack the u the also in terms of tools for sleep the the a a revery that was devolved by my colleague doctor davit's people who is a medical doctor at stamford psychiatry simmer schoolmensin cychaetry there is a free trial there is a nominal cost if you use it month o month but the data are really strong that people that use that i think it is eight to eleven minutes sleep hypnosis once to weep and it does not have to be in they'll the night when you wake up really help improve people's am billy of fall asleep quickly stay asleep fall back asleep if they wake up in mom the night in some cases curing insomnia in other cases religious helping people with their general sleep issues and i mention this because i obvusis the technology is not a supplement but i know that some people are supplement of verse also if you look at by the cost comparison between taking the sleep fact italy a and the revery a it is pennies on the dollar really ism get ism a proposing of both for myself but i realize that people have varying budgets and again i should say as always behavior a tools first and i think of the revert a as as more less of behavioral tool yet it is a it is really just a tool any these prothwork protocols hippos photocells there is just a tool for you to touch backing with your on physiology rather than a a substance that is coming and i i fully support those we have used a number of those a in in protocols there is some other tricks we can pull in those areas i i probation say is but the really it is depending on what is keeping you up sometimes we recommend just getting up and getting it done if it is a really they give it is a a project or a thing or whatever i sometimes it rather than lying there all night not sleeping you can get up get it done and the if you stay awake fine at least the anxiety's gone or sometimes you gash go back to sleep to especially the task only little would take ten or fifteen minutes i it may ruin your sleep but your con have on sleep always you can try that tool i you do not want to pull that carvery often and you have to h be very careful what you consider to be something worthy have doing that but that is between me and you and nobody else here that is the tool i have used personally more than a few times or a dislike i get an idea i do not lose it or the solution for something you have been doling on for a long time pops in your head just in your not wing to forget just get up get at done and get on the your day in several previous episodes you emphasis how exercise induces serious adaptations depending on the typespecificity volume intensity camera of the exercise and that during exercise the degree of adaptation that one triggers is often associate with things that normally we do not associate with exercise related health things huge increases in blood pressure during exercise huge increases in inflammatory markers muscle damage and these all things all sound terrible but as you beautifully explained all of that trigger's adaptations that then bring those markers below the base line with which they were previous to the exercise that is the adaptation in the recovery within the realm of supplementation nutrition ism aware of a number of things same urban some lipid base other compounds that a use for various things but that are known to have a potent anti inflammatory effect things a magothry fatiacids ash gone for its effect on court is all although that is a bit indirect to the inflammatory pathway churchmen a and things of that sort given that we want inflammation in order to trigger the adaptation response to exercise and given that we want to reduce inflammation in the recovery period can we put together a logical framework as to when is best to take anything anti inflammatory whether it supplement base or prescription or over the counter drug and when to strictly avoid taking any antiinflamatory supplement or a no behavioral tool you mention ice can reduce inflammation that is what you do not want to do it too close to exercise nu may i think you get the just of the question what about specific supplements related to inflammation and anti inflammatory responses what are the best ones when shall we take them when should we avoid taken the way that i think about it is understanding what we call the fitness fatigue model i mean be that is whenever you do some sort of insult the whole idea is for you to come back and get an adaptation a recovery is not adaptation y recovers recovery adaptation is what happens after you are recovered i sodas a very importanstinction that finish fatigue model salsas you have done something and you have got an adaptation and you have enhanced fitness and by fitness in this case i mean as a non specific term you got stronger you i improve your dens whatever thing you are trying to train for at the same time though your fatigue elevated what happens is if fitness increases at the same or a similar rate as fatigue your performance actually is not any better and you may think all my program is working i need to then train harder or i need to take more and i flat or whatever the things are when reality all you really need to do is reduce fatigue and if you do that your performance will increase and all the training adaptations will be actualized the way that we do that is a couple of things first informant is actually a taper the the first step i think of if someone is training very very hard and you are not seen any results and we want think about supplementation before i get there i want to think about taper and dead if you are actually training hard and sleep and anything else is taken care just without going too far intotaper some general for general examiners there and you want a think about about a fifty percent reduction in training volume over the course of about a week for every eight weeks of training supersuper rough right if you been training hard for three months for something you might want a taper for two weeks something that right its sort of a rough estimate that taper you actually do not need to reduce intensity case intensity's not the driver fatigue attend to be volume long as your volume is reduced by fifty percent you can maintain intensity you can maintain in fact i gently would recommend manta dining frequency s refer use to work in out for days a week keep it forays week you can go down a little bit in frequency but if you got on too much in frequency you actually tend to feel superlethargic i would not do that if you do those things correctly you can ten pity sea somewhere between a three to eight per cent improvement of performance an within a matter of days it is important to do that am we actually ran a study on cross country runners years ago testing on a metabolic card muscle bosses blood a whole bunch of things and we did at free in post three weeks of taper and we actually this is cool because we did this in competitive season sees were collegiate cross country runners and we got them to come to our lab three weeks before their conference championship ran them all through much a testing by obey them they went through the three week taper and we buy up see them again an the thy went and ran am their conference championships s well what happened was they in a pitting about a fifty per cent reduction because what they did as they took out will we call the junk volume they kept their race tempest intensity stuff in there i they kept the recovery stuff and that medium pace they justpasey reduced now they were terrified as any endurance ruler or parents out later purtisement would understand a when you take volume away they tend to get very nervous and they did not that but as a result to that what we saw as their view to acts despite the fact that they covered half the mileage their veal to macs did not go down in three weeks a reduced taper your fitness is in is extremely stable and in fact once we actually looked at their data the ensiles in their muscle responsible for outdated metabolism were maintained and you do not have to worry about losing again fitness with retaking about over all performance or even am oxygen capacity my o condo function et camera that was all preserved obviously we saw performance go up but was actually really interesting is we saw i think it was grounded ten per cent increase in time to rich your fast witch muscle fiber size s we saw ten per cent increase in fast fiber size at the end of three weeks of tapering now what you may think is while i guess tapering is anabolic but that is probably not what happen what realistically probably happened was their volume of training was actually causing their fires to be reduced in size and the once we remove that fatigue they just recovered back to normal that is a good example of what ism talking about once you remove the fatigue you can actually see in hansinse and performance not because you are necessarily getting better but because you are moving the stimuli that suppressing him that being said the way the you want a think about recovery this is although recovery especially that injury recovery seams chaotic biology's very organized and there is a very specific three step process that you can a go through for recovery and then there are different supplements that can help you in each of those three areas area one is basely inflammation this is when the side a kin storm comes rolling out a start sign filing the injuries there in the case even if it is muscle damage am inactive ate i man system to kick on an that whole repair process happens there ism what you are trying to do effectively infect this is why y you probably ever wonder why is inflammation a thing ism what you are trying to do is bring include unhands the size and increase blood flow ins the we neutrinos for repair and a man cells and that in the system an get the waste out short term inflammation even the case of muscle soreness is the example we wen we talked about the previous ups but any inflammation it is part of the necessary process that is why you would not want to take an antiniflamatory in that state an why you also would not want to do things an ice spot ism in that immediate in lavatory response time window this is in seconds to hours after training you would want to stay away from things that ism a good action here are things all make a threes am good evidence together somewhere in the neighborhood of two to five grams total typically a one to one i spite d the ratio is fine similarly this is another example of when good does it mean more is better ism cause for example there is e a actually evidence showing up to fifteen grams well harm they mean response and you do not dust one to be map supersoreum trying hard er ism just going to go to ten grams and ore more or more me you are actually causing yourself more of a problem i anti linens wanton the lavatories are fine again it'll make a trace in that dosage ism are a decent thing ism you can also do something five hundred milligrams of cerumen three times a day that is con be enough a to keep you in a decent spot am there are some other things that you could look up a maybe some potential benefit for ginger ism an basuellia and somethings that for inflammation but under unless we are in very specific circumstances where we have an injury i more probably note going to those areas it is going to i one thing that came up in a previous episode some not all people but some including myself are very sensitive kirkman yet it has a very potent effect in reducing d h t had cestostron and least all sorts of a clamping of testosterone associated positive things i i a experience that myself have had people right to me and say i do not understand i s are taking a supplement ism kercumence us to be a great anytime lavatory it flat line my libido it took away my drive i thin i wondering what is going on there those people are very likely to be very d h sensitive cerumen while it is a podinentineflamatory can also puttontly reduce t h t but some people tolerate it quite well and our hearing this a poly thing that is ridiculous well it is i certainly substantiated by the a chemical pathways that kirkman taps into the known roles of d h t on legit aggression power output et camera and mood just be weary that ism e there is no way to predict this one simply has to figured out impure my mean you have to try and see if you it or do not a the good news is is those a negative effects on the seem to reverse pretty quickly after am the teasing to take a kirkman just a mention of something that came up in previous episode but in case people din hear that on that segment am just wane to highline those those facts further evidence y i strongly discourage strongly discourage taking anything in the anting lament or antigen around unless you actual have a reason to do i if you are waking up n maybe ism inflamed that is probably not a good approach let us have a reason to do step too is actual we we call proliferation and that is conn that clean up crew that is when you are in to be going in there and cleaning out dead sells and debris and misfiled de prolines and things that at this stage i fantastic evident space supplement a it is glucose ludo mean twenty grams to day we typically honestly put it up into twodosage engrams morning engrams night it is a conditional monoacid which means you can make it you are body can make enough of it at times an other times you may have support it a generally those conditional times are things burn victims am high stress situations or injury things that am there is not also a ton of downside to gludomin because it can go through a transamination which means your body can take it and say we do not need anything here for our must recovery let us make it into in a something else use it i for whatever else is yean it is kind of another one of these low risk a products is on why you see it in a lot of recovery products a if you ever one i wat the has that in there i do not need to reanalysis an you are thinking it is for proline synthesis its really not it is because of this it is a beneficial to this proliferation process have been taking glooming for years am i tend to take it in hire dosage is several timesthroughout the day if i member feeling particularly run down i know their decent data not great but decent on the roll of gludomi for leaky got totally fore off saying leaky got that is getting a little bit into the realm of a not superwell substantiated but i in in the pure reviewed literature but some a a lot of anecdota and am and certainly some pure reviewed work bunt a ton and then there is also am growing interest in the idea that gludomin because it can trigger activation of the anurans in the got that signal to the dooming pathway in the brain that it can be used to offset sugar cravings this is you have an interesting new an emerging theme which you make sense given the biology of the neurons in the got that respond to a specific aminuacis including cludomine essential fatiacids and sugar and because they respond to any an all three of those am any one or commination of those i should say a to trigger this opening response some people have taken to i a teaspoon or of ludo of goldmine in some water or other drink couple times throughout the day as a was reduce the sugar cravings because what is the sensibly doing is it is tricking the pathway in tat into activation of those means through an alter it a began receptor interaction right also another interesting point there very ism than think my bounced on my head i cannot think of a time and have used clue to mean a lot i cannot think of a time where have ever heard nobody come back with any side of fact reports i think if you take enough of it you can get some gastric distress but of course you take enough of it prouder substance a it mixing water you gin to get a a last distress response and what have notice about gastric distress with things a creatine glutamine and even preaching powders for that matter i use a his quality a way preaching powder a routinely a is that if you build up to it over the course of a few days then you can get away with using much higher dosages without any issue see a bit alleneane is the same thing by the way we sort of talked about that earlier if if a you have ever tried that your all my gash i feel i yous rolled around o grass and my skin is itching and were that a once under the skin sensation ye well that is tho u you gean to take a bit a bit of a lower dosage and be fine but for the most part and then you will build up a tolerance to that pretty quickly you can up that dosage along the way what we will often times do their start at a dosage that is pretty minimal two grams and then every week or you can go up another gram until you get to whatever final point you want to be five six grams day yo whatever ism that's another we consort mitigate that problem the e third step in this recovery process after inflammation proliferation were now into remodelling and this is when you are actually you do not coconut growing back bigger and stronger am this is where the majority of the reparisactually taking place and at this point where basely playing a mike for new than and mackerel train game it by that i mean were talked about basic mack or neutrino a one thing to pay attention to often times if people are hurt whether they had an injury or they have had a just their superior and they are concerned about eating excess calories they ten to one who eat less food during this process as are ism not working out much i ma not eat less calories one of things that you have to pay attention to is injury can increase space o metabolic rate by up to ten per cent what you want to do in general is just take your calories up about ten per cent a least that is what i recommend a if that is an extended period of time than yes you may put on a slight amount o body fat or something but if that also means you come back some percentage faster then it is worth the exchange we recommend that in terms of your carbohydrate or fat split ism not superworried about it my general recommendation is just do not make any major changes relative to what you were doing i keep yourself a pretty much in the same spot in terms of proline this is the big one you want to make sure you were absolutely at one gram propound body weight because we need those a mean assist to come in in sort helping a with recovery one gram a approach propounder body a on more or one gran or more ye the ends can be very little downside to to having more ism but remember proline and carbohydrates both stimulate insolent and remember insolent is anabolic and we are trying to drive this process of recovery i that is why you want also you would not want to skimp on care hydrates in this face nor would you wan a skimp proline because you need the activation the drive into the tissue as well as this structure going back to one of earlier conversations and at this point in the week i honesty cannot remember at all what episode we cover this in but i gave an analogy about ism use it making a camp fire and using fat and carbohydrates is the would in the log and the proline worthy the the metal structure you need that supply if your trying to bank if you have cleared out in the previous up ism damage prolines and you need to make new ones to recover that process you have to have the a supply in material yo would not want avoid either one o those things i there is actually some indirect inflammation management that comes from phadiasis but you actually sort of a audio earlier ism i do not think you need necessarily go crazy do not need to change your fat and take that much just do not drop it i i depending owner your hat if you are a little bit of a higher care for fat person great if you are moderate great if you are the indirect if you are higher fat for car person possum just do not make an extreme change and do not and try to not beyond the extremes of either one of those ratios but i the only specific number to pay attention again is that proline numbered if you go littlabut high or even a lot high it is totally fine just do not go low that is the the macronutri portion of remodelling m trims of micronutrient to be honest you just get your basis covered this is one a basic mufti vitamin i it is e fact of what you are really trying to look at here are vitamin ones sink they actually have independent mechanisms are a helpful here ism but those are typically covered in most multivitamin we generally misgive people a mufti sidemen i magnesium is actually has some some benefits here something six telegrams or kilogram of body wait is the dose age you are looking for there ism magnesium nitrate is probably has the most evidence i entries of this respect but it does not mean iactulo no reason to think you could not use glicenade or if you using other form for sleep a that probably fine i do not know that for sure but i i cannot think of a reason why the other forms of magnesium would all the sudden not work you could probably choose whichever form you i object citrate has probably the most research in this aspect the only other things you would probably consider here a three things ism calcium might be on your list particularly if you are trying to if you are concern is some sort of bone injury and we sort of gone pass recovering each like into injury ism seeyou see that in re cover products occasionally and that is why and in the last two ones of course our item indeed and that is pretty well researched then the last one is actually something that can help you if you are at the stage and you still are dealing with the lot of soreness or not and that is tart cherry use notes actually effective for on both does muscle injury musclesornes and actually has another benefit of potentially aiding with sleep not a bad one to turn to as well there is a number of companies that make these things of an the there's coaly more in going research that i know unto serious but i promising literature will say not often but every once in a while on this podcast i will solicit social media for questions from the audience where i should say the audience to be and then ask some of those questions on the fly during the podcast i do this with doctor is freedmen ism going to do with you your goal is to answer each of these questions certainly not all of them you the at aboutwithin the last couple of ours to answer each of these questions in three or four sentences i certainly will not be counting the number of sentences that you speak just know that if you want to go over a little bit that is fine but feel free to refer to your instrgamsite at a future time where you might go more in depth or to refer to a study or if you you can also say pass if you do not think t you can answer the question a distinctly enough for this form at and here the goal is not to put you on the spot i the goal is simply to allow the audience to ask some questions directly and i i confess ism looking at these for the first time i it'll try and be quick with my with my reading some of these we may have touched on in previous episodes or in this episode even in which case you can can of cue us to the reminder this is not directly related to supplementation but it is related to nutrition and i do not think we touched on this directly can we do intermittent fasting a him restrict feeding with quite and still gain musclemen teddy i am am quite clear such study does not exist i do not know i think of alluded to to a before that we did run in intermittent fasting sixteen eight i perched study there is no quite arm the result of that study bathe time that comes out will probably be ready though i not sure i cannot comment on i have like the day but regarding when lav you did that with meet or not i cannot comment scientifically do you ever prescribe the use of gala supplements well i cannot prescribe anything to to make sure were clear but your professor you can profess i candy frog as we generally do not spend too much time i gala it rarely is it cade to wait trained fasted than not break the fast and eat for three or four hours after training another words train fasted i do this but then also not eat immediately following training and wait another three to four hours after training once we have our results from miner men fasting study back well we will have a t our answer here my general recommendation as it stands now though is is long as your total approaching and take is sufficient a you should be in a decent spot great a lot of questions about fasting and training just to ye i one that am can you train high performance fasted and how long before a you need to refuel the body yet you can certainly do that i know of actually manyapletes some how they it will do that though the vast majority will not as it gets higher and higher an intensity and operation it gets more challenging but it really does come down do what you did the day before as well if you aid sufficient calories ta day before i did not train and your lycatinstorers are stopoff you have a fighting chance now the duration part of that occasion is really dependent dependent upon you am are you really talking thirty forty five men at sixty minutes your probably fine whether you're out past that in several hours you may not be and then the only of the common i would make is there is keep in mind whenever you think about fasting and any other say against the textbook in a cotton cotstrat style you really really need to be careful in thinking the difference between can i do it and is it optimal i have absolutely no reason to think fasting that would improve performance i only work for the most part with people who are trying to perform at the higheslitle possible i cannot think of cento which i would go too fasting to try and has performance whether not you can maintain some level performance probably i will it providing benefit i struggle to find sonar's in which that would actually make you perform better how do different forms of carbohydrates in pact performance and the right below it another question about carbohydrates which is was carbohydrate cycling work these are to a questions from people that i think do not know one another but out of care questions about carbohydrates in performance which we have touched on anything else that you want to add to that conversation i do not think i really may be you might want to think about care loading a slash care cycling carbohydrate loading does help however a miss conception there is its just b o a big bull post the night before that can help top off storage but really optimal carbohydrate loading prior to a long duration endurance performance is probably best over the course of three or four days see an a gradually increase carbohydrate and take for multiple days rather than to have one big bollaposta branch chain emend acids and essential mind acid supplementation ye may or as i would say me ma usually if your total approaching and take is fine then you do not really have a need for them a if you are for whatever any number of valid reasons total protein is not then going to an essential monoacid would be my first step rather than a b s e ism now admittedly we actually do use i essentially munoassis somewhat regularly because it is is also sort a there is no real harm other than if you are price conscious your sort i wasting money that is fine the people i work with general again that is not a few dollars for the maxima recoveries is not that very we will sometimes use that a preminterpose training and in some circumstances a total proline would be my is a high quality way something that i if you cannot use way for whatever reason there are plenty of high quality vegan a proteins you could use if you ought to top all that off though an add som simcomemy tosses it would not hurt anything and may potentially help slightly you choose i base on that logarithm ah i was hoping somebody would ask this touch on in a little bit it is a we bit of a loaded question the way they phrased it ism at risk of leading the witness does the mythical anabolic window really exist ism just laughing is the way they pop the question theatre already telling us where their stands is making it more effective as to create hypertrophy a to eat within a certain time from after working out ism going to resume that this person genuinely wants to know whether not the anabolic window really exist were not because they refer to it is mythical assume that their suspicious but what is the deal as the anabolic window a real thing the post exercise anabolic window is extremely real what this is a you can see more detail in a number of videos on my you to page i believe it is the idea that you need to must i consume some sort of neutrons specifically usually proline ain some time domain thirty or sixty minutes a post exercise an or two maximasgrope is that window real yes are you hyprisensitized to neutrons in that time frame yes is it very important that you rehydrate a replenish music again and rebuild tissue a quickly after exercise to maxim as recovery absolutely it is not real though in the sense that you that you have to have it within thirty minutes ism in the case of proving as we talked about a second go you are total prating and take throughout the day is more important a timing though four things carbohydrate especially if your training multiple times a day it is very really it is a very real thing it just you may or may not actually care about it it may not be important for your context garlic seems an appropriate question what if any functional rolls does garlic have in performance garlic acts you really cool there is a number of things you can dive into theater outside of my three to nonsense is considering a mat to an a half probe already i you are not in a fine strong human data on garlic extract however there is a little bit a suggest it can actually in hands recovery from injury or potentially tissue damage you got a kind of be careful though because in order to understand was happening you have to differentiate between a name an adapt of recovery pro cases and when we say things immunity realized fence that is not one thing that is us a very local term for a number of things again it is o verb li o the now writ the immune system but it immunity is a bunch of processes a processes o if you are about to correct my speech all correct years right back am not yours and yet lesser press is but tomato tomato it is avert immunity is a verb this is my problem with immune boosters same issue rigtlik will what are you boosting specifically because in fact if you are boosting the wrong part of unity during the wrong phase of recovery with garlic you may be actually hurting i thin the process because you are theoretic they could be trying to down regulate that portions that you can up regulate a next portion that is the faster way to say it if you will a we act you may see more my to come out that says the garlic extracts overrated i do not actually do not yet a but just do not have enough human at to hon it but yet t there is somesulf there if you want to look cartenough man asked this question for myself cause ism curious to know the answer selfish tart cherry extract for a pretty effective actually a for too things i eventually hate eating in sleep getting u sleep as well as a muscle soreness that is the bulk of the research is in muscle soreness and a seems to be a moderate sector think for people that might be interested in hostages of things tartcherry extract garlic et camera u obviously doctor and gallons integral and twit er great places to ask questions that and to fine questianswers to questions that as well as examine not calm as a terrific web sight am they actually recently overhauled their entire web sight they have this human effect man tricks that shows the am the effects an the the strength of different effects in human studies of many many different compounds am i related everything to formal health and men and women sports performance cognac performance it does not cover everything but it certainly covers a lot with links to studies there is a lot that is available at completely zero cost by joining examine dot calm a you can access some additional features and this is by the way not a paid endorsement from examined to common simply long time user of examined to calm myself am and i just want a cut people to it and again a many of the resources there are available completely free of costs it is a wonderful sight for hostages of garlic tartcherry extract and things of that sort whether not you abetting from food o you are getting it from extract a powders rather am all of that information is is pretty nicely laid out there unless you have something to add to that i was just can act people to that resource nob an using that since the first day that depside was locked i i was made aware that it was coming i been fortunes ton ow those guises for a while have you've used it i used it in all my classes i use it do not e no probably weekly at this point another need nice feature that is actually on there is they have a a series of the do some topical review the space spaceitle i a big paper out on muscle damage or blood pressure the station to sathordhandsmen or am formant a you menstrual cycle and and yet piccolo ask i i they do on and all kinds of of seen search by topic i no energy o recovery or whatever r even search by a black human see extractor whatever number of things you want to do and it'll also tell you there is an your actions pate to such really really nice be carefully partaking a hand be or whatever yet it is wonderful wonderful they have done a marvelous job thank you examined i come keep keep up the amazing work well we have come close to the end of this episode and that means that we are close to the end of this series where you have graciously joined us for six full episodes of the hubrmen ladpodcast to educate us on all things fitness episode one you reviewed and educated us on assessing our level of fitness in fact i learned many ways of assessing fitnessthat i had not thought about and also assessing my recovery capacity for instance one thing that ism defiling going to implement from that episode is a routine broad jump test and and in home i jump jumping touch test if people do not know what ism referring to that is all contained in that episode its time stamped these are very straight forward zero cost ways to assess one's level of fitness ism there a few others that require a bare liniment of technology taking your pulse made in very specific ways o specific times also is som timing of mile runs and some other things relaid to strength and hypertrophy and on and on really it is a it is a buffet of options that we can select from and i already know the four or five that i started implementing this week have recognized how ism pretty good in a couple of areas ism doing may be may be better than pretty well in one area but that ism doing a imthisy world in a few areas that am i just was not aware of and have a already started i taking always to a just that a retire an o it'll keep people posted that first episode is absolutely incredible and just provides much actionable knowledge and the ration of behind it the second episode you educated us about strength speed and hypertrophy training and there too an immense amount of incredible knowledge we got way down into the details you explain sets rets the ration awl for sets rets rest cadence number of workouts per week ism dealing in to take away my need to do some speed base training and some power base training normal i thinking terms of strength or hypertrophy and ism relief f to learn that a lot of the speed and power base training it is low intensity enough that it can be done fairly often and incorporated into my program which is already touches on strength and hypertrophy and indeed some endurance work as well a amazing tipsy provided there ism certainly going to implement the three to five program the yo describe i three to five exercise is done for three to five repetitions three to five minutes between sets ah you are doing this three of five times per week and on in sol with all the details again timestamped in the strength and hypertrophy a episode shootout such as incredible waving use that to set up pierce with you that is right i did par this week thanks thanks to your in put and following that program and ism really grateful for that it it does feel good to break through a barrier and i intend to break through more barriers but not just with strength and hypertrophy because episode three you taught us all about in durance the four different forms of endurance how to train for each of those different forms the value of doing even very brief twenty second springs are bouts of jumping jacks throughout the day which to some people might you son a a l hack or give me but no these are actually tapping into fuel systems and modes of curl muscular interactions that greatly aid other forms of endurance long duration en durance i would love to return to my mum high school mile time i will not reveal what that is cause sis is not really about me but i plan tost are doing if not mile repeats then doing some mile mil runs and testing there once a week you laid out a beautiful programmed for how to do that and then in the next episode you would us again with a description of the science and the tools and this wrist down to the details but all laid out very cleanly and clearly as to how to design an optima fitness program what are the things that really represent an optima program what questions does one have to answer before designing a program what are some of the barriers in the way this concept of defenders as things that prevent you from reaching your goals and one of the key things i have it right here in front of me i that i took away from that episodes was this quadrant i approach of really thinking about and figuring out how much one intends to devote to work career calling let us make that one been i relationships another been fitness in the other been and recovery in the other ben and ism here will tip our hater are good friend penny cane for i mentioning that over all am scheme for doing things been immensely useful and have actually tarted it out and thought about and drawn out which different things fall in teach of these categories you my think it is obvious at relationships but that includes a lot of different things and there is cross over between these bens terms of how you can combine enhancing relationships with fitness work recovery and on that episode is just again a treasure trove of knowledge and then in the next episode you you educate us on recovery in all its forms n the very short term in within the work out immediately after the work out and from work out to work out waste to really accelerate recovery access recovery and as you pointed out for people me who always assume that we do not recover very well in that some sort of character trait a nervous system thing or genetic to really think about how my training is impacting my level of recovery and in doing ways reveal to me that i have far more capacity than i thought i had and already this week have managed to train more often doing more work and i feel better than ever and that is also despite the fact that we have spent a affair mount of time in these chairs across from one another the kind we i say ah it is it is been it is been a pleasure and then in to day's episode you explain nutrition and supplementation as it relates to performance and of course tat touches into recovery but also potable mental states for training how to approach one's training and how to extract the most from training through quality nutrition to what to eat and when which carbohydrates routine amounts windows of opportunity am windows you absolute do not want to miss and then some that are a bit more flexible and then we went deep into the weeds of magnesium garlic tartar extract alpha p c we touch on nerd transmit a related systems hormone related systems we went deep into a discussion about sleep because of course sleep is the foundation for recovery in performance of all kinds emotional mental and physical recovery in performance and in taking us through this enormous arc of a journey through fitness thing it is fair to say that you have given us your knowledge contained in your head i was telling some one i just the other day that one of the things that i always lamented science is that i would encounter these incredible professors and scientists and in other domains of life too and you just wish there was some way to download their brain because they would much knowledge inside them and um ism looking for a youesbe or cusp c a port on you and i do not see one yet but what you have effectually done for us across these six episodes is to down load the actionable knowledge and it is wonderful the informant you have provided is clear it is super interesting it is highly highly actionable and in many cases it is counter intuitive and surprising but once one understands the logic behind it as you have provided for us also and it all make sense in a way that is extremely satisfying and extremely motivating it is certainly motivating me to change the way that i train in a number of ways and i promise that it'll report back to our audience and to you as to what my results are but really as we both agree this is not about me this is not about you this is really about the people listening and for those of you listening i i hope you can appreciate what an incredible gift it is to have somebody of doctor any galloping experience and drive and a scholarly background who also works with athletes in every day people just to splay out all this knowledge for us systematically over six episodes doctor and japan thank you ever much i appreciate that far too kind of a words to me there if you ben following long tho this entire journey as you called it i first principles thinking and i lists me i get you with one more lists and i got five things on this final list get your pen and pad out please i number one i want to really emphasize science itself is a verb which means it is on going in changing i i did my best over the course these many many many hours to provide my interpretation of the scions to provide my practical knowledge an things that i use but that is fallible science changes there are many many things in my career that i was very sure they are that the evidence was clear on and then it changed as you move forward do not think of any the recommendations i gave you whether they were about supplement dosages in timing rap range is or breathing tactics anything between just use them as guidelines number one science is avert number two i really want to think the audience this has been an extremely long haul as some of you somehow ism sure which ism not sure how but some you probably made thou this entire journey and listen to all six episodes and you should probably get some sort of free humoral labshirt or something are a place or i do not know it a gain place ah ago place how about a in it at high five and even if you job drop in for fear the episodes you i i appreciate you takin to time is a lot of things you could be doing with your time and a to make to spend those resources on my words is a touching number three i want to act you thank you of course drew and the whole team the crew up here for three things number one am i think it is incredibly important that you have gone out of your way to give other people credit for their work you go out away and your large platforms a socialmetas attar people to give science credit for their work and most people do not do that and that is something you do not have to do and i think that is a culture i do not know n why you do you come from science that is just what you do you get people credit for their work but you go out of your way to do that and i want thank you for that the next one is many people who have outlets in platforms will try to fill those with people who are going to grow their platforms does not mean these people wrong are bad but i think what is extremely special about what you have created here is again you have gone out of your way to bring on the direct source of information i cannot even imagine how many of your podcast guess have never been on upon cast before or it been on a very short mum be of them and you have made are an extremely large platform doing nothing but talking about super deep dork science directly from the sciences themselves and to create community that it is i ism happy the sciences is made here and you have shown the world i people are stupid people want detail and people want science and you have given us them i in last one of course see i get through this is a n thank you for you have done for me in my career i understand there could have been any number of people in this chair to put me on your giplotfrorm once was i hretapegracious happen to do it for six hundred here whore if we did in the series's i i i cannot think enough or that opportunity i hope i lived up to it and i had a tremendous time and then thank you for being such a gracious house you more than exceeded a expectations you are absolute we person to be in this chair talking about these topics with me and for the world and once again i just wont to say thank you as a colleague as a public educator as an exercise scientist and as a friend

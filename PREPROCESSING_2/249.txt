of all the things on the movies that could happen to you and there is many it i think getting shrunk down to a miniature size i think that is one that nobody would ever choose it seems dangerous it seems frightening how marvel comics of her thought that shrinking could be a superpower that is really totally beyond me turning herself into a person the size of her pencil racer it does not make anything easier everything is harder and wit the aunt man the first time aunt man shrinks is instantly immortal danger water in a bath top in a drown you dancing in apartment almost crushing with he high helped shoes a rat tries to eat an its a ridiculous super power the rivers like should have to chest and give aunt man a whole second power mind control over armies of and we never get anything accomplished but these stories of tiny people honey has shrunk the kids the borrowers when was young i love the film fantastic voyage i do get the appeal of them they give this feeling of what if what if i was small that i could stand between the wafers of an trial cooky that i could climb on to an insect i show win she was unforthgrat coly thought about this lot she is given superb in new jersey that shes in fifth grate so find this little barrissing but last year every night when she go to bed she prepare for the possibility that magic my strike while she was asleep n the she would shrink down to the size of her doll house is preparations included i would feet on me age of my pillow you the very top of my head is on the pillow and and the rest of my bodies on my back that way she shrunk in the middle of the night she would be on the bed and not on the pillow which seemed warmer treacherous to her steals took a slap bracelet which you know can stretch out a role and position the roger very carefully a little bridge from that like of my bed to the edge of my bedside table and why to walk from my bad to my bed why had the little can the little hammock which she made for herself to sleep on which basely a bracelet of intertwined t rubber bands suspended an air on a frame of cute tips i then i also how a little on couch and the catches on the be i table you walk case thriller you turn at you see the couch and to go of beyond that you'll see the hammock anger the hammock was calculator that she could step on little footstool to get up on to the hammock and next to the couch was a posted folded and half with a note to her parents itsplaining that she had shrunk all ready to be unfolded when this really happened to her fore and finally every night when she went to bed i to some of the remain printed rinse but the in a blanket a en held on to the make it every night hoping that i would turn small with what would be wrapped up in the blanket my stuff animal bill my out stuff animal why my boy and a couple of the stuff animals and will you hoping that this would happen were you fearing that this would happen that you ut get small i was i was both o that up being the yo hearing coy was being recorded on a telephone who batteries started dying at this point in the inter view making the peeping noise tell me the hope tell me the fear the hope be cause then i would but to live my doll house would shit had a little swing on the porch it it is to and i would have to watch no flicks with my fitter and every top sort would be on mel that is the hope

to swim any more yellow my pant mi my lot o part flight get up a little ball they con say she could just take a tray of water just put it out for you yet do not you said to thing by the world this way small stuff can become really trains fixating the sheer tininess of tiny things can have a kind of mesmerizing power to it we are tag g about this at her office last week and him took the most extreme stand on this i dragged he into the studio to talk about this i just generally small things if there is a small version of a thing i am interested in seeing it or reading about it will hearing about it it is been why told me about the radically tiny tubs of gasoline you can buy with have the exact design of the bigger jars it is about the size of my thumb nail made him my thumbnail in a hold they very small and very cute they do not look they real they look ornaments that you might hang from a christian tree and whet you about them is what i about them is just how small they they seem almost pointless you can find anilin in any number of other sizes the fact that this exists i think feel it feels somebody just yet it was just a pointless gesture let us make gasoline even smaller li can y imagine them looking across one another can young hay should we make this smaller in solo they the need on they we precisely and i think i think small things by nature are whimsical they just feel oh you do not have to be you do not have to exist but here you are and that is what makes them kind of joyful the just things for the pleasure of smallness it staring at smallness it is when you look at abrokaly an you think all ism a gonna this is a small tree it is that feeling ism ally forty you still have that for you look at a trackway yo think it is a small tree i do not still have that feeling i used e the feeling when i was a child i will noting o no one ha to you yo may n i program small things considered if there is of people overlooking what is great about the tiny the miniscule the pe we the byte size and the tansy wine also s very dramatic examples of the power of smallness going for instance the power to end health in durance as we know it from plans of people they my be easy chico its this america life i mare a glass my voice affected by some sort of tiny tiny bug this week stay with us a n coming up sort it'll go we got an anal from a physician who was starting to see a then that disturbed her among her patients she went in a skin to it that i contributors shot brown would be the best person for the job for reasons hat to become queer as he proceeds here shot this doctor told us that all these parentshave been coming to her scabs of them she used the word inundated with the same problem their kids were short not dramatically short they were just below average here for their age we are talking nine ten eleven year old kids and what these parents wanted was for this doctor to prescribe them human growth hormone injections to make their kids taller these are daily injections that cost tens of thousands of dollars a year it is usually affluent privilege families this doctor says who already have all the advantages she when as farms to call the desire for growth hormone among these folks an epidemic because have had parents come to me and say every one i know is s on growth hormone that was an actual quit every one i know is on the stuff or it is all the rage in this anonymous community very affluent community this doctor wanted to be completely anonymous by the way she feels she is whistle blood in fact this is not her real voice we sopor voice for an actors in our recording of the interview since i cannot identify her it'll refer to her from hereon as short throat all we can say is she is a pediatric into chronologist that is a children doctor specializing in stuff the bees proud problems and growth she says she got into medicine to treat sit kids but fully half of her patients are coming to her just for the growth part parents will you not find out one kit is being treated and is seen that their child because their below average need needs o to oh if there doing it then am i can be missing out in fact i think the phrase one moused with something ism just trying to be proactive and worried i do not miss my window of opportunity that window is real parents have to stator kids on the drug by the time their hitting purity short throat has been practicing for bout seven years but she works closely with other doctors who have been at it for decades and they do say that it is gotten much much worse they do not remember anything this i mean one of my senior colleagues it is almost she is surprised every time i cannot believe this kid came in here look at this growth chart and i walk in the office tat it is a kit growing at the forty have percentile with parents who are the forty of percentile fortieth per gentile meaning forty per cent of the rest of the country is shorter than they are just below average and she is cannot can't believe there here for growth and am yes i can believe that because were see this is everyday you call me in and are fabrigasit by the same thing i had a conversation where i had a patient comes to me her son was five fat seven mam was i for dad was five they wanted treatment if you say something in them will his predicted height is five nine you might get a response that something well that is an acceptable you are laughing but that is my job i ism laughing for somebody different r sins do you get it now oh i get it have got in in my whole life this is probably the point in the story where i should level with you if i could gorge ism just under five three which puts me right around the first per gentile of america mails by height shorter than ninety nine per sent of the men in this country for years i thought i was five for second per gentile but a recent doctor visit confirmed that made been rounding up have always been the smallest going the room consistently smaller than other kids for as long as i can remember there some downsides sure but i think have a pretty good life my success is in failures i do not lay them at the tiny feet of my shortness my height is just one thing about me not teething not the defining thing but recently i wrote a young adult novel about a sixteen year old boy whose four foot eleven and struggling with his identity and i found myself thinking every day about being short what it meant to me what it might a went what i might a miss and then i hear from this doctor about all of these parents who think having a sun my size is unacceptable and come to her to fix it to fix them short throat tells the families who just one of wen hands their kids height that she will not do that but that does notalways stop them there are some private practice pediatric under chronologists in our area who i mean the prase have used is i feel like they would they've growth hormone to a rock if you got some too sitting people down and giving them the worst case in areal high prediction and then being this is what you need and then treating them oh their consult is part of saying as i you don't have the shore t get ere you on ye you do not want a habit oh absolutely that is what the ere i mean i know the prescribing practices of all other feds annoys in our air because people bounds around and thee doctor shop and they want their opinions among the things that bother her the most a lot of the parents seem oblivious to the possibility of side effects but really the biggest be in short throws growth hormone bonnet is the marines aspect the full treatment over four or five years can cost three hundred thousand dollars or more and even though most of these families a rich they find ways to get it covered by insurance when some of her diabetic patients cannot even get the latest insolent pop covered she also says she seen rich families take advantage of patient assistance programs the drug companies offered o needier faults i have seen affluent patience get on these quota quit patient assistance programmed when okay this the terrible but sometimes i will villa their house and all relic you live in six million dollar home and your getting patient assistance for your kids growth hormone grow grub justgruss it is important to say short throat does treat some kids with growth hormone kids who are not producing enough of it or any of it on their own that is a serious health problem but she will also treat them if a kid is just going to be really really short waylay below average way down in those basement percentiles where i am using growth harmonies cockering cases this according to the f t e that is because there is a diagnosis for people me and learned about it while researching my book it is called idiopathic short stature i assess sound carry but all it means is ism short and know one knows one and because i fit that diagnosis i could have been one a short throws patient yes even our whistle blower who believes this stuff is over used would have treated me if it'd come to her if my parents had wanted and is one of those other wise healthy kids who just short and who kind since the use of the word otherwise i had all of this looks not a whole lot medicine it looks cosmetic a bootjob for kids short kids but before i went off on a napoleon rage bender over the claims to this one role grow doctor i thought it'd run those claims by doctor avid b allay another pediatric after chronologist and area by the leading expert on this topic he sat on the panel that wrote the recent guide lines for growthormon treatments for kids spend writing papers about it for three decades specifically about idiopathic short stature you actually i may not to get personal but a ousomewla you doit t the o diagnosis you ma did you just donors may over the re it is amazing i may love got lot of his furious the said he did not think unnecessary growth hormone treatments for kids was an epidemic per say the reluctant of insurgents companies to cover such an expensive and if he treatment keeps widespread is tamp down but sure there are lots of families in more image conscious wealthy places who put their kids on it when he writes about using growth hormone for height not health the phrase he uses cosmetic and o chronology and he told me this story back in the day growth hormone was used almost exclusively on kids who were growth hormone deficient the way you give insolent to a dibasic and the only force for the stuff back then was the pe guitar glance of cadavers dad people the supply was limited unfortunately because it came from cadavers some of it was tainted with the brain to see similar to mad down twas a free thing this was in the ties dozens of young people got see some of them died but that same year synthetic growth hormone became available now there was lots of the stuff lap made safe from contamination doctor allay told me in my producer shown colds that the drug industry and doctors started looking around for r other uses say making idiomatically short kids less itiapathically short you knar ready yo past a hurt stature really became a thing once there was grow hormone a treatment available it might work an meter was a descriptive term you courses been a descriptive term for longing time but as he diagnosis an i think it was more really after there was a treatment available it is one of these situations where it is almost a treatment that is in search of a diagnosis ye so a solution in search of a problem sort of ye struck e jangling and also why are we treating shortness its a disease because when you look into it as researchers have there is no evidence time being short to having a bad life studies show short kids get teased bullied there often treated as younger than they are but there is no direct connection between being small and failing at life i for instance did not and to depression alone living any tiny cardboard box behind bob's bigot at least not because of my height another thing doctor allay said is that the use of synthetic growth hormone in kids is generally agreed to be safe but he said it just has not been on the market long enough for us to know yet there could be an increased risk of cancer down the road one study and only one points to more instances of stroke among a adults who took the drug's children thing is we will not really know how dangerous the stuff is until thirty r forty or fifty years down the line also on average kids who take growth hormone might gain three inches a little less than half an inch per year but that is average your heihdach may very a lot could be more could be less it'll just note that less than a little less than half an inch a year would be a very sad title for a countrysong the darkest irony here is doctor allay says the kids you think need the drug the most kids are short parents are the ones who benefit the least and it is conceivable that there is some risks that were do not yet know about or just learning about i o twenty years down the road that this completely healthy ten year old as now been exposed to for a benefit that we have a lot of difficulty documents a me tat to me that is the connundroom right not a cannundroom for me the health effects are unknown benefits in certain and even if he get taller you are not necessarily happier then ism not putting my kid on it not for a maximum three inches total not for a half inch a year who would choose that for their kid i decided to find out you to call i growth hormone gait som meou to calling snappy we should definitely do that it is fining i cannot tell yo any of these folks names either there in southern californium it'll call the dad jerry he is a doctor he is five foot eight the mom who it'll call aura is five foot for she is a personal development coach are there are two kids delay and barney also not their real names dean's been taking growth hormone injections for five years and asked aura why they wanted to be anonymous unit is a little embarrassing must have his lobby peers out know as clos friends now but enough far girls kid if she shore i power a for guy kind of say something about your masculine any or i just one in ta protect hin for whatever reasons short turn long turn they all live in a big beautiful house with a pool that contains what ism fairly sure is a waterpologol delays on the team the living room is immaculate the lobby of a luxury hotel when we got there there was a dog room adman setting out front in which their dog was being groomed she look nice afterwards lar has been worrying about dollar size since he was a baby he was born pray size even though she carried him full tern he spent four or five days in the bijou and as he got older it just seemed he was having a hard time catching up to his friends and the hight department he was the smallest in his teamfotos its glass fools always an outlier when she found out there was something that might help fix that just felt the right call to me it was a it was just a medical twice that it was never esthetic it just was more medical and i do not know f at it is interesting we have slightly different views and perceptions again this is verify he is a doctor you would expect him to come at this from a medical necessity point of view too and he does but he is totally upfront about his less doctor reasons i just straight a bit on ma guile i want him to be big and strong and if he can be bigger and stronger but to get to that the the risk factory had to be eliminated and would did what was the point where you were while now we can start thinking about bigger and stronger because i am satisfied that whatever long term studies they i i i i it was there was a risk i had to con o take at least it was it my life it was not worry buskin id no just now you plenty a e servos i no i ad it was the risk you now its s not easy making that decision i ash ism putting my son at sister diabetes my brothers dies i see it just a point out the risk of diabetes from pediatric growth for among use is more theoretical than anything else doctor's monitor for it but far there is no causally there's a love in the back of my on o boy would not i just due to my son something might have happened that would have been reversible and i would have just never forgiven myself haw it happened is no question was the back of my brain ism a doctor i get it i do not think it but an i i was have worried about in the back of my brain it is do not verbalize it but not on wood fortunate es in fine and ales seem his a benefits better than find jerry says the drug seems to be working and he satisfied if i searched my hard of harts it'd be least for myself it'd be dishonest if i said i did not have superficial motivations exactly as you describe may be not said in those words future leader a more tractor to a made but i mean to unless your giant who does not want be taller it dos a feel weird to be kind of feeding into that feeding in to this a there societal y the society all sort of clamoring wrong it now were then your turn to look nice to day won't you dress nicely you're giving in to society looks at gets som my shoes on you get a college sure and you picture glass did you pic the almost ugly glass as you could pick not you try to irksome nice glasses right we all we ought to some degrees it is a continuum i do not thing is any wrong with that but would you have been sad if he had been shots hit that stopped the conversation i offered to stand out for him ye he t the t o do not do that i i n the word sad i mean we would have always wonder may be like could he have what would have happened but it mean he does raise this question of in a fully paid a place society to you and up with different tears of people some of whom have selected characteristics that the con fer advantages wore seem to covered vanda mean i get it this this smacks of the whole essay t gat thing i this is all this whole let me gain the system let me i want my child to get a sixteen hundred as he the i want my t hold to go to hazard it is acts of that and i get it but the same time i do not think it is all that sinister for us we just did not want i to be sitting below the steering we on and be made for of or something that is con of which is where army and lava's opinions about the whole thing long up malodor ear used to blanch when people would ask of dollar and his little sister were twins she is two years younger and aura hated that her son wore clothes made for boys two years younger but all that is in the past now i this is fella the twists man fifteen years old i he came home from school in the middle of the interview still wearing his school uniform white pole shorts he is five foot six now i producer show sensitive sold that he is had to stand back to back in lethe the back of s got said is going it and to your a neck i would not one o i wouldn't one to sis an an anal well i me thought we were though were pausebody ut here is the thing measuring yourself directly bodily against another human being it is not a natural situation trees as a forty three year old man standing back to back a fifteen year old i felt this almost primal humiliation and just for a second i thought did i miss out on something i felt a little jealous now w o lard spread out the charts on the coffee table inches fir is years cellar's whole history of growing up band up band up from elementary school on and a laggardly parable that takes off a rocket round the time he started the growth him each dot is a measurement how ism in the first tight per cent out for men in america dollar started off parked between the third and fifth per senile and ended up nearly in the fiftieth almost average it made him feel proud cause i saw each stack climbing and it was going up who only going up and at to me was scam getting taller but i am going to be a little side that i cannot be as tall as i wanted to be it'd to be on five ten or five eleven for sure that we am a little bit above savage have never thought about it that way what height do i want to be how average what i to be this demand side attitude about height was alien to be and standing there between this giant five foot six child masted on shoulder blades i though about what had brought me here underneath my indignation my short identitarianism here is the thing have gloss over a bit the downsides of being short i took some hard punches to the stomach and elementary school i often feel taken less seriously by taller people and professional situations i prefer phone meetings for that very reason i pretty much know thati've had friendships with women that might have been more than friendships if it'd ben a few inches higher off the dance floor have watched the li mid drain for my daisies as we stand on on the restaurant table after desire have been judging these people these parents trying to check every box by every advantage but there was a moment a long time when my parents thought about putting me on growth hora and i was littlelittleer and they did not i have this really strong memory of their telling me they would looked into it we were in a car this would have been the minds in virgin i remember an apple worker on our left the background on our right and my man telling me they considered it and decided against it i remember thinking why are you telling me this it is the moment i became short the first time i really new it was o facial doctors had been consulted powerful elixerious considered maybe none of that should a come as a surprise ism the outlier amongst my siblings my other robot is six foot one even my little sister dollar is taller than i am they take after my dad who at five eleven is a full foot taller than my mom you all these years we have never talked about that decision why did not they want me to get taller why did not they make the choice still man's parents did i went home and i asked my mama about that conversation in the car i hade know memory of this at all how did that conversation come to i mean ism driving you home from school and i go by the way how moms have a way of making the pivotal chapters in your personal history seem less pivotal and more totally apocryphal ye it was that thing my mom very convincingly debunk to my big origin story of how i became short the time line was wrong the location was wrong the only true part was once upon a time i found out i was short and ism clearly more hung up on it than i thought i was but mam confirmed they did decide not to treat me and we must have talked about it back then i wanted to know why they did not treat me and the answer was pretty simple when i was about ten my pediatrician sent me to an enter chronologists to check my growthormon levels because i was small and doctors to check every box i got tested i was normal e terms of form on levels anyway and that is it they did not pursue it further also my father was a farm suitable research or who tested experimental medications my mam was a nurse they know about the stuff and this was right after the stories came out about the tainted growthormon from cadavers it'd just listen to those stories and it was kind of a got thing it was gonna well it took em twenty five years to figure that out that we had tissue took him twenty five years in mi gong today twenty five years to find out oh here is a really bad consequence of growthormon why i want the and we could not could not for a see it and i had a healthy son who as o thriving i thought and o was sharp got and why i did not want screw it up my parents were trying to protect me by doing nothing the same way aura and ceramic were trying to protect dollar by doing something something elemental making him bigger but for my mom there is something else she does not think of what might have happened if she would made me bigger she thinks about what might havebeen lost if she had it is always been interesting to me to see genes well out what i mean when you say why you do that and my dad did that you know sake a physical thing that that somebody does or the way they they attitude they have or the way they handle their hands it is a it comes those a genes coming out that that i to see they are familiar to me they are familiar to me to i remind myself of people life known my grandfather my uncle my mom have got their bodies ism built on their blue prints reliable blue prints that delivered several generations of tiny living things from primordial slime to this crazy risky present moment that is no small thing all i know is this is the box i came in and i thing here i thing ascot brown is a red to producer on the who lis serious castle rock he said to note novel about a super short kid who grows freakishly tall in the year is called exile o i o e ta e of o e e pal the o i re the o e ala e a a e o a o e i oil t too e we o e o are the o we i o e e i i tree o on how when something shrinks and shrinks and shrinks to can undo a nine hundred page law and more about the power of tininess that is in a minute chico bublicradio went our program continues ti spare can mine from my re glass to day so small things considered stories in defense of the little and the litlopution we've arrived at at two of our so tat two let us give him nothing to talk about stay a gestabout has this story about something the cut shrunk to exactly as small as something can possibly be with huge consequences the playing to right now this very moment his avid this thing that got made small it is a tax a couple years ago the government set it to zero zero dollars zero sense which makes what follows remarkable how could a tax small it does not actually exist cause any trouble but before i explain and since this show is about the importance of small things let me just confess here how much i love zero it is unlike any other number in its capacity for destruction zero times anything is zero no matter how big it always winds and even better is dividing when i was a kiting math glass i to put one divided by zero into my calculator it would show e for error because one divided by zero there is no answer to that it is undefined divide by any other number in your fine one divided by two for instance or fifty seven are six hundred and ninety three but what is heroin and it just blows up mathematicians call this kind of situation as singularity where the math is not well behaved in fact it stops making cents there singularities inside black holes but it never heard of a real world example outside of that until remember fourteenth last year for that brought health curate the millions of america have been struck down by a us judge judge has ruled i unconstitutional may be remember this i know e judge in taxes ruled that the entire a fordable react violated the u s constitution this is big news and it immediately got appealed but the signature domestic policy achievement of the entire boom of presidency the thing that right now is giving millions of american's health insurance that whole thing the judge was saying it was unconstitutional had to go and the thing that set a this off a zero last year congress reduce to plenty tax for not having helping durance to zero the judge ruled that without then explain how zero could love an entire law when bomb care the affordable character was written almost a debate ago it included this thing that people call the mandate which basically said you have to have health insurance and if you do not you got to pay a fine in two thousand sixteen the average fine paid was a little over seven hundred dollars opponents of the health carol took issue with that part saying the government cannot just force people to buy something they made out want all this went to the supreme court which ruled it was o ka because and this is key the mandate could be viewed as a tax the government has lots a taxes this is one of them which felt the end of it and it was until this other thing happened that seemed unrelated in two thousand seventeen republicans pass their big talcum though in one of the taxes in there that they cut this was just a sentence was the mandate the find that you have to pay if you do not have in she rance they cut it to zero it really does seem most lawmakers in congress did not understand that this one little change could be the basis forgetting all nine hundred plus pages of the act ruled unconstitutional i could not find any record of lawmakers even mentioning it in the floor debate a newscoverage one person who did see that who put together how zero could under the law was some one not in washington at all e find was consetmecha salad who then was the states solicitor general i found him on face book this profile picture was from an ultimate frhisbitoriitpeople lightly declined to comment but from legal filings we know his basic argument salad's logic was that if the taxes zero then there is no tax and what your left with in the law is this line that basely says people shall buy health insurance that was o keys part of a tax you shall by health insurance or pay a penalty but now the tax was zero the take to the law was simply telling people to buy health insurance unconstitutional that is how a tax of zero and up in a federal pealscourt most of t america is kind of in the courtroom too eighteen red states on one side sixteen blue states on the other i reached out to some one involved in the case nice barley professor at the university of michigan playschool i talked to him about the part of the case that i find transfixing can it can i say that the part that that stood out to me ye i used to work in physics and its you know the call his singularity it is zero that denominator it creates a black hole ye i mean your putting your finger on one of barley to declare thinks the first judge got it totally draw he is worked on a brief filed in the appeals case and he is been writing about it he pointed out something i honestly had not consider it have have encouraged and others have encouraged congress zebra at least teahouse of representatives to pass bill that would set one dollar tax o really yet the house goo a pass the bill that made this gal this whole of suit go away to morrow an it would not be it would be it would be the a the jot of a pen a and if the house passes it and the senate does not want a pass it well hang that around the senate's neck and the next presidential election make it there a across to carry we wait way that a that would work right if they just absolutely ye absololl sands at all case goes away if they said it to a dollar tethered a munch different ways you can dor penny would a any today a penny sure but e how can it matter that it is a dollar or zero really really it cat it cant in it should not and again it your putting your finger o well i man understand that legally it might but it seems crazy also that it might yet that is one of the great things about the law the grant things ye we would not know what i meat but is that is that if it seems crazy to you it probably is and if the argument is too cup by half it probably is i talked to barley back in jury on the day the appeals courter the case we listen together on line a a the arguments the lawyers made were a about standings separability doctrine and meaning author shall what did congress intend when it set the tax to zero was he did not go well for the affordable carat agley did yyouculdell from the generous questions barley's exact words while we listened include things oh jess and this is really bad this is really bad and finally this is about as bad as you could expect from a normal argument the hero or or or he was truly surprise he thought the legal argument that zero could take down the whole law was quote weak to the point of frivoliciness to randy barney though this all seems totally logical barney is a professor at gorge town law has been vocal on the other side if the taxis zero barney says the mandates unconstitutional he don't think the court can strike out just that one part of the law the whole thing has to go to me it seems quite reasonable because it is a straight forward application of separability doctrine as i understand it people on the other side feel this case is an example of we are legal reasoning being used to get to a particular conclusion are there other legal decisions that look that way to you i would say that any decision that says that congress has a power under its power to regulate comments among the several states to short answer yes which is to say liberals have their examples of what they see as activist judges inventing bazaar arguments and do conservatives on your and libertarians bravest and everyone else he told me about this case that he argued before the supreme court and lost six to three you are the courtrule that a woman in californium is could not grow medical marowana o mist at our own house never in our own garden orstitstake for our own back pan rail nurse because of the interstate commerce clause a the constitution that sounds a loocrasy to me and yet those kinds of rulings happen all the time give me another one how much your time ism i going to get i asked earnest what he made the fact that this case is how we are deciding whether millions of america will have health an trees and that it all seem to stamin some way from the heard power of zero does it seem odd to you that we are in this position a you define odd would you mean it just seems odd that somehow therewould be a difference between congress setting a tax to a penny and zero whenever you have a distinction am there is going to be martial cases in which a that distinction could make a difference in the distinction could look arbitrary that is just the way law works it works out it works that way all the time your speeding by the way when you go thirty six miles an hour and a thirty five mile and hour's own but why is thirty six miles an hour why why as that a terrible speed when thirty five miles an hour is perfectly o we feels little different somehow am i mean you could say that ten i norm not sure how to respond to ta it'd let you have to ask it either it is it is your your feelings are your entitle to your feelings here are my feelings having big things this decided in the courts and legal grounds that most people will never understand it does not seem ideal to me the appeals court disposed to issue its ruling any day now it seems quite possible this thing is headed for the supreme court it is this little talk set to zero as created a legal world with the red states gathered on one side blue states on the other a four tax of highlevel legal math in the middle i worry it is can a suck us all into some other dimension well cross some event horizon from which there is no return it will tear our dams apart it will tear us apart either that or a neatly type dominion will come out some tuesday morning in tune they we cast about is the executive editor cool i three with the id cannot see to we enters to day with this last appreciation of small things that are anything but small from wily mulligan when i is in my early twenties it is been a lot an in time looking at topmost things on mine ad read the qualification section leadership skills self starter results oriancit and then it'd look at myself broke weird she of the point of silence and miss the dead line which just when i stumbled on a story called the job application it spit this writer robot valor the stories told in the form of a cover letter but instead of selling himself he just offers an honest assessment of who he is esteem gentleman i am a poor young unemployed person virgin difficult tasks i cannot perform and obligations of a far ranging sort are too strenuous for my mind ism not particularly clever first and foremost i do not to strain my intelligence over much ism a dreamer rather than a thinker a zero rather than a force dim rather than sharp the passion to go far in the world is unknown to me i remember thinking cannot suppose a tell people that stuff he was being funny and mocking bells long an dance but at the same time he was not making it up he needed a job he and t e letter well now what sort of a person i am i am sincere and honest and am aware that this signifies precious little in the world in which we lis i shall be waiting is seemed gentleman your respectful servant positively drowning in obedience i knew almost nothing about this writer but i loved him for writing this because a thing is feeling worthless at that age it was terrific when your brain is not orderly and results oriented an effective humans it'd have a rough shift temping or waitron sing people can be awful when you are t the bottom and it'd come home just treating the rest of my life and he got that i started reading more of his stuff when my favorites is a novel about boys in his school where they are training to be service he wrote and one thing we people are all similar we are small small all the way down the scale to utter worthlessness one thing i do know for certain and later life i shall be a charming utterly spherical zero robot razor turns out hes swims born in eighteen seventy eight and for a moment it looked he was going to be the next big thing conga who's younger than him was a fan when costa came on to the scene one critic back then explained conga by saying hi the says cone robot razor and there was as delighted absurdity to his wort he poke fun at himself for being small ut there was always an edge to it worsen being weak were the people deluded enough to think their see pompous he was not mean exactly were just entertained by their foolishness i started to see the world that way too but then one day a few years later i was at a bookstore and i saw a knew robot welfare book on the shelf more of his work translated into english i started reading the introduction and had all the stuff i had not known before about his life it sad that walker had spent the last third of his life in a mental hospital set's a frenzy he live there for twenty seven years until he died i was lord and was that for him this was the writer i turned to his a road map to remind myself that there are people out the me and there fine and he was the best of our kind of people i free to me out lake that is what life did to him it turns out robot walker had a little early success but not much after that writers liked him but his books in it sell well and he has predictably terrible at marketing himself it her flailing for a while he left the arisen and berlin i moved back home to switzerland n once he is there his life starts falling apart he could not really get his books published any more he starts renting out single rooms months to month from old ladies reduces his possessions to a single suit case he unhappy alone all the time mentally shaky he get nightmares and stay up all night pacing and muttering to himself eventually he checks himself into a mental hospital is nineteen twenty nine he asks the staff to put him in the share door because the speaks my heart he is afraid to be alone the diagnose him with skits of biennia he is there voluntarily at first the later he gets committed against his will kicking and screaming as they force him into the car for the transfer he spends the rest of his life in a sanitarium there is a story that when people encouraged him to write again he said ism not here to write and here to be mad and the world forgot about him and then he died an crisis day actually in nineteen fifty six he goes for a walk outside of his asylum and he collapses a couple cads find his body in a fields of snow some one actually to a photo robot walker's lying face up one arm out stretched dark clothes against white snow hes hat a few feet away he book i was looking at had something else something eerie it didn't know it to make of it after altar died a nurse in one of his hospitals came forward with these strange scraps of paper his sister had a shoe box full of them too hundreds of little scraps use post cards business cards old calender pages ripped in half and those little shreds were just covered and ant pencil markings dense little rows of tiny slashes and ticks packed on to shreds of paper everyone thinks its to madman scrawl and they put the papers away a few minutes later his friend who for years was one of the only people who really visited him in the hospital publishes a blown up photo of one of these scraps in a swims literary magazine and decipherable he writes a product of valuer skits of frena but when the magazine comes out a grad student writes in saying wait i can read this i think those scratchings are letters he got the papers and spent months staring at twenty four pages trying to decipher the tiny handwriting i turned out to be an entire novel tut there was still hundreds more scraps it was not until the nineteen eighties that some one tackled the rest of them another grad student names barnyard eta twenty one at the time he d actually been on his way to becoming a doctor but when he discovered robot altar he stopped that life in his traps swim to literature to spend more time with robot altar because i was nolytochu not treks not i i e us of the a burin but o mud says them he is to cop es hoe he is writing about everything in about nothing n that i thought to to realm en was seven ten an i it him on as every day since them he sought to the archive for the shreds are being kept and they agreed to let him see them try to decipher some more and when he sees them for the first time he is stunned the writing his micro comic he is letter just a speck about two millimeters at first and as the years go by they get smaller down to one millimeter these tiny bold characters lake miniature japan's calligraphy but the real difficult chat is the deny of twins because there no distance between the line write be cause if the letters are a millimeter the pencil marking must be half a millimeter yes you and this is very very default because the pens is not as shop as i should be he brought that up a few times could not he sharpen his pencil and this this is the problem because you you live know will not let this there and how and so but if you can read you can read it because you do not spell letterful or to we you i don't yo show the for the world he cannot identify the individual letters but somehow when you look at them all together sometimes you can tell what is says a word will reveal itself he start working on at full time with a partner they would said a type writers across from each other in a little room filled with cigarette smoke tent over these magnifying glasses called thread counters and he'd stare at the worth when they get stumped on a word itch happen constantly they had this system where they would rattle off gibberish and random syllables baronial an the other guy would work separately on a scrap for a while then they would compared their guesses if they had come to the same conclusion they decided it was wrist the project was supposed to take four years ain't ended up thinking tone tbaronhard ted the last six years alone he had started when he was twenty one and the cistern is for to one and when he would finally finished those five hundred twenty six scraps turned the six volumes sopor the might grow scripts two thousand some pages of stories comity little dramas a novel tout a robber who does not teal much of anything i had pictured this writing as sad little notes to no one but when you read it it is walkers back happily throwing stones when he writes give no use for these scrapers pleasure seekers overlook life's true pleasures aware not serious which makes them boring and they cannot help being word with me since ism port to them some things scholars have figured out walker wrote most of these scraps before the asylum this romantic idea of one man alone writing his master pieces well locked away seems i get did not happen that way unit seems he probably was not so as a frantic barn had to studied all the medical records walker's own doctor thought he was fine and should go home sychitris who study him now do not think he baskets a frantic either he nearly have the symptoms also that thing hes famous for saying ism not hear a write ism here to be mad people who study him think he likely don't say that that is a myth and that the truth is he got trapped there for the most infuriatingly mondayine reason magical buracrasy once he lost his wrists he could not get them back could not sign himself out and during the twenty seven years he was there at happened in the world weldwart to that are gloom writers who might haveknown his work people might have remembered that he was there had scattered there books were band they were living in exile or dying violently cook's family members were killed in the hallacoss some writer no one read any more can no one ever really knew in the first place people at other things to worry about one scholar told me she thinks that at some point walker probably could have gotten out of the hospital if he wanted to that he stopped trying i wondered why he spent many years writing things that even he probably could not read he explained to some one in those years when he was really depressed when publishers did not want his work any more he had bad writers block he describes it as a cramp in his brain and he explains that writing this tiny hurts he can take the cramp in his brain and put i into his hand instead once he does that his mind is clear and he can think a on a page of a calender he would cut into pieces he writes about why he did at all in pencil one day he figured out but a find made him nervous all this mistakes cross outs in ink but if he used the pencil instead and labored over this tiny writing he explains this labor look to me a pleasure as it were i filter would make me healthy a smile of satisfaction would creep into my soul each time a smile of amicable self derision it seems to me the pencil let me work more dreamily peacefully costly contemplatively i believe that the process ad just described would blossom into a peculiar form of happiness that his handwriting was small his incest connection with his convictions about life and the whit is interesting in life he was not interested in great portions and thinks we chat big and everybody knew about the interesting things are the small things the idea i had had about his life in the asylum how he died how awful it all seemed to me barnyard does not see it that way he studied altar his whole life every letter and document even about the house where altar once lived and he lives there now he knows his life inside an ow and he thinks is not tragic he says valuer usually seems kind of coquet not happy exactly but content life without success walker once wrote can also be beautiful his was there is power in being coquet with being aching it is honest and he cannot crush nothing he made his life smaller and smaller until he almost did not exists any more and then he did not an utterly spherical hero willy saliva is one poproducion i shall that of details about valuer's life in work in her story game from susabernavski thanks to her he translated eight of

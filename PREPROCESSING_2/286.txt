fluke was eleven when his found me move from the normal boring suburbs to what amounted to basically the coolest place on earth his tad got the jab is the manager this tourist park called the butterfly farm that had do filled with rainforest and a exotic birds and butterflies and a miniature train track and pony rides and minty bike rides and a launching ramp for the watersheds who came in spider housework vicnicaria a snake house and a banding vice did a show with his collection of deadly snakes it is a smarecan by the way from o u by chico and the only bad thing about being eleven and living out in the country side on the grounds of such an incredible place was the school that like attended this was an australia outside what was then a little town called wilder for us and the other students with the tuff kids it did not accept could a which is why it was such a great day for like when his whole class took a field trip to the butterfly farm it was it was my place my kingdom my tub and i felt extremely i excited and filled with anticipation that i could kind of relax and show off at the same time off especially because his dad had asked the snake candler vice to come in into a show for duke's case normally vice did not work during the week there were not big enough crowds to justify it be lukesdad knowing this would be god for luck asked him to come in special and that want that i was going to help vice we would been living there for about six months and now my brothers and i we were allowed into the snake room the snake house and he would deal with the poisonous snakes and we would deal with the nonpoisonous snakes and the pitmans that was fun and ai was exciting as you could imagine for an eleven are a boy being watched behind the glass by he is eighty class snakes and teachers i right you gas we might go this brave kid dealing with the snake can get in to do something at cool ye totally cool and and i would be totally at home with it because i was by that stage ye and love to doing it every week and i would watch victor his shows i knew them off hat and i just used to love standing there amongst the crowd every week and and feeling everybody is amazement as he would milk the death ad er and show the venom dripping down e the glass and vice was fearless that was his world he was very very comfortable handling snakes and they came up and all the kids piled out of the busses and i got to theater counter up to the busses in stakhide of my teaches an and the day began and at a certain point around the middle of the day it was time to see the snake show then everybody's in the snake house i mean there with vice putting the snakes in the bags everybody's watching us through the window this was is pray for the she my we put the snakes in the bags n then they would carry them to the stage for vice's presentation and all of a sudden this incredible thing happens beside me vice picks of a tigers snake the second deadly a snake in australia and it bites him three times tit that and i made this little sort of thump thump thump sound on his on his hand as it bit him had you ever seen that before no no at never nothing had ever gone on i had never seen the snake bite a human being before and now i saw it from one of the deadly a snakes in the world and it was it was massively powerful the moment of the bit and it was a triple by it bang bang bang and vice drops the snake and he says can and stop sucking the web of his hand where the snake bit him and ism completely astonished and just on my knees looking at him thinking what happens next is how bad is this well i knew it was bad i heard him give the toke every week and about how bad the tiger snake bite is we we and vice says this run down to the kiosk can get me a find of milk i say or say and i run out the door and have got a task now and as his little general stole kind of kiosk thing at the place and wait i run down to get the pine of milk i say this is for vice i do not have to pay this is the beginning of all the rules of the day being broken is one of my clearest memories of this day is how everything went the way it should not have gone n and and all bets were off but get the pine of milk i run back up he he opens it and he drinks this pint down drinks the whole thing down in one long mouthful and i say your cave vice and is i we everything's fine mate everything's find that is do the show and and this not because milk is some sort of thing you do if you get bidden by deadly snake i think the milk thing was just one of those weed old wife's tails or one of those australia bush recipes that this helps if you get bitten by a snake a we are ready to go now we have all the snakes in the bags and we leave the snake house and it is this weed pie piper kind of thing it is me and vice weighed down with these little blue canvas bags filled with writhing snakes and we all will down to the snake platform where he gave the shows followed by all of my classmates and our teachers and the only other people there that day at the butterplatform was a a couple of busload or a kids in wheel chairs there were kind of the spin buffeter kids or that o kid who a disabled in various ways and they were there with their minders his middle aged women mostly pushing these very disabled kids in wheel chairs they too are following us all down for the big snake show and e snake platform was about the size of a buying ring it was a raised platform and people would circle the platform on all for sides and pick begins the show and he gets about ten minutes into the show and he is holding a green tree snake which is a thin little whip it snake and suddenly he says ah that is not gentlemen ism going to have to stop the show now because and he just he is standing straight up and his eyes glazes over and he is instantly unconscious that is clear and he starts to fall backwards and at the instant that he falls backwards the snake in his hands he releases it and it falls over the edge of the platform and into the lap of one of these kids in a wheel chair and starts writhing around in the kid's lap look ay crazy and nobody knows what to do the snake is on this child's lap and because this has turned a stiff as a board he he does not break his fall at all he is completely unconscious from the standing position and he hits the wooden platform with this whack this enormous jump horrible cracking sound of his head hitting the wood at the same instant this kid in the wheel chair this kid had sort of claw hands and on and he is looking down at this snake in his lap and he starts to discover and everybody around the kid in the wheel chair starts just runs away screaming including the lady who is looking after at the same instant pick has hit the ground and he is arms have spread out and arms and legs spread in a kind of star shape and ism staring at him and the kid and my tit and then i catch the eye of one of my teachers who is looking at me as if the say what what is going on i have to act suddenly there is this moment now where i suddenly realized that ism the one with the greatest knowledge and my teachers in a sense are standing there powerless and beginning to be freed out and not having a clue what to do and it is it was an amazing moment and in amazes hi moment for a kid to have it eleven when you are eleven you do not get many situations where you are the wine and adults need to look to you to take control of a situation yet i run over to the kid and there is this women t where i look in his eye and i say something it is ora i mi take the snake out of his lap in the way that i was taught to do which is gently and without any jerky movements and am and yo run up the stairs on to the platform and that is the moment where i see how incredibly bad things are in terms of six state of health and what is a look i well it looks t first of all its tremendously embarrassing because his pity's pants this my who i looked up to much and it just it is everywhere the whole bottom half of his body is smoked and it is all around him spreading on the on these floorboards it was very much no longer a matter of this is good for me because this might change my place in the pecking order amongst the these difficult schoolkids in this difficult situation her but just a matter of oh my god i think vices dying or six's dead his face is almost black by now it is this kind of bruised purple black color i put the snake back into the blue canvas bag and tied the knot the way vice had taught me and then i said to my teachers it'll get my dad and then i proceeded to sprint up the hill to the house screaming at the top of my lungs dad dad dad it is a free very whey to go when he gets is dad and lukesdad came back with them and hen they got back none of the adults had taken any action at all one of duke's teachers was kneeling next to vice but he was an administering similar doing mouthed mouth or anything at all he was just kneeling there not our what to do look's dad lifted dick's limp body into the car tore off to the hospital now was it look gathered up the snakes and put the back where they belonged vice survived but the incredibly sad thing was that was the last snake show he ever gave in his life he was on a kidney machine for three months ah his skin took three months to gradually gradually return back to it is color am and and and that was it yet that was that was kind of end of career when i tell the story even now it is absolutely vivid and it is always vivid my got all of the the main moments of what happened that day as telling my go it is to this day one of the most vivid and intense memories in my life because in some we'd way it was the turning point it was one of those series of events heading towards adolescence and heading towards developing a concept of yourself as an autonomous human being as an adult and and how and how often in your life do you have a murmur where it suddenly become utterly queer what you have to do and only you can do it i think it is really rare i mean it for me that that was it that was that moment i mean i love every moment of my life and without sounding pretentious i hoar does not sound attention but at some absolutely primal level it is this deeply satisfying sense of actually doing something heroic wet a day an i had our show stories of people saving the day and what takes them over when they do it an he stories the people who jump in i just seized by this sense that they have to act they do not have a choice they will not be able to live with themselves if they do not jump into action is tin incredibly pure about it i so in two at one in the wilds of mexico one in the halls of academia stay with us that in midlife cowboy we have this story from names spring who as in a city that is not far from the medical border sandy ego at thirty nine i took a little inventory of my wife and found myself to be unremarkable and almost every way for more than a debate it'd held a job writing ad copy and radio commercials in sanding i had a wife two kids two manages tiro prescription reading glasses and about twenty extra pounds that i no longer had the energy or ambition to lose my fortieth birthday was only a couple of months away in aril my wife telly had a brighter attitude about it all we throw you big party she said it will be fun i do not think i said i did not want a party it is your big for o she said think about what you want to do for it i did think about it for a long time in the end what i thought was ism man to do something big to help somebody else in a big way it is going to be a great big thing when it is done i'manto feel really really good and helpful what d you mean help somebody my wife said i do not know i said it was still pretty shapeless inside my head it used to be a boat captain i knew parks of mexico better than pretty much anybody maybe that was a start will you been to help my wife said help them what i do not know i said something's gin to come up maybe an earthquake head and it'll help dig people but maybe helcopp tor go down an bah i could help find it this was all met with the most epic of i rolling and sighing i be boat least twice a week this conversation continued to divide us she talk about party planting and it'd have to remind her that i might not even be around ism i might be out rescuing people aril arrived and still no earthquakes or helicopters on fridge about five o'clock right after work i thought maybe i should be a little more proactive i did a gouge search on two words that seemed to make the most sense for my plan bah and missing it might be time to explain the bah part in the late eighties i worked in the area that the drug enforcement agency calls the western mexico bah corridor but i was not one of the good guys it was over twenty years ago i just dropped out a college and i was a little aimless i re connected with a friend that it'll call ales back in sanding ales had put together and enterprise moving metal examine along the west coast right about the time i arrived a new law had been passed in the us that made it tough to get the main ingredient exedra but i was pretty sure we could still get it in mexico the border was less than a half hour away the effederan pipe line was easy to establish and soon it got filled with other stuff too to marijuana personally the drugs held no attraction for me which made it easy to justify my actions i mean if these airbags wanted to ruin their lives with met letter it turned out i was really good at the job i got to know my way around mexico around the marinas and hidden ranches and dirt air strips around the cops and soldiers i came to love the a peninsula but during this time the business was falling apart back on the best side ales in his paws had developed bad drug habits and i got really sloppy it been away and mexico during two police rates on the house in sanding ut i was there for the third one i was arrested and taken to jail with the others it the cops didn't have a warrants thy had to drop the charges i moved out o the house the couple of weeks later some badges came in the middle of the night backseat shirts black scheme asks they beet ales into a coma raped his girl friend it toll everything they copy get their hands on after that i packed up my red cheap and i drove south to bah i did not come back for four years by the time i moved back to sanding an nineteen in to three ad fashion myself in to an upstanding citizen an ambitious and enthusiastic member of the work force and life rolled along pretty much a supposed does for most people an a chemo aforrwon say family i kept waiting for the other shoe to drop but life was really steady it was good far better than i deserved and on the eve of my fortieth birthday i brought up gouge and typed the words bah and missing the top result on gouge was a day old newspaper article about a fugitive couple wanted for kidnapping and murder this story essentially was that this couple richer carrell and shell pinkerton were a pair of chronic methheads who killed their landlord in san francisco then they drove to sand crus a kidnapped their own six year old daughter from the grand parents who would been given legal custody an oh yah also on the run with them there two month old baby girl with down syndrome clearly these were not great parents a year earlier there were hold up in a motel when police rated the room when found them with the pile of stolen property in metal etamines their daughter liana then four years old was found hiding under the motel bed the newspaper picture of liana showed a smiling little girl with blond hair and blue eyes an address with pink pocadats she look just my daughter laddie police had been searching for liana and her parents for more than three months this article said that a month earlier a two's might a spotted the family and he town called sankantein on bah californium's specific coast met had kidnapper murders on the run i was a former met supplier i absolutely do not believe in destiny jess christy there was a link to a missing flier with pictures in a one number to call i died an a switchboard operator answered for the san francisco police department i realized i had no idea what to say i i said ism calling about a flier for a missing girl liana carrell a flier sir the operator said ore i guess a poster i said a missing poster card the whereabouts of a missing person no i said it'd saw i just need to talk to somebody in charge of the liana celli case can you spell that sir i spelled the name she put me on holed three times obviously i had not called the right person i looked up other contact info for the san francisco police department i made a couple more calls and quickly realized i needed to fake a little more competent here is what i was can to say look ism certainthat there is a team of officers and volunteers conducting canvasing an search parties i would to volunteer to join the effort but the conversation never got that far instead each time nobody knew what i was talking about i finally convinced somebody to francs for me to the detective's division i got an answering machine saying that the office was closed until money morning the lack of information e lack of interest by the police department was surprising unbelievable really this whole story had become front page news because of the way the san francisco police had already bungled it the newspaper said that after carrell and pinkerton's landlord was re ported missing the place did not respond for a month and when they did finally arrive at his building to look for him they found his tenants carrell and pinkerton unwilling to let them search theproperty a police dog keyed on carrell's van in the driveway there were blood staying visible on the open garage bathe officers had no warrant they allowed the couple to drive away in their beat up white mercury sedan the cops eventually towed carrell's van but then incredibly they did not search it on the inpour lot somebody finally looked inside found the body of the landlord he would been dead for six weeks by this time carrell and pinkerton were already hundreds to miles away siphon record showed that they made it as far as vagus and then for three months nothing maybe the san francisco police for not the best resource here i looked online for volunteer groups flier passerrouders candelihte vigils again nothing all that was left at this point was the little girl's family the grandparents and an uncle that the newspaper had called the family spokesman probably every d net job in the world was calling them the smarmy in vestigatoris in the psychics grifter is conman i found the uncle's phone number and then just sort of died it went exactly you would think it would which is to say badly if your want objective in a conversation as to convince some one the yournoct crazy you have already lost essentially what the uncle said was thank you for your concern the police are doing everything they can we appreciate the support and then the call was over i was on my own to be honest it felt sort of good sort of familiar but better as i knew without a out that this was the right thing to do i was going to bah now i just had to go one and tell my wife she was not happy you said you are onto help people in an earthquake she said this is not our problem this is not your fight she was crying and yelling they are drug antics they are murderers she spent a long time listing reasons why i should not go i understood why she was worried baas rough every couple of weeks there is another string of beheading ore a government official hung from a bridge usually thanks to the drug cartels last year a guy nick named ell posaleto the shoemaker confessed to dissolving the bodies of more than three hundred of his victims and acid these stories help keep barhop protein free of turns free a development free of laws it is the old wild west the old west there is no sulphone service selling knew she could not even call me down there ti kept repeating the one thing she could not argue with nobody's looking for those little girls i said if i do not go who will a they're next day sturdy i packed the gas cans too maps the p s watered jugs fix o flat hi sent animal to my bass saying that something sudden had come up and that it'd be taking a vacation week ore maybe too i took the lousy missing fire that i had found on line and redesigned it i added a picture of the infant and a photo a car from the auto crater that match richer crew's white mercury i translated the fliers to punish and changed the headline to read sick with strata which means kidnapped i went to kinos and rented twenty five hundred copies a californium self was the dusty peninsula that begins near the sanding to want a border ends the thousand miles later in the resort town of cops on lucks there is only one road that runs from top to bottom and at various points along the way at passes tiny villages and military check points and about two dozen of the state run relax gustations without much to go on this is what i chose to believe we your cruelly knew nothing of bah he spoke no punish and had no friends he had no weapons at this point and no money the family was still traveling in the mercury sedan they would not willingly double back from military check points a crossing to areas where they would be required to show idea in register e tween the beat up sedan and the newborn they had to be somewhere close to the highway i spent the first day passing out fliers the gustations at police stations at military check points where i also passed out old played by magazines i put my truck to grease the skids with soldiers the trick i resurrected from the old days i made countless stops and starts at every market and rancho near a dusty crossroads i told the story not a single person had hard it before but they were all titillated now by the drama of the murderous couple in their poor children just before dark i arrived in sankantein the town where the couple might have been spotted a month earlier tacostands bars hotels camp grounds nobody had seen or heard of the family i went to bed some time around midnight but i could not fall asleep i lay on the lumpy mattress and tried to invasion every possibility celli and pinkerton living in a village ad they squatted it an abandoned ranch they found a benefactor they already dead i wondered if maybe i was in saying to be here sometime before i fell asleep i hit me that they might not even have come to mexico at all the next morning i broke to the sounds of roosters day two i got my truck and headed south i had my doubts but i figured i had to keep going an hour later i came to a tiny farming community called santamaria i went into a market and left to stack o fliers small group of men was telling around to poetic coffee when i went back outside to the gas pumps the guy who ran the market came out with one of the fliers in his hand these people he said they were here really i said somehow i doubted it he looked at the flier again they bought water milk and potato ships they asked if we sold divers but we don't his grocery list was specific they were here they had to be what vehicle were they driving i asked this one he pointed at the fair how long ago three weeks the timing was exactly right did you see the children i asked no he said i thanked him and left with a new plan i would raced straight down to the bah for state line the half way point o the peninsula where the family would be forced to register i would drive the emigration officials for a pick at the book and confirmed that correlliand pinkerton did not sneak past then i double back and mad scoop him up a net i was driving fast now that the tires squealed on the turns before a half hour past i reached the village will rosary pa make station there cod be the last gas for two hundred miles probably told my tankanell rosary three hundred times it was too important to place to not stop for a men use handsome fliers i jammed on the brakes and skitter across the lane into the gas station i was posting a flier near a gas pump in one of the attendants approached clavi he said i saw her the blond where i asked it pump number one he said she asked me about a cheep place to eat when i said three days ago three days i said you mean three weeks days he said three days ago next door to the gas station was a small to tell i showed the flier to the two ladies working behind the reception desk when they saw it they both shrieked covered their mouths yes the family was here n ell rosary they were living in a small house just two doors away from the home of one of the receptionists yes they were still driving the white car but they would been trying to sell it in the village and yes the little girls were still with him but the infant whose name was faith was very sick the bondwoman they told me was earning money by teaching dance license to children in the village for ten passes an hour a buck an hour the house was a hundred meters away less what time or the classes i asked three o'clock one of them said i looked at my watch it was two forty five carrell and pinkerton were here now a block away things were moving fast through my head that it fell earth time had stopped i could suddenly see everything that i needed to do next clearly i told the women at the motel not to telling one about our conversation i ran back to the gas station and rip down the fliers and took back the stack i had left i needed to get my truck in its america license plate off the road fast it was a tiny town i had to assume that word would soon get back to correlliand pinkerton i drove a half block to the town small payphone office and hid my car behind the building an operator connected me to the uncle and santicrous i found them i said i told him the stories quickly as i could he gave me a phone mum be for a u s marshal handling the case and i got him on the phone i found them i said the you ask marshal seemed doubtful annoyed i led i know that i could get together a team of local police and go get correctly do not do anything he said call me back in one hour i looked at my watch again it was now after three clock dance class was in session if i called the u s marshal back in an hour and he instructed me to contact the local copse which was the only reasonable location that whole process might take another hour may be more it might be too late i went a crops the street to the center block police station three cops were gathered round to small televise an watching a move with chuck morris and a midget i later figured out that the move was lone with ma quay than nineteen eighty three classic in which chuck norias character making in version into mexico to take care business we ice mexico gag i meed to speak with the commandant i said one of the cops leaned back in his chair ism the comingdon the what you want he was clearly irritated by the interruption but he led me to a tiny room with the metal desk and closed the door when it'd finished telling him the story he radioed his off duty copse and told them to report to the station immediately they call for back up from sankanteen the dance class was half over in the police station bullet proof vests were pulled to lockers weapons were loaded one of the cops found an extra flack jacket that would fit me

died the uncle in sand crus look i said the u s marshall says that we have to wait until to morrow i explained that it did not have to be this way that i did not work for the u s marshal but this was not my decision it was his family only he could decide he conferred for a few moments with the grandparents and then he said the paper working be ready by the time it is needed go do it medical federal cops arrived from sancanteine a few moments later for unmarked truck loads full of guys with big mustaches and feathered jackets most of him carried assault rifles one of the troops was sent out to observe the house they radio back to the station that the children were out front with to mother i few seconds later came the report that the father was now outside too the leader of the federal squads said nominal then he put a hand on my chest and ordered me to stay put ten minutes later they returned nickel pinkerton in the children were in the back of one truck cruelly was handcuffed in another they jerked him out of his seat and stood him in front of me when he saw me the fight trained out of him and he fancy he might have held about the arrest being just a medical shake down was dead he asked me why he was being arrested i did not respond liana stared out the door of the other truck wide eyed and nervous nickel pinkerton was working hard to convince her daughter that everything was toque she held the baby tightly in one arm and hugged wanna with the other rocking them both gently against her we caravan back to the federal headquarters where a big group of copse whooped as richer cruelly was pulled from the truck and let up to the station nickel and the girls were taken out of the other truck and wanna watched in horror as her father was led

tried to explain what had seen the girls seemed well cared for but they seemed loved i told him that things were different than i had expected well he said liana loved her grandparents too i drove home the next day i did not know it yet but the media was already in a full frenzy seeanend and see be and fox were calling my office all the news reports were or black and rioting after a whole most poles that none lo finding the girls but one i did in just two days came sprang whether were calling me a hero but i did not feel one the lotteways i felt the homerecker it did a couple of interviews but they went poorly well that is off you went to mexico and what did you do a basely a i a i created a flier and punish and the thing about the loss i stopped the one bright spot in all the coverage the one moment that made me feel maybe i had done the right thing was semvidio shot at the air port when wanna got off the plane in the out in at wanna seize her grandmother at the arrival gate she yells grandma runs under arms and they are both ruin the grandma tells her it is you you are home now i mustn't watch that body a hundred times all week the phone calls did not stop producers are trying to by the movirihts long lost relatives tried to re connect everybody was calling except manna's grandparents it'd been thinking of them a lot i just wanted to know that the girls were happy it not happy but that they were of that they wherein to be of tut the grand parents did not call i couldn't call them i mean they had to be overwhelmed i fell maybe it'd intruded into the girls lives enough already but i needed to do something i said a huge box of presents to the kids and notebook for liana for she could write letters to her parents on the inside cover i wrote her a note i tried to make her understand why it'd done this it was kind of an explanation kind of an apology even thought knew she was way to young to comprehend any of it i got no response and then i started learning some odd things on one newspapers website i found a comment from a guy who said he was shell pinkerton's brother i called her white trash said that he hoped she was brought to justice for her crimes a reporter told me that he would interviewed the grandfather and that the guide made some pretty hateful remarks about richer carrell not hoping that correlate would become some big black eye's girl friend in prison d then there was a photographer who would been sent to take pictures of the family who gave an equally depressing report he said he could not shoot any photos in the house cause it did not look children even live there no toys no kids stuff on the walls course that does not mean anything it is just cosmetic it did not mean they were not taking good care of them or did not love them i did not know what to believe i was worried about this little girls and nothing had heard since bah was making me feel any better eight months passed the trial date was set and then one day in the middle of the week i got a call from viand's grandfather it was not a thank you but it was a man that thing you did not mexico was really something and i said yer and then he reiterated his hopes that manna's father be raped in prison every day for the rest of his life he told me that the trial was about to begin that i might get some phone calls from prosecutors and then the call was over correlate was charged with first three murder he had fitted the landlord had died during a fight they had but said it was on intentional e trial the details came out the landlord's lip was busted open his nose was broken he was badly bruised and had been stabbed with the small knife his body was found wrapped in a sleeping bag bound with ducktail buried under a pile of trash in the back of the van the official cause of death with suffocation the defense argued that met had given correllia condition called hypofrontality meaning could not think straight he made whacky decisions storing a corpse in his van and kid napping his daughter and fleeing to bah in other words the met made him do it which as a former math's smuggler did not make me feel great the trial ended with a hung jury richer carrell was not convicted o first three murder he would have to be retried on he lesser charge the some point i got a phone call from a private investigator mi shell pinkerton's public defender had hired the guide to track me down is pinkerton says that you spend a couple of days with her in the kids in mexico he said i told him that seemed a strange way to describe it did you see her he asked interacting with the children i told him that i did wall she was thinking you might have some good things to say about what you saw there it took me a moment to understand that it'd just been asked to be the character witness for a m pathetic an accused murderer who had taken her kids on the run and in a way i was really tempted because she didn't seem a good mother on that day mother who loved for

life from or glass todaysho saved the day stories of people who get the impulse to step in wethers turned the backs and do good rescue the needy we have arrived at at two of our programmed too it'd to spank the academy every year since nineteen ninety eight the university of montavalo the smallerbroart's college outside of bermingam albata as held an event called the life raft debate got a simple premise there's ben gobocatastrophe now war something as wiped out the world except miraculously the hundred of students who are in the audience of the life draft debate students are on a life raft it is only got one spot left and six professors another university staffers sit up on the stage i make the case one by one that their department there academic discipline is the one that deserves that one empty seat that deserves to be saved that there academic discipline will help the student survive will make the students lives much more meaningful even professors take part in this every year there different winners every year nancy unlike heard about the event from a listener a student back when we first broadcast today show name carry matters honorary matters and nancy looked into this the man who started the life raft debate a philosophy professor at the university of montevala named michael paten warned me when he sent a bunch of d v is of the event that there would been a sort of convergence of silliness at the two thousand seven debate and i was looking forward to the silliness as a corrective to what i figured would be a pretty intense over all intellectualism and dryness because what else is there to thank when some one says he have got a d v d of university professor's arguing about how there area of study is better than any one else area of study i popped the two thousand seven to v d in and instead of a debate i watch mimics pile up one after another e dean of the business scold rolled into the cam when he van was an how on a barley to the tune of the song that not names tense wast land but that we all know is to his was can he hart tuck off his letter jacket and stalled up to next to the other coin stage he was the first to make this five minute pits to the audience i every much i every much indeed i her o i too i talk to you about strata yoga strategist you will understand what that needs i was try to take theatres an weakness as at you may possess and to put them together with opportunity now wont the life a you count need is because that will be women are gone be some men and we need to put together your strengths at your weaknesses i know i sound my elves but ism sorry it just comes out that way dean of the business gone went on to say that strategy would not be enough on the life raft he also promised leadership he did a demonstration asking the audience to stand o take eyes this is your part go with me now here ago my we got to leadership y ladies you get it you do the other part we w we w race on wow an we we keep in mind that the stages set up with elector and microphones tables with professors seated at them facing the audience just some earnest think tanksponsered political discussion or a college debate a professor of education showed up on stage in a formal academic robe and then took it off to reveal a superhero costume to audience cheers who has captain education de his right was an art history professor who argued that the post apocalyptic world would be bleak without images and the survivors we need in our historians to get the most out of any images they created or conclusion out of the blue we can build a new world a batter world a world in with woman have the power remember it is the man whole t us into this mast the chair of the english department tried briefly to argue for the importance of story telling in human culture and then used up most of his time reciting a three minute and fifteen second poem he made up about a mythical woman's football team at the university and its champion kicker mighty ritzy mighty mite mi get to kick once more shes put it through for three good points for foot we sure to score watching e debate i found myself getting strangely mad had gone to a wrestling match and all the wrestlers worried that the audience would find wrestling too violent the just walked around doing the preening and smack talking and as i remember it pretty much every student getting a liberal arts degree worries at some point that their education might actually be useless that is what makes the liferaft debate a funny idea and a serious one it is a forum for the students to say to their professors make us believe in the value of what we are doing here that cause seemed lost in this debate and then the devil's advocate got up to rescue us all every liferaft debate has a devil's advocate he makes the same argument every year vote for no one and he never went in this debate the devil's advocate was an unsecured english professor named john smith who when he heard how the debate was going threw out most of his prepared notes and spoke off the cuff making the most impassion speech of the entire event and one of the most satisfying speeches have herd in a long time ism going to let play through the end i required mi freshmen to come to this because i thought us recovering argument that they would be exposed argument gas i am sorry what i to do is to give you a little history of the life raft debate and try to explain how we got to the present pass a by way i guess of apology it used to be that the life r aft debate was a it is espouser by the philosophy club and it was a fairly say i philosophical discussion about which disciplines truly contributed the most to a liberal education that is what was being contested i have not been here the whole ten years have been down it but have been here five and i can dimly remember when michael paten one he was funny but he also made a case he made a serious argument see if parked the next year one he made a good argumentwhich is a double achievement because sociology is not a real discipline but something when terribly awry in about two thousand and fore and i cannot remember this cause i was on the stage willow falling stood on a chair and declared that god is a his story and the audience ate it up and voted for him a he was they did not were not really voting for willow falling the scholar or the his stories ism sure he is both those things but they we voting for willow found the baptist preacher the next year you voted for a cook and i thought i could not get any worse in the year after that you voted for at administrator you have brought yourself to this because seriously these are smart people up here they have stooped to some of the stupidest crap to make you laugh and all of us who are a serious teachers sometimes can fall into that trap we want to be funny we want to be entertaining and we get this sense that if their laughing we must be teaching it is not always true i think there is a general argumentative fallacy that is gone on with every single one of these poor people up here and i dontknow ow they got sucked into it is probably your far i it is what i call the sherry ford fallacy sherry you here to night o you may remember this from the two thousand and for debates it is always stuck in my mind sherry argued that because you need to communicate to have sex you need a communications professor to have see ism pretty sure you do not i mean it is quite possible images are great but we have not yet heard the case made how much you needed our historian to have images you probably want have images anyway education is wonderful but people were doing education for a couple of thousand years before some one got the idea of having education professors ah people been telling stories for a long time before there ware departments of english and foreign language is not forth and i hate to do that because that is my own disciplines i have to shoot down but good lord the i read a decided a poem it's not an argument look folks it is gone too far a it is you were not you you may have been entertained for the last half hour or fortify sense whatever but i do not think you were intellectually challenged i do not think a strong case was made for anybody's discipline and i honestly think the life raft debate has got in kind of far away from what initially used to be and what it should be you have a chance to night to change that you it devote for no one is not to say oh i do not any of them or there not all funnier they're not charming or whatever is just to say come on treat us a dulse argue for your discipline you can do that an be funny but please you can send that message and i hope to night you will here's what i real if when i felt thrill that the students for the first time ever in the life rafterbate voted for the devil's advocate at some point for me the whole thing became a metaphor for politics in the ass right now the non debates the pandering the flimsiness the endless stage craft and all of it swallowing up the serious people along with the vacuous ones part of the time i was seated in the bleachers watching it and then part of the time i was off to the side pacing madly john smith the devil's advocate himself also saw politics in the debate when i got in touch with him after watching there is a degree to which we sort of expect public discourse is is going to be just horrifically debased that you are going to have these got awful arguments and there is there is nothing else i except crappy emotional appeals that mayor may not actually impact on real issues is one thing that did feel really good is that the students responded they said no we do care about substance carrying about substance does not men we have to surround ourselves with massive bores but it does not mean we have to stiffen our spines and rays our standards which john says he is done with help from roll models people simony cowl actually have done wonders for us as teachers simony cowavav amercanite of of amercanita right as of the counties everybody was frickand concerned with everybody's self esteem the it was very hard to just actually come out and say something a that everybody knew is true but it would have been perceived as being in polite it became very hard or unusual if you actually said this is a bad argument ought to a student on a paper am a you and and you would think that students who have been brought up and being told their special all the time this is everybody talks about them lonely as the the generation that were brought up being told their special all the time would be these fragile narcissists who would collapse at the instant that they got some real criticism but what i found a is that they are quite robust in the years since john spoke and two thousand seven the life raft debate has been more substantive while still being funny one years a history professor told the audience that history shows that in the chaos following a global catastrophe one person on the life raft one of you in the audience he said would definitely become a dictator and he as a historian would be the ideal adviser to this dictator to tell them how to be benevolent a mathematics professor all in camaphlige dear calmly argued that without mathematics the life raft survivors would have trouble navigating anywhere and building anything durable once they got there he also promised that no one on the life raft would have to do map ever again we want all

todayshos poster baxxpressvipian thousands my liters v already secured their neortata join them expressvepiandicon flashes yesterday seven chowders in estimated reporters broke a huge story the long hidden manifesto of the natural tennessee trains school shooter o march twenty seventh twenty twenty three the shooter a twenty eight year old woman who believe she was a man shot up the covenant school in green hills killing six people mostly children given the identity of the shooter the media quickly jumped to the narrative that the story was lack of gun control in fact that narrative quickly spun into another narrative about racism after two black democratic lawmakers illegally storm the house for in tennessee and took control of the chamber and then faced the prospect of expulsion from their seats gun control and races hm against black america those were the narratives the media spun about the astral shooting the real story obviously was not that it was the evil insanity of the shower herself what might have forced coverage of that issue would have been if we had all seen the shooters manifesto in virtually all other cases in which a nastier leaves a manifesto the manifesto or at least its general message is made public nearly immediately the august twenty twenty three jacks dill shooting targeting black america featured a white premises manifesto for example the twenty nineteen ell pass shooting targeting his panic america featured another white premises manifesto the twenty fifteen tarleston church shooting featured a white premises manifesto the shooter and natural had a manifesto two but we were told it was utterly unclear just why the shooter had targeted a religious school and we are told that the manifesto was quote rambling without a clear political motivation in fact a federal law in forcemenofficial told and beck news that quote no direct motive has been established in the investigation and then suggested that the driving force of the attack was similar to previous school shootings in which the assailant was drawn to other mas killers we are told that the manifesto might never be released despite the fact that the natural police department release a list of items belonging to the shower including in suicide note three folders and nineteen journals it has now been seven months the manifesto still has not been officially release but powders investigate give teem somehow obtain three pages of the manifesto and here is sum of what it says two three twenty three kill those kids those cracker is going to private fancy schools wit those fancy kakis and sports back packs with their daddy's mustangs and convertibles f you you little leaps i wish to shoot you weak ass with your mop yellow hair want kill all you little crackers bunch of little f words with your white privileges f u f words three twenty seven twenty three death day today is the day that it has finally come my campily the sear do not know how i was able to get this fruit here i m ism a little nervous but excited too been excited for the past two weeks there were several times i could have been caught especially back in the summer of twenty twenty one none of that matters now ism almost an our and seven minutes away can believe ism doing this but ism ready i hope my victims art my only fears if anything goes wrong it'll do my best to prevent any of the sort god let my rat take over my anxiety it might be ten minutes tops might be three to seven its dunnage quick i hope i have a high deaf count on quit what do we know about the shooter well we know that the shooters pouted radical left when slogans about white privilege and wanted to shoot white kids we also know that the shower came out as a trains gender man on face book in twenty twenty two we know the shutter attended the christian shool as a ten your old kid in other words we know that a transgender person suffering from severe mental illness and citing left going slogans on race targeted white christian kids we are the case the reverse we the suture a religious christian targeting sexually confused children of color the manifesto would have undoubtedly been released immediately the entire media conversation what of centered on the evils of christiania and white races in america but the story had to be buried and that right quickly it is not o hates talk about trains violence in the united states despite violent threats that attach to any one who says that men are not women and women are not men in fact the washington post canon entire piece after the trains school shooting claiming at the right was quod exploiting natural shooting to escalate antitank generic the white house issued it sympathy for townspeople over all here as corner chon pierright after the hoping and what o ta thing that we saw during the maternal actions is that people do not want their freedoms to be taken they want us to fight for their freedom and it is shameful it is disturbing and are harts go out to hothouse the grant community as they are under a tack right now the story from the white house from the left is always about the victimhood of trains america trains america are always experiencing a massive wave of deadly violence even if that isn't statistically true it is not o ka to talk about anti white violence in the united states either whiteness we have been told must be abolished whiteness is inherent privilege whiteness is it disease to curse never mind the fact that in twenty twenty one eighty seven percents common league into racial violent crimes committed between blacks and whites for example or black on white as whether my donate points out whiteness is the problem the fact that these are cherished left wing narratives means they must be protected at all costs and that means burying an inconvenient manifesto in reality if we are going to release any masshooters manifestos and that is questionable whether we should but if we are going to release any of them we have to release all of them if we are going to examine the motives of shooters in order to in cover supposedly unique america ills we are owed the full paminiply of the criminally evil but we will not get that full view and we all know why in just a second we will get to a shocking murder that happened inflows annual's the result of procomas quote quote protestors

peaceful they are all decent it is not that their anti america radicals who wish to destroy the west none no these are all decent members of the interjectional coalition again the narrative in america is very simple and in the rest of the west for the left here is group of people we call these people the oppressors and there's a group of people and we call these people the oppressed and you are member of an oppress group you can never be an oppressor and if you are member of an oppressor group you can never be oppressed that is the way this works i you're transchoolshooter they're ember of an oppressed group and oppressed minority and that means the we have to bury your motives and your identity if in fact it turns out that your motives and your identity are connected with your status as one of the oppressed if you are a member of an oppressor group and there we just mean people who are powerful people who are rich people who are not poor it does not matter if you are pressed if you are a new for example in the united states and jewels are just proportionately highly educated wealthy in the united states if you're a due that means you're a member of an oppressor classed and that means that no matter what happens to you the have to pretend it did not happen to you we have to pretend that you are somehow the victimizer this this extends by the way it abstracts up to the highest level in internationalppolitics if you are member of an oppressed group say the palistinians for example and we know their pressed because they are poor and there not poor because they have not spent dime building up there own society theyrenot for because they continuously elect and put into power people where derris there not poor because they eve decided that murdering news is more important then actually growing civil society they knot they are poor betas obviously the were exploited and we know they ere exploited because they reports perfectly circular they are poor because they were exploited and we know they were exploited because they are poor they are the oppressor that they are intheoppressed category that means that whatever they do to the quit n quit oppressor even if that oppressor is the only thing that has provided them any money any living any jobs for the pass twenty years even if that oppressor but pulled out of the gosetripinto thousand five that means that anything that happens to the oppressor group meaning civilian news in israel is justified anything that happens to commons is in justified that is the logic and that logic justifies pretty much anything it justifies pretty much anything it also ends with blood es a turns out that if you break down all of society and all of civilization into these two groups oppressor fore s is oppressed what you and up with it is people who believe they are oppressed and also believe that they have full immunity to do whatever they want this why the black laves matter riots in two billion dollars an damage there is a baseline assumption that people do whatever they want andyou know what they were right it is why over the weaken you's hob people to face statues of ben franklin try to climb the white house walls is why you saw that the reason the you all this is because these people feel they have immunity because they are a member of quit oppressed class and if you are not a member of oppress class let say that you are white america the way that you are able to join oppress classes which is a great thing because the incentive structure is to give you full immunity for anything to do all you have to do is join the solidarity coalition that is all you have to do that presumably is the reason why all of these violent protests are happening all over the world because again once your member of an oppress group can do what ever that held that you wants and it is not as the people do not say this out loud they do there's a fascinating piece over then your times called a cross the echo chamber a quiet conversation about war and race when two acquaintances in aslant sat down to find common ground on the israel commas war they found themselves in a painful conversation about race power and whose suffering is recognized race power who suffering the entire article is about two people one name sameraminciln who om is a jewfish woman a very liberal jeishwoman and the other a woman me conidia liver conidia liver is a procomasnic and surotomane quote the actual history of the situation is not complicated i will always stand beside those with less power less wealth less access and resources and choices regardless of the extreme acts of a few militant who are don watching their people slowly die she says the quite bite out loud the cent city liver if you're a member of a quote powerless group if you are poor you can do literally anything and she will stand with you and it is entire article is about minion who has brought in gas you liberal jo minion who has brought into that premise not being able to convince liver out of that premise quote in nearly two hours together on a recent who's the afternoon the women stumbled through discussion of race power history and whose suffering gets acknowledge both liberal democrats they touched on many of the same disputes now rolling their party college compasses and companies a cross the country what exactly to the conversation godlike they wont exactly as you would think olives had quote i have a very strong affiliation with marginalized people brown displaced refuge he is black we usually hear the prospective of those in power and our school is about amplifying the voices of the die powered she then accused minion of defending quit settler colonialism and she recalled expressing disbelief that the displacement felt oka to jewfish people mankind thought that question was an over simplification because you not historically ignorant she news have historical ties to the land she said we have failed to acknowledge we have to acknowledge the policies the a reapplied thus far have failed i hope maybe the end of this their some sort of large policy cracked open by the people whore supposed to be leaving us leaving us p but in the end all that happen is that minion said quote you see me as white in that binary or your lens of the oppress in the oppressor leaves only one space for me tut i mas see myself as jewfish in that scenario it is much more complicated that is the wrong argument but mankind cannot get out of the argument because once our in the oppressor press matrix it does not matter if you try to claim that you are jewfish and not white the macs no difference at all you are member of an oppressor class because news in the united states are disproportionately wealthy and highly educated which means you are an oppressor the actual answer that mincing refuses to say is the oppressor up pressed being yard is stupid and wrong when makes you an o presser is being oppressive when makes you a pressed is being oppressed it does not it does not identify by race it does not identified by income but as long is the left is addicted to the sort of nonsense evil is going to a par and be justified by the left well that is where we are with regard o these prokomas protest which resulted in the murder of a sixty nine year old jewfish man the other day according to a b c seven pal nestler died as result of the injuries sustained at an event sundae according to venter county sheriff's office investigators he is sixty nine years old hots coat injured and an altercation at a propalistinian raliatza it's a very nice way of saying that he is beat over the head with megaphone which is actually what happen it is believed kettle was involved in an altercation propalistinians a demonstrators when he was injured he then fellow hid his had on the ground according to the sheriff's office remember if canary six protestors slash rioters are involved in physical altercations with officers and those officers died days later shamans canary six of the violent insurrection that ended with death if however prokomas protestor beats a sixty nine year old man on the head and he falls down and hits his head and then dos the matures o not that teston altercation is just teething that happen kind of the nature of the altercation remains under investigation but somereports indicate that before he fell kettle was struck in the had with a megaphone by an individual whit the propalistinian revenge who is pronounced t dad on money he venture county medical examiner's office has determined castle's death to be a homicide cause by blunt force head injury by the way this is not in the dregs of lot angels this isn't thousand oaks which is one of the nice more up scale areas of lot angels was is great crime apparently he was flying in his daily glad the jewfish reiteration of greater losangel's release tostatemen quote we are devastated to learn of the tragic death men elderly jewfish man who's struck in the head by a megaphone we will did by a propalisinian protester in west this village our harts avert the family the victim whole we wait for more in formation for our loin foremen partners we are mind you this the fourth major cosmetic crime committed in fella this year alone violence against our people has noplace in civilized society but again civilized society is see it depends on high fine civilization and for t left civilized society means pretending that anybody who is standing with the quotonclor rest can get away with literally anything this is the way the logic works ism t e left and what is that lead to shockingly a rise in antisemitism will get to more on that momentarily first the october fifteenth tax deadline his arty

allegedly plauedher car into what she thought was the jewfish school this story is actually hilarious because it turns out that it was a it was am a badgiam badge crime rub along that thirty for allegedly back for vehicle into a building a located with black here israelates and india polis laid fridge while several adults children were inside the reason i said to begin bag gag rime intros it is in its more accurate sates an antisamad an antes my crime the blackebrew israel turn anti memetic group she saw a jewfish star on the building and she assume that it was scynegoch and she ran her car into a black here israelate congregation she is offended by a here israelate simple upfront according to a policereport said yes i did not on purpose she repeatedly describe the building as the israel school adding the driver also made a reference to quote her people back in pasta now is the white houseman comments on any of thus of course not they bands the oppressor opressmatrix the white house well build an entire is lamafobia campaign of of the evil stabbing of a palistinian kid and his mom in michigan and then meanwhile they will never mention a woman driving her car into a school because she thought that it was jewfish school i room they will never mention a sixty nine year old jewfish man being killed on the street in thousand oaks because you is flying in is daily flag he is all of that blows up the narrative meanwhile over night a brooklet man was arrested for attacking religious juice with pepperspray you're some the idea here is being a re this a of person being arrested apparently it was a female who is attacking news of pepperspray in brooklet sh had a knife and pepperspray on her when she was arrested meanwhile poster describes her going a obit further now the not s strong posters of kidnap children they're actively attacking people who tried yo stop them or asked them questions about it here was som video from the streets of new york again this woman belongs that she has full impunity she is a member of an impressed clash which means that she can not a all people on the street she is a we for sully fine do not worry it is allies all fine he man o pressor oppress metrics that is the way that this work and this is the way by the way that coalition is built the coalition is the supposed coalition of the pressed and it makes up three categories you have the actual full scale members of commons as it turns out for example according to the can telegraph the people organizing the marches these giant marches in brain are members of commons mohammedc bathmat callas ha for as a founder of the muzzle association of brain one of six groups that organized the onion march sat for nonmember eleventh he is a former common chief the former comose chief and he is organizing this things you have the actual commosnix those people are companies by the civilization fellow travellers they are companies by the other members of the supposedly oppressed case and those people are company by the cowards and the cowards are people who just a moral equivalent tall i take no sides i am a moral sophistic i do not know who is right i do not know who is wrong ism not going to ism just going to say that i wish that piece rained on earth the miscongeniality version of world for policy that does not matter of terra are killed people and then people are tempting to killterrist is all the same to mean i just do not known ism just i just i ism ism smart enough that i can comment on the situation ism smart enough that i can inject myself into the situation but ism certainly ism not is enough to actually lakeside all i know is the genocide on all sides is wrong of course trying to pretend the we do not know exactly who what you are doing when you say the outsides are tempting commatgenicide everybody can see exactly what you are doing when you do this you sudosophisticate idiot to it is truly amazing this commission and this commission in the end just reinforces that same oppressor oppressed matrix that is under mining western civilization that is what it is and that oppressor press matrix is riding hard to try to convince hoiden now to separate off from his support for israel that is the goal the goal is to under cot america support for israel by sitting this matrix this oppressed matrix will get to that in just one second first as a daily wirelessener you are not just informed you are engaged to value freedom and personal responsibility this is why you need to check out medicare share is a community based approach to health care that lines up with the principles you believe in you are value's matter and with medicare your healthcare dollars will not be used for medical procedures that do not line up with your beliefs medicare is the highest rated health care sharing ministry with a thirty year proven track record it is not health insurance it is a community over four hundred thousand believers vomited to carrying and sharing with one another members save up to fifty percent or more on their monthly health care coss member satin faction surveys show they medicare much more than health insurance why well because it works for limited time daily wirelesseners or see that one hundred and fifty dollar gift card when they join medicare to find out more go to medicare dot come slashed that is medicare dot come slash ben terms and conditions to apply we all know the shortcoming of the america health insurance system one way that you can end around that and get the carry you need is to join up with medicare the highest rated health care sharing ministry with a thirty year proven track record go check him out right now that is medicare dot come slashed and get a one hundred and fifty dollar gift card when you join okas the this interjectional coalfish an the pressed matrix they are now tempting to utilize whatever levers they have nor to push jobidon to abandon israel this is woman woman the congressmen from new york and the the idea here is that if jobidon does not abandon israel can accost i the election now that is not what the poling a to suggest jobidon has had very bad poling debt for months at this point years actually some of the worst poling data that we can see but there's an attempt to hang this on what is going on the willies now is poll numbers have gone down consists slightly since the beginning of this war the reason being whenever there is a war people do not war people get mad at war people do not conflagrations and they blame the present in power when that sort of thing happens to be connected with their policy but the idea that it is because their people who are upset with israel that they are now moving away from jordan what toward donate trump the most proisral present america history that's a bazar read of the data but that's exactly what the conn what a pressed matrix is attempting to achieve here here is job woman a moral moron cut this war cotton reelection yes in con and let me just be very clear is one thing to support israel this the ours has always done and we will continue to do it is the other thing to never a whole israel acamnibole they are behave here whether it is related to the occupation the open they intrusting at is goo a the war cross that are taken paceriht now during this siege i man israel is very clear from the beginning we an a come off water fool electricity they use white phosphorus y turns of collective poison that is what is happening right now o k that is a lie that is a lie he says they are there using white phosphorus no there is been no evidence that they are using wite phosphorus when he suggests that america is not con c holding israel to account on human right to israel is being as meticulous as it can by in one world's most densely populated aria that is honey combed underneath with terratunnels is is why israel is for example not simply bombing the entire place from the airts white israel is currently opening humanitarian corridors and commits attempting to close them is really trips are being attacked as they open humanitarian corridors to loud people to leave the north of the gosestrip where there engage in a battle and move toward the south of the gosestrip that video is widely available he can see it here is some of the tat ya yo can see israel is actually opening full streets that they stop the coming for hours at a time to allow huge convoys of people to lea the areas where they are attacking and move sou many of them a carrying white flags because they want to be seen as civilians and according to man woman they do not care about that israeliscomiting humor a gat the lie that somehow what is happening here to obit jobidon's pullnumbers are chiefly because jobidon is supporting israel that is something that is being promoted very very high by people tho hate the state of israel really hate it according to political fear's our going paramount among democrats of our president jobidons standing one year out of the twenty twenty for election now some us good predicted that he was a weak candidate given the fact that he is in rock togeneerian who can early make sentences out of his face how given the fact that the economy has been on a rough ride for the last three years given the fact that we have wild conflagrations n not only the middle east but eastern rope and maybe in the south china it turns out people do not chaos and join who promised solidity has guaranteed even more chasing from t e policy far more case from s policy than tonal trump things were way better in twenty nineteen than the are in twenty twenty three in everybody basically feels that of get that has nothing to do with jobidon being pro israel in this conflict it again the radicals in the party our tempting to say that if your coalition is the about coalition of twenty twelve namely the quote duo dispossessed in a few white liberal ladies we thenyou ever get that poison us possess together and theory way to do that is to dump israel off the side o the boat a goring to politico within the party there are merging concerns o support for israel an its war against commons is weakening him among keep parts of his parties base america attitudes are shifting quickly about the conflict and a lock could change between it now and next nonmember by the way they are not shifting quickly about the conflict the america people are behind israel in the conflict by every available pulling metric a series of your times poles will be sundae s likely to super charge the worries mong some democrats about to political fall out from bids handling of the conflict those poles showed biding trailing former president trump and five of the six battle ground states among registered voters for policies weak spot for bison the times poles show registered voters the battle ground states trust trump over bison managing israel passing an conflict by margin of eleven per centare points voters hundred thirty years old much the brought electric prefer trump to manage the issue by ten points swing state voters under thorite are only backing by and by a single per centime went per the time serve now question in what world is the america people favor in trump over bide in the idle east in anti israel point of view ism n a need you to explain that line to me on on a carts explain to me how if the america people back trump the most prove israel president in america history over jobidon who as been cant wish washing on the issue up until now how is that a how is that are rough region pro israel feeling but again the zealand up it is all a man fractured crisis inside the be ad ministration which is presumably while you have members of the take department hour now leaking internal memos critic criticizing began tailing of the israel commons war the memo that was again leaked by low level state department staffers who should all be fired because ones got if you run an executive branch department and your local staff's are leaking things they should be on the on i lament lines to morrow that is the way works the metal has two see requests that t you us support sense fire and the a balance its private in public messaging toward israel including errand criticisms of his rally military tactics and treatment of palsinians the us generally prefers to keep private the document says we must publicly criticize israel violations of international forms such as a failures limit offense of operations to legitimate military targets if first of all that is a late israel is targeting legitimate military targets please name the civilian only aria that israelicenting that is not the way that israel is pursuing this war again if they war israel has complete air superiority i cannot repeated enough if israel wish to turn the entire place to glass they certainly have the military fire pow r to do they have not done we because they do not wish to do and then of course they say when israel support settler violins and legal land seizures or i play successive use of portsagainst palstinians we must communicate this publicly that that this goes against our america values to israel does not act with impunity again these sorts of to send memos are being issued to try and craft and narrative which is that biding is losing support internally meanwhile the the white house is apparently doing nothing about actual procomas news impeding the flow of military weaponry last night process protestors broke into the port of to coma in an attempt to stop the shipment of military weaponry here is some of the tape we helot the pins where the federal authorities and these a protestors block the port to homo on needs protest what they said was a militaryship down for israel during the twelve hour protest some people marched in circle some was palstinian flag some held up signs that is had no a fort israel seaside now and resist until return which of course the call for the destruction of the state of israel protestors believe the ship is transporting military equipment and weapons to israel if that is in fact the case than these are people are obstructing the function of the federal governments which means there engaging in criminal activity are any of them going prosecuted by the by administration ism still waiting speaking of which is any one in we prosecuted for defacing the wite housemates to the day after that giant protest over the weaken the white house gates were stained with bloody red hand prints this is called passionate protest by the journalists good news they left their finger prints directly on the wall so you could rust all of those people if these are right wingers who done this all than would be entail presumably without council because that is the way this works if however you are a procomas terrorist supporter and you put your and you put your hand prints ore bloody red paint hand prints on actual federal property then everything is totallyifinme again again as long as you identify with the right people you can do whatever the hell that you want meanwhile this is having some impact on how the bide administration is approaching the israel comas issue jo biding i s now raising the possibility of a tactical pass in gozofighting with benjamin intonate now israel is engaging in taxicab pauses anybody who's been watching this conflict closely crania lowly the way that i have you understand there certain hours of the day where there are nobomings and israel has multiple tons galoot announced were not bobbinging ten in two now is the time freed move out israel does this lot sitting ow who himself sad in an interview they be seensquo as far as taxicab little pauses an our here an hour there we have have them before i suppose we will check the circumstances in order to enable good to sanitarian goods to come in ore our hostages individual hostages to leave i but if if the bid administration s putting pressure on israel to basically leave comas in power with sense files then that is going to be a ridiculous failure on the part of the bide administration and that of course is the entire goal of the media at this point en john curly was pushing this yesterday here is the the spokes person for the national security ministration suggesting at that it is now who should consider quod unquote tactical pauses ironuan understand what that means with the present en e a a who we were told that there was a good deal of discussion about a patent for tactical pauses in the fighting again i for hat a ten belief in all of that up the did that come of but what is a new my a be dead yo wat can you tell this certainly did come up it was absolutely want the top things that the president wart to tack primesnen ya who about this is something we believe needs to be explored need to be considered and when to just talking about one pass we believe that there is probably value in multiple tactical pauses a discreet time discreet geography for discreet purposes an we still want we still want a pursue that and we believe that this is a conversation that we have hadn't recent days with these rallies and we continued o we know wherein to continue to have those conversations going forward were the beginning of this conversation we do not think we are at the end neon you've know what you think the an looks then by line is this whatever the united states has to say about tactical pauses israel is not going to leave composing place they are just not going to it is not a possibility there is complete unification with in israel and military power to get ridcomoss is what they are going to do and what isogon to come after is probably is rally military control of the gossistrip even if some other power is put in municipal control of the area israel is going to have the ability to put it is military assets on the ground in order to fear it out future terrorism israel never for the rest fits history under go what just happened again any government that would allow that to happen we'll not last very long in the state of israel if all this pestering is designed for the arab states or for domestic radicals inside their own coalition is under at a certain point is ben a lot of talk on both sides of the isle of the worst last few years about throwing the radicals out of your coalition the democrats are still coddling the radicals including heresies to leave at certain point i might behoove you to get rid overshoe of to we but from your coalition if you are a democrat we actually believes you have some moral leg to stand on in just one big will talk about these twenty twenty four election and could be the closest in a generation told rely on

house majority for forty years with an average margin more than eighty seats then when the see ament thirty and nineteen fifty for n retained it until nineteen eighty this year demo cats told on to the senate and the republican majority the house are both at rest while poles point to a close race for the white house me right now it is the closest we have been in terms of sort of elect total balance in years and years and years and years which means that the future of the country does rest honor razors edge which is why y if donate trump is the hominy and if dona trump continues to be at the enter of headlines a chatter entirely about him and not about yobidon its going to be a serious prom republicans i know republicans wright now are looking at the polling numbers there saint jobidon is supervulnerable and that is true he is unbelievably vulnerable right now there look at these polling numbers the tho trump up in the swing states their saying trump could beat him and that is also try trump could beat him that also relies an y new cycle were donate trumps absent from the new cycle the great weird toxic charm of dona trump is that the very thing that makes his base love him is the thing that makes independent hate him the more he is seen the less he is liked if ye ran tobidon's campaign from twenty twenty had president again on fortunately all the headline yesterday we are all about him in court again according to the same poles that are trunk trump up in the swing states if he is convicted in any of the cases that are currently up in court in there four of them if he is convicted in any of those cases his poll numbers are going to drop wright now according to the our time's pole again ism only sending that folks that the exacts in one trowing trump very very durable against don in all the swingstates the poles found that for the most part true is politically surviving the criminal charges against in before voting in the get p primary he leads mister bison by between four and ten per septic points and five of the six battle ground states surveyed and in a sixth state witsconsin bison is only up a vital bit the core of true aren't romaines has receive skill at managing the economy however if the former president is convicted and sentence around six per cents of voters across arizona georgia a michigan ovate pennsylvanian wisconsin say they would switch their votes to widen that would be enough potentially to decide the election it would presumably suppress some prove republican votes if you look at the pulling is to hell bison would far against all the republican candidates at this point generic republican generic publican a personwin thonameust a generic republican is up fifteen points on biding enemata sixteen in georgia eighteen in arizona fourteen in michigan pennsylvania plus fourteen wisconsin plus fifteen an other words the more media coverage any republican candidate receives the less tell they do against widen which is why trump right now is up pretty solidly on biding in eat georgia prison a minivan pennsylvania the mantis is only up slightly but his up slightly in all of those states and hailed who again is the most generic republican of the generic republicans is up six enemata three in georgia seven and arizona ten and michigan ten an pennsylvania thirteen an wisconsin if this electability argument is going to be made it going to come down to on trump's behalf ism going to be discipline which again is a very riff case for true to make and that was made purely positive yesterday when he is testifying himself in this case is bazar and ridiculous case it is it is ta stupid case being brought bilaticia names againstonnal trump uncivil part for fraud now again it is not a criminal case which means that all she has to show is preponderance of the evidence chasing have to show damages that is wit is crazy about this case shousn' nave to show that the down trump by inflating his real estate assets stole money from anyone or hurt anyone just test to show the g in floated the value is real estate assets and that people relied upon that in their decision making even if they made money well that is a ridiculous case it also happens to be the case that again if the scam is put trump at the center of the attention cycle and then just folk is every came on him if that is the democratic strategy it is working and y can work just because that is he democrat strategy does not mean that will not work here is trump yesterday going off on the sort i heragain what hes saying here is not wrong the problem is that if america are focusing on trumps legal foibles they are not focussing i the see the trump is saying they should focus on a true is saying focus ism job being a bad president and then of course he is in court and that is a big story of course it he is the formal president of the united states and he is facing down four criminal trials in a civil trial bike that is that is that is not great for the up coming year i can sympathize with trump i can don't name to trumps legal defense fund in cases this and i can still think that maybe it is a dangerous move politically for re publicans to nominate the guy who is likely to spend the next year in court talking about he is legal troubles allowing the media to nibble there attention from jobidans consistent record of failure over too donate trump and his legal issues trump yesterday began his testimony an court by delivering a series of broadsides against put the court and the prosecution he is set of the judge ism sure the judge will rule against me because he always rules against me that is true he told the judge hen none nothing about me and then he referred to a tits names is quit this political hack back there again all o this is all o this is correct also a donate trump could not stop himself from rashly giving credence toothy charges against him for example one point he claim that he personally intervened to talk about the asset value of some of his assets which is something he is been trying to layaway from his trying to say the basically his lawyers this it was not him he is not responsible was one of the things that the judge in this case kangaroo who is a motivated left winger that angry is trying to do is removed true from control of his own crumpanys t and find him to on or fifty million dollars jo the lot of money even if you are donate trump trump again putting him on the stand is a dangerous move obviously it resulted in the the judge basically threatening to toss trump off the stand according to politico testimony by donate trump in a civil fraud rob only quickly to sender into bitter sniping as trumps discursive answers an powers prompted the judge t repeatedly admonish him he spent four hours on the witness stand he lost his temper and attack the judge railing against the person will decide the fate of his business umpire and suggesting that one of his pretrial rulings was very stupid he says the terrible thing you have done nothingabout me trump's primary defense which he has offer publicly since the start of the trial is that financial statements contain very very powerful disclaimers and there fore were not intended for use by bangs or insurers but due and then in the middle of his testimony he suggested that actually the man's may have relive on it now again the case is completely bunk it is garbage it should not be brought in the first place and it is letitia name's being malicious as all hell in bringing this thing also when your inthmittale legal case no matter the grounds upon whinchat is brought just as a lawyer good be extremely careful and how you handle those charges politically trump can be totally in the right and legally he can still put himself in dire jeopardy this is going to be a continuing problem for trump and this is going to be a continuing and again i wish it were not but it is and that is that is just a reality again the focus right now if you are if you are re publican should be ism the failures of jobidin but if john trumps can be prom here is drums lawyer clean a had a losing it on the judge yesterday again she is not wrong i men from the judge who already free o german hat mi yin committed ride before we eaten a in si i quarter a nit ere ti here whet he hat

left to suporfrisr but he is just a unable candid he is a bad candidate he is been in the low forties or high thirties in terms of his approval rating for months at this point mean that just is what it is the presidential job approval rating according to real car politics right now he is under water by about fifteen points and that is not a major increase from where he was as as late as jury of twenty twenty two at that point who is eighteen points under water he is been consistently under watering from sis aprualrating since literally august of twenty twenty one it is now nonmember of twenty twenty three would that the speaks is the fact that the president of the united states very we candidate avid axe rod who is of course he chief political adviser to brokobama is all maybe they should not run him maybe in my concerns i ma clear i think ins been a great past i think he is then thinks that a generational we will have generational in act an importance i think he is been honorable in the office a have have not be od things to say but as have set for by a copy us now the this not a for him is is not a political its aquarium and you can see that in this to in tit just lot of concern about the age issue and and that is something that i think he means to a ponder just tho a check and say is this the right thing a to do a that would be on a good question there from avid axe rod what hilarious those that the democrats for believers are well that just means we have to work partner here as the ladies of the view sangs democrats were you do not the approval ratings

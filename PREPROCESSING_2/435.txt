welcome to the ubermsciencescience bacon and do supermen and on a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor acyl delete doctor delete is duckboard certified in family medicine and city medicine and practices out of a clinic inkansas and viatelle medicine he provides full spectrum medicine including hormone health preventive medicine obstetrics which is the branch of medicine and surgery concerned with child birth and the care of women giving birth and pediatrics i first learned about doctor delete from podcast of all things and was immediately struck by the breadthand depth of his knowledge on all things hormones and hormone optimization as you will see very soon to day doctor delete can teach you how to optimize your hormones using behavioral tools nutrition exercise base tools supplementation and hormone therapies if those are appropriate for you there are many professionals out there including many medical doctors of course talking about hormone health what really sets doctor delete apart from the pack is his ability to understand how the different factors that i describe before nutrition supplementation exercise in hormone therapies how those interact with one another and the safest and most rational ways to approach hormone optimization during today's episode you will learn how to optimize your hormones notes testosterone and estrogen but also prolactin and other hormone pathways that impact your mood mental health and physical health doctor delete is also an avid educator about hormones and other aspects of health he does this on zero cost to consumer platforms such as integral and other social media on instrogram he is coo delete m d that is k i l e g i l l e t t no e at the end m d calgelette m d on instregram and he is delete health on all other platforms including lictor twitter you to ticktock and face book if you go to his instergram or his other social media you will learn a lot about hormone health about the latest science impacting of city and metabolic health he is a wealth of knowledge and again he is providing all that information at zero cost to you the consumer what you are soon to hear is a conversation between me and doctor delete about all things hormones and hormone health and hormonoptimization we dive do into mechanisms but we are clear to establish what eh word or set of concepts mean if you have no background in biology or even if you do i am sure that you will come away with a wealth of valuable knowledge we also talk about specific protocols related again to least factors nutrition supplementation and wear appropriate hormone replacement therapy i know there is a lot of interest about these topics doctor delete is very thorough about addressing both male and female issues and addressing hormone health for people at all stages of life ism sure that you will come away from this episode with the same impression that i did which is that doctor delete is a n extraordinarily clear communicator and that he has tremendous compassion for his patients and that he has a deep love of understanding biology and medicine in ways that can benefit you before we begin with to day's episode i want to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero nostoc consumer information about science and signs related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens t lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand an twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigrens once or twice to day is that it helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body with out lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitemend three k too there are ton of stand ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the fivfree travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before in this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium in potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element doc come slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element doc come slash supermen to day's epic it is also brought to us by inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzed that data from your blood and liana to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals have long been a believer in getting regular blood work don for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long term health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test there are a lot of blood and dean test out there but a major issue with many of them is that you get numbers back about nobles of hormones metabolic factors lipids et camera but you soft know what to do with that information inside tracker has solved that problem by creating a personalized dashboard you take your blood and or your dean test you get the results back and were certain values might be too high or too low for your preference you can click on that and it will direct you immediately to lifestyle factors nutrition supplementation et camera that can help you bring those numbers back into the ranges that are ideal for you it not only gives you information about where your health stands it gives you directives as to how to improve your health if you to try inside tracker go to inside tracker dot calm slash supermen to get twenty percent off any of inside trackers plans that inside tracker dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off and now for my discussion about hormone health and optimization with doctor child delete doctor delete welcome thank you for having well ism superexcide to talk to you because i found out about you on a podcast and it immediately became clear that you are an encyclopedia of knowledge about hormone health for men and for women across the life stand i have many many questions but before we dive into those questions it'd love to just get a little bit of your background in terms of your medical training and what your particular orientation is toward treating your patience and how do you think about this the whole landscape that we call hormone health what is a hormone a how do you invasion a people managing their hormones you you just can a filling a few of those blanks for us i think a lot of people would appreciate it absolutely ism duel board certified and family medicine and obesity medicine have kind of tailored my training an order to provide what i call a balance to preach to total health which includes body mind and soul give recently saw a podcast with job organ and mister beasts and job asks a mister beast how do you become such an amazing you tuber and have all these and great clicbat videos and how did you become good at it and it turns out you just became obsess when he was a teenager and that is essentially how have tailored my education as well i become obsessed with optimal human performance their body their mind and even their spirit i tended medschool at the university of canvas which is ism one of the few medschools that still emphasizes full spectrum c ere they emphasis exercises medicine the emphasize food is medicine of which always active in both of those interest groups and residency i was active in a lot of a mindfulness curriculum and then also things walk with the talk where you emphasize preventative medicine that something that we have kind of got away from and that in each led me to hormone health i did not rally start as hormone health but it is a very important component of health in general that many people do not emphasize great well this idea of prevented medicine i think is starting to really take hold an the general population especially given the events of the last few years people realize that they are showing up to health challenges at a bunch of different levels and with some people feeling very robust other people feeling back on their heels when some one comes to you as a patient what are some of the first things that you want to know about them i man obviously you don't now their blood pressure you want to know i something about their mental health and family history but in terms of hormone health what are the sorts of probe questions that you ask him and what a you looking for and i ask this because it'd people to be able to ask some of these very same questions for themselves e when you do a physical exam and a history you have a lot of different parts you have your history of present illness if they have a complaint may be the patient does not have a complaint in that case things their social history in their family history are extremely important because that gives you an insist in into their genetics and insight into their common health patients will tell me ism doing o k but it helps to ask them well how are you now what say the patient is fifty how are you now verses when you were twenty and what has changed have got the question a lot how do you get your doctor to order a better labor up or to even include your basic hormones and there is no magic answer to that but what really helps as you tell them my energy is not as good as it used to be my focus is not as good as it used to be my athletic performance is not as good as it used to be you do not have to have a pathology in order for a lab to be indicated you just need to have that pertinent symptom this can be really healthful because for many people the the idea of getting a blood has to look at their home hormones just seems such an enormous hurdle to get over many doctors will not prescribe them i and would you say that it is using the approach you just described that it is equally effective for men and women or do you find that ism for one reason or another that men and women have different challenges in an advantages in trying to access their deeper hormone data yet slightly different i with women there is a lot for objective data if there having minstrel irregularities or if there going in if there not having a period if there having too heavy of periods than those are things that they talk about very frequently frequently with their doctor men are more hesitant men really one to now wit their testosterone is but they at the same time they really do not wan to tell their doctor how their libido is or how their energy is because it it is almost a they feel less masculine or they feel less a guy when they say that even if they are just talking to their doctor about it i think that that raise a really important point which is that the whole discussion around hormone health is a bit of a barbed wire topic because in many ways when we hear the word hormone we think testosterone and estrogen we think notions of masculinity in femininity and of course testosterone and estrogen our present in all sexes right all comes also backgrounds a and just ta varying degrees and rations but it also raises all these issues about sexual health that it is kind of interesting cause i surrounded by medical doctors in my lab at stamford and the more physicians that i surround myself with the more open is the discussion around sexual health and reproductive health but in the general population i think some of these topics are a little bit taboo or against kind of barbed wire and i think that people are seeking a lot of this information on you two band through communities that may or may not be very educated about the actual biology along those lines you no we could probably assume that hormones are changing across the life span right a certainly from from childhood a in puberty onward if if you would it'd love to just go to take a snapshot of what you think everybody should be thinking about or doing to optimize their hormone health male or female in the let us ay in their twenties and then maybe we could migrate that to their thirties and forties but before that could you just tell us what every one should be doing for their hormone health from puberty onward em the low of diminishing returns apple doing a little amount of what i call life style inter mentions over a long period of time is going to be far more helpful or efficacious than doing a lot and than doing nothing or doing a lot than doing nothing i talk about the big six pillars the two strongest ones are likely diet and exercise for hormone health specifically resistance training is particularly helpful for diet colonic restriction can be particularly helpful especially with the epidemic of metabolexand drove that is continuing to onto in this country and in developed countries in general those are the two most powerful number one an number two are diet and exercise for the last for i have a little bit of a liberation there's stress and stress optimization that has to do with tortoise all that has to do with your mental health that has to do with social health and collect of health of your family as dealt when you are a member of a family or even a very close friend trying to a achieve optical health together very important it is the same thing with nicotine action same thing with hormone optimization if you do it as a household unit it is far more helpful after stress you have sleep optimization sleep is extremely important a especially for monicondral health as well and then you have sunlight which encompasses anything that is outdoors you move more you have cold exposure you if he would exposure that sunlight and enlist one is spirit that is kind of the body mind and soul if you have all the other five in other dial then completely but you do not have your spiritual health whatever you believe and that is going too profoundly impact your body and your mind is well and we are defiling in touching to this notion of spiritual health because i think for some people that might a draw connotations of of certain things that may or may not be accurate but i know a number of academic laboratories that are focus on this an a number of of not just a functional messing clinics but a research cleaned and hospitals throughout the country that are achieving some really interesting data locust in in people that are quite sick but in healthy people are trying to further o tor myself we will definably touch back to that it if you a be kind as at maybe give us a obit more detail about some of these other airs when people here diet i immediately think o a now we get into the a the combat around vegan plant bases carnivore at camera but i think that mix general view of this is that most people should probably be eating as few highly process foods highly portable foods as possible which does not mean eating foods that do not taste good of course but what other sorts of things you recommend in the realm of diet and then i also want to know about colonic restriction because my understanding is that a cleric surplus cannactualy support certain hormones test estrone how does one combine cleric restriction and still optimize a hormones but what would you say is it a really terrific way to think about and approach diet diet should be an individualized approach if you have a a car each cars made different and requires a different sort of fuel whether it is a race car whether it is a devil truck they have different fuels for different performance outcomes if your trying to tost something or you have trying to go fast it is the same way with athletes it is a pretty well studied the more infra work out cars ultra long distance athletes take and generally do better i think they have studied this en cyclists quite often it also depends on yourgenetics you can have a genetic polymorphism and you metabolize cars and sugar butter even when they are unopposed by fiber how does one tat determine weather not they have such a polymorphism man have i'manominivor i i do eat some high quality meats not in huge quantities but i also vegetables and starch as i feel fine have never done in elimination diet may i think i did a very low carbide at once and all it gave me was a lot of psoriasis and poor sleeps i backed off i probably did not do it correctly a but i know a lot of people hat do quite well on on a very low harbor's eurocorpdiet ye particularly those who are at risk of cancer because you have less a glue cost that can be easily uptake into cells and then also people with auto in diseases a they tend to do well on our on lower carbide at ye but ye as far as the how do basically you can use your bilepheed back how your feeling to guess what you tolerate well or you can just get genetic testing which can be fairly expensive but most of all it requires my physician or some one who knows how to interpret the test accurately and if someone had the means or the a would you say that getting regular blood testing is a good idea a d if what is regular blood testing is it every three months is every six months of course the back drop of of life is changing to stress levels et camera ye every three to six months for preventative purposes at times you need blood tests et a faster frequencies than that and then you should also get a blood test when you are fasting and when you are not fasting if you are looking for damage to the beach you want you do not just look at low tide you look at high tie and you see what is happening at high tide is well it is a great way to put it and interns of a general recommendations around exercise in ism of the mind based on the data that have seen that almost everybody should were everybody should be getting hundred and fifty to a hundred eighty minutes minimum of his own to cardie per week that and of could continue a while having a conversation but with if one were to exert any more effort it would have a hard time getting the words out at least that right for carry of vascular health in general brain health and must scellital health plus resistance exercise is that more o less the contour of what you recommend yet tit is more or less the contour the more you are doing yours own too carry of vascular exercise the slightly less important a long duration of cleric restriction is interesting and that brings us to cleric restriction it is very clear that cleric restriction can allow one to lose weight it this is a the classic kick we i see o calories in calories out we are not disputing calories in calories out somehow that always has to be stated fifty times o in any forum because of whatever follows people i think a will anchor to and assume that we do not mean that but i know you and i both agree on calories in calories out as a fundamental law of therm of dynamics but it is clear to me that base on what have read that when one is in a slight cleric surplus that hormone's testosterone can be optimize but is that true for somebody who is showing up with excessive body fat how does this all work because body fat is manufacturing insides that convert to stosteron to enteron another words how does some one know if they should use cleric restriction or avoid cleric restriction ye here is had a parse that out before i dell than ta the details a bit more i should s hey has aboard certified o obesity medicine physician obviously the laws of thermodynamic supply and then in addition to that there is nothing special about intermittent fasting or chloric restriction or exercise when it pertains to losing body weight in general when you do lose weight about thirty three percent of that clean body mass and about ten per cent of fat cells atipocells are actually body mass as well because it has prolines in water and thins that in it to the reason for exercise and the reason for chloric restriction in general including interment and fasting is health reasons that is how you increase your health span it is not necessarily going to make the weight on the scale change but that does not matter is much it is been fairly well studied in both mice and human is much easier to study and mice that is a precursor to our six types of people the ones that care about my studies in the ones that care about human studies but a you calorically restrict mice by forty per cent then am they can have improved testosterone parameters but only if there will be start and it appears to be that same way in humans as well the easy way to think about it is if your be or you have metabolexandrom chloric restriction will improve your testosterone there has been a study and they talk about all these studies in a systematic review from the man clinic proceedings in march of last year an a they note that there is a study in young healthy men and they calorically restrict them and their testosterone does decrease if you are young and healthy and you do not have metabolexandrom than chloric restriction will likely decrease your testosterone that clarifies a lot for me and i i believe it will clarified lot for other people is well and ism delighted that you pointed out this distinction about intermittent fasting not being the only way to achieve chloric restriction there are a number of a young a healthy or older healthy a people i know who using intermittent fasting even if they are not trying to lose weight for a couple of reason some believe that it might extend life spend i think there still that still a bit of an open question it is a bit of a hard experiment to do because the controlsione want to be in the control group as i say done me there right exact afbaudience exactly and the other a feature of it the sylobitrickey is that many people interment fasting because of the mental of facts the clarity of mind that they feel during fasting the increase pleasure in eating when they finally do eat am and here ism referring to interment fasting of the sort where eating windows a anywhere from eight to twelve hours a they not extended fasts of twenty four hours or more the question therefor is for the healthy am lean enough person right nonobest a person is intermix fasting a bad idea in terms of homo own health is oscillating between this period of of confess in famine within a twenty four hours a problem if one is getting sufficient galleries to make can weight if there in a cleric maintenance then it is not going to be a it is not onto be deliveries as not going be bad further hormone health there is a couple different hormones that we can talk about we can talk about to testosterone we can talk about d g e which you usually go hand in hand another we can also talk about growth hormone which is not a steroid hormone but it is a peptized hormone it is a a chain of prolines i mean acids that are put together instead of a steal think of sterile hormones is coming from collected all intermontane fasting you do get a little spike in growth hormone after you eat but you also get a huge spike in growth hormone a morse significant less negligible spike overnight and that is improved if you are intermit and fasting it is probably gin a help your growth hormone and subsequently i g f one levels which will help more in older h groups than younger h groups and i the et dinner for me that means sometime around six or seven o'clock sometimes eight o'clock i can fess last night tons working late i ate i pretty big i why basing my only meal the day at ten o'clock that is a rare thing for me can i still achieve a high degree of growth hormone output if i lull say i avoid food in the two to three hours before going to sleep where does one have to be very deep into a fast in order to achieve this the increase in growth hormone there is still pretty good growth hormone output even if you eat two or three hours before you sleep it is just the law of diminishing returns the longer you go you get slightly more and slightly more it and i know a number of people think of growth hormone in the context of the exogenous growth hormone i an the fact that that can in some cases be associated with cancers have been asked many times before can the increasing growth hormone from things saunas are interment fasting cause levels of growth hormone that are high that they cause cancers i my impulses to say no that doesn't hos it is not i likely to happen but i i should probably verify that statement with you yes quite unlikely i think about growth hormone and especially i g f one the is artily an i g f one and i g f to but i think about it in terms of endocrine i g f one mostly i g f one that is a synthesized deliver and released in the in the liver first as i g f one that is released a classically an example of this would be your i f one levels increase after resistance training or exercise and that is more merocrine or autolysin and they have more local action that i g f one it is pretty well studied that if you just give people i g f one it is not going to at ta pays geologic levels it is not an improve their body composition however that beef one that is apocrine and merocrine just working in those local tissues and muscles is likely part of the reason why you get a improved body composition response after exercise i my an ism just to clarify for me and for for others what can we say or the major functions of give one an beef too that are distinct from just growth hormone are they just give the active form o growth common the found of the them the pickaxe end of the of the of the assembly in they have a much longer duration of action i believe the half life of beef one is several days almost a week whereas growth hormone has an extremely fast half life of only hours growth hormone acts a significantly on the liver to produce beef one it is a it is around in the serum in the blood long enough to where it is producing an effect a pretty much all the time very interested when then there other pillars stress a yen we have talk about about stress on this podcast before in tools for managing stress am sleep obviously is a big one i i think a know if nothing else i will either put people to sleep with my podcast ism certainly not this one but my my sol episodes or ism fully convinced people that sleep is the foundation of mental and physical health and and performance are there any aspects of hormone optimization that can improve sleep i know sleep can improve hormone optimization but are there any aspects of hormone optimization that can improve sleep and for people that are suffering from this common syndrome of going to sleep in that waking of it three or four in the morning we know that can be associate with depression but are the any form hormonal indications that might lead to that kind of situation ye there is three big ones the first one is not supercommon but it is a very direct correlation if you have a growth hormone deficiency a true deficiency whether you are a dull or a child than your sleep is likely going to be effected in a lethe your a child with growth hormone deficiency once that is replaced with therapy you are sleep is gingko get significantly better the second one that is a very common scenario is if you are having what is called to face motor symptoms of menopause or f as motor symptoms of anderpause which are also applicable and that is where you are progestigenic activity you are a remain projestigens are project one and then pregnant alone and then five ala three ala project iron is those manufactured in the body they are manufactured in a few places in men there manufactured som in the testes in the late excels in women they are manufactured in the ovaries until menopause and in they are also manufactured in the adrenal glance a if you are in if your are a drinapauzle where your penal glands are still working fairly well usually still have a decent amount of protest run around and this can be measured to a after bananas women make progesterone from there a overs the sorry from their drink glance if that progesterone crosses the good rain barrier especially if it is five land three algor do it is modified a little bit then it is both a gala against a which help sleep just gala does game minobuteric acid the main inhibitory narrow transmitter of which lots of things work on alcohol works on gala as well gala lenten also works on gala my grain medicines many of them work on gala then i aspens and also non benzol of example of a benzol a buzanics an example of a a non benzol would be ambient those all work on gala gab is also helped by the progestigenic activity as well that is why a lot of women and menopause feel their sleep is much worse es because they have lower activity of those protestations is hat end for men in called andrepaus a testosterone is that also one of the causes of poor sleep testosterone candy forsleep but my thirdconario a is actually if a man begins t r t then they develop poor sleep because of sleep apnea it drastically raises the risk that somebody is going to have sleep apnea and then a lot of people especially when they first a in the first month or two it puts them into this hyper sympathetic state because they have a overactive aldermen receptors especially after a long time of being hyhpoganatle then they have a a physiologic dose of t r t and that causes the sleep issue itself interesting a have a lot of questions about tear teaches octroi replacement the be a i should just mention that when you say a it increases sympathetic activity a you do not mean a that taking testosterone increases sympathy for others it may in fact do the opposite although it is very clear for my discussions with a my colleagues in on the in the underchronology side and also with a the great doctor robot supulsky that that increasing testosterone merely exacerbates existing features of people the jerks become bigger jerks kind people become even more kind in general a but we will i want to get into tar t in depth butts very interestingly to hear that testosterone replacement there be a increases the risk of sleep apnea and i onto make sure that i ask that is that also the case on people that are using tar t who are not hypocanattle because in the classic situation as somebody is not making enough to stosteron their below three hundred anagrams protest leader on the chart they going to take tarty but many people nowadays it is honest art a taking doses of of testosterone even though they are in that sort of standard range because the range is large because of other symptomatology is that right ye i do love the analogy that doctor supulsky had about monks taking testosterone and making the more and more generous that does appear to be what testosterone usually does is it exacerbates if you will what your previously it is not an a change you as a person but a if you are you gentle before you start testosterone meaning meaning you have normal testosterone and then you star t r t or self administer t r t steroids would very one a look at it then you risk of sleep apnea still goes up in a dose dependent fashion the higher the dose the more risky with the sympathetic and the part sympathetic nervous system the sympathetic is the rider flight nervous system the part sympathetic is the rest in digest if you have too much rider flight and trashcan cause that too than you are not can arrest as well at night i wanted touch on testosterone an women because there is testosterone and women it'd to know where that testosterone comes from which tissues it'd to know whether or not testosterone replacement there b make sense in women ism hearing more and more about women using testosterone and i to know whether or not knowing a woman's teston for her to know her testosterone is of equal less then are more value than knowing offerinstance progesterone an estrogen levels because i think there xylotomous conceptions about the rules of testosteronand women for health optimization testosterone is just as important to know for pathology prevention for example brescanser onto pyrosis estrogen and progesterone are more important to know when you are thinking about women women think that they have such a tiny amount of testosterone because you cut contest it most people test a are testosterone testosterone that is unbound which is by far the the smallest proportion of testosterone any acrogen is bound by lots of different steroid binding proteins but the one s that are mostpertinent are called s h b g or sex hormone binding globular and that binds the androgenic steroid for exampled d h our my hydro testosterone it is associated with prostate enlargement located with man paterbaldness it binds that the most strongly and then it binds testosterone nextmostrongly and then it binds things andiron a done or d a d hydro et p androsterone and then it binds the estrogens the weakest estrodyle if you look at the total amount of testosterone women actually have almost all women not all women but almost all of them have significantly more testosterone the an sterile but it is because it is indifferent measurements esterodile lot o time is yo grams premial a supposed to wanigan s prodesolater women have more testosterone than estrogen and significantly more d than either interesting do women make dihydrotistostro e where does it where does the testosterone come from because they do not have testes most tustostron and women that are premed apple can come from thecasells t h t thcacells or cells in the ovaries that can produce testosterone and a lot of people a have actually heard about hyperthycosis not the term itself but a lot of olympians that a their cromasones a exit their females and they are not taking any w their s li but their am we're sorry their x x o e the their x x there not x we and they have never transitioned or been on any sort of hormone replacement or testosterone but they naturally produce a huge amount of testosterone as much as many men and some of these women i believe there from bosun were band from competing in the olympics in certain distances i believe there band from the four hundred meter and eight hundred meter because their natural testosterone was deemed to be too high said they mistakenly thought that they were using steroids they actually knew they were not using steroids they knew it is their thecasells were just genetically gifted i suppose and they still made them change distances one or two these athletes change to i believe it was the three k or the five k and they still did quite well but it was not their best event interesting that is turning out to be a very interesting and controversial area of this notion of hormone therapies and natural variation and hormones on different cromazomal backgrounds fasting we should i do a whole episode about that cause it is very much of the times a men and women both make t h t it'd to ask about d h t in men so often we here about testosterone in men and for testosterone and being the unbound form of course but i hydrotistostrone where does it come from in men what is the cascade of of events that takes testosterone to dihygrs to stostrne and what a some of the button quote positive and negative effects of of here ism only referring to in eugenist i a i hydrotestostron in fact it'll it'll make it very clear weather or not aim talking about taking something or one's own natural production here we are just i think up in till now we have just been talking about natural production tell us about d h t in men i such a powerful hormonduring development obviously a but what is it what is it doing d h t is a very androgen hormone whether you are talking about d which is a mile a weak androgen or testosterone which is a relatively strong androgen or d h t which is a very strong androgen they bind to the androgen receptor in both men and in women the a effect of all three of those is mediated by the androgen receptor there is a couple different data straddle receptors and a alpha straddle receptors but there is only one aldermen receptor in tryingly it is on the ex cromasol men get there androgen receptor get from their mother women get one androgen receptor get from there father one from their mother often the one that is more sensitive to antigens and p people with piece less that is the one that is active the other one is methylated an inactive can i just pause you on say a sorry tonthroughout but i have to ask this question a before i forget and i know number of people jolly winning have heard that whether not one develops male pattern baldness whether not a a male develops male pattern baldness just to be very precise a you could get some information about that by looking at your mother's father and that would in keeping with what you just described that the excrumizon which of course is handed off through the mother is carrying the a gene setting cod for the number in distribution of these d of these androgen receptors that the h will bine who cause of course i think as you will probably tell us that the h t is a responsible for male pattern baldness and beardgrowth is that right should i look at my grandfather or my mothers side to determine what ism likely to look in terms of my d h t ness is that a word ye it is the best guess that you can make purely from phenom types than you can measure your gene type and a you don't get a better idea of that assuming that it is true male pattern baldness it is related to the get transcription of the androgen receptor i to think of it as how much of this aldermen receptor gene is active ate by any angel if you of an extremely sensitive gene which usually means you have very few c g repeats which is basically just a ascertain c g an coats for a certain amen acid and if you have very few of the repeats than your androgen receptor get works better think of it as a coronary to huntingten's disease where if you have very few of called try nullatide repeats then it is not as severe by the disease but after you get more and more c g repeats which by the way or a in the population you are getting more and more c g repeats a it is a unnatural selection of process that has been one going for a a variety of number reasons but anyway if you have more repeats than that get activate in the idioplasm and move to the nucleus and causes get transcription more often and harlots more often sos that mean that we are seen more hair lost now do to elevated levels of d h t than we were fifty years ago a probably not a the harlots fifty years ago not fifty years ago at five hundred years ago was probably more significant because on average five hundred years ago people were more sensitive to androgen is there is a centrum called androgen intensity insensitivity centrum a i s and that centrum is related to when men who have the copy from their mother who is a carrier they are a r in or androgen receptor in is completely insensitive think of it it does not have it it is not related to the c repeats but think of that a receptor as just not working at all there is a continuum everybody's receptor works a little bit better or a little bit worse and the better your receptor works the more likely you are to have mail paderbaldness to mum out from this but still keeping a a and i on d h t what do you to c all women and all men do to optimize d h t and here ism talking about regardless of age we are still in this from puberty onward phase we have not yet a microdisected out decade by decade which we will do but a what do you to see people do to keep d h t an jack but before you tell us that could you tell us what positive things d h t does when it is in the proper range d h t helps a lot for the same reason why tostostron helps it activates the aldermen receptor one it helps effort feel good it can be motivating that is how it is active in the c ness it also is active in carry of vascular tissue if you look at a some one that has heart failure or if some one has cardiac hypertrophy the level of d h t in matter because it is also binding to the aldermen receptor in the mile cardiac were in the heart itself you think of the classic body builder heart it is an easy example to make they're very thick and muscle their muscle is very strong because their pumping blood often with high blood pressure and that d h t and the testosterone and an d h t derives mastering or wander lone probable and also bind to the heart and they cause even more i perturb are enlargement of that muscle tissue then let say the person stops in their recovering and they are trying to have cardiac modelling which is ware you take a very thick heart and cardiacrymodellings important in a lot of different a cardiac pathologies but if you give them fanasteridor u astride which inhibit the inside that converts testosterone to d h t making less activity at the aldermen receptor gene they have cardiacrymodelling and their heart health improves i see for the nobody builder the typical women or man or a young younger or older a what sorts of thing support d h t and thereby heart health am presume we d h t is involved in some of the other things that testosterone is famous for in both men and women things we bid as you mention a making effort feel goods of motivation drive and a vitality it is a as i guys s be the general phrase what what sorts of thing support d h t what sorts of things create problems for d h t there is lots of dietary changes and supplementation that you are probably doing right now that is effecting your d h t m sitting were every everybody all of the listeners because let us say you have a diet high and plant jolly finals many of those inhibit t inside that converts tostostro to d h t could could you give us an example of of one of those i either in supplementation form or in food form kircumens certain kirkumanoids beginning on the structure well inhibit t some called five algor a ducts that converts tostostro to d h t numeric the numeric black pepper extract a few it is used often to increase bile availability it is also called by purine it is also a five a for a duct in hitter a and on top of that people have different genetic to some people they are five algor a auctions is there is three of them i they are on from a some two three and four i believe but a some of them ere active in the post some of them active in the brain and some of it depends on which tissue their tissue specific invites that depend on how much d h t u convert do you recommend that people avoid kirkman in tunic for that reason and is there any specific recommendations for men verses women if a man or a woman by the way an women a lot of times if you just ask your doctor for a d h t check it is the same unit basin men it is essentially undetectable a you have to em especially if they are on oral contraceptives which is the different topic their h t is very likely undetectable especially if it is for d h t you can measure both a d h t and far d h t but if some one's d h t is already low or if they have somewhat insensitive androgen receptor the genetics or v li style then i recommend they avoid by what available kircumanoids big available numeric black pepper extract and they might be a good candidate for are t creatine create money hydrate and significantly increase the conversion of tostostro to d h t inter thing there is also a lot of really interesting data coming out now about the i the role of of creatine as a brain fuel and maybe even as a conniving cancer over time the date are still on going but some o the studies in humans are pretty impressive at least to me i ism glad you mention the thing about kirkman in blackpepper i wish we would have this conversation and six years ago because it'd the experience of i jumping on the band wagon of the excitement around numeric and i took a numeric supplement of couple capsids of what i thought to be and i think was high quality numeric and have never felt as poor as i did in the subsequent few days flat line of less you say everything that one would want to have in life energy vitality just it was a cliff and i a friend somehow new a that kirkman could inhibit five algor duties that converts to operon to de a she as you pointed out i stop taking it was the only new addition to my diet and supplementation and things bounce back within about three four days but it was remarkable a i felt garbage and it was actually kind of frightening to to experience the the a sharpness of that cliff but i i know that some people numeric for its a anti inflammatory a properties et camera sounds people either need to experiment or a and if they do obviously to approach that with caution any time you ad or remove something younkers talk your your doctor you are a doctor and ism guessing that am if one were to experiment am would you say that most of these effects of things kirkman are reversible as they were in me or is here any potential of permanent damage if people have been taking them for a long time the effects are nearly always reversible when you are talking about five alforoductase in ambition what tumor does but stronger the most common story that we hear is regarding a supplement not a sal palmetto which a lot of older men take for their prostate health or finasteride which you can take for your prostate or your hart or your hair or dotastoride if your heaving side effects on these then it is probably because of a couple different reasons one can be your ratio of antigens to estrogens is off and that needs address another one can be it is inhibiting the conversion of your pogestorown to that other type of progesterone the five ala three ala that we talked about earlier that is helping with your sleep and your brain and your calmness and a that is definitely in effect another one is depending on the type of supplement or me they inhibit different i invites of that five alforaductaes if it is if they're disinheriting one and two then that is going to be a different effect than if they're inhibiting two and three finastoride does two and three sal palmetto does one and two and then do astride does all three the third one is active in the brain and you astride inhibits that third one a little bit weaker in vive but strongly in nitro it is really a hard to parse out you can use big feet back in experimentation i do think with supplements it is safe to experiment the time that it takes to set in is usually about three months the risk of and i anecdotally there is been lots of research published about if postfinastride post finasterides inform is real or fake and it is real but it is one of those things that is a combination of organic and inorganic disease almost canalize libra milo where it is definitely real and there is lots of things that you can do to help with it but it is very unlikely to occur if you stop taking your supplement or medication after you we did effects interesting why certainly feel better when i am taking five grams of creating mono hydrate per day i know most you'll take it for muscle growth and tissue repair and things that sort mainly i think brings water into the muscle tissue et camera but i i take it for the brain facts and also because i to think that it gives me a little bit of a the h t bump that i can actually see in my my blood starts when have done them a i know many people want to avoid the hair loss that can sometimes be associate with t h t levels going too high and have been asked many times does creating mono hydrate cause hair loss it would make sense that if create increases t h t and h t binding to the engernan receptor on the scalp can induce hairless that that would be the case is that true or am is are people just really concerned about something that is reveal or non existent each man and yes it campotentially at it i do not to say it causes it but it is it can be a little bit more fuel to the fire just everybody has a different sensitivity of their androgen receptor they have a different amount of gene transcription that is going to cause death of the police that is an arbitrary threshold you do not really know until you start losing hair and if somebody takes elicit of creatine for the a to increase their d h t make for the cognac en hanging effects or for whatever reason and they knowing till bit more her fling o out in the sink and they stop taking it with you said death of the logical which sounds very dramatic are those frolic are those little stemsell niches that residing the logical which her grow from are those then abolish there there is no going back or can you one rescue the the hair it takes months if there still there the hair will come back the loss of the hair itself is i normal part of the hair cecal your have your snag in phase your cottage in face your teelageen face and then your hair loss and tin enow o the level nice in the in the hair fall think think of it starts have teeth sharp loses a tooth than they have a new one that comes through or losing your baby tooth than you have a new one but your hair just always keeps coming through it is natural for it to die and lose that is what t that is why when you start five out for a ductason ofebitters often you have a big shed what happens during that big shed is all of these cells that are unhealthy they immediately jediscon that hair and they start making am much healthier new logical but all the hairs that a it at the end of the teelogin phase then a they have what is called negligent affloveium which also happens after pregnancy also happens in a thirty pathologies you shed it a new one comes in place and you think that your having a a horrible hair loss caused by your finasteridor whatever your whatever you are doing and monoxide does us too but you are rellyjust having a new healthier logical if you go a really long time if you go a year then those hairs might come back and they might not for am simplicity s i if somebody is concerned about or is experiencing harlots male work female what are their options of a ways to offset that hair loss that are not going to negatively impact other tissue sensitive to d h t an and what ism what ism basely saying here is i could imagine taking a d a d h t inhibitor ism a pill of some sort or an injection some sort and offsetting hair loss maybe even stumbling more hair growth a it is clear that ism not doing that but but i know people that do but then experience some of the other negative effects of a blunting d h t reduced fact reduced albedo reduce drive am disruptions in a prostate function or or even aspectual function generally what could can people do if they want to maintain or grow back here but they do not want all those other effects what should they avoid and what should they perhaps consider talking to their doctor about there is a whole host of options i i try to separate alopecia or harlots into two different categories male pattern baldness or androgenic alopecia also in is androgenic alopecia verses other types of alopecia usually teelogenifloveiums and if it is andrigenetic alopecia or m male patternbaldness even if their female perhaps they apiece as something that then you want some sort of strategy to decrease the activity of that androgen receptor women forget male pattern baldness absolutely o k t ism have to wrap my head around that one but e there is a lot of different things that you can do that are topical the most promising is called do astride hemotherapy essentially what it is is it is very localized injections and areas that are prone to male postern baldness whether there female or male and it acts o locally only and you repeat these injections from time to time it decreases the conversion of testostera to d h t just in the scalp that can avoid prostate of facts and what are some of the negative effects of a blocking d h t in a females in the periphery meaning not in not on the scalper in the brain but but where is d h t doing its stuff it is both d h t and an also that five ala three ala progesterone which is called a t h p my hydrops progesterone or tetrohydro try hydrops justurone there active in the central nervous system but it is all just active again binding to the androgen receptor in female is well causing them to have that effort feel good motivation a lot of women that are sensitive to d h t cause women can be sensitive to d h t is well feel very different when they start in oral contraceptive not because it alters their d h t to a huge male it does to some degree because the negative feed back in ambition in the fruitarian less produced in the ovaries but it increases s h b g really high because their less h p gs are significantly higher their free d h t is way lower how does a woman know if she has pick so polysystic ovarian indium what are the issues with polysystic o ovarian indium what can be done about pick s i confess i was naive to pick s am that was not splinter rhyme but since it does i do confess i was completely naive to it ask our getting a lot of questions about it in various forms and i think that is that is i shall that reason why initially approach to you i know you give treated a lot of pick ss a what age women am should be thinking about pick s what is pick s riches about pick ass please pick s is polysystic ovarian indium and this is one of those conditions which is under diagnose it is prevalence is much higher than we think it is there is been a lot of studies in some some studies say prevalence of ten per cent some say twenty per cent it is not completely clinically penetrate most people do not know they have vicious until they have infertility or sub fertility and is is as pick s happening this frequency in twenty year old women an thirty year old women and forty and onward most women find out they have vicious in their thirties especially isn't it is on a spectrum or continuum a lot of things where you can have a weaker version or very severe version on of the symptoms there is a critters called the rotter dam cried terra and in the rotter dam criteria there is a couple different ways a you can diagnosis you are looking for androgen excess insolent resistance and you can also look for polysystic ovaries you do not actually have to have polysiystic ovaries or get an older sound of your ovaries to be diagnose if you have androgen access for example androgenic acne or hormonal acne if you have hair growth a hair growth on the chin it is called a hirsutism or if you have a deepening of the voice am at any symptom of too much and a mail powder baldness fear female that is a a symptom of vicious as well then you can also have insolent resistance this is ability it is predibedis a high fasting insolent a home i a over too a fasting insolent of over six if you have significant insolent resistance and also a androgen dominance that is a sign of it driven dominance often leads to what is called oleo minored if your having more than thirty five day intervals in between a period or if you have less than nine per year then that can be a signed that you have oleo which means too little minaret which means minces that is a very common sign of vicious if you have infertility's if your under the age of thirty five and you've been trying for more than a year or if you are over the age of thirty five and you been trying for more than six months then that can also be it is a very common presenting complaint when somebody presents with piece es and assuming that a woman is doing it all these other things is paying attention to the six pillars that we you talked about earlier dirt exercise cleric restriction in some cases right not everyone needs to be cleric restricted a stress sleep and sunlight spirit am assuming that they're doing all those things a what other things in the realm of diet or supplementation can help them avoid pieces if they have sub clinical precious or they have not developed it but do not want to develop because it does not son a good thing ya defining on where they are if their very strong on the insolent resistance spectrum than a optimizing their body composition decreasing their body fat entreating that metabolicxendrum can help a a lot a people ask what is everybody that is on a does everybody need to be o atforman as vicious not necessarily but met formal is one of the tools i can help with insolent sensitization other tools i can help or anostatal moan postnatal is an insolent sensitized it is cousin d iron postnatal is a a weak antiandrogen a lot of types of an postnatal have both of those in it decision on inure a female or a male and yore on an postnatal the type of an osteal does matter yet this is very important point i i just to day i said trying this new am supplement an postnatal am for its roll an help perhaps enhancing sleep even further my sleeps generally pretty good lately it is been a woman off for a number of reason i took it for the first time last night and and i said give i thought it helped and am just subjectively and you said a what kind of anostatal is it because an stay a very portent androgen inhibiter it turns out i was taking moan postnatal which is not an androgen inhibiter the type the other type that you mention which is an androgen in hitter is d iron postnatal it is usually in a ratio of one to twenty five or one to forty in a much lower amount compared to my an postnatal in a in a supplementary in the body in a supplement to help induce ovulation but for women who have pick as who might want to trying reduce androgen then they would perhaps want to take a form of an postnatal that reduce the androgen receptor activity grant they want both purer a woman than you have ever talk to your doctor about getting on e oral contraceptive or sparonalactone which is also an antiandrogen but it happens to be a potassium sparing diabetic blood pressure medicine as well a d ciroanostotal might be a better option dim or dirndl meting is other another kind of weak antiastrogen anti androgen that a lot of women should consider as well you mention or contraception a have done a few posts a o an these let us call them that they really are perceptual effects whereby it is been demonstrate inhuman several times now and in what i would appear to me to be very solid studies where a women that take a oral contraceptives there is both a shift in their perception of men cause thees these studies only looked at hat arecectual a a the sort of arrangements here am where women who are on oral contraception because it blunts some of the peaks in valleys of hormone a what no longer a experience the same peaks in valleys in their assessment of other man's attractiveness it sort of flattens the the their perception to speak they still find certain men attractive an certain men unattractive but the the the that degree of difference is kind of mellowedoubt a and likewise men peri these data say that men perceiving woman's attractiveness they still see women on oral contraceptives as attractive but there a women taking oral contraception eliminates this kind of pike in her attractiveness that men would otherwise perceive in other words oral contraceptives are changing the way that we perceive each other at least in terms of these male female a experiments what is going on with that is that because oral contraceptives blunt the increase in testosterone that occurs just before ovulation or is it because of a complex cascade that is going on i find this fascinated ye there is differences in how your and i would not use the word change necessarily but alter the severity or alter the a pike as you said it is just tort is not going to change you as a person an oral contraceptive will not change you as a person that will just change your a day to day pieces and troughs in a libido and attractiveness one of the main effects of oral contraceptives almost all of them have a synthetic estrogen and a synthetic progestin in them one common type of synthetic estrogen is ethical estradiol there is another new a synthetic estrogen its out there as well but that anecdotally that seems to have even more side effects this eternal estradiol is one hundred times more potent than indigenous or by identical esterodyle in the liver it binds to the estrogen receptor in the liver and it is going to increase sex hormonbining globular which secondarily as you mentioned decreases your free testosterone especially your freed age t that little testostro hump that you get when you are a female is ovulating that is really flat line and it is already tit is a pretty insignificant difference it is not negligible but it is a little bit of a hump and you have significantly less of that when you are on oral contraceptive and does that bluntness located increasing libido that normally would occur from that increase in in androgen yes interesting a and what about other forms of contraception right cause there are others copper a up there is a averse implants there rings there is a a huge number of of different a forms of these what we are talking about is a as i understand it is only the effect of am a oral contraception that impacts hormone output s a correct yet there is a lot of other effects as well for example your choice of synthetic progestin will alter how higher platelets an es h b g go it appears to be the higher your platelets an the higher your s h b g the higher risk of a blood clot a lot of women know that if there normal contraceptive and there already predisposed to a blood clot or a venue thumb embolism and the vain they have a blood clot in either their leg or their long than it can increase that chance you can choose a synthetic progestin that is not going to have as high of a response a but there is there is various protein cons some synthetic progestins are weak and tiandrogens as well for example t there is one known as blind which is made from spronalactone some women are on spronaloctone and that is well which is made from spronaloc to which probably is not particularly necessary unless they for a diuretic or high protective effect i see i objection it a a intentionally interrupt i apologize but am specifically because i want to ask about a there is this notion that am that or contraception taken over long periods of time can disrupt fertility in ways that are independent of just the a the age related of decrease in infertility is that true it depends on what you mean by a long time six to twelve months it is possible past that it seems very unlikely however the persistently elevated s h b g can be present for quite some time wait i if a woman takes oral contraception for six to twelve months and then stops will she essentially beware she would have been anyway interns of her fertility at that age where you saying that it can cause permanent damage her fertility would be equitable as if she had never taken it if she is certainly twelve months but probably six months on what is she i know of women thayhave taken an oral contraception for many years are in addition to the age related declining fertility that occurs that is inevitable a of course the slope is going o be different depending on am the individual but it it are they a quickening the a the transition to infertility probably not am you can make a case that because they have been in a oral contraceptive they may have been slightly more predisposed to insolent resistance and or lowering b admass but that is n probably going to be a negligible difference compared to their resistance training and also their chloric restriction or chloric maintenance is there are also effects of having children ye why ism in on all these parameters recons as a severe it is a major life style shift i that obviously what people contend with and have fir since the beginning of a human time anyway i will not ask some questions about malhormon there be and malhormone's generally but before i do that i have a couple of burning questions that i get very often that ism just joining uncertain now marijuana have heard that it can decrease testosterone in men and women have heard that it can increase testosterone alcohol i think there is general consents us that his alkoholan take hi barbituit an take can does in fact refuse testosterone what about modest increase of aldol ism not a drinker that not asking these questions for me i do not smoke pa bi don dis never really the mariwanar alkali her not my thing but many people want to know the answers these and the the data that have seen are very confused and conflicting what about marijuana does it refuse to stostrone to significant degree were not cannabanoids itself whether it is t h c or c b d are not going to reduce testosterone by himself if it smoked marijuana then it is very likely to increase your romataste which increases your estrogen and you know that is going to it is aromatizing from testosterone that is going to decrease toststrone when you have an increased estrogen estrodyl that is going to work on your pituitary to make less hormones that cause retie release of of tostostrones you can have less eland less eyes age it is almost kind of a you know opiate are well known to a opiate agonists they are going to decrease elation effesation subsequently to stostrone smoked marital will as well as far as alcohol high alcohol will decrease to stostrone as will any very potent gala agonist whether it is a barbituatorobencs of disipenor a non bens or alcohol they are definably going to em moderate alcohol i guess a depends on what your definition of that is the the arms ebony a i i some people i know that do not seem to be alcoholics at least by my a assessment well have i a glass or two of wine fortnights a week which to me seems a tremendous amount only because i do not alcohol i i do not have a prom with other people in aldol but but i think many poor many people that would be considered low or moderate in take ye i would consider that down take the america hard association for men recommend between one and two drinks a day on average they wellmond it yes round one per w my ism making my heart less healthy by not drinking alcohol ye they they recommend a very low amount of alcallan take for men for women they recommend the zero to one that is gone a hard to interpret the zero to one am but the protective effect of alkali especially if it is a red wine a with polyphenals in it always the deleterious effect interesting cause have seen some studies tat point to the idea that even lo in take of alkali over a prolong period of time might actually decrease brain volume or at least volume of particular brain areas but of course we do not know the consequence of of decreasing the volume wig of a given brainaarea either mean one can imagine its decreasing the size of one's a migdelan making them less stress althoughthere is no evidence to support that have been told that i need a drink many many times but i always reply that i do not need to drink anything in order to speak my mine again an individual differences a very interesting it sounds smoked marijuana may in fact reduce testosterone or at least increase the conversion of testostr onto estrogen o and with alcohalan gabaagonists it is important to remember that it should not be daily one drink of alkoholiday is actually very mildly met oppressive it is better to have two drinks of alcohol one day the week and in two more drinks of alpha another day the week and then no alkali the rest of time the same could be said even for supplements that have gala in them a lot of sleep supplements have give o metobuteric acid i occasions take o start anti occasionally take a hundred to two hundred milligrams of gala ism in order to enhance sleep but i do it maybe every third or for night no more than the or four nights a week that is perfect there is a lot of sleep supplements that should not be taken daily and galas one of them a another one of them is trasadon and in melatonin is kind of arguable and a depends on the situation but in general if you are taking a sleep supplement it should not be taken every night the the sleep supplements that i understand or coquet to take every night or nearly every night ore things magnesium three and eight have the get an if that is not true correct me i o those who i certainly take them every night unless i forget them in back home in ism travelling magnesium one of the exceptions ealthiating is also another exception great l then at least i have not put anything into the world i that is i wrong in that category yet and homely i will not but if i do it'll correct myself let us talk about testosterone in in male the you see these head lines all the times now that testastron levels are dropping sperm counts are dropping vina types of men are changing over time and and i cannot quite follow the literature an that because we see those are hard controlled experiments to do because techniques change over time and sensitivity of techniques change over time but regardless ism aware that a lot of pe i are considering increasing there testosterone by taking testosterone that f a few years ago that was considered steroid use and was really extreme kind of stance nowadays it seems there is more discussion about it first off it'd to know does testosterone supplementation and here i pane out prescription from a doctor does it make one more prone to prostate cancer that seems always be the first question that comes out ye and there is a huge amount of is information about this to testosterone is not going to cause a prostate cancer however normal aging comes prostate cancer and testosterone will grow your prostate cancer if you are a eighty year old male and you have an autopsy and there is at least a fifty per cent chance that you have a prostate cancer if your ninety for a hundred years old there is at least a ninety per cent chance for humans with a prostate it is only a matter of time until you a prostate cancer that begs the question do you want to take something that is going to grow it for sure once you have it it is an individual assessment and it is important to follow things p was as well a p a of of for or less i mean ideal you would not be at fork as that's have the upper threshold is am the simplest redoubt of whether or not there is excessive prostate growth there is beeline prostate hyperplasia where the prostate s is growing but it is non cancer's correct and then of course there re the symptomologies people have challenges urination they r sexual difficulties et camera ism always struck by the am correlation that people draw between testosterone and prostate health and the fact that or that i should say the claim that tester makes prostate health worse because if you think about it young males have high testosterone often if not always em certainly often and you do not see a lot of prostate overgrowth in cancer in young males something is going on here how how should we conceptualizes if you have a p a of three point nine and you are a twenty five year old male verses a seventy five year old male and you have a p a of five point nine the three point nine p a is significantly more concerning think of your prostate is taking cumulative damage from not only testosterone but also estrogen and also growthormmon that is why o is individuals have higher incidences of prostate cancer as well it is because they do not have those sell check points where a your mean system takes a second says i stop a replicating as fast prostate cells let us see there is any eight typical ones and in fines those and it prevents them from reproducing that is why it mean both theropean cancer is promising us because they can target these certain things the older male is going t have that cumulative damage happen already and arguably prostate cancer is a normal a enow it with aging a fast aging is abnormal very slow aging is normal there is a fine line to walk between those two but there is a lot of things that can be done to decrease the turn over decrease the inflammation and decrease the congestion of the prostate over time there is also a lot more than just says that can be done there's prostate em prize and things that that can look at the structure in the function of the prostate what should every male do to maintain the health of their prostate and i realize that younger males are not thinking about it all although seems nowadays i get these kind of what i call am critic questions you a i think women are more comfortable talking about their hormone and sexual health because of they they cycle you because of menstrual cycles their used to fluctuations that we it is forgive them the experience of what it is to have different levels of protester on estrogen tost of a et camera i get these kind of critic questions often in my direct messages where what i think people are asking is m what what is there something wrong with my prostate what should i do for my prostate these are often indirect questions rather aspects of their life where their suffering but am and i do not say that a in just i i think a more direct discussion would be great a what should all males do to main to maintain a prostate health throughout the life spent maintaining prostate health can be looked at similarly how you can maintain a good natural optimaltustosteron you look for things that can hurt it you do not necessarily look for one thing that can improve it or boost for young males those are prostatitis i go hand in hand with epiditomitus different infections of the prostate the younger the male is the more likely it is related to something that could be actually transmitted but another very common cause is what we call gram negative and anerobic bacteria the prostate is right by the end of the clan if you have chronic constipation or if you've coitus or a if you have you know even just an enol lie overgrowth in the clan is very likely to cause an infection of the prostate as well what should males do tot to prevent that have a diet that has good healthy periotic fiber robotics as well a make sure that the having regular base movements that they do not have chronic constipation have good sources of dietary fiber which is also a soluble fire and enough insoluble fiber most people get enough insoluble or non dietary fire that can help prevent the chance of divert units which is another type of infection it can also decrease the chance of coitus and decrease the chance of prostate infections as well are there any foods and our supplements that men should take or avoid what about you here about salpa motto am ye supplements for or a supplements that support or cause issues for the prostate a if there is a strong genetic predisposition to enlarged prostates or even just really early prostate cancers that grow fast then they consider taking salpometto or even kirkman as an antiandrogen as long as my re able to tolerate it an individualized pass and depends on their history as far as a making sure that their prostate is not congested there is an interesting correlation between having girls and having prostate cabins ora of if your if your offspring a females then your slightly more likely to have prostate cancer there is some a there is hypotheses that link estrogen to prostate cancer rather than tostofstrone if you hyper estrogen's your prostate a has more a typical cells in general the higher your c reactive proline which is a general marker of inflammation in your body we call it c r p and the test order is h c r p or high sensitivity s a p if your c r p a raises up very high if you have an autumn disease if you have a crone's flare or if you have a lupus or an infection or a sexually transmitted infection or even a coitus or even the flue your c r p is can a rase significantly that you would detect in a bloodiest correct you want to get a baseline we or p when you have not had any of those things recently and if your r p is higher you also have more female offspring if your c r p is higher then your reactive option species which are causing mutations and a typical sell turn over in the prostate or also likely higher you want to keep it very low c r p interesting and a what about blood flow and pelvic floor in general we should ride you a whole episode on pelvic floor the other much interesting a data coming out of the the fields of clinical and research neurology i realize it is kind of the netherlands of of a biology an medicine people probably are not thinking much about this but pelvic floor is obviously a a a conferments of a ton of blood a musculature of nerves and of course the prostate resides there and of course the generals and a reside their as well i would imagine that the one of the six pillars no exercise being able to maintain adequate blood flow to those regions is k what about just postural things people sitting too much a not a hydrating well enough a you mention avoiding constipation what are some other things including medications that can serve to support the prostate overtime and maybe even support pelvic floor in general both in males and females overtime absolutely and this is something that is rightfully getting more and more to action the way explain the pelvic floor is your abdominal cavity which includes your peritoneum were where most to your organs are your retoapperitineum your pelvic space think of it is a box and your abs are the front of the ox your back muscles are the back your diagram is the top of the box and your pelvic floor that is where your port is to the outside world especially important that has muscles as well and you can you exercises pelvic floor physical therapist a becoming more and more utilized especially after child birth but in other situations as well including by men getting care from neurologists you went to to strengthen that pelvic floor and make sure that the tube sit er docks to the outside world a working well enough but they are not too loose are not working too well there is a lot of medications that can b a positives or negatives for your pelvic floor we cannot talked about your got in colon health in general as far as your prostate health and as far as your a flatter in your binary system health you think it about a couple different classes you have your phosphodastraces you have your tadalafill basically this is going a help decrease congestion in the prostate a lot of people take it for e d but it can actually help you decrease your uterine then a lot of men take to dalifill generic is c alive has a much longer half life than diagram early trees half life is almost to day we e con take a very low dose of it instead of taking twenty telegrams you take two or two and a half molegras o they are taking you are saying that a lot of men ta et for erectile this function yes that it at lower dose s it may have serve purposes for prostate heart independent o a erection correct the most common snare is if a male is waking up twice at night to p on average it will cut that down to once if there waking up at four times at night than it can cut that down to twice at night just because you have easier blood flow used to use other medications float which is tampsyuloson that is an ala antagonists who at basically binds to a recapture in smooth muscle and at helps relax that there several other ala antagonists and then you also have your medications that a hormone fanasteride that a lot of people take for prostate health to decrease the enlargement of the prostate the aerier urethral aria or periorethral lobe your several lobes of the prostate that tends to be especially enlarged in cases of b p h and b p h prostate hyperplasia or an enlarged prostate and if you are unable to shrink that area then a et that point is just a plumbing problem and the earn is able to get by easier et my understanding is that now there is a a e growing i mut say a movement a but a take the idea of taking very low dose two point five telegram or f we telegram to dallifille even daily it is becoming pretty common for many men who do not have erectile this function simply to either maintain or enhance prostate had that is that correct he's correct and are there do you see any negative effects of doing that there can be negative effects it can lower blood pressure theoretically i can increase your chance of vast vagal syncope a lot of people take it as a alternative to pump because it cunt of work similarly to coralline a or a different pump products and are work out and it can certainly help with that but if you are about to go to a deadline where you might pass out anyway it can certainly increase the chance of that happens because you do not have that compensatory exercise hypertension response could someone just take it away from exercise they could a if you took to dalifilled and it is that is going to be has a long half life whereas diagram let nature as just a few hours to dalifille is almost to day some interesting studies on vagary have been done as well it can potentially alter your rays and cones in your eye the usual recommendation for pilots that need have red green discrimination from very long distances with very small indicator lights is to not take a diagram i usually say if you are if you are pilot that your profession perhaps hold off from that for a while there is also studies with diagram that significantly which is also it is sit denipill as the generic now it can increase eyebrow hare growth potentially what it does is it helps vast dialyze and relax the veins especially an aldermen and when those veins are relaxed to you have better bloodflow that is one of the proposals or theories behind we older men get the androgenic alopecia more you are having less blood flow in the scalp theoretically it can also help prevent that t it is the unborn increasing blood oh because it increases bloodfloat a systemically throughout the body not just in in a specific tissues why find it incredibly interesting that am tether these online forms building up now around am loose to dalifille a daily use of lotus to dallafill again not for asexual erectile is function but forsake of of longhorn prostrate health is there any reason why women might want to take loose to dallifille to dalifill is also it we androgen receptors sincitizser kind of alcaratine were the density of the available androgen receptors to bind increases slightly there could potentially be a a benefit from that but a most the time it is used in men ere interesting we have not really talked about testosterone in optimizing testosterone and male assuming some one is paying attention to t six pillars there is a kind of a gap as i see it between doing all those things and tart common replacement there and again that the are the replacement in tart is a little bit of a a in quotes nowadays because a lot of people who have testosterone in that three hundred to nine hundred anagram presently arrange opt to take loose to stostrone anyway my understanding is that a there been a new out of movements in this area toward for instance not doing big large doses in injected infrequently but rather low doses quite frequently obviously prescribed by a door honor by a doctor et camera i is that generally what you to see in your patience if they are going to take this rout if there a hypoganatlpatient whose benefits outweigh risks of tart then you want to have a nice even steady state it is nothing to be exactly the same as producing pulsatile to estrone release indogionously from your own body when you have a steady state you do not have a poker a troth when you have a per that is when the angel receptrgene is overactive that is when you get more erithropoetson or ego release and that leads to a lot of the side effects of thick blood higher hemoglobin an hematocrates and then a when you have a crash you do not feel it is a definitely not optimal there is a lot of ways to get around this when you are doing testosterone replacement if you are someone that needs it you can have different types of esters or you could do topical to stostrone the ester is basically something that is attached to increase the biological gaff life e most commodores are simian and xanthate there is also ever short acting proprianate which has almost no clinical relevant there is also very long acting ones to cantowate an undecaniweight and different mixtures of all of us if you are some one who has a very very low es h b g you are gong to have trouble of regulating your drum testosterone in the long run h if you do it topically in the testosterone is absorbed hopefully bound to s h b g and then a lot of times you reapply twice day or once daily but you have lots of variations for most people specially for people who cant absorb it well that is not in to be a great option injections would be preferred most people and up injecting because they have either side effects from too high too low or ts too much of a very dose when they do topical there is also a causal with a special lymphatic absorption it is not being absorbed through the liver is not emphatically metabolize but it is absorbed through the limp and it is essentially testosterone undecanoweight and then put into a capsid that is taken two stately has fairly steady half life but you have to take it at specific times day a that bean said an it it is new enough to where there is not a huge amount of data on it but it is f tie approved it is it is grandame now scallgutenzo but a the injectables in general the lower up es b g the longer of an ester you want because when you inject it a whether its intramuscular subcutaneous stocked here doctor about the risks in the benefits of those subcutaneous has slightly longer act of half life because the asteraces take a longer to reach that sipianae or an ant the estrin cleave it most men a lo people ask me about what a usual dose is a for most people it would be a total of about one hundred to one twenty per week for an actual replacement dose telegrams telegrams one twenty to one hundred telegrams per week administer two to three times per week and you are not you sink dividing that into two or three right as ism sure the lunch we lost the or thinking o you hundred three times a week which is rashly quite his dose yet there there really does seem to be a shift in a toward am spreading these a dosages out into youdividing them into two or three a smaller doses and then am along those lines a five ten years ago it was common to hereabout inhibiting estrogen through a romatases in hitters nowadays you hear and i think it is a true at least by my read of the literature that that inhibiting estrogen can disrupt rain function can cause connective tissue issues and even can cause am reductions in libido a lot of a people think that estrogen if they you crash even that basicllybedo goes ut but actually the opposite is oftener you do not want estrogen too high or too low is that corrects and for that reason am do you a shy away from people taking a romantases in visitors ya a very few people truly need romatases in hitter there is almost always life style in or advections it can just depend on which get how active your romataste get is some peoples are imitate gene is very active lot of times these individuals have a capital kind o comas which is a breast tissue growth in male even to spite no other risk factor even even if they are lean a some people get it if they are lean i remember growing else there were a few kids that got a mild cases of on o comas that were transient the sort they develop grand comitia and then went away often it is you no lateral on one side tun growth common but a times is the a fuel to that fire o interesting aye there were couplikids aging that they took some teasing was back then it there was not on line discussions about horns and things that but then t it would seem transient and they were the the people on thing of were actually lean individual they they were not over wait which of course can cause con coast i because a tips fat tissue can convert to stosteron into estrogen am it sounds except in special cases that a avoiding a romataste in visitors probably going to be a good idea there is several other ways that you can control your estrogen and keep it at a healthy level which you do a the check there is a lot of patient to assure me that there estrogens going to be sky high and it is actually very low and vice first but a case glue crate is a supplement that can help with estrogen control what is a typical dosage of calm do glucrit five hundred to one thousand telegrams but is there the risk that if some one's estrogen is in normal range and they take the supplement that there estrogen will go too low is it that potent it is not that potent it is not nearest potent is in a romatastean hitter it helps with excretion and also the sensitivity of the estrogen receptor itself i cannot helps out compete it i some people also take dim or a different cruciferous vegetable a the him from cruciferous vegetables call but a or richly and that is both an anti estrogen and an anti androgen if you are on t a t and you are on that than you are probably just on too much tar t i remember a few years ago had o friend and at truly this is a rissole i had of i have a friend am because ism very cautious about which supplements i take i think peel might get the impression that ism very cavalier about this but ism not i always actor one thing at a time i talk to physicians i i what i suggest other people do actually do an have done for a long period of time and i recall am a wanting to take dim cause i thought with you back then you hear oka reduce estrogen mig estrogen levels were not out of range they were time it i thought well what what would the experience be of bringing those down but some one i know it is quite informed in the sarees at yet exactly what you said which is that dim can reduce estrogen but also tostostrones i just never opted to try and take it a i do want it were her arming in this direction but we went straight from the six pillars to t r t or to what some people now call sports t r t which is basically cod language for saying taking exogenous testosterone even though one does not need it to get into a semi superphysiological range or a am i end am nine hundred to a thousand anagram predesoleader range and people always point out i i should mention that oh well in certain countries the high and range is twelve hundred anagrams per does leader in the you ass it is nine hundred and if you are twelve hundred are you really superphysiological all that aside a i neglected to ask about that gap in between where individuals could think about supplementation meaning non prescription approaches to increasing testosterone and here we should probably also talk about things is it true that ice baths increase estastrone or not am little factors that go beyond the six pillars for increasing testosterone if you cod comment on those thatwould be terrific supplements that are useful and i be wonderful a if you can mention were some of these same practices and supplements might be useful for women as well as men to increase testosterone for all the reasons we talk about earlier ye this is where a true individualized preach comes in when you are talking about what dose of t it you should be on one thing to keep in mind is the law of diminishing returns a quality of life is a subjective thing and it is different for each person some people are more willing to give up a a little bit of athleticism or body composition some people are more willing to give up or not willing to give up albedo or sexual health and as we mentioned earlier everybody's androgen receptor is less or more sensitive you can make a case that if somebody is androgen receptor is half as sensitive as somebody else the not the person with the less sensitive receptor does need a level of one thousand or twelve hundred there is no great weight to know that and you can alter the sensitivity for androgen receptor a things ell carnations and to dalifelas mention will dealing come back to ell carnations because ism a really extreme by the baton a carnations both for women and men in terms of beg quality sperm quality fertility and a bunch of other interesting effects will come back to l carnations but a lot of how you feel the bile feet back or subjective i feel this comes from the ratio of your androgen's to your estrogens and a lot of that is life style some one's also on h c g that count upregulae a comatose as well n g ow you might want to at it human a cryonic ganatatropen a found used to be found in preen it still found pregnant women still founded are used be a nonbeliever not there was a black market for pregnant woman's rein a before it would the stuff was develop synthetically another is what we are saying as a men typically would buy pregnant woman's rein yes through a black markets in order to get the h c g in order to get the testosterone enhancing effects of h c g another words men were using pregnant woman's rein phrase i do not want to know how they i got into their body lass just skip to what you were going to say acts instead e a that is h c g a there is a lot of other things regulate estrogen alcohol significantly increases a comatose if your very sensitive to estrogen than you probably should not even consume the two glasses three times a week a high fat meals also regular comatose if you are on a mutagenic diet but you have hi per estrogen's then you should take care without as well all kinds of fats are just saturated fats ism not sure if it is just saturated fats but fat definitely increases a both fat in your body and consumption of a high amount of calories increases of tomatoes that it is the radio of testosterone estrin and o want to break your flow but that but since we are talking about fat i have to at since estrogen and testosterone are both synthesized from the collateral molecule have heard that in getting some amount of saturated fat can be useful because of the way that collected all can i serve as a precursor to these molecules now i once said on a pod cast that i butter much i occasionally eat pats of butter somehow that to a misinterpreted to mean that i eatentire many pats of buttelit one or two pats of butter he ere and i have no guilt or shame about my bloodlipits are in great shape also ism feel good but am is it possible that people who are investing too little of saturated fats could a directly or indirectly reduce or somehow disturb the proper ratio of testosterone to estrogen in men and women it is theoretically possible but it probably doesn't happen in developed countries just its theoretically possible to have not enough it'll make a six fatiasits but that probably does not happen in developed countries i do not need the butter pats but moi to do it anyway ism just curious a o g grassed butter has good all make a three content as well a grassed foods in general it is not the and it'll be all and everybody does not need grab fed foods but they are one of the only sources of healthy trains fat a naturally occurring transfer comes from ruminants ruminants think of a cows and a the the rumination in the different stomachs can change your it'll make a three and all make a six to strands lenolinic and trains linalaic fatty sits which are healthy for so it it is actually it'll are a threes on all make a sixes that just happened to have a trains instead of a sis isomer a and these healthy a translate would be found in am ruminant chess and milk and butter from luminance and an forego meats and the meats yes and for people ore fallowing a purely plant base diet were s wore mostly plant base diet are they at risk of not getting enough of certain types of fats other nutriance to maintain that healthy ratio of testosterone to estrogen were not if there vegetarian they are probably non at risk if they are vegan they very well could be at risk most vegans are aware of this a very acutely and they will supplement with a ally or tho supplement with other sources of a healthy fats i see the take away that ism am drawing from this is that less than getting saturated fat it is key to get these healthy translate from a luminance is am or the food products of those luminance as well as am to get proper a amounts of o mama threes and to be clear you do not need any translate it just happens that those we'll make a threes and all make a sixes are in a trains isomer i see less o that is nutrition what other supplements can support healthy testosterone to estrogen ratiosanything that alters a rumatase can support healthy tostostron to enteron and ha your testosterone to estrogen ratio think about it as how much estrogen activity do you have at the data estrodyle or scepter and your ala estrodyle or scepter how would i know that a it it is hard to tell but detention on what you are eating if you have a lot of plant was stilts or jolly females many of these are data estrodyle receptors people know about trcasterone and also bates recti terrine which are too recti steroids that are data estrodyle receptor agonies the activate the bates estrodyle receptor if you have a very low on of estrogen naturally you are probably a better candid for for taking to ta trcasteroner item empty sir have never tried then but i know a my understanding is that they work tremendously well for some people and not at all for others and one was simply has to try but in am in promoting the activity of this estrogen receptor is there a risk that tircesteroner echos their own could cause some of the a cording problems associated with increasing estrogen activity it reduced libido water attention am water water attention yes reduce libido probably not a closing growthplates in the bone no because that is the ala estrodyle receptor have talked before on a couple of podcast about am tonga all in much is this indonegion era i gossip also a men made an found in malaria but it seems to be the indonesia a variety of tonga all that is most effective or potentially for reducing senior morning binding globular an there by freeing up testosterone am whether not the effects are through that pathway through another pathway a lot of people report improvements in things libido and maybe a a androgen a find types right feeling more vital et camera and of course some of that could be placebo correct m but what are your thoughts on tonga all an please challenge my statements about tonga all if they are in correct and ism not looking for validation here i just really one to know what your thoughts are on it o you ever a recommend it to patience a when a men women one or the other ya tong cat all or long jack it has multiple mechanisms of action and there have been several a placebo controlled studies on it some of them show decrease in less age be at least one of them did not show any change in less be however it is it does act on a comatose very weakly probably not strongly that you would have to be concerned of hip estrogen's it sing it reduces a romataste and thereby can reduce estrogen correct it is also a weak it is not a seem it is not a select of estrogen receptor modifier but it is probably a weak it is probably er as well or a non select of estrogen receptors modifier and that should help with decreasing negative feed back inhibition of estrodyle in various locations and also increasing testosterone you have the dosage that have been using for years now is a it is four hundred telegrams taken once a day am typically early in the day cause it can con have a mild stimulant in fact very mild am and i know that some of the products out there recommend dosages that are much higher an come have taken more than four hundred i do not feel very good i do not know what to described a the it is a l over stimulatory in terms of they s me kind of am it is doing in too much coffee am that is that is interesting and would women ever wane to take tons all for any reason ye absolutely there is a lot of women that have hyper estrogen's and unlike a renal fatigue or andrapasers actually iced ten cots for hyper estrogen's i see t ten cots ya doctor so i o there is codes to were your doctor can actually diagnosed with something if you go to your doctor and you say i have a renal fatigue they cannot dignosyo with that or if you say i have andropaustay also cant diagnosed with that a but if you say you have hyper estrogen's the most common complaint that comes with it is endometriosis which is overgrowth of the lying of the uterus and a those people copetentially i think that is one a area where we might see ton cat supplementation more and more because not only does a decrease a romataste like we mention testosterone of females is higher than estrogen an females lot o females get estrogen from a romanization as well a peripheral estrogen's sometimes what we call it because it is not directly produced in the overs but they could be good candidates for to cat if that is the case very interesting in it and my understanding is that people should be looking for sources of indonesia tonally in particular correctsanother interesting application is essentially a it'll call it a pie c t but essentially what es is piece t men he tennis post cycle therapy physicians love acronym sins is let ins military love acres for weka yes is h pop cycle theories to be p people coming off one mother my r stewards this would actually be for women that are coming off of their birth control pill ah because perhaps say can help lower that sh b g back toe normal which is sometimes persistently elevated and the tit can help prevent the subsequent hyper estrogen's that happens ten tonga all need to be cycled when i first start taking it i would cyclist i would do fou the three formonths and i would take some time off now just been taking it continuously for years and my and i should say i do blood work to check my liberals times and everythingales in it you now i do not see any reason to the for me to cease taking it ye probably not there is been human studies on both ton cat and fidosia and full disclosure i did help design series new testosterone optimization supplement which has both fidosia ancestress and also ton cat all in it yet let us talk about fidogia separately in a moment but if let us say some one is only taking tons all for whatever reason but do they need to cycle off likely not but i would just to be safe because it does both effect your romataste and it is an estop estrogen receptor modifier and an what what would be a reasonable a cycle off how long to takin how long to to stop before taking again ya m there is a couple different protocols that you can do but eleven months on one month off for tom cat is pretty reasonable a thionic i guess us is we will talk about this late or to but if it is combined with fidosia the protocol t at i would do is three weeks on one week off that's tonga all but ism curious what your thoughts are on fidogia arrests this nigeria shrub were this a extract from nigeria shrubs that at least in my experience in my read of the literature has the potential to increase testosterone and probably other hormones as well by way of increasing utilizing hormone something that we have not really talked about much up until now what are your thoughts about fidogiagrestus whatever your ideas about the proposed mechanism or mechanisms and where might this be useful for people on were off hormone replacement therapy ya fidogia arrests has just reached a point where we have enough evidence to we know it probably helps both with aluminizing homo release which stimulates late excels in the testis to produce more testosterone and probably with all age receptor sensitivity as well which is good combination of the two am it does come from the nigeria shrub but am there is not quite enough evidence for me to be able to say it is safe for somebody to take this all the time which again poldestro disclosure that is why i recommended that we a recommended for people too cycle this supplement three weeks on one week off that is likely safe the only toxicity studies a in general are in rats and inhuman it looks quite safe understating is that the toxicity a studies in rats showed atoxasy to the testicularselves that certainly concerning but that the dosages that were used am or translating the dosages use to humans am would lead to a situation where the dosages that humans would have to take would be very very large that the amount of a i no longer take fidogia but i i took it at six hundred telegrams per day for a long time and i cease taking it because am i was experimenting with other things and i did not want confound am those things a not because i i had any negative sign of facts if that i was wandering blood work and and other by biological parameters that would would have told me if those testicular toxicity and there does not that's put it that way the i think it is extremely say and a ism ism just not convinced that there is enough overwhelming evidence for long term consistent a administration a do you recommend this to people who are not taking to party and do you recommend to men and women ya if you have a really high elate can there probably a goal issue whether it is he damage the testes a vericaseal am a history of testicular cancer your this a get to be higher of your this already very high increasing it even mores probably not can help however if your oh is low than hallways you've ho to find out if is it low is it deficient or is it just a little bit low if it is low and you do not have an issue with protect an you do have an issue with a of you would receptor antagonism now tractor can actually potentially help antagonize that to increase eh is well especially in people recovering from am point sir likely eve an alcohol you are looking for a sub clinical secondary hypogananism which is essentially just think of that is low ell ah in people with that lower eh and their estrogen is fine and their prolactin is fine than fedora is a particularly good option interesting three weeks on one week off for a for six hundred telegrams fidogia a four hundred telegrams tonally indonesia tonga all am could potentially be begoodn of course everyone shouldalways check with their physician clear this do blood work et camera i would say we do not u say that to protect that we say that protect you am meaning that the the consumer am it is very very important a you do want git a you don't wat a fly blind with any o the tuff you want to do blood work right that is the cast twenty to with supplements is most of them are afford then medications but the only difference between them and a medication is once prescribed and once's not and oftentimes with supplements it is in clear weather not what is listed on the bottles what is in the bottle but am but i think there are a number of reputable brands now am the a the other supplement i won talk about interns of testosterone augmentation is bore on a what is bore on thought to do does it actually do that and a do ever recommend bore on y bore on is actually in element and you can find to on the periodic table it is more plentiful and rich soils frequent farming can deplete the soils of bore on it is very plentiful the mediterranearea grease and turkey lot of people will just e dates or raisins that are grown there her an tell me people e did a there are people who there are people who e tend there's a a phenomenon a called bite right where people am in a and that is not a good thing they they often arson iron deficiency and okra but there they're eating grapes and dates that were grown in soil that has high amounts of bore on is a e for on can help regulate s h b g but it is effect is mostly acute it is unlikely to have a bad effect lot of people take bore on because it is probably not can a hurt and a it will lower s h b g even if it is for a short period of time i guess you make a case that maybe cycling bore on can help too what sorts of dosages are are useful for bore on supplementation three to six telegrams once to twice at o interesting that is higher than the amounts tat a ovum an take it i belong in doing this cocktail of a a tongaali again i stop taking fidge but a for a long time with fidogia and and bore on i think it was two to formiligrams pray but maybe i could for to go hire although my blood work is where i wanted my sir circling back to fidogia fidogia was at tractive to me as a supplement because i saw increases in l h testosterone and free test estrone my estrogen it in check but i also did not c down regulation of l h when i would cycle off i whereas with h c g human cationic caltrop in which am does now arrive in am i informs not from pregnant woman's burin only but ta enthetic forms at people in neck that as i understand it can suppress hormone you indogion is hormone output if one takes it for a long period of time why would a man or woman want to take h c g and what are the potential risks and benefits of taking h c g as h c or human chronic can atatropen is actually very similar to t s h spiroid simulating homo correct when a woman is pregnant she produces more h c g especially in the first trimester when you take a pregnant test whether it is qualitative for quantitative you s the h c g rise and it actually doubles every forty eight hours a if your five weeks pregnant you have me to h c level and n two days later five weeks in two days you can s r h c g and maybe it went from five hundred to a thousand precipitously increases it does a few things one thing is it prevents hypothieratism or hypothroxinemia of pregnant which is one of the most common causes of miss carriage it is also why if you are a if you have hypothiratism and you get pregnant in the first trymesture you won o increase your dose from twenty five to forty per cent to keep your free t four high as much as possible it the reason why you have to do that a supposed to somebody who does not have hypothiratism is if you have hypothiratism than likely your thyroid will not respond to either t s h or h c g the increased h c does not compensate for that if you take h c g then it campotentially improved your thyroid function that along with illinium are likely the two best things that you can do for thyroid health h c g and illinium by defile a make sure i on enough illinium by eating m three to five brazil nuts per day i very much enjoy the taste of also a who should take it h c g and can h c g suppress one's normal aluminizing hormone output suppresses l h in a dose dependent manner the higher the dose of h c g you take the more it suppresses el h a commandos for fertility fertility is usually why h c g is prescribed in men or women in both is ten thousand i s all at one time which is quite a bit that is a tremendous dose in fact some formulation some brandnames of h c g come in autoonjector pins to where you cannot even dose slower than five thousand units at a time well you but i know a number of people who take h c g to maintain testicular function while on testosterone therapy or augmentation of some sort does it does it work to do that ye a some people are on h c g monaltherap it can be slightly better on your bipeds then bin on t r t host people are using h c g alone as a kind of a neither sort of a hormonagment indirect hormonaghation some clinics advertise it as a a non suppressive alternative to t r t but it is suppressive of h but it could also increase astern pretty potently and is it true that increasing ell h a and or h c g can improve sensitivity of the generals and is that true for men and women my have heard this anecdotally people say h c g makes am sexual activity more pleasurable for people because of a some is it a direct effect on on some of the nerve sells in in the generals y el hes also a an agonist in the prostate an congenital tissue in general it is a very common a treatment for post fanasterides condom or post five alforaductase when you have block to the conversion of d h t for a long time it helps r upregul d h t some one what been taking fanasterad to prevent hair loss comes off it feels mama because they felt lousy but then feels even lousier for reasons he talked about earlier and then they might use h c g as a transition treatment to am transition back to normal a on one health is er it is extremely helpful in many cases now when you come off h g g than you to have a strategy of hate returned here normal as fast as possible as well but it will regulate those five alfraduoct sin times you have in your gentle skin both scrubdleskin and p nice skin an perineum in general you have a i believe it is called stratamolucidum it is a skin layer that is very very thin but it has the highest concentration of five alforaductase you have a lot of activity and after you have been on something that inhibits the in him the five a reins i am in those tissues then you do something else to regulate those invites whether it is waiting in taking time whether it is trying to fill whether it is trying creating even or whether it is trying o h c g a lollies those of the go ts for postfanastrade into any risks for women taking h c g am on their ability get pregnant or am or is generally e a ovicitoll make any pregnant test p little that is risk that some women do not know one could in theory fake pregnancy test by injecting sign absolutely interested am have know a motivation to do that iuscurous am what about a prolactin t a the simple version of this that i was taught because i was taught mainly from the narrow indican perspective was dunno dopamine is a kind of close cousin of testosterone and also estrogen for that matter a drives a positive behaviors including a pursuit of sexual partner sex itself a motivated behaviors generally then am postcopulatory a postorgasmic a a states are a company by a prolactin increase that the refractory period for making an males maybeven in females as well am involved in milk get down at camera what are sort of the the general contours of a sindrums or things that people could a be on the look out for of having too much prolactin or too little prolactin and i ism aware of a number of people who take a dopamine agonists all tracing capergoline things of that to really booster a dopamine levels and that it is not always a good thing as it turns out oversized people become and of hyperodopam an uric and they have the drive to do all these a positive things young fill in the blanks am but they do not always a have the ability because it seems just as testosterone an estrogen need to be in the proper ratios dopamine in prolactin need to be in the appropriate rations what what howshal we to thing about a and perhaps act on our prolactin systems absolutely the way i describe it is the dopamine wavepool if your increase your dupe in too much nice overflow and in you can have that wave crash too much see on t have nice even waves that are not going too far above the pool of dopamine and prolactin will follow protected an estrogen or quite close cousins estrogen regulates a gene call the for reline or prolachtingine that directly increases prolactin synthesis prolactin is going to a also in habit the release of testastrode from the pituitary if your using a dopamine agonist then you are going to help decrease the prolachtand producing cells including if you have a polar and producing my coratnoba in the pituitary how common er those because i having i hear a lot about these a hypoganat ism or and of course that can be due to an issue at the testicles or i am hyproganizm a could also be of course in epic aoverarian syndrome and then there is of course the brainsick of it where the signals are not coming from the rain your not enough a ganatitrop an not enough aluminizing hormone and their ways of teasing this apart through with an entercronologist that are quite elegant in fact right use stimulating homos too much to dive into here but how often does one actually have one of these pituitary towers am i have purred a that people that play lot of high contact sport boxing ut ball people that head headed the hairball quite a lot am sadly a people whose jobs force them to take head blows a for cold be military an they were firing you know fifty caller guns and the kind of woodpeckering of the brain inside of the skull am and construction workers were just a concussion can cause the pituitary to go out functional is that really common orbs this something that is is a rare like one per cent ye it is extremely common it is another on those conditions were a lot of people never know they have it they just feel little bit more fatigue they have that high prolactin feeling all the time put guitar macaradnomas can be non producing as well your producing can be totally normal your growth common an idea one can be totally normal let's the second most common producing mycaradnomis growthormon causing neither acromegaly which is growth of cartilage or gigantism this is the the bigbraw ye those are fairly common a causes of adenomas but a lot of people that have a very small a adenoma much less than once in a meter it is hard to see on imaging even if you have a contrast that specifically looks at the pituitary and many people are not symptomatic a it is one of those things along with pitiless and predivetis that are much more frequent when it comes to prevalence which is the amount a the percentage of people that have it the general population ism glad you mention the opening way wool i know nowadays a there is a lot of interest in augmenting opening a i know but number people to do this prescription drugs a at a all riddled madafphanil and those drugs of course hit many transmitter systems but dopamine a certainly invade people taking a enter depressions whale button to happen to that system and of course people are trying to in habit prolactin and promote semitone and a reduced her tone and to me it all seems a very delicate dance right i mean to just imagine the arousal ark of for raining behavior for sexual reproduction is such an in in elaborate dance between sympathetic drive and parts sympathetic drive even with across the span a minutes it om love talked about this before the podcast the arousal is kind of more part sympathetic am orgasm and a itself is is a sympathetic response at completely different set of groans and where do you see people getting into trouble just trying to hit the gas petal on dreaming and where do you think there is a place for people who perhaps our experiencing low drive and motive action not just sexual but in general am to increase the amount of dopamine circulating in their brain embody how layout how you think about that given this wavepool analogy ye it is importance a parse out and start with the least powerful interventions some one's concerned about topspin or may be they have a slightly higher prolactin than they eliminate things that could be increasing that prolactin a avian or gluten which are mu opioid receptor agonists or any you opioid receptor agonist an the gut casino milk proving correct can increase prolactin correct interesting in addition to that they should a if they need a patuitarium or and they would get a tuitarim or if they do not have an adenoma or if they do not have a high enough placed in level to where they need it i are a if there haven visual symptoms or thou having a all factory symptoms with the nose than it is more likely than they do that they do but a if they do not a lot of times a placed an under about forty is not too big of a deal they can take opening agonists that agonize that d to receptor p five p which is essentially video an be six it is pyridoxine five pirophosophy and pyridoxine is video an be six that can help fifty telegrams once to twice a day aside em an e can also help especially if it is mixed to cover all a lot of people have the a high levels of a vide em any but low levels of the game form avieemany that can also help a fastening ism glad you mention visit an be six and a p five p am i have heard that one can shorten the refractory period after am after orgasm to sensual to be able to a have sex again and to be quite direct about it by a by way of vide em an be six am blunting of the prolactin response which turns out to be quite potent am but have also heard that victim an be six can be narotoxic is specially in in the prefer that can case primeval naturopathies if it is taken doses but that p five p is the safe for form is that true it is are activated it does not build up think of it as a allegory to how a collate can build up it is not a methyl full late but it builds a a and it can increase levels of homosistine or if you have too much visit an be twelve another water soluble b video an you can have too much methelmalonicasidor immix detention on what your insimatic conversions to the active forgot the inside often it is just safer to take the active form the inside re very interesting o kat well at risk of going down every hormonal pathway and talking about am supplementation lasstoll factors i think touching on t as we have to stosteron and estrogen and ow prolactin it'd love to a chap obit about el carnations we talked about this earlier and but i want a raise this discussion about ell carnations not in the contest of our carnations itself but in the context of fertility because my read of the literature is that el carnations can be very beneficial for enhancing sperm quality and egg quality and even rates of conception m what forms does ell carnations come in that people can reasonably am consider again doctor your doctor poke am what is it doing and do we know how it is doing it and you often use this in your patience ye the way i think about el carnations and it'll try to tie the sin with creatine and other things as well is if your sell is an energy factory or car think el carnations is the shuttle that helps get the fuel into the motor to use the motor the motor is mostly due to lifestyle factors your diet in your exercise and the type of fuel itself is in a plus we don't need to get into in d precursors or name or and a anything and then the accessory fueltank is your creatine phosphate creatine is your accessory fuel tank your in a d status which is largely determined by your rimsleep in quality sleep an exercise along with supplementation is the fuel the carnations shuttle is a carnations palatial coins may and net takes medium chain fadiacids it takes different molecules of fat ye too many energy sources other than ketones y of your glucose or cars if your fat or faddy acts net takes at a cross the layer of the motacondrio that it can be utilized regulates that that is why it things that have flagella in general the flagella argon work better lixeerm flagellating anything a sort of though the wavy little tendrsorn saltines t i which away there everywhere right in the got too e those are gingko work significantly better and in general your moth condriorgan work better the worst your moth courier off the bat the better they are going to be helped by the settle that shuttles them across the it also slightly increases the dignity of the aldermen receptor as well is that a local fact if in el carnies injection to particular muscle will increase the dens of androgen receptors in that muscle likely aware people taking el carnations their capsule forms in their indictable forms most peopleirin it be taking the case forms because that is all the gan have access to and then we should also ask can you get a carnations from food ye el carnations is just the commination of it is actually a very small peptide gludithion is just a three of monoacid el carnations is the smallest peptide too peptide is just a protonema has a monoacid between two and about two hundred and a el carnations is just women sit arsing sos a ma micro peptide ye your body synthesizes enough it likes to absorb the amenoacids by themselves and unfit puts them together there makes ell carnations it is not very bile available if you take it hate people take el carnations a tar trade or sell carnations and that is about ten percent bile available if you want one graham or a thousand telegrams of el carnations you can take ten grahams of oral el carnations is it is the one graham the typical use you recommend one gran per day for fertility and aldermen receptor regulation that men tanking ten grahams of the capsule form e that is about fifteen to twenty calls andwjjus a lot that is a lot you can also potentially increase t man yet wont to ask about that because t a may o on your bloodchart is that is when that is elevated that scan a bosom concern a you taught me a trick however that one can take six hundred milligrams of garlic caps for the malison is fiscal malison is the name malison but with two els oh k u and that had a remarkable effect in reducing t ammo that is quite put in also read they was it just coincidence that it really brought my elder down as well i am not sure if the radio is a coincidence but detention on your gut microbic or your micro biota some microbic a beneficial bacteria will convert a carnations and also coaling any coaling precursor alpha p c or phosphor i seeing they will convert them more or less the to t mayor something you can get measured in a blood test and see if is high or low some people might not not even need malison true people do benefit from i interesting although it i think i think it was you that also told me that that malison an garlic can have positive effects on in a party of vascular tone an blood flow generally is that right ski may be its six hundred milligrams garlic and excessive of a excessive amount and i just eat garlic you must i to eating garlic case o one could also just eat garlic u if one were going to take a elcarntin in indictable form how much of that is by available a hundred present if you inject it is in aqueous solution it is a bacteria static water essentially it is not in a carrier oil it relish it is gan a burn a lot if you inject it subcutaneously its can be absorbed faster and more evenly and also just hurt o less if you inject it into a muscle but one could then just take one one graham per day injected ore divided up into a couple though or five hundred the minimum efficacious dose for injectables probably round two hundred when it comes to sperm motility t androgen receptor regulation it really depends on why you are taking it terms of fertility and in terms of blood test generally y i always say that a if possible am either by way of insurance or by way of a some other way affording it it it would be great for people to have blood tests to know what their hormone levels and other levels of other things metabolic markers and limits were in their twenties also in their thirties also in their forties i think there is this idea that you only take a blood tests when you have a problem but then of course you one cannot actually do the comparison that you mentioned earlier or state the comparison to one's physician that things are changing over time and it it seems to me that easily everyone should get at least a longs a year blood test is there the hope that insurance will will some day just cover it for everybody this would be standard care i would think that everybody should know what sorts of things are floating around in the blood stream in what they mean more of and less of in life i doubt it will ever be covered by insurance in many cases you can make an argument that it is indicated as insurance begins to cover more of the population for pathologies the a things f says your h says your care credit will likely cover this advanced testing which bee it is continues to come down and down in price it will be a fordable but it will be free to it it'd to shift years slightly and and talk about social interactions and relational effects on hormones something i just find fascinating we touch on the kilobit earlier with in terms of oral contraception but ism now that we have the back drop of what these various hormones do some involvement and or transmitter systems demean and pom prolactin associated pathways protection course being hormone noted nor transmitter but that there is a phenomenon a in human beings square people get very excited about a new partner and that excitement no doubt is related to the doping system among other systems and that excitement can be maintained or can wan over time and here ism talking about attraction but ism also talking about just general excitement in the sense of novelty because that is what dopameans associated with given that a rope you work with human beings and they have life lives and relationships and life styles and they have hormones and and all these things interact what are some of the ways that we could think about adjusting our relationships in order to optimize hormones a supposed to just thinking about hat it optimize hormones forsake of our relationship because it is by directional of course i and this assumes i should say that one is already paying attention to the six pillars talked about earlier is doing that people doing most things right am how shall we think about relationships and hormones friendships romantic relationships new partners longer partners yow how do you think about this kind of stuff ye if you have a new partner than it is largely regulated by the dupomanurgic system which changes over time people may have heard the saying that you have to go through a full calender year with some one that you are in a relationship the very good advice pilethat you really know i what to do in what not to do but because they you experience both of your families in the holidays an all the different situations but i would argon until you have a moved in together had a baby and then rage that baby a preferably breastfeeding because that is when you get the prolactin spikes you do not you an't really gone through every stage in life yet now you cannot really do that with every person at you're considering well some people do but it i be quite a costing terms of time and finances and emotionally costly a a in the hear of defiling out referring to any personal experience of having done all that many times over but what would you suggest people a do or think about as they enter relationship or it for people that are in long tern relationships where they feel something at shifted and indeed those shifts may reflect the output of different hormone systems and burro transmitter side they almost certainly has to be the case right a just a women who spend a lot of time together whether their to workers a whatever a lot of times there went minstrel cycles will aline there is a lot of farimonal and hormonal cross talk including prolactin between men and women spending a hundred per cent of the time together this is why people think it is hard to work together and live together there around each other twenty four seven you do not have their reprieve where you let that do not mean settle down and then you are excited when you see them again a along is know that if they have gone on a a hunting trip or if they on a trip for a long time they come back and they see their partner an it is a new r not quite a new relationship but almost a new relationship they have that excitement again and purposely building that into every relationship can help significantly especially if you choose to have a child there get present or be press feeding because you just plan ahead for both of your prolactin to be high and both of your dopameans to below and both of your testosterone to below a there is a there is a lot of planning that you can do essentially every relationship goes through a a crisis and that crisis is personal between a the two of you and you can plan ahead and figure out a way maybe it is not supplementation maybe it is not even a the amount of time you spend away from each other but plan ahead to have good times if you are about to go into a crisis god and it sounds time apart and time together which is actually built into a number of cultures where man and women will will purposely avoid each other for some period of time avoid physical touch and made in proximity and then will re convene and yet those are very stable relationships over time often am is the inverse also true am for instance for people that are in long distance relationships am where they are only seeing each other three or four days a week or two days a week am does this explain the fact that a some of those relationships can gone for a very long period of time without ever actually entering the am that's call the hyperprolactin phase of actually moving in together and et camera et camera in other words is that a a a way in which people are a spiking and roughing opening that keeps them attached this kind of elusive a a this sort of what is it called i thing it miscalled a cats string if you play with a cat and you move the string away they will keep reaching but you throw the string on the ground the they are tolly uninterested in it is that that what is going on cops that is a noblemen urgent phenomenon the casting example we know o this experimentally in those cases the relationship has not really progress in many of those cases past the open mean spike the fun initial stage honeymoon stage what every one call it it is almost kind alike a rumal if you are looking fer remade if it was for college or after college or whatever you can fill out forms and look for common interests but until you are actually together a significant proportion of the time you are not really to now rig in a be compatible on and is there am a evidence that the appearance of of an infant change is obviously tat there can be hormone shifts a we know actually it that for ain both women and in men there is a prolactin increase a when one when couples are expecting a child a this is the it is most a brooding phenomenon you see this in birds where it is called actually calls called brooding and it is caused by prolactin increase but turns out this also occurs in humans and ah some peopled argue this causes the the dad bod phenomenon to it actually projections solve in laying down a body fat preparing for sleepless nights and presumably that spiking prolactin is they're also to suppress sexual activity because there are periods of time immediately a were child first a were ism sexual activity is not advantageous a you see a prolactin spike right after breast feeding you think about it often when you have an infant a you will breast feed put the infant to bed and then immediately go to bed with your partner which is not particularly conducive it is almost trying to have intercourse back to back and that is very difficbecause of inn the prolactin sense y lots open mind high prolactin oxytocin is also increased significantly to help with millet down as well a yeas far as brooding there is definitely a a human equivalent of brooding a some humans call it nesting instinct which is both helpful but it is a it is not necessarily a bad change in in relationship it is just a change and as long as that it is coming here did you better with it just any medication if you are aware of the side effect and that it might happen than when it happens it is not only less severe it also happens less often very interestyutelipation was a nurse scientists come from the frame work that of course hormones impact perception and behavior but perception and behavior also in back mormonths i find this fastening also really the example you gave of am people taking time apart but also these affiliative bonds that are m non romantic bonds can service kind of a a reservoir to replenish dope o mind am that is then released upon i balance going back to one's partner or some sort of regular feature of home m very interesting and of course is i should exist on both sides on guessing that a a from both the mailside and female side that there is an interest in kind of separation in run man as it is the theme and i guess the frequency will vary for different different couples indifferent situations ye and i soft wan to make it seem prolactin is all bad prolactin does help with a nesting instinct it helps with best feeding is well a lot of women our diagnosis with audial pace defects which is basically the faces after ovulation but before a period or giving birth the pregnancy's kind of a prolonged audial face and a lot of them will go on progesterone for this progesterone can also decrease prolocutor and prolactin is also helpful for them maturity of lungs and infant it helps the sing mile in tolechothan ratio it can decree if you if your prolactin too low through pregnancy at spikes a very high during pregnancy then it can lead to increased risk of a respiratory distress of the rewarm the interesting yes we did we certainly do not wat a pain a picture where prolactin is the bad bad warm on to avoid it is it is a without prolactin none of us would be here course am it is vital i realize the earlier i raise the question about weather or not cold exposure could modify worm one out put in particular whether not ice baths or i supplied to specific tissues of the body is people are doing i one way r the other can change testosterone levels estrogen levels anotherwards to taking ice basin cold showers increase to testosterone end er estrogen ye taking a ice bath or cold shower or cold exposure in general it is not in out correct divide him indeed efficiency your emetabolican drove there's a lot of things that it will not correct that a causes of hipogonatism cloth er lo testosterone but it will help acutely specifically the application of cold to testes that are too warm if you have a vericaseal or if you have a little bit of a primary hypogonatism which is were testosterone is not a released by the testes but your elation off sage signals are sufficiently high then a you will likely respond to cold exposure better and there is actually undergarments that our design specifically to help with fertility and there is probably gan be more or more than the future you just need to be careful not to get frost by because it is a particularly bad spot to get frosty noted could you define vericaseal you mention if you times is that is a varicose vain ye it is essentially a varicose vain it brings warm blood and the venue flow or the flow back to the heart is not as good just in the legs it can happen in the scrotum usually about twenty to twenty five percent of people have one great o vericaseal there is grades one through four or one through five and most people just have a very mild one usually on the left side because the blood has to go through further to get back to the heart and it raises the temperature of the testes temperature is the enemy of testy they to be five to ten degrees cooler than the rest the body soarsanais particularly bad for sperm production they can be bat when you say can be a telling could one safely be in the sand a would you want go back and forth between the cold an son am is there any are there any data if some one is having in fertility then i tell them to avoid all sands empirically if some one has a if there are not in fertile but they have a low sperm count i also tell them to avoid however it is mostly a warmed water that can raise the temperature of the testes faster than the sand to hostile in things that sorted hot tub and egicoozy those are enemies number one an number to offer what about ice baths and cold showers for women any evidence that it can shift hormone output in women the it can it increases the a activity of debate adronargic receptors a even in the central iron system and atrocities as well it can do a few things it can slightly decrease a the drive for food which astrocides and made o agronargic receptors had a some medications that are way lost medicines also do similar things but a it it can be beneficial in women to but no evidence that it changes estrogen output in women correct nothing i know of me mother am peptides at a discussion these days about peptides peptize the curious being strings of a men asses as you mention the very steal small ones to two menoasses ell creating all thewy up to jolly peptides which has been many many a many monoacid there is many peptides that there is we five us do an entire episode about peptides but i think one of the reasons ism hearing much about peptides these days is that they are not called steroids that the names steroids a i think has been a has come to be associated with anabolic steroids in the contacts of ache a testosterone rage et camera but of course testosexcuse me estrogen as the steroid hormone right a there are other steroid hormones am as we both know but peptides are gaining increasing popularity i willing to go on records saying that you can be sure that many of the incredible transformations that you see in hollywood are the consequence of a peptide use and i put my am my name behind that a because ism well aware of people that uses to prepare for rolls but athletes use them and then everyday people are using them to for instance am immoral and testimonial and immoral and to stimulate a the release of growth hormone rather than taking growth hormone a b p we one five seven which is a essentially a synthetic gastric juice that normally a repairs the got they being used to treat injuries and there are other ones as well what can we say generally about peptides are they safe or they not safe what about for sing and are there any peptize that you think could be of particular use for people and we should probably also touch on peptize that people should not go anywhere near with a tenfootpole ye definitely peptides are very heterogeneses there is very dangerous ones and very safe ones my favorite peptide is the original peptide which is insolent insolent is a peptide and a less than a hundred years ago there is a scientist a studying insolent and at some point they saw that an animal had its died cured by insolent injeccured by insolent injection less than a year later they were injecting insolent into every type diabetic because it was saving their lives and yet insolent can kill you if you take it at the incorrect of ye just insolent should be prescribed by a doctor there is over the counter insolent a rely on or in p h but ideally your insolent is prescribed by your doctor for a your died a as its life saving peptize should be prescribed by doctors as well and there is several that a eft approved you mention a lot of different ones a let us start with tessamorlane tessimoralan was recently it you prove for something called lips destroy at happens where body fat is displaced into abnormal areas often as part of ads or severe burns things that and it helps re distribute this body fat and give people their quality a life back tessmorelan is a g h a h which i kind of loop into the category of g h a pes growth hormone releasing peptides it is only a couple of men acids different from endogenously produced growth hormone releasing hormone growth hormone itself is also a peptide it is a peptide hormone not a stern ad hormone you have a a different sematitrophs which are a very similar to growth hormone another fun fact is that h p l which is human placental lactose we love acranariet human placental lactagent is nearly identical to growth hormone a the growth hormone an pregnancy is not what causes the sugar spite and gestational ibexes it is the human placental laymen if you look at twin pregnancies if they have toplecentus or more placental tissue making more human placental lactygen the risk of gestational dibedies is exponentially higher this h p l is only a couple a molecule's different from growth hormone it is interesting that these different g h our hes in g h our peas actually have pretty different mechanisms of action grain is also a hormone that is released when you are hungry an this is probably one of the reasons why you have more growth hormone release overnight and there is a lot of peptides that are very similar to gremlin these peptides are not byway identical peptides but they just have a couple different a men acids change their almost identical and they problegan a be used in the future for growthormo deficiencies including in kids they have been studied somebody wants increase their growth for worn out but in addition to not eating within two hours of sleep getting go deep sleep a doing all the other things of in the six pillars that you mentioned early er especially resistance exercise a at some point earlier in the day what are the risks and benefits of taking a growth hormone releasing hormone peptide sirmorilin a prescribed by a doctor of course a what should one be concerned about a how long could one take these have even heard that they can modify get expression that they really are changing your hop with the helm's a in very long lasting ways ye a there is deafinny lot of risk tumor growth and cancer you look at a type one diabetic they have very high incidences a various types of cancer they have very high growth hormone but lo i gap one paradoxically they would likely give you a similar cancer risk to a type one diabetic that has very high a growth hormone however there are the benefits of it you think of lipolysis a decreased body fat increased a lean body mass a lot of those can you can use other things to get those benefits then you do not need growth hormone for those benefits tat just leaves cosmetic benefit to which you can usually use topical to get a your hair and your skin and your nails there is a lot of other things that you can do other than growth hormone a lot of people just do not need ts g h armies if there if they do not have lipodistropy or if they do not have growth honor deficiency there is other uses of them specifically in injuries i know that they have been studied a not surfeits in a military we mention the woodpecker or the two contract injury the harass anting back and for ran busy slamming up against it on the skull they all football heading the ball in soccer dealing people who used the fifty collar an military that is a fairly am small a population a and i think any one that is hit their head hard more than once a a we can talk about be c one five seven for a bet g h copper peptide for a bet a t b five hundred or a finis an bate for analogue and the we can also talk about a brimmalanotide which is llano tan three they have plankton one and two and the they also can a ten three and four yow let us talk about blow ye see one five seven and molanatan cause i think those of the ones that most people are am eyeing to speak be see one five seven as body protective compound one five seven it is a identical or by identical to gastric protective compound one five seven that is produced in the stomach as you age you get a trophy gastritis very often that is why you have less intrinsic factor which is kind of another peptide that bines tivideim and be twelve that is what you can get age related b twelve deficiencies that is one reason why you have more coitus more i verticulitus as you age you do not have that gastric protect compound it is a it increases edge a vascular endothelia growth factor which basically makes your blood vessels grow more s that is what a causes your body to form a blood vessel another medication known as a vision it is on the w a chose list of essential medications for canter many different types of cancer including coin cancer you treat it with a vision which is a edge fin hitter it if you have cancer or a my canter risk you probably do not one to be taking a medication that is the exact opposite mechanism of action as your essential anticancer me in other words if you have cancer or you are at rest of cancer of word be easy one five seven correct a lot of people prescribe it for six weeks and b p c one five seven brimalanotide that is eft approved for a hypoact of a sexual disorder that's a moral that is also proved for lippodistrophy interestingly male a another one of the malanotans is also approved for lippodistrophy and also a deficiency in the malady core to recept or the receptor that receives a the alphubalanocites stimilitan hormone it's a very rare condition it is also approved for that because if you do not take it than you get obesity but a be see one five seven is not of t approved but it is essentially standard of care this point a i would say it is a if you are not counting insolent or growth hormones peptides it is one of the most commonly used peptides an anecdotalist in some clinical literature it is fairly well tolerated for short periods of time ism not in the camp that everybody needs to do it two to three times a week or even daily for six weeks no matter what the major benefit is when you've going to take it early on because it is can allow your body to increase blood flow to the injured area and the less blood flow t has for example cartilage ligaments have horrible blood flow especially as people age it is goal to make a significant difference i would wager that that russia gymnast that aculei heard in one month it completely from a a full eruption was likely taking b piece in one five seven or something very similar ism willing to wager on that as well a remarkable recovery a and because it is presprescription there are non prescription forms my understanding of the non prescription forms in the danger of going after non prescription forms is that oftentimes they will contain what they claim they contain p easy one five seven in this case but they are not adequately cleaning out the l p s the lipopolisacaride which can cause inflammation fact in the laboratory we use el p s to deliberately induce fever and inflammation to study systemic inflammation this is a warning to people if your interested in peptides you absolutely need to work with a physician in my opinion get it from a really good compounding farmers who will clean out to that cleans out the l p s because if you are buying it through a source that lot of pop i soft ant a named sources but there the common sources on the internet that everyone knows about their buying these sources they will ship it to any one essentially but then the l p s is really causing inflammation and many people experience a kind of mild fever or tingling from that when they inject it a i can feel it working that is probably l p s action which is not good for the brain i do not know about it another prefer tissues have not heard of people dropping debt from the stuff yet but i certainly would not want to be investing any el p s unnecessarily would you agree you should work for the doctor after all you are a definitely talk to your doctor about this and talks them about the dosing regiment as well if they have you doing it for six weeks ask i why my doing it for six weeks why not two weeks or why not as soon as i feel better can i just stop it the there is a lot of good questions that that you should ask your doctor and if somebody is trying to prescribe you a bunch of different things than c is this what they prescribe everybody or as individualized for me there are peptides g h we copper peptide which is produced in dogenistly in the liver more at younger ages that is why the liver can regenerate folly as this the g h k copper petite helps and if your copper deficient which not a whole lot of people are but a lot of people that of had geriatric surgery are copper deficient g h c copper peptide can help significantly with your nervous system and it is also synergistic any growth agonists chemists invade a for made in kids in the fists which shrinks a that is another reason why kids heel really well that and g h k is somewhat synergistic with p p c but if you do not need all three you do not want them and if you do not need it for more than a week you do not want it for more than a week i really appreciate you saying that i often say that sometimes the best done of something to take is zero it is often that case of the best dosages zero you mention mana tan there are several kinds of milanatan i find it a little bit of a running conversation because it i first learn about milanatan from reading about peptides and discovering that people were taking injecting milanatan to get tan because it is in in the melon synthesis pathway they also discovered this is an individual this is reading about this in serious manuscripts an a previewed papers that u it could cause things priapism a sustain direction that might be the last one that any one would ever have because of damage to the to the evasculature t m also women taking milanatan as it as a way to get tan and lose body fat the sounds all very recreational are there any clinical usage o malanatan at separate from the kind of extreme bivouacking cosmetic world which is really not the main focus of this podcast ever wat more in terms of health pursuing health optimization a there is actually three it approved indications believe it are not not many people know about this but there is three well accepted indications one of them is the hypoact of sexual disorder and more in women that is for brimalanotide those there those are women that have essentially know libido whatsoever but other hormones art seem are inches classically it is a before menopause those hormonal issues are not contributing and a when you give them this peptide it is also as p t one for one at help significantly a toe times you use it in nasal spray it goes straight into the central nervous system and accentual you can also inject it and you can also take it for a troy men and women take it correct it is approved for women but it can also help men and it is relatively safe the only relative contraindication that i tell people and all o people say o there is no side effects that i know of but if you have a family history of melanoma or potentially have a melanoma and do not know about it that is why am a big advocate of aeroscope is well and regular skinchecks then theoretically it is gan it increase that alpha malanosite stimulating hormone and it can grow that a that is defiantly not a good thing am be very careful about longer administration of it it is also approved for lipodistriphy which is the same exact thing as tessimoraland which i believe its alsonon as a a vista or adrift and then it is also approved for the reargenetic condition where your a receptors or your malady sites do not proliferate as well usually have hypopigmentation it is not true albinism a but it is associated with morbid morbid obesity and very that poor outcomes from that childhood suits use in kids actually interesting peptides are a fascinating landscape but thank you for that i a deep dive into several of them and we we proudly return to you a to talk about peptize again in in the near future because i know there is a lot more there in a lot of interest i want a talk about the sixth pillar right just remind people you said diet exercise were appropriate colonic restriction managing stress sleep and sunlight are critical for every one at all ages to manage and optimize hormone health than of the six category which is a really intriguing one which is spirit which is a kind of unusual thing to hear coming from a medical doctor except that i have many colleagues and ism and indeed are a former director the national institutes of health francs calling as talked about this notion of spirit we talked about but belief of facts on this podcast before with alarum how one's understanding of the things that they you and the world in general really creates it an important effect on everything at the level of physiology notion psychology as a physician how do you conceptualize the spiritual aspect and how do you talk to patients about this giving that people walking into your clench a presumably have a bunch of different religious and not a religious backgrounds unsure some or eigtheas some are probably strong believers how do you deal with that and how should people think about this ye i believe it is it it is surprisingly well received you would not think at first glance that a patient really wants to talk about their spiritual health with their doctor but the way i think about it and the way that it really is is it is a vindiagram and you have a body in a mind and a soul and you cannot have one healthy without the other health even if your mental health is a phenomenal and even if your physical health as phenomenal the mental aspect of spirituality if that peace is not the than that is can effect your body physiologically as well and a allychrums done some excellent work there is also been a lot of other studies regarding prayer and ism a christian i believe in god and that gives me a lot of that resilient and mote ovation it gives me the the cornerstone or the ground work how i can interact with life and regardless of some ones and atheists are regardless of regardless of what someone believes as far as religion or the origin of the species they can know that their spirituality is going to have a profound effect on their mental and physical health as well people to compare metalize it they to talk to their doctor only about the physical health cause that is comfortable to do that they only talk to their pastor or homer us we know rekyhuler for their spiritual health and they just talk to their therapist or psychiatrist about their mental health but you to bring all three those things together a it is well known that interdisciplinary clients lead to improved patient outcomes and that is just disciplines within medicine that is just a doctors that a specializing in this or this this takes a step back and upper ain upper part of that tree before you reach those psychologies or the spliffs you have your you have your body in your mind in your soul to your spiritual health in your mental health and your physical health if you are a in line in all three those things that builds the corner stone for the rest of your earth and the rest of your life some one comes into your cleek and they say i their feeling one way in their body their feeling one way in their emotional life you run their charts you get their blood wore i and they are an atheist or they're agnostic i what are some of the six pillar practices that they can consider that are in keeping with the ism atheism er agnosticism am because have to assume that people who are i in participate or feel that they belong to you do not particular religioussect will have pertyulers prescriptive from those religion s a sects that will direct them towards particular types of prayer but hi would i somebody who does not have a a prescriptive coming to them from some other source what would they what could they do or would they do yes i certainly do not force prayer on anybody or anything that but it is my believe that being especially being an agnostic it is almost the hardest thing because if you are anathema than you have some ground working you have some spirituality even if it has to do with a the human spirits interaction with the environment things that cannot be physically explained well phenomenon the work that ally crumbed us but if you are agnostic you are still trying to find that i hope that everybody does find what they truly believe in as far as their own spirituality but ah yet that that is a a personal journey ah from a physician standpoint and even if of friends with him as well from a friend standpoint i do not to push anybody inane specific direction i do not think that everybody should believe what i believe and a i do not feel there should be any pressure for them to believe something different i think that there can be excellent physician patient reporter regardless of what of what we believe and what our backgrounds are ye am that is wonderful to here i can say without revealing any names that i have close colleagues that in every bin of this spectrum ut hard court aqueous hard your religious in different domains a different religions i do not know i do not know if i know many i diagnostic as to whether not i know any gnostics i should say i i it is not something that people commonly discuss but ism in the context of science in medicine but it is starting to happen more and more and certainly this issue of spiritualties is one of the areas in which negro science is asking a lot of questions what ism spiritual experience is really are interns of how they are grounded in the brain or not grounded in the brain i think it is a really interesting area for discovery and i appreciate that you a that you bring it up and you bring it open that in the non pressured way that you do i think that a it will stimulate a lot of thinking which is a ultimately the goal this podcast well i have one final question that i a a a listener insisted i ask and it is a very straightforward one i it is it is not at all occurdball and not at all related to what we were just talking about but it was the most common question when i told people that i was going talking to you which is is fine problematic for hormones is amazing i received hundreds of the same question about fine and since it is probably the most commonly use drug on the planet i know its taking us back into the very practical but in a inclosing i were not quite there abut inclosing is fine having a an effect one way o the other on testosterone estrogen or other hormones that a is positive negative ere neutral only f it effectrsly works on identify and it can actually slightly improve valor get us well but a negligible effect otherwise greatwell sorry to end on such a practical brass tax type of a type of question but i did promise to the listeners that i would a i would ask that question listen i want it sincerely

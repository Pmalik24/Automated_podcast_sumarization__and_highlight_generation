welcome to the superman laponcans disco science science pace to for i mindrhuberman and of a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day marks the first journal club episode between myself and doctor peter after for any of you that are not familiar with doctor peter after he is a medical doctrine m d who is in expert in all aspects of health and life span he is the author of a best selling book entitled outlive which is a phenomenal resource on all things health span and life span and he is the host of the very popular podcast the drive where he interviews various experts in all domains of medicine and scientists as well today peter and i hold our first on line collaborative journal club for those of you that are not familiar with what a journal club is a journal club is a common practice in graduate school and medical school where by students get together to discuss one or two papers to critique those papers and to really compare their own conclusions of those papers with the conclusions of the authors and to highland any h take always peter and i have been wanting to do a journal club together for a very long time and we decided to do that journal club and to record it for you to day you will be sitting in on the first superman a t a journal club by the way it could just have easily been called the area superman journal club and we will discuss two papers first peter is going to discuss a paper on met foreman which is a drug that many people are interested in for its potential roll in longevity i want a highline potential there he is going to compare that paper to previous findings on metforeman and by the end of that discussion he will advise as to whether or not he himself would take metforeman and whether or not other people might be well advised or ill advised to take metforeman based on the data in that paper and at this time then i present a paper which is about the placebo effect i have to imagine that most of you h we heard of the placebo effect but we it's interesting about the paper that we discuss today is that it shows that the placebo effect can actually follow a dose response its notches all or none it actually is the case that you can scale the degree of placebo effect depending on whether not your thinking you are taking lo doses moderate doses or hi doses of our particular drug and the particular drug that is discussed in the paper that i cover is nicotine for those of you that are interested in cognitive enhancement by way of pharmacology or frankly for people who are simply interested in how our beliefs can shape our physiology i think you'll find that discussion to be very interesting by the end of to day's episode you will not only have learned about two novel sets of findings one in the realm of longevity as it relates to met foreman and another in the realm of neurobiology and placebos or placebo effects but you will also learn how a journal club is conducted thin you will see and observing how we parch these papers and discuss them even arguing in them at times that what scientists an citations do is they take a look at the existing pure reviewed research and they look at that pure review research with a fresh eye asking does this paper really show what it claims to show or not and in some cases the answer is yes in another cases the answer is no what i know is for certain is that by the end of to day's episode you will learn a lot of science you will learn a lot about health practices some of which you may want to apply or avoid and you will learn a lot about how science in medicine is carried out before we begin id to emphasize at this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science in science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is relic sleep relic sleep makes customize mattresses to give you the best possible night sleep now sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance when we are sleeping well and enough mental health physical health and performance all stand to be at their best one of the anythings to getting a great night's sleep is to make sure that your mattress is tailor to your unique sleep needs heck sleep has a brief two minute quiz that if you go to their website you take that quiz an answer questions such as do you tend to sleep on your back your did your stomach you tend to run hot or cold in the middle the night may you do not know the answers to those questions and that is fine at the end of that two minute quiz they will match you to a mattress that is ideal for your sleep needs i sleep on the dusk do you ask my matters and when i started sleeping on a dusk mattress about two years ago my sleep immediately improve if you are interested in upgrading your mattress go to relic sleep do calm slash supermen take their two minute sleep quiz and they will match you to a customize mattress for you and you will get up to three hundred fifty dollars off any mattress order and two free pillows again if interested go to heck sleep do calm slash supermen for u to three hundred fifty dollars off and two free pillows to day's episode is also brought to us by levels levels is a programmed that lets you see how different foods and behaviors affect your health by giving you real time feed back using a continuous luck monitor one of the most important factors impacting your immediate and long turn health is the way that your body manages its blood glucose or sometimes refer to is blood sugar levels to maintain energy and focus throughout the day you want to keep your blood luck steady without big spikes or dips using levels you can monitor how different types of foods and different food comminations as well as food timing and things exercise combine to impact your blood luck s levels i start using levels a little over a year ago and it give me a lot of inside into house specific foods were spiking my blood sugar and then leaving me feeling tired for several hours afterwards as well as how the spacing of exercise and my meals was impacting my over all energy and in doing it really allowed me to optimize how i eat what i eat when i exercise and on such that my blood glucose levels and energy levels are stable throughout the day if you areinterested in learning more about levels and trying a continuous glucose monitor yourself go to levels dot link slash superman right now levels is offering an additional two free months of membership again that is level's dot link ally and k slash supermen to get two free months of membership and now for my journal club discussion with doctor peter a tea peter good to have you here agree to be here my friend this is something t you and i have been wanting to do for a while and it is basic something that we do all the time which is to peruse the literature and find papers that we are excited about for whatever reason and often times that will lead to a text dialogue or a phone call we are both but this time we have opted to try talking about these papers that we find particularly exciting in real time for the first time as this podcast form at first of all that people can get some sense of why we are excited about these papers we we do feel that i people should know about these findings and second of all that it is an opportunity for people to learn how to dissect information and think about the papers they hear about in the news the papers they might down load from submit if they are inclined suggest to start thinking scientists inclinations and get a better sense of what it looks to pick through a paper ism the god the bat in the ugly we are flying a little blind here which is fun i ism defy excited for all the above reasons ye now this is e you and have been talking about this for some time and and a actually we used to run a journal club inside to practice where once a most one person would a just pick a paper and you would go through and count of a formal journal club presentation we have got in away from a last you are just because we have been a little stretch then i think it something we need to resume because it is a it is a great way to learn and it is a skill people probably ask you all the time because i know i get asked all the time hey what are the us and do not of interpreting scientific papers is it enough to just read the abstract m and now usually answer is well no i but the how to is is tougher and i think the two papers we have chosen to day illustrate two opposite ends of the spectrum your on ops yo talk about something at we argon a probably get into the technical nature of the asses the limitations et camera and the paper ultimately have chosen to present although i apologize ism surprising you with this u until a few minutes ago is is actually very straightforward simple epidemeologic paper that i think has important significance i had originally gone down the rabbit hole on a much more nuanced paper about a t p binding cassettes in cluster absorption but ultimately i thought this one might be more interesting to a broader audience by the i con t tellyour holy story i had a dream last night about you and am in this dream you were obsessed with making this certain drink that was your editor and it had all of these crazy ingredients in it si on som tons of supplements an i but the one thing i remembered when i woke up cause i forgot most of them i was really trying hard to remember them one thing the you had in it was due you had to collect a certain amount of due off the leaves every morning to put into this dry who it is just found something that i would do and and but here is the best part you had you had a thermos of this stuff that had to be with you everywhere and all of your clothing had to be tailored with a special pocket that you could put the thermos into that you were never without the special drew drink and again how dreams when you are having them seem logical and real and the you wake up and your hat doesn't v make sense why would he want the thermos in his shirt that that would warm it up it all they but but by it was a realistic dream and there were lots of things in it including de spaspecial due off the leaves every morning i lo it well it is not that far from reality i big am fan a yeurbomati ism drinking it right now an d an i am in it is many forms usually the loose leaf i do not tend to drink it out the good my dads argentine that is where i picked it up is tour drinking it when i was five years old or younger which i do not recommend people to its heavily carny do not drink the smoke divisions either folks i think that was potentially carsonagenic but this thing the you describe of carrying round the thermos close to the body if you are ever in argue or if you ever spot grown men in a restaurant anywhere in the world carrying a thirst with them and to their meals and and hugging it close chances are there ruin and they are drinking your hamate they drink it usually after their meals postboy good for your digestion is not that far from from reality i do not carry the thermos but i do drink mate every day and ism us tart collecting do off the leaves just a few rocks every morning think why ah some other time we can talk about dreams recently have eve been doing some dream exploration have had some absolutely transformation dreams for the first time in my life one dream in particular that it has that allowed me to feel something have never felt before and has catalyzed a large number of important decisions in a way that no other experience waking or sleep has ever impacted me and this was drug free et camera and you think you could have had that dream we do not have to get in through it if you do not talk about t now but was there a lot of work you had to do to prepare for that dream to have taken place oh yes ye at least a eighteen months of intensive analysis type work with a very skills psychiatrist but i was not trying to seed the dream it was just i was at a sticking point with a certain process in my life and then i was taking a walk while waking and realized that my brain my subconscious was going to keep working on this i just decide it is going to keep working on it and then two nights later i travel to a meeting and aspen and i had the most profound dream ever i where i was able to send something and feel something have always wanted to feel as real within the dream woke up knew it was a dream and realize this is what people close to me that i respect have been talking about but i was able to feel it and therefore i can actually access ten in my waking life the twas as it was absolutely transformation for me i anyway sometime i can share more details with you ere the audience but for now i wish to talk about these papers very one i push go first i ism happy to go first try for this see ss a pretty step for paper been a talk about a paper titled reassessing the evidence of a survival advantage and type to diabetics treated with metforeman compared with controls without diabetes a retrospective cohort study s by matter homes keys and colleagues this was published a last fall i why is this paper important this paper is important because in two thousand fourteen a banister published a paper that i think in many ways kind of got the world very excited about performance is almost ten years ago and ism sure many people have heard about this paper even if they are not familiar with they have heard the concept of the paper and in many ways it is the paper that has led to the excitement around the potential for hero protection we have met format and i should probe jobs to find for the audience what hero protection means when we than nobly also sorry to interrupt what met foreman is just out of the uninforout that that is a great point is it'll start with with the latter metforeman is a drug that has been used for many years a depends where it was first approved i think was in rope i but you do not call it directionally fifty plus years of use as a first line agent for patience would type to i bodies ain the you less maybe forty plus years this is a drug that is been around for ever trade name a glucofage a grandame and a busboy we its you knows generic drug to day the mechanism by which met foreman works is debated hotly but what i think it is not debated is the immediate thing that met foreman does which is it inhibits complex one of the mitochondria again maybe just taking a step back the mitacondrea as everybody thinks of those is the cellular engine for making a t p o the most efficient way that we make a t p is through oxidate phosphorelation where we take either fatiacid pieces or a break down product of glue cost once its partial metabolized to prove we put that into an electron transport chain and we basically trade chemical energy for electrons that can then be used to make phosphates on to a d p it is you know you think of everything you do eating is taking the chemical energy and food taking the energy that is in those bonds making electrical energy in the mitochondria those electrons pomp radiant that allow you to make a t p to give u sense of how primal and important this is if you block that process completely you die everybody's probably herd of aconite rite ignite is something that is incredibly toxic even at the smallest doses scionide is a complete blocker of this process and if my memory serves me correctly i think it block complex for of the mitochondria do not if you recall if it complex thresh your complex for may i know a lot about toxins that in back the nervous system but i onto lot about the ways mitaconly an if ever you want to have some fun we can talk about all the dangerous stuff that animals make and insects make and how they kill you ye i got the throat any toxin and all these things at li going lar on younger i i really geek out on the stuff does allows me to talk about her science animals and scary stuff it is a combines us we can do that some am orphan maybe at the end if we have a few moments something dioxide that is a very potent inhibitor of this at electron transport chain will kill you instantly people understand that of course a drop of dioxide and you would you would be dead literally instantaneously motorman works at the first of those complexes i believe there are four of my memory serves correctly four electron transport chain a complexes and a but of course it is not a complete inhibition of it it is just cold of a weak blocker of that and the net effect of that is what for the net effect of that is that it changes the ratio of a denizens monophosphe to a denizens diphosphy a what is less clear is why does that have a benefit in diabetics because what it unambiguously does is reduces the amount of glucose that the liver puts out hepatic glucose output is one of the fundamental problems that is happening in type two diabetes you may recall i think we talked about the suntan press podcast you and i sitting here with normal blood sugar have about five grams of glucose in our total circulation that is it five grams think about how quickly the brain will go through that within minutes the only thing that keeps us alive is our livers ability to titrate out glucose and if it puts out too much for example if the glucose if the glucose level was consistently two teaspoons you would have type two diabetes the difference between being metabolically healthy and having you no profound type to diabetes is one teaspoon of glucose and your bloodstain the ability of the liver to tamp down on high glucose output is important motorman seems to do that can i jusask a a one question is it fair a to provide this really simplified summary of the to chemistry which is that when we eat the food is broken down but the breaking of bonds creates energy that then ourselves can use in the form of e t p and the mitacondraar central of that process and that get formal it is partially short circuiting the energy production process and even though we are eating when we have met foremen in our system presumably there is going to be less net glucose the bonds are onto be broken down we are chewing were digesting but less of that is turned into blood sugar glucose well sort of i mean it is not am it is not depriving you of ultimately storing bat energy what it is doing is changing the way the body a partitions fuel that is probably a better way to think about it to be a little bit more accurate am for example it is not depriving you of the calories that are in that glucose that would be fantastic but early that was the a electro let remember a elaztra from the ninety's olestra folks for those the do not remember am by the way if you ever ate the stuff you would remember ah because it was a fat that was am not easily digested it had in sorvanaligos to plant fire or something that is being put into potato chips and what not and the idea is that people would would simply excrete it am and i do not know what happened except that people got low stomach aches and a well the only li batter in the world we know that the anal seaside is what really did that prodigal see pitch only a physician because after all peter's a clinician for physician and empty and ism not am could find it a an appropriate term to describe when you have that a much when you have that much fat man absorption you used a to have accidents well and that that did away with that product you was either that or the diner industry was t en really agon why you do not hear about elestrsr we have got this drug were get this drug met form and it is considered a perfect first line agent for people would type to dialed again what is happening when your type to diabetes a the primary insult probably occurs in the muscles and it is insolent resistance everybody hears that term what dos it mean a insolent is a petite it binds to a receptor on a cell it's just talk about it through the lens of the muscle cause the muscle is responsible for most glucose disposal it get's glucose out of the circulation high glucose is toxic we have to put it away and we want to put most of it into our muscles that is where we store seventy five to eighty per cent of it when insolent binds to the insolent recapture a to a trypsin kinase is triggered inside just ignore all that but a chemical reaction takes place inside the cell that leads to a phosphorelation a t p donates a phosphate group and a transporter just think of a little tunnel a little straw goes up through the level of the cell and now glucose can freely flow in some sure you have talked a lot about this with your audience we things that move against radiance need pumps to move them things that move with radiance do not glucose is moving with its radiant into the cell it does not need active transport but it does need the transporter put there that requires the energy that is the job of insolent by the way i did not know that i mean i certainly no active in and passive transport as it relates to no transmitter an i on flow but i never heard that when insolent binds to a cell that literally will straw is placed into the membrane ones does not need a pump to move it in a because there is much more glucose outside to cell than insight it u but the energy required is to move the the straw up to the cell soggy is at is what happens is as an herald shaman at male did the best work on elucidating this as the intramuscular fat increases and i by intramuscular i mean intercellular fat a trial and dial glycerides accumulate in a muscle cell that signal gets interrupted and all of a sudden ism making these numbers up if you used to need two units of i stolen to trigger the little transporter now you need three and then you need four and then you need five you need more and more insolent to get the thing up that is the definition of insolent resistance the cell is becoming resistant to the effect of insolent and therefore the early mark of insolent resistance the canary in the coal mine is not an increase in glucose it is an increase in insolent normal glycerin with hyper insolenemia especially post prandial meaning after you eat hyper inslanemia is the thing that tells you hay your your five ten years away from this being a real problem fast forward many steps down the line some of you type too diabetes has long pass that system now not only are the insolent resistant where they just need a boat load of insolent which is made by the pancreas to get glucose out of the circulation but now that system's not even working well and now they are not getting glucose into the cell now their glucose level is elevated and even though it is continually being chewed up and used up because it again the brain alone would account for most of that glucose disposal the liver is now becoming insolent resistant as well and now the liver is not able to regulate how much glucose to put into circulation and it is overdoing it now you have too much glucose being pumped into the circulation by the liver and you have the muscles that cannot dispose of it and it is really a vicious brutal cascade because the same problem of fat accumulating in the muscle is now starting to happen in the pancreas and now the relatively few cells in the pancreas called data cells that make insolent are undergoing inflammation due to the fat accumulation within the pancreas itself and now the thing that you need to make more insolent is less effective it making insolent ultimately waywayway down the line a person wit type to diabetes might actually even require insolent exogenously could you share with us a few of the causes of type tudiabes of insolent resistance mean one itself his accumulating too much fat yes energy and balance would be an enormous one inactivity or insufficient activity is probably the single most importance when herald bellmen a was running clinical trials at male a they would be recruiting undergrads to study obviously cause you are typically recruiting young people and they would you no be doing these very detailed mechanistic studies where they would require actual tissue biopsies you new we an a biopsy somebody is quadriceps and actually look at what is happening in the muscle well i remember him telling ye this when i interview m on my podcast he said the most important criteria of the people we interviewed is cause they were still lean these were not people that were overweight but they had to be inactive you could not have active people in these studies exercising is one of the most important things you are going to do to ward off insolent resistance but there are other things that can cause and alone resistance sleep deprivation has a profound impact on insolent resistance i think we probably talked about this previously but if you u know som very elegant mechanistic studies where you sleep deprive people you let them only sleep for four hours for a week you will reduce their glucose disposal by about half where which is i mean that is a staggering amount yo you are basically inducing profound insolent resistance in just a week of sleep reprobation hypercordosolemia is another factor and then obviously energy and balance where when you are when you are accumulating access energy when you are getting fatter if you start spilling that fat outside of the subcutaneous fat cells into the muscle into the liver into the pantries all those things ore exacerbating it got it o enter met foremen first line drug most of the drug every drug you give a person wit type to diabetes is trying to address part of this chain some of the drugs tell you to make more insolent that is that is one of the strategies here are drugs sulphonioreas they tell the body make more insolent other drugs insolent just give you more of the insolent thing met foremen tackles the problem elsewhere it tamps down glucose by addressing the glucose dish the a hepatic luck's outlet channel gel pee one agonists or another drug they increase insolent sensitivity initially causing you to also make more insolent ism jealous o get tonetic yes ye and be is it true that berberine is more or less the poor man's met formal ye lots it from a tree market just happens to have these same properties of y y the a rent you in am tor and reducing the blood bluecoat end met formal by the way occurs from a lilac plant in france that is were it was discovered it is also metforeman is also based on a substance found in nature you you need a prescription for met foreman you do not need a prescription for beriberi but yet we can talk about berry loll the later i had couple great experiences with berberine and a couple of bad experiences interesting barber ye i may be taking one step back from this in two thousand eleven i became very interested in met foreman personally just reading about it obsessing over it and just somehow decided i should be taking this i actually began taking metforeman i still remember exactly when i started i started it in may of two thousand eleven and i realize that because i was on a trip with a bunch of buddies we went to the berkshire pathway a shareholder meeting which is a the buffet a shareholder meeting and a you now sou's cone a fun thing to do and i remember being sick the whole time because i did not straight up the dose of met foreman i just went straight to two grahams a day which has kind f the full dose and we went to the sat characteristic of your approach to things yes i think that is safe to say i him it'll give you the thirmnists of this due that i collect in the moral en i remember being sick that the whole time we were in ne brass i maxi guess i could not we went to dairy queen cause you do all the buffet things when you are there right i could not have an ice cream a dairy queen you could not man i could not noxious elks i would say if you got tat foreman in your system yoke in a afford locos you get for ice creme consider i was if i could not wen i could not keep anything dow i mean it was his own at clearly metforeman has this side effect initially which is a little bit of appetite suppression but regardless that is the story on met foreman there there are lot of reasons i was interested in it a i was not thinking true hero protection that term was not in my vernacular at the time but what i was thinking is hay this i don't help you buffer glucose better it is got to be better and this was sort of my first fore into self experimentation you wanted to fine hero protection yea you good torn to the beer geriatric hero ye the a hero from from geriatric old protections protection from aging and when we talk about a drug met foreman or caparison or even an a d and a these things the idea is were talking about them is hero protective to signal that they are drugs that are not targeting a specific disease of aging for example a pieces canine inhibiter is sort of hero protective but it is targeting one specific pathway which is cardiovascular disease and dislopodemia whereas the idea is a hero protective agent would target hallmarks of aging there are nine hallmarks of agent pleased do not ask me to recite them have never been able to get all nine straight but people know what we are talking about right decreased geophagy increase synessens decreased neutral sensing or defective neutriansensing a prodiomic instability genomic instability a methelation all of these things pungent changes those are all the nine o marks of e and seven eh a go protective agent would target those deep down biologic hallmarks of aging and in two thousand fourteen a a paper came out by banister that basically got the world focused on this problem by the world i mean the world of of antiaging what what banister and colleagues did was they took a registry from the ache and they got a set of patience who were on met foreman with the to diabetes but only met foreman these w we're people who had just progress to diabetes they were not put on any other drug just met foreman and then they found from the same registry a group of matched control this is a standard way that epidemiology studies are done because again you do not have the luxury of doing the randomization you are trying to account for all the braces that could exist by saying we are going to take people who a look just that person with diabetes can we match them for age sex so we cannot make status a blood pressure be ami everything we can and then let us look at what happened to them over time now again is is all happening in the future you are looking into the past it is retrospective in that sense and let me just cannot pull up he the sort of a table here i can can a walk through and this is not in the paper we talk about bat i think white's an important background they did something that at the time i did not really notice i did not notice what they did i probably did and i forgot but i did not notice this until about five years ago when i went back and looked at the paper and they did something called a a informative censuring the way the study work is if you were put on met foreman we are going to follow you if you are not on motorman ran follow you and we are going to track the number of deaths from any cause that occur this is called all cause mortality or a c m and it is really the gold standard in a trial of this nature or a study of this nature or even a clinical trial you want to know how much are people dying from anything are we are trying to prevent or delay death of all causes informative censuring says if a person whose on met foremen deviates from that inclusion criteria we will not count them in the final assessment how are the ways that that can happen while one the person can be lost to follow up to they can just stop taking their at formal three and more commonly they can progress to needing a more a significant drug all of those patients were excluded from the study think about that for a moment this is in my opinion a significant limitation of this study because what your basic my doing is saying we are only going to consider the patients who we are on met formal stayed on met formal and never progressed through it and we are going to compare those to people who were not having typed to diobedi an analogy here would be imagine we are going to do a study of two groups that we think are almost identical one of them are smokers and the other are identical in every way but their not smokers and we are on to follow them to see which ones get long cancer but every time somebody dies in the smoking group we stop counting them when you get to the end you are going to have a less significant view of the health status of that group with that caviar the banister study found a very interesting result which was the crude death rate am was and by the way the way these are done this is also one of the challenges of epidemiology's the math gets much more complicated you have to normalized death rate for the amount of time you study the people everything is normalized to thousand person years the crude death rate in the group of people with type to diabetes who were on met formal including the censoring was fourteen point for fourteen point for deaths occurred per thousand patient ears if you looked at the control group it was fifteen point to this was a startling result and i remember reading this in again two thousand fourteen and being holy cat this is really amazing is there a could you explain why was a a i here those numbers than they do not seem that striking it is the difference of about a year and a half now of you rest a difference of about a year and half an life atman is is well ai r more natal it does not even translate to that voting a step back diabtyeto diabetes on average will shorten your life by six years i say that is the actuarial difference between having typtodibedes and not all comers but you are right this is not a huge difference it is only a difference of the little less than one year of life per thousand patient years studied bothered by the way a pear to point out my my half was wrong when i d y year and half but but the the point here is you would expect the people in the met foreman group to have a far worse outcome i e to have a far worse crude death rate and the fact that it was statistically significant in the other direction and it turned out on what is called a cop's proportional hazard which is where you actually model the difference in lifespan the people who took met foreman and had diabetes had a fifteen per cent one five fifteen per cent relative reduction in all cause death over two point eight years which was the median duration to follow up all that tons o not the number that makes me go will ye right that a because because you repeat those numbers yen yet fifteen per cent reduction in all caused mortality over two point years s ideal it is and again there is no clear explanation for it unless you believe that met foreman is doing something beyond helping you lower blood glucose because the difference in blood glucose between these two people was still in favor of the non diabetics again the proponent of met foreman being a hero protective agent and i put myself in this category at one point i would put myself to day in the category of undecided but at the time i very much believed this was a very good suggestion that met foreman was doing other things you me mentioned a couple already mat foreman is a week an hitter of em tour mat foreman produces inflammation mat foreman potentially tamps down on honestest cells and their secretory products there are lots of things met foreman could be doing that are off target and it might be that those things are confirming the advantage as many of have been taking a g one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsoring the pod cast a g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundational nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but oftentimes i simply cannot get enough servings but with a g one ism sure to get enough fitments and minerals and the robotics that i need and it also contains adaptagens to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to take sgrighte for all these reasons whenever ism asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a g one if you would to try a g one they will to drink a g one dot calm slash supermen to claim a special offer he'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of item in d three k to again that is drink a g one dot calm slash supermen cast forward until a year ago and i think most people took the banister study as count of the best evidence we have for the benefits of met foreman and ism sure you had lots of people come up to you and ask you should i be on met foreman should i be on met formalin i probably gout asked that question almost as much as ism asked any question outside of do i mean people definably o enough you should be consuming you but but after that it is met for rest off the leaves has to be while feeling morning unlike solo let us let us kind of fast forward to now that the paper that i wanted to spend a few more minutes on and thanks for that background i ism still i dazzled by the insertion of the straw by way of of insolent i i i only have heard that described i needs i i need to go get a better textbook it is a pretty short straw in terns younowits just it just a little you a just i just a to give people sense to yum said dazzle by i am always fascinated by how quickly how efficiently and am how specifically biology can create these little praying complexes that do something really important an you are talking about an demand creation off a portal right going t these are cells engineering their own machinery and real time an response to chemical sign let remind is it that is it is great yet the think but ism ism sure of rusty on my narrow science but an action potential works in reverse the same way you need the t p gradient to restore the a to restore the gradient but once the action potential fires its passive outside right yes o what pears referring to is am the way that neurons become electrically active as by the flow of ions across the see that from the outside the cell inside the cell and if we have both active conductance mean their trigger by electric changes in the radiance it by a changes an electrical potential am and then they're pass radiance for things can just flow back and forth until there's a balance equal ut inside an outside the cell i think what is am what is different is that there is of movement of a lot of stuff inside of neurons when euro transmitters opening bines to its receptor and then a bunch of it is a bucket brigade that gets kicked off internally but it is not often that hereabout receptors getting inserted into fairy you win normally at they go through a process of a transcribing cents and making sure that the specific prolines are made and then it does are long slow things tot take place over the course of many hours or days whet you are talking about as a real on demand insertion aroma channel and it make sense as to we that would a be required what its just o very cool cool desk and collins came along and said we would to redo the entire banister analysis am and i think the motivation for it was the interest in this top i is through the roof there is a clinical trial called the tame trial that is i think pretty much funded now and may be getting under way soon the tame trial which is an important trial is going to try to ask this question prospectively and through random assignment this is the targeting aging with tat formal trial correct near basal a is probably the senior p i on that a and i think in many ways the bannister study along with some other studies a but of lesser significance probably provided some of the motivation for the tame trial they said of we look were going to do this we are going to use a different cohort of people the first study that we just talked about the banister study used a i believe it was roughly they sampled ninety five thousand subjects from a u k big bank here they used a larger sample they did about half a million people sampled from a a a danish health registry and they did something pretty elegant they created two groups to study the first was just a standard replication of what banister did which a was just a group of people with and without diabetic that they tried to match as perfectly as possible but then they did a second analysis in parallel with discordant twins same see twins that only differed in that one had diabetes and one did not i though this was very elegant because here you have a degree of genetic similarity and you have similar environmental a a factors during childhood that might give you you soft allow you to see if the is any sort of difference in signal now turning this back into a littlest of a journal club virtually any clinical paper you are going to read table one is the characteristics of the people in the study you always one to take a look at that when i look at table one here you can see its and by the way just for people watching this we arena to make all these papers and figures available if your do not don't we will have nice show notes that ill make all this clear table one in the keys paper shows the baseline characteristics and again it is almost always can be the first table in a paper use see the first figure in the paper is a study design it is usually a fly chart that says these are the inclusion criteria these a all people that got excluded this is how we randomized et camera and you can see here that there are four columns that the first two are the singletons these are people who were not related and then the second two are the twins who were matched and you can see remember how i said they sampled about five hundred thousand people you can see the numbers they got seven thousand eight hundred forty two singletons on met foremen the same number then they pulled out matched without diabetes on the twins they get nine hundred and seventy six on met foreman with diabetes and then by definition nine hundred and seventy six to twins without them and you look at all these characteristics what was their age upon entry how many were men what was the year of indexing when we got them what medications were they on what was their highest level of education marital status et camera the one thing i want to call out here that really cannot be matched in a study this this is a very important limitation is the medication look at look at that column drew notice how pretty much everything else is perfectly matched until you get to the medication list that is all of place ye just you it is not even clothes they are nowhere they are nowhere near matched right another were just to give you couple of examples on the and let us just talk about the singletons could especially the same story on the twins if you look at what fraction of the people would type to diabetes are on lipid lowering medication it is forty five point six per cent verses fifteen point four per cent in the matched without diabetes it is a three ex different what about antiplatelets there that is thirty per cent verses fourteen per cent any high extensive sixty five per cent fir sixty thee per cent verse is thirty one percebecause people w h o have one health as you and our taking that foreman are likely to have other healthier exact fly this is again a fundamental flaw of epidemiology you can never remove a the confounder e the s we became an experimental scientists gets that we could control variables that is right because without random assignment you cannot control every variable now you will see in a moment when we get into the analysis they go through three levels of corrections but they can never correct this medication one just keep them tho back your mind oke the two big things that were done in this experiment or in this survey study to differentiate it from banister was one the twin trick which i think is pretty cool the second thing that they did was they did a sensitivity analysis with and without in formative censuring on of the things they wanted to know us hey does it really matter if we do not count the met form an patients who progress a let us see count of what what transcribed the next figure figure to upon me the next table table too walks you through the crude a mortality rate in each of the groups the most important row i think in this table is the one that says crude mortality per thousand person years now you recall that in the previous study in the bannisters study those were on the ball park of about fifteen our oke let us look at each of these in the am single the singletons with without the non twins who were not diabetic it was sixteen point eight six can you put a little more contour on what this thousand person years what what it is i tie m up pooling the lifespans of a of of a bunch of different people until you get to the number one thousand ya because you are normalizing not it is not who is get a love a thousand years cause of e expecting that am your sensually take to we you have got some people that are en to live om seventy six years fifty two years ninety one years and you are pooling all of those until you hit a thousand and then that becomes kind of a a a ad it is a normalized division you are basely likes to let us ay the the control group o asking if there were a thousand person years available to live how likely is it that this person would live another yes o couple ways to this aboutsimp taking a step back we always have to have some way of normalizing when we talk about the mortality from a disease cancer in the population we would we report it as what is the mortality rate our and it is typically per hundred thousand persons that is a much more intuitive way to express it it is but the reason we can do it that way is because we are literally looking at how many people died this calender year and we divide it by the number of people in that age group is typically what you are doing when you look at aged groups in buckets of decades that is why we can say the highest mortality is people ninety and up even though the absolute number of deaths is small it is because there is not that many people there it the majority of deaths in absolute terms probably occur in the seventh decade but as you go up because the denominator is shrinking you have to normal lives to its we just normalized to the number of people here are all the people that started the year here all people that ended the year what is the deathly why are these done in a slightly more complicated way because we we we do not follow these people for their whole lives were only following them for a period of observation in this case roughly three years to say something we have a crude death rate of five deaths per thousand person years one way to think about that is if you had a thousand people and you followed them for one year you would expect five to die if you had five hundred people and you followed them for two years you expect five to die if you have a thousand people and you follow them for one year you expect five to die those would all be considered equivalent moralities great thank you for glotnow o this this stuff is i mean i find i find epidemiology when you get in the weeds is what more complicated than following the basic of a experimental stuff where you just you get to push all the stuff into the garbageman and just say where to take this number of people or an exclude this group organarandomize ignore what happens that is the paper will tog about now when you a just for age and they do not show it in this table it is only in the text when you a just for age a very important check to do is what is the crude death rate of the people on met foreman who are not twins verses who are twins now in this table they look different because it is twenty four point nine three for the met formal group and twenty one point six eight for the twin group in that is on met foreman when you a just for age they rearmost identical it is it goes from twenty nine point twenty four point nine three to twenty four point seven one other point it'll make here for people who are going be looking at this table is a you will notice there are parentheses after every one of these numbers what is that what is that offer in there those parentheses are offering the ninety five per cent confident interval for example to take the number twenty four point nine three is the crude death rate of how many people are dying who take metforeman what it is telling you is we are ninety five per cent confident that the actual number is between twenty three point to three and twenty six point six for if a ninety five per cent confidence interval does not cross the number zero it is statistically significant so the first thing that just jumps out at you i think when you look at this is there is c early a difference here between the people who have diobedies and those who do not it complicates the study a little because it is basically two studies in one but you are comparing a ninety five per me a twenty four point nine three to sixteen point eight six t which by the way remains after age adjustment when you go to the twin group it is twenty four point seven three to twelve point nine for maybe just assume out for that what you are describing if i understand correctly is this a crude deaths per one thousand person years let us just talk by the singletons the on does is sixteen point eight six o sixteen point eight six people die and some people writhing how can point eight six of a person die while it is not always full numbers but there is there is a bad joke to be made here but i just call it seventeen berth is twenty five r seventeen deaths per thousand verses twenty five deaths and the twenty five is in the folks that took at foreman now that to the naive listener and me means oh you'll met formal basically kills you i a not a faster or you are more likely to die but we have to remember that these people have another they have a major health issue that the other group does not have hit is right because people were not a signed drug or not a sign drug it was not placebo drug it is let us look at people taking this drug for a bad health issue and compare to everyone else that is right now you have to go into and and it'll just sort of skip the next figure but the next figure is a caplin yer curve i think it isectoly worth lunatic cause they show up in all sorts of studied you look at figure one it is a caplin mere curve which is a mortality curve you will see these in any study that is looking at death and this can be prospective randomized this can be retrospective but these are always going to show up and i think it is really worth understandingwht a caplin mere curve shows you wen the exact is is always time and on the axis is always the cumulative survival it is a curve that always goes from zero to one one or one hundred per cent and it is always decreasing monotonically meaning it can only go down or stay flat it can never go back up that is what a cumulative a mortality curve looks and now we are looking at starting at alive and you precooking how many people die for every year that passes that is right and in each curve there is one on the left which is the matched singletons and there is one on the right which are the discordant twins you have two lines you have those that were on metforeman with type to diabetes and you have their matched controls in this figure the matched controls are the darker lines and the people with typetodiabdes on metforemant that is the lighter line you will also notice and i the way they have done it here they have got shading around each one we should mention for those that are just listening that in both of these grafts the am downward trending line from the controls get nondiabetic not taking met foremen is a bulge the line a corresponding to the diabetics who are taking met foremen om put crudely om the people who are taking that formal tho have diabetes are dying at a faster rate for every single year examine the two lines do not overlap except at the beginning when everyone is alive it is a foot race where baby thou people with met foremen and diabetes are falling behind and dying as they fall that is right and ism glad you brought up a good point it is not uncommon in treatments a to see japan mire curve's cross they do not have to it is not a requirement that they never cross it is only a a requirement that their monotonically decreasing or staying flat have seen cancer treatment drugs where they have two drugs going head to head in a cancer treatment and one starts out looking really really bad but then all of a sudden it kind of flattens while the other one goes bad and then it actually crosses and goes underneath but that is not the case here ts to your point the people with diabetes taking met foreman in both the match singletons and the discordance are dropping much faster and they always stay below and i bus just on to say that the shading is just showing you in ninety five per cent confidence interval you are just putting basically error bars along this if this were experimental data if you were doing an experiment with a group of mice and you were watching their survival and you ere what you you would have error bars on this which you're actually measuring this is because you have much more day to hear you are just showing this in this fashion for those that haven a been familiar as to statistics no problem a aerators correspond to give you r just in a measure the heights of of a roomful of tenth graters you there is gong to be arranged why you have the very tall kid and the an the very a shorter kid and yuan the short kid and the medium ken and there is arranged there's can be an average a mean and then they will be standard deviations and standard errors and am i these confidence intervals just get give a sense of how much range of some people am die i early some people die late within a given year there can o be different ages a it these aerators can account for a lot of different forms of versatility here you seeing about the versatility is how many people in each group die we are not tracking one diabetic takin met former verses ism a control i i should have asked us earlier but ism well and it is also a mathematical model at this point to that smoothing it out has notice its running for the full eight years even though they are only following people for typically i think the medium was three or four years at a time they are using this quite complicated type of mathematics called a cock's proportional hazard which is what generates hazard rations and basically any model has to have some error in it and they are basically saying this is the ai her you could argue when you look at that figure we do not know exactly where the line is and there but we know it is in that shaded area it my if that sort it make one other point if those shaded areas overlapped you could not really make the conclusion you would not know for sure that one is different from the other yet that is i shad good opportunity to to a raise a common myth which is a lot of people when they look at a paper wet say it is a barograph and they see these arrears and they will say people often think oh if the arrears overlap it is not a significant difference but if the arrears do not overlap beaning there is enough separation than that is a real and meaningful difference and that is not always the case it depends a lot on that form of the experiment i often see some of it the more robust twitter battles over how people are reading grafts and i think it is important remember that you run the statistics aholpuly the correcstatistics for the for the sample u but determining significance whether not that the result could be due to something other than chance of course your confidence in that increases as it becomes typically p values pe less an point erasers er to one per cent chance that it is do chance rites o very low probably p lesson point or five fence to be the kind of gold standard cut off but when your time about data these which are repeated measures over time people are dropping out literally overtime you are saying they have modeled it to make predictions as to what would happen we are not nearly looking et you would had data point at the had data was in the previous table that is now taken and run through this cox model and it is smooth out on it and to your point about the barographs my i think the other thing you always want to understand is just because something does not achieve theistical significance the only way you can say it is not significant as you have to know what it was power red to detect em in statistical power is a a very important concept that probably does not get discussed enough but before you do in experiment you have to have an expectation of what you believe the difference is between the groups and you have to determine the number of samples you will need to assess whether or not that difference is there or not you use something it is is called a power table and you you would go to the power table of you if you are doing treatment averse is treatment be and you say well i think treatment a is going to have a fifty per cent response and i think treatment be will have a sixty five per cent response you literally go to a power table that says fifty per cent response fifteen per cent difference that gives you a place on the grid and i want to be ninety per cent sure that i am right ninety per cent power ism being a little bits to can be a thatisition listening to this who is going to on to kill me but this is directionally the way we would describe it and that tells you this is how many animals or people you would need in this study you are in a need a hundred and forty seven in each group and by the way if you now do the experiment with a hundred and forty seven and you fail to find significance you can comfortably say there is no statistical difference at least up to that fifteen per cent there may be a difference at ten per cent but you were not powered to look at ten per cent and o very important point that you are making another point is just a more general one about statistic in general the way to reduce variability in a at a set is to increase sample size then can make sent right if you if i just walk into a tenth great glassing limit measure height a i lit up by the first three kids that i see and i happen to look over there an it is the three that all plan the volley balls together i my sample size is small and ism likely to get a skew to refer sensation in this case taller than average increasing sample size tends to decrease variation seldom that is why when you hereabout a study from the puca biobank or from a half a million danish citizens for instance in this study that is those are enormous sample sizes even though this is a not an experimental study its in epidemiological observational study a there's tremendous power by way of the enormous number of subjects an that the way that epidemiology will make up for its deffest you could never do randomize assignment study on half a million people a you de in it epidemiology makes up for its biggest limitation which is it can never compensate for inherent biases by saying we can do infinite duration if we want we could we could survey people over the course of their lives and we can have the biggest sample size possible cause this is relatively cheap the cost of actually doing in experiment where you have tens of thousands of people as prohibitive and if you look at the woman's health initiative which was a five years study on i do not know what was at fifty thousand women a man that was a billion dollar study this is this is the balancing act between epidemiology and randomize prospective experiments and they they both offer something but you just have to know the blind spots of each one i to take a quick break and acknowledge our sponge a inside tracker inside tractors a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood engine to help you better understand your body and help you meet your health gulls ism a big believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your mediate and long turn health can only be analyzed from a quality blood test however with a lot of blood tests out there you get information back about blood limits about hormones and on but you do not know what to do with that information with inside tractor they have a personalized platform that makes it very easy to understand your data that is to understand what those lipids with those hormone levels at camera mean and behavioral supplement nutrition another protocols to adjust those numbers to bring t em into the ranges that are ideal for your immediate and long term health inside tracker's ultimate plan now includes measures of both ago b and of insolent which are key indicators of party of vascular health and energy regulation if you a try inside tracker you can visit inside track dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off any of inside trackers plans again that is inside tracker dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off let us just can a wrap this up i mean i think less just go to table for which i think it is the most important table a in in here which now lays out the that the final results in terms of the hazard rations this is this is the way we want a really be thinking about this again hazard ratios a these are important things to understand a hazard ratio is in number and you always subtract one from the hazard ratio and that tells you if it is a positive number if it is a number i sort of it is number great than one you subtract one and that tells you the relative harm if the hazardratios one point five you subtract one point five is a fifty per cent increase in risk a if the number is negative you may recall on the banister paper the hazard ratios point eight five when it is nesting what that means it is a fifteen per cent reduction in relative risk and here you can see all the hazard rations are positive what it is telling you here is and i want a walk through this cause its there is a lot of information packed here you have got singletons you have got twins there showing you three different ways that they do it they do an unadjusted model if you just look at the singletons with and without met foreman and you make no adjustments the hazard ratio is one point for eight meaning the people on met foreman had a forty eight per cent greater chance of dying in any given year then they are non diabetic counterpart the only reason of smiling its not cause i enjoy people dying quite a quite to the contrary is that am this is novel for me that give redeem ofdemeological studies before but its not normally where i spend it the majority of my time but up until now i was singing o gape people taking that foreman are are dying more than those that are an i just and i them just relieve to know that i was not am looking all this backwards e they are dying more but of course we do not have a group that is taking that foreman who does not have diabetes and we do not have a group am who to has diabetes and a is taking that form and plus something else again whet were only dealing with these constrained yet now there is of others arm to this study that ism not getting into cause it adds more complexity which is they also have another group that is got diabetes takes heat formal and take sulphone areas which is er a bigger drug and those people die even more who which again thetveeks to the point right the more you need these medications they are never able to race the effect of diabetes but in this case it seems that they might be accelerating possibly accelerating death do the diabetes possible we could never know that from this because we are we do not see we would need to see diabetics who do not take that foreman who take nothing and i would bet that they would do even worse my intuition is that the met formal is helping but not helping nearly as much as we thought before my point is they make another set of adjustments they say one will look in the first one in the unadjusted model we only matched for age and gender that is pretty crude what if we adjust for the medications they are on the cardiac vascular psychiatric pulmonary to mention mess and marital status i oft know why they through marital status in there but they did o know may be being married or unmarried ism sure all admit just hat's a random thing to throw in with all their mess i would have personally done that adjustment higher up but nevertheless if you do that all of a sudden the a hazard ratio drops from one point for eight to one point three two which means yet you still have a thirty two per cent greater chance of dying in any given year all right what if we also adjust for the highest level of a education along with any of the other covariaus while it does not really change it at all it ends up at one point three three or a thirty three per cent chance increase in date always knew that more school long in a same was it is not to jack now let us do it for the twins if you do the twin study which you could argue is a slightly purer study because you at least have one genetic an environmental thing that you have attached the unadjusted model is brutal two point one five that is a hundred and fifteen per cent think about this these are twins who in theory are the same in every way except one has diabetes in one dozen and that one with diabetes in met foreman still has a hundred and fifteen per cent greater chance of dying than the non diabetic coat twin when you make that first adjustment of all the mess and marital status i you bring it down to a seventy per cent increase in risk and when you throw education in it goes up to an eighty per cent chance of risk now they did this really cool thing which was they did the analysis on within without censoring everything i just said here was based on no censoring tell me about censor censoring is when you stop counting the met formal people who have die so in the singleton group when you adjust it and the reason ism doing the unadjusted is that is where they did the sensitivity analysis i do not think it really matters that much it is yours have to draw line in the sand somewhere you will recall that that was a forty eight per cent chance of increased mortality all cause mortality if you stop counting if you if you upon me if you do not censor meaning if you include everybody including when people on met foreman with diabetes die if you censor them it comes down to one point three nine in other words this a very important finding it did not undo the benefits that we saw in the banister study banister saw a fifteen per cent reduction in mortality when they censored when keys censored it got better but not that much better it went from forty eight to thirty nine per cent in the twins it went from a hundred and fifteen per cent down to only ninety seven per cent in some ways this presents a little bit of an enigma because it is not entirely clear to me having read these papers many times exactly why bannister found such an outlined it such a different response there is another earth there is another technical detail of this paper which is they you can see on the right side of table for they did something called nested case control but you will see and i was going to going to a long explanation of what nested case controls are it is another pretty elegant way to do case control studies where you sample by year and you you you sort of normal lot you you do not count all the cases at the end you count them one by one i do not think it is worth getting in to and because it does not change the answer you can see it changes it just slightly but it does not change the point the point here is the newspaper makes it undeniably clear that in that population there was no advantage offered by met foreman that undid the disadvantage of having type to diabetes this does not mean that met foreman was not helping them because we do not know what these people would have been without met foreman it could be that this bought them a fifty per cent reduction in relative mortality to where they would been but what it says is in ma way this is what you would have expected this is what you would have expected ten years ago before the banister paper came out or maybe even before met foreman was used because in some ways it saying what is the likelihood that sick people who are on a lautomedication are going to die compared to not sick people who are not on a on medication you one of it is not quite that simple in the in the sense that as you said there are ways to trying isolate met foreman contribution somewhat him because they are on a bunch of other mess and presumably that was done an analyzed in in other figures where they they consort of try they can never attach the results specifically to that foreman right but am there must be some way of waiting the percentage theater on psychiatric mess or not on psychiatric medias some way to teas out whether not there is actually some contribution a met foreman to this result well that is what they are doing in in be in the n the partial adjustment is their actually can there actually doing their best to say all right marriage ore not many there going very solitary drug by drug all the way through high blood pressure non high blood pressure smoking non smoking et camera right in the way they would do that presume is by saying o cane mark not marry that sat that is a simple one u are you on lipid lowering mess yes or no of you are not you are not they and then comparing those crispy yes and note no difference is jumping out that can be purely explained by these other various yes although again this is this a great opportunity to talk about why no matter how slick you are no matter slick your model as you cannot control for everything there is a reason that to my knowledge virtually every study that compares meat eaters to non meat eaters finds an advantage amongst the non meat eaters and we can talk about all i span advance yes an we can er disease incidents o studies and yet might be tempting to say what their fore eating meat is bad until you realize that it takes a lot of work to not eat meat that is a very very significant decision that a person for most people has a very significant decision a person makes and for a person to make that decision they probably have a very high conviction about the benefit of tat to their health and it is probably the case that that their making other changes with respect to their health as well that are a little more difficult to measure anther's a million other problems with that picked a silly example because the whole meat discussion then gets in to well when when we say eating meat what do we mean we n as i can is a belly me berg's gray there were we know it dear that you hunted with your ball e rate how do we get into all the things but my point is it is very difficult to quantify some of the intangible differences and i think that even a study that goes to great lengths as this one does epidemiological to make these corrections can never make the corrections and for me the big take away of this study is one this makes much more sense to me than the banister paper which never really made sense to me and again i was first critical of the banister paper in two thousand eighteen about four years after comment that is about the time i stopped taking at foreman by the way i stopped taking it for a different reason which we can talk about in a sect but a that was the first time i went back and said wait a minute this information the s is informative censuring thing is that is a little fishy and i think we were not looking at a true group of real type to diabetics now that is said maybe it does not matter in other words maybe and even even the keys paper does not tell us that met foreman would not be beneficial because it could be that those people if they were on nothing as their matched cohorts were on nothing would have been dying it a hazard ratio of three and this brought it down to one point five in which case you would say there is some hero protection there it is putting the breaks on this process all of this is to say absent a randomized control trial we will never know the answer has there been a randomize control chat not a mat of image not not when it comes to a hard outcome now there has been why akee p the interventions testing programmed a which is kind of told standard for animal a studies which as run out of three labs it is it is an and i age funded program that is run out of three labs they a they basically testmolecules for hero protection a the step was the first study that really put rape mice on the map in two thousand nine that was the study tit is fortuitously demonstrated that even when rape bison was given very very late in life it was given to sixty month old mice it is still a ordered them a fifteen per cent a life span extension has a similar she been done in humans it is ha imine hard now we cannot really control with rape mice no a but when the it p studied met foreman it did not succeed the the there have not been that many drugs that have worked in the i t p the stipe is very rigorous right it is a it does not use an inbred strain of mice it is done concurrently in three labs with very large sample sizing and when something works in the i t p it is pretty exciting caparison has been studied several times it is always worked another one we should talk about it an subsequent time is seventeen alpha estrodiale this continues to work in male mice and it produces comparable effects to rape mice estrogen does not work in nammailrice make but this is alpha not data this is seventeen alpha estrodyle not data estrodyle which is the strobile that we all that that is available and always and and i just as a briefaside am think you and i basically agree that a unless it is a problem males retire postpubrity am should try and have their estrogen as high as possible without having negative symtomology because of the importance of estrogen for legit for brain function tissue bone health bone health not this idea rushing estrogen and raising testaostron is just silly right there is not alert just leave raising testosterone out of it but many of the approaches to raising testosterone that a pharmacologic in nature also raise estrogen a lot of people thing push down on estrogen and that is just again unless people are getting a hybrestrogenic effects onacomastya or other issues is the exact wrong direction go you want estrogen a estrogen is a very important hormone for men and women that is a canada lots in and estrialty two in hitter also very successful in the i t p but again interestingly salami a a metforma not motorman has failed in the it p you no longer taken that for me i stopped five years ago you are not a diabetic presume my you are taking i o taking it for jeurope protection to buffer but glucose you bean an order madly actually of longer yes exactly and the reason i stopped in this all b the last thing before we move on wat cause you could not go to the dairy queen at the buffalo finally the nausea went away after a few weeks sir month maybe am but once i got really into lactate testing i noticed how high my lactate was a at rest a resting fast at lactate should be in a healthy person should be below one some were between point three point six milimole and only when you start to exercise should lactate go up and an two thousand eighteen was when i started blood testing for my zone to previously when i was doing zone to testing i was just going off my power meter and tartrate but this is when this is after it'd met and you go son man and i started wanting to use the lactate threshold of two milimole as my as my determinant if where to put my wattage on the bike and ism to in finger pricks before i start and ism one point six milimole an ism t how is going on i cannot be one point the i rand the a flight stairs up the back of the emparsapa well no that would put me a lot higher great but but an an anointing generous to your ah no but but but that is when i started dig a little digging and realized oh what this totally make sense if you have a weak mitochondrial taxi what a you going to do you are gin a shunt more glucose into private and more private into lactate ism ism anaerobe yet you need not an ala on fuel source that is right and then my zone two numbers just seem off my lactate could you feel it saurian jo did you feel it in your body cause maybe now it'll just briefly describe i took beriberi am it i a during the period of maybe somewhere in the two thousand twelve to two thousand fifteen scratch i do not re i what you taking it for well tell you i i was and i still am a big fan of them premises a slow carol hydra yet because i liked to me and vegetables and starch as i'manominabore and i found that it worked very quickly got me very lean i could exercise i could think i could sleep all i a lot of my a rational for following one eating regiment or another what i e is to enjoy myself but also have mental energy it because if i cannot sleep at night ism not in replenish i wen i i do not replenish how when i feel garbage i do not care how lean i am or o i found the slow care died to be which was in the for hour body to be a very good plan for me was pretty easy you drop some things bread at camera you do not drink calories i except after a resistance training session t camera but one day a week you have this called cheat day and on the cheat day anything goes and i would eat it acrodonts and then it alternate a sweet stuff and then i go to s and by the end of the day you do not want to look at an item of food at all the only modification i made to this slow care diet for our body thing was the day after the cheat day i would not eat i would just fast and i had no problem doing that because it was just basically well since you said ah what was it anal it'll sleep ye at yon seabirds i did not have that but since you said that i i will not up the anti here but ill least match or anal abridge comment by saying i had less just call it profound gastric distress after eating that a next day selah you ant to do as yea can food out just hydrate and oftentimes to try and get some exercise and what i read was that berberine poor man's motorman could offer blood glucose and in some ways make me feel less sick when in wasting all these calories and in many cases spiking my my blood sugar and insolent because you are having ice cream in you et camera and indeed it worked if i took berberine and i do not recall the milligram count and then i ate a twelve doughnuts i felt fine it was as if i had eaten one down a i felt sort of o kain i body and it id felt much much better no a presume because it is buffering the spikes and blodshure i was not crashing in the afternoon nap than that whole thing and we i remember how much you were taking i tank as couple on your milligrams say son about rant is would write a yellow caps i forget the source but in any case one thing i noticed was that if i took barbering and i did not invest a profound number of carbohydrates very soon afterwards i got brutal headaches i think i was hyped sumac i did not measure it but i just felt i had headaches i did not feel good and then i would eat apetza or two and feel for and i realized that berberine was putting me on this to a lower blood sugar state that was the logic anyway and it allowed me to eat these cheat foods but when i cycled off of the the forays i i do not follow the silcarbdiet any more although i might again at some point when i stopped doing those cheat days i did not have any reason to take the berberine and i feared that i was not in jesting enough carbohydrates in order to really justify trying of buffer my blood bucks also my bloodlucostens to be did you be d you ever try a carbon no what is that a carbon is another glucose disposal let's it is cilia drug that but it works more in the gut and it just prevents glucose absorption a a carbon is another one of those drugs that actually found a survival benefit in the i t p and it was a very interesting finding because the the thesis for testing it the city piece a very cleverest system anybody can nominate a candidate to be tested then the he another panel over their reviews it and they decide yet this is interesting woo had not study it when i think avid allusion nominated a a carbon to be studied the rational was it would be a a chloric restriction memetic because you would literally just fail to absorb i do not know make up some number rite fifteen tor twenty per cent of your cargo hydrates would not be absorbed and therefore you would the mice would effectively be calorically restricted it win as pass the that is right and what happened a real interesting one the mice lived longer on a cargoes but too they did not weigh any less it what it they lived longer but not through carry restriction that is interest yes and it tithe speculation is they lived longer because they had lower locos and lower insolent and i do not want to send us down some rabbit holes here but there all sorts of interesting ideas about for instance that some forms of dementia might be call type three diabetes a diabetes of the brain and somethings barbering met foremen lowering bluglucosts keetogenic diets et camera might be beneficial there i there is a lot to explore here and i know you have explored a lot of that on your podcast have done far less of that but well at least it seems that we know the fallowing things for short one you do not want insolent too high nor too low you do not want bluglucos too high nor too low if the buffering systems for that are disrupted clearly exercise meaning regular exercise is the best way to keep that system in check but in the absence of that to or i was taken addition to that tool is there any glucose disposal agent that's what we are talking about here that form in berberine a marmoset et camera that you take on a regular basis because you have that much confidence in it the only one that i take is an bestial to to in hitter a this is a class of drug that is used by people would type to diabetes but which i do not have but because of my faith in the mechanistic studies of this drug coupled with its results in the it p coupled with the human trial results the show profound benefit and non diabetics taking it even for hart failure i think there is something very special awoke the drug affix that was another paper i was thinking about presenting this time if we will do at the next time but do you believe in colonic restriction as a way to extend life or you more of the do the right behaviors amend that is covered in your book out live and elsewhere on your podcast am and buffer blood glucose i is do you still obviously you believe in buffering blood glucose in addition this doing all the right behavior y i think you can uncouple a little bit the buffering a blood glucose from the colonic deficit a i think you can be in a reasonable energy balance and buffer glucose with good see pyrene lots of exercise an just thoughtful eating a without having to go into a calorie deficit it is not entirely clear if profound cleric restriction would offer a survival advantage to humans even if it were tolerable to most which it is not right for most people it is just kind of off the table right if i said drew you need to eat thirty per cent few calories for the rest of your life all a live thirty per cent four years ye er not many people who are willing to sign up for that is what is kind of a mood point am but the question is do you need to be fasting all the time you need to be doing all of these other things and the answer appears to be outside of using the is tools to manage energy balance it is not clear right an energy balance probably plays a greater roll in glucoshomia stasis than a from a nutrition standpoint then the individual constituents of the meal am now that's not entirely true i can imagine a scenario where a person could be in negative energy balance eating twicxbars all day and drinking big gulps but i also do not think that is a very sustainable thing to do because if by definition ism onto put you in negative energy balance consuming that much crap ism going a destroy you you are going to feel miserable you argon to be starving right you o can be satiated eating pure garbage and being in colonic deposit you are going to end up having to go into colonic excess that is why it is interesting thought experiment i soft this it is very practical experiment for person to be generally satiated and an energy balance the probably eating about the right stuff but i do not think that the specific macro's matter as much as i used to think ism a believer in getting most of my mutants from unprocessed minimal process sources simply because it allows me to the foods i ye and a more of them and i just love to et i i physically enjoy the sensation of chewing that uknolegeusly cucumber slices for heverfon yet that is i mean that is not my only form of fun fortunately a this is an amazing paper a for the simple reason that it provides a wonderful tutorial of the benefits and drawbacks of this type of work and i think it is also wonderful because we hear a lot about met foremen rapamizin and om the antiaging approach is but was not aware that there was any study of such a large population of people its pretty interesting yes i think it remains to be seen if and my patience often asked me hatred i be on met foremen an i give them much much much much shorter version of what we just talked about and i say look if the tame study which should answer this question more definitively right this is taking a group of non diabetics and randomizing them to placebo verses met foreman and studying for specific disease outcomes if the tame study ends up demonstrating that there is a hero protective benefit of met foreman i all reconsider everything i think that is and we just have to i think all walk around with an appropriate degree of humility around what we know an what we do not know but but i would say right now the epidemiology the animal data my own personal experience with its impact on my lactic production an exercise performance we could this a whole the rapid hole we could go down another time which is the impact on hypertrophy an strength which appears to be attenuated as well by met foreman a i still crime it to patience all the time if their insolent resistance for short it is still a valuable drug but i do not think of it is a great tool for the person who is insolent sensitive and exercising a lot i cannot help but ask this question do you think there is any longevity benefit to short periods of colonic restriction you know for instance i decide to by the ay i have not done this but let us say i were to decide to fast into one meal a day type thing where ism going to be in a slight colonic despite five hundred to a thousand calories for a couple of days then go back to eating i the way that i eat before of that short colonic restriction slash fast is the any benefit to it in terms o cell er health can you you a reset the system is there any idea that the the change is the clearing of senile cells that we here about a topology that we know that in the short time you can glean a lot of benefits and then go back to to irregular pattern of eating and then a periodically in once every couple of weeks or once a month just be on fast for a day or two is the any benefit to that that is that purely in the domain of longevity not because there is all discipline function there there is a flexibility function n there is jolly an insolent sensitivity function but is there any evidence that it can help us live longer think the short answers no i for two reasons one i do not think that that duration would be sufficient if if one is going to take that approach but to ism even if you went with something longer what i used to do et i used to do seven days of water only perverter three days per month i was bet o basely always to be three day fast three day fast seven day fast just imagine doing that all year rotating rotating running for many years i did that i now i certainly believed and to this day i would say i have no idea if that provided a benefit i but my thesis was i the downside of this is relatively circumscribed which is profound misery for a few days and a what i did not appreciate the time which i obviously now look back at it realizes muscle mass lost you are just it is very difficult to gain back the muscle cumulatively after all of that loss a but my thought was exactly as you said there is got to be a resetting of the system here this must be sufficiently long enough to trigger all of those systems but you are getting at a bigger problem with hero science which ism really hoping the epigenesis field comes to the rescue on it has not come close to it to date which is we do not have big markers around true metrics of aging everything we have to date stinks we are really good at using molecules or interventions for which we have bookmarkers rig when you lift waits you can look at how much weight you are lifting you can look at your decks again and see how much muscle mast your generating that those are bite markers those are giving you outputs that say my input is good or my input needs to be modified a when you take a sleep supplement you can look at your eight sleep and go oh my sleep is getting better there is a big marker a when you take mat foreman when you take rap a mice an when you fast we do not have a big marker that gives us any insight into whether or not we are moving in the right direction and if we are are we taking enough it do not know i often get asked what is the single most important topic you would want to see more research dollars put to in terms of this space and it is unquestionably this as unsex as it is who cares about big markers but without them i do not think we are going to get great answers cause you cannot do most of the experiments you and i would dream up got well ism grateful that you are sitting across the table or me telling me all this and that ism everyone can hear this i but again we will put a link to the papers plural that i peter just described and for those of either listening and not watching ism full you ere able to track the the general ism themes and take always and i it is fun to go to these papers you we these big stacks of numbers and and it can be a loll it overwhelming but i my a additional suggestion on parsing papers is notice that peter said he spend u he's read it several times youunlike a newspaper article or or i a instrgranpost with a paper your not necessarily going to get it the first time you certainly will not get everything that i i think spending some time with papers for me means reading it and then reading i again a lit bit later or an n tell me where it it you've bat to say what is your cause cause i kind of have a way that i do it but ism curious as to how you do it of your if you are encountering paperwork the first time what do you have an order in which you to go through too do you want do you read it sequentially or do look at the figures first how do you ho you go through it unless it is an area that i know very very well whet i can skip to some things ism before reading it the whole way through i my press is always the same and actually this is fun because i used to teach a class when i was oppressor you see sanding ism called curl circuits and health an disease and it was an evening course that grew very quickly from fifty students to four hundred plus students and we would do exactly this we wouldnitparse papers and i and i had everyone ask what i call the four questions i it was not exactly four questions but i have little through by five card next to me or piece of a mana by eleven paper typically and when i sit down with the paper i want to figure out what is the question they are asking what is the general question what is the specific question and i write down the question then what was the approach you how did they test that question and sometimes hi can get a bit detailed on get into uniisto chemistry and they did piecing for this it it is not important a for most people that they understand every method but it is worth while that if you encounter a method piecyar or your chromatography or efhamari that you at least look up on the internal what it is purposes et that will help a lot and then it was what they found and there you can usually figure out what they believe they found anyway by reading the figure headers it what are you'll figure one here is the header that typically if it is an experimental paper it will tell you what they want you to think they found and then i tend to one and the conclusion of the study and then this is really the key one and this is the one that would really distinguish the high performing students from the others you have to go back at the end and ask whether not the conclusions the major conclusions drawn in the paper are really substantiated by what they found and what they did and that involves somethinking it involve really spending sometime thinking about what what they identified now this is in something that anyone can do straight off the bat as a skill that you develop over time and different papers require different formats but those four questions really form the cornerstone of a of teaching under graduates and i think graduate students as well of how to read a paper and again it is something that can be cultivated and it is still how i approach papers what i do typicallies it'll read title abstract i usually then will skip to the figures and see how much of it i can digest without reading the text and then go back and read the text but in harness journals great journals science natures oftentimes will pack much information the see press journals to into each figure and it is coded with no definition of the acronyms that almost always ism into the introduction and results within a couple of minutes wondering what the hell this acronym is of the had acronym is and it is it is just yes just wild how much how much nomenclature there really is i cannot remember was it you or was it a friend calcanei when he was here i who said that oh no ism sorry it was neither it was charaboff themologyit stampford a doctor jeffrey gilbert who has a guest on the pot casts recently who off camera i think it was told us that if you look at the total number of words and terms that a physician leaving medical school owns in their mind in their vocabulary it is the equivalent two additional full languages of fluency beyond their native language you are try lingual at least out d you speak language other than english poorly o case o you are youyoureat least trilingual and probably more no one is expected to be able to pars these papers the first time through without substantial training ye i i i think that is that bit is a great format and you are absolutely right i have a different way that i do it when ism familiar with the subject matter betas one i not a well again if ism reading papers that are something that i know really well i can basically glean everything i need to know from the figures a and then sometimes it'll just do a quickskim on methods a but i do not need to read the discussion i do not need to read the entry out any to read anything else ah if it is something that i know less about then i usually do exactly what you say i try to start with the figures i usually end up generating more questions what what what do you mean what what is this how did they do that and then i got to go back and read methods typically and one f theotherthing this write worth mentioning is a lot of papers these days have supplemental information that are not attached to the paper i you are amazed at how much stuff gets put in the supplemental section and the reason for that of course is that the journals are very a specific on the formed in length of a paper a lot of the times when you are submitting something if you want t put any additional information there it cannot go in the main article it has to go in the supplemental rigor even for this paper there were a couple of the numbers i spouted off that i had to pull out of the supplemental paper for example when they did the sensitivity and crisis ism the ism censuring verses noncensuring that that was in a supplemental figure that was actually not even in the paper we presented well she pivoting another paper it is a very different sort of paper it is an experimental paper were there is a manipulation i must say i love love love this paper and i do not often say that about papers ism excited about this paper for many reasons but i want to give a couple of caveats up front first of all the paper is not published yet the only reason i was able to get this papers because it is on byoarchive there is a new trend over the less i will say five six years of people posting the papers that they have submitted to journals for pure review on line that people can look at them prior to those papers being pure reviewed there is a strong possibility that the final version of this paper which again we will provide a link to is going to look different maybe even quite a bit different then the one that we are going to discuss none the less there are couple of things tot make me confident in the data that we are about to talk about first of all the group that publish this paper it is really playing in their wheel house this is what they do and they publish a lot of really nice papers in this area i ism going to mispronounce ism her first name but i think it is cha see you at i who is at the con school of medicine mount sign runs a laboratory there study addiction in humans and i the first off author of the paper is over pearl i this paper is wild and it'll just give you a couple to take always first as a bit of a hook toile a entice people to listening further as this is an important paper this paper basically addresses how our beliefs about the drugs we take impacts how they affect us at a real level not just at a subjective level but at a biological level just to back up a little bit ism a former guest on this pod cast doctor all drum a whose name is actually a decorum but she goes by alichrum talked about belief effects belief effects are different than plusibo of facts pluasibo effects are really just category of facts it is oke ism going to give you this pill peter and cumin to tell you that this pill is molecule es five nine five to and that it is going to make your memory better and then i give you a memory test and your group performs better than the people in the control group who i give a pill to and i say this is just a placebo or there other variance on this where am people all get a drug and you tell them at placebo they will get a placebo you tell them its drug it is it is a binary thing it is an honor and thing you are either in the drug group of the placebo group and your either told that you're getting drug placebo and we know that pluasibo facts exist in fact one of the crueller ones i was never the subject of this but there was a kind of lore in high school that h kids would do this mean thing it is a formablling i really do not it where they get some kid at a party to drink am alcohol are beer and then that kid would tart acting drunk and than they go dacha does even have alcohol in it now that is a mean joke am and just reminds me of some of the the u the horrors of high school may that is writing govern often which i also do not suggest but no it am it is a mean joke but it speaks to the plusibo of fact right and there is also social contact office plusibo effects are real am we know this belief effects are different belief effects are not fire the placebo or non placebo belief effects have a lot of knowledge to enrich one's belief about a certain something that can shift there psychology and physiology one way or the other and i think the best examples of these really of these belief effects really do come from alarum slab in the psychology department at stamford although some of this work she did prior to getting to tampered for instance if people are put into a group where they watch a brief video just a few minutes of video about hostess really limits our performance let say at archery or at mathematics or at music or at public speaking and then you test them in any of those domains or other domains in a stressful circumstance they perform less well of and we know they perform less well because we are by virtue of a heightened stress response you can measure heart ray can measure stroke volume of the heart you can measure a prefer blood flow which goes down when people are stress narrowing a vision et camera you take a different group of people and randomly assigned them to another group where now there being told that stress enhance is performance it mobilizes resources it narrows your vision such that you can perform tasks better et center et camera and there performance increases above a control group that receives just useless information here lease useless as it relates to the task in both cases by the way the groups agreeing told the truth stress can be to pleading or it can enhance performance but this is different than placebo because now it scaling according to the amount and the type of information that they are get can you give me a sense of magnitude of benefit or detriment that one could experience in a situation the onerous just describe ya it is its striking there opposite in direction the stress gets us worse makes you am let us say i think that if we were to just put a rough percentage on this would be somewhere between ten and thirty per cent worse et performance than the control group and stresses enhancing is approximately equivalent improvement there in opposite directions even more striking is the the studies that m ally lab did m and others looking at for instance you give people a milkshake you tell them it is a high carry milkshake has a lot of new trance and then you measure gremlin secretion in the blood and gremlin is a marker of hunger that increases longer it is beensince you have eaten and what you notices that suppresses gremlin to a great degree an for a long practice time you give another group shake you tell em it a locator shake that has got some neutriance in it but that does not much fate t much sugar et camera they drink the shape less gallants suppression and it is the same shire and it is the same shape and satiety lines up with that also in that study and then the third one which is also pretty striking as they took hotel workers they gave them a short tutorial or not informing them that moving around during the day and vacuuming doing all that kind of thing is great helps you lower your be amie which is great for your health you we you incentivize them and then you let them out into the wild of their every day job you measure their activity levels the two groups do not differ they are doing roughly the same task leaning down cleaning out trash gas et camera guess what the group that was informed about the health benefits of exercise lose twelve per cent more weight compared to the other group and no difference in actual movement apparently not now how could that be i mean literally this was sparked by valley's words this was sparked by her graduate adviser saying what if all the effects of exercise or pluck right language is which is not what any one really believes but is just such a you knot i love that anecdote that alley told us because it just really speaks to how really smart people think they sit back in the goyellic exercise opium he has benefits but what if a lot of the benefit that you tell yourself its good for you and the brain can actually activate these these mechanisms in the body and why would not that be the case cause the nervous system extends through both o interest interested oke fast word to this study which is really about belief effects not placebo facts and to make a long story short we know that nicotine raped smoked dipped or snuffed wore these lot in pouches or taken in capsid form does improve coolant performance ism not suggesting people run out and start doing any f those things i did whole episode on nicotine that delivery device offer will kill you some other way or bad for you but it causes vast constriction which is also not good for certain people but nicotine is cognitive enhancing why well you have a couple sises in the brain namely in the basal forebrain uncles sales in the back of the brain structures locus rules but also this what is called it is got a funny name the podunculo pontine nucleus which is the nucleus in the in the the ponds in the back of the brain in the brainstorm that sends those we as on wires into the thalamus the thymus is a gateway for sensory information and in the thalamus the visual information the auditory information it has nicotine receptors and when the poduncul pontine nucleus releases nicotine or when you ingest nicotine what it does is increases the signal to noise of information coming in through your senses the fidelity of the signal that gets up to your quartan which is your conscious perception of those senses is increased and how much endogenous nicotine to be produce o am well it is going to be a set calling binding to nicotenic receptor i we not taking nicer we are not find into this is a this is a nicotine steal cosine receptright of which there are at least seven and probably fourteen subtypes but it there called nicotine receptors in an annoying way in the same way that canabinoid receptors are called can adenoid receptors but then everyone thinks oh you mother's receptors are there because werespost to smoke pot or those receptors of their expose to in jest nicotine no the drugs that rung ustatautov e receptthat is right very exactly receptor is named after the drug and the important thing to know is that whether notes bail forebrain a produncul pontine nucleus or locus rules that at least in the brain is were not time about muscle where a redo calling toes something else ya nicotine receptors there in general just tends to be a signal to noise in hanger and for the non engineering types out there no problem signal the noise just imagine ism talking right now an there's static in the background the two ways for you to be able to hear me more clearly we can reduce the static or i can increase the fidelity the the volume and the clarity of what ism saying am for instance and that is really what a set calling does that is why when people smoke a cigarette they get that boost of nicotine and they just feel clearer it really works the other thing that happens is the fatuous sens information to a couple of places firs want sends information to the reward centers of the brain the musolymic reward pathway that releases dopamine and typically when nicotine is increased in our system dopamine goes up that is one of the reasons why nicotine has reinforcing we just it it is a we seek it out have done beautiful experiments with honey beat even where you put nicotine on certain plants or it comes from certain plants and the will forage there more you get run of them kind of buzz that was upon tan on a in any event there is also an output from this thing the thalamus to the ventrimedial prefrontal quarters which is are of the forebrain that really allows us to limit our focus in our attention for sake of learning it allows us to pay attention this is the circuit you talked about this in your fantastic podcast on stimulants yon eighty get the eighty it t typically eighty eight e drugs to things at or all via ants methamphetamine for that matter am riddling your whit is counterintuitive the stimulant would be a treatment for some one with difficulty focussing yet in young kids who have difficulty focussing if you give them something they love they are a later and the reason is that ventrimedial prefrontal quarter circuit can engages when the kid is interested and engaged but kids with eightyhty eight high t tend to have a hard time engaging their mind for other types of task and other types of tasks are important for getting through life and it turns out the giving those stimulant drugs in many cases can enhance the function of that circuit and it can strengthen that ideally the kids do not need the drugs in the long runnel the that is not often the way that it plays out and there other ways to get at this there is now a big battle out there its eighty h t real is it not real of course it is real does every kid need eighty h t mess no are there other things nutrition more playtime outside et camera that can help improve there symptoms without drugs yes is the commination of all those things together known to be most beneficial yes o the dosages given too high and generally should be you know high traded down maybe some kits need lot some gets ne a little i probably just gained and lost a few enemies there the point is that these circuits are hard wired circuits throw one other question u if my memories sromscrectly does not nicotine potentially have a coming effect as well and that seems a bit counter intuitive to the focusing one or h is it a dose effect raising effect ow as i er yet it is a dosing effect the interesting thing about nicotine is that it can enhance focus in the brain but in the periphery it actually provide some muscle relaxation sos cute the perfect drug if you think about it again u it is was us reflecting on this how when we were growing up peopled smoke on plain that smoking section on the plain no people smoked all the time and now hardly anyone smokes for all the obvious reasons but yet it provides that really ideal balance between being alert but being mellow and relaxed in the body am hence it is reinforcing properties oka this study is remarkable because what they did is they had people come into the laboratory they gave them a tape pen these are these are smokers these are experienced smokers typically there is a wash out before they come in they are not smoking for a bit they can clear their system of nicotine and they measure long as that u typically it is a couple of days o ya which must be usable dos i you n us an the cannot have nicker at come or anything how nothing they must be dying and i wonder how many cheat but they they can measure they measure an oxide or they measure carbonoxin their measuring nicotine in the blood is well they do a good job there then what they do is they have them tape and their raping either a low medium or hide of nicotine the dosages do not really matter because tolerance varies et camera and then they putting them into a functional magnetic residence in making machine of where they can look at it is really blood flow is really humor dynamic response for those o you want to know it is the ox is the ratio of the oxygenate to deoxygenate blood because when blood blood will flow to servants that a active to give it oxygen and then it is deoxygenate and then there is a change in what is called the bold signal exam are when you see these hot spots in the brain is really just looking at blood flow and then there is some interesting physic around and it'll pry get this long but it'll take an attempt at it tat i get beat up ion bit by the physics engineers ism you member the right hand rule wanna was do i have ti strict a correct the rehimeral if you put your thumb out with your first with your index fingering middle finger your thumb facing up i think that the thumb represents the charge the direction of the charge right and then is not the electromagnetic field is the downward facing figure and then it is the to have that right i have to logo act was wat some one will look it up what what you do is when you put up person's head in this big magnet and then you pulse the magnet what happens is the oxygenate and deoxygenate blood it interacts with the magnetic feel differently and that difference in signal can be detected and you can see that in the form of activated brain area see i mean m are all works by proton detection presumably there is a difference in the proton signal when you have high oxygen verses low oxen concentration that is right and what they'll do is the pulse with the magnet because my understanding is that and this is deftly getting beyond my expertise but that the the spin orientation of the proteins than it is it is going to relax back at a different rate as well what by the relaxation at a different rate you can also get not joust resting state activation o look at a banana what areas of the brain light up you can look at in connectivity between areas and how one areas driving the activity of another area very very powerful technique what they do is they they put people in the scanner and then you will this as you what a the whet e the limitations of of of acari o in in terms of i mean how fine is the resolution a ma where or the blow in spots of a technache resolution you can get down to sub centimeter they talk about it always in these paper as a voles which are these old a few big piles things a you'd sub subsntimeter but you are not going to get down to illicit there are a number of confounds that maybe we will not go into now that have been basically worked out over the last ten years by doing the following you cannot just give somebody a stimulus compared to nothing it'll just tell you the experiment it was discovered for instance that when some one would move their right hand cause eve when you've in the smart and its onion for one of these recently for clinical not a problem but just for diagnostic sand you are leaning back an you and you can move your right hand a bit and they would see an area motor corrects lighting up but what they notice was that the area corresponding in the left hand was also lighting up what you really have to do is you have to look at resting state how much are they lighting up an to last ran and an a tract that out now you will always see resting state verses activation state yet was not there a really funny study gun is a proof maybe a decade ago that put a dead salmon into an maria machine and did an did id an fear have a dead salmon that demonstrated some interesting signal no that would but no we going this one for the means i do not you do one of these wild papers ones there is there are papers of people putting do not do the folks putting elephants on celeste that were published in science and things crazy experiments we should coffin you a crazy experiments gone club in any event you can get a sense of which brain areas are active and wen with fairly high spacial resolution fairly high and pretty good temporal resolution on the order of hundreds of mill a seconds not but it is not ultraultra fast because a lot of naval transmissions happening on the opens of mill a sons ism especially when you are in talkngabout auditory processing of they put people into the scanner and then they they give them a essentially a ta that is design to engage the thalamus known to engage the thalamus reward centers and the venturemedial prefrontal quarters and it is a very simple game you this was a you have a background in finance you let people watch a market a here is the stock market or you could say ere that the price of peas it does not really matter it goes up it goes down another are looking a squiggle line than it stops and then they have the option but they have to pick one option they're either going to invest a certain number of the hundred units that you have given them or they can short they can say hit ingoing to go down and try to make money on the on the prediction it sign to go down you could explain shorting better than i could for sure depending whether not they get the prediction right or wrong they get more points are they lose points and they are going to be rewarded in real money at the end of the experiment this is going to engage this type of circuitry now remember these groups were given a tape pen prior to this where they have raped what they were told is either a low medium or his dose of nicotine and they do this task the goal is not to get them to perform better on the task the goal is to engage the specific brain areas that irrelevant to this kind of error and reward type circuits and we know that this task does that that includes the thalamus that includes the musolymbic reward pathway and dopamine it includes the ventramedial prefrontal quarter first of all they measure nicotine in the blood they are measuring how much people raped they were very careful about this when the nice things about the tape pen for the sake of experiment and not recommending people tape but they can measure how much nicotine is left in the tape pen before after they can measure how long they inhaled hello the held it in his lot that you can do that is harder to do with a cigarette of they measured people's belief as to whether or not they got low medium or high amounts of nicotine and if if they were told they were told they got y that this is a low amount to medium amount or high amount and then of course they looked at ordinary activation during this task and what they found was very straight for sorry they were all given the same amount yes that is is is is the sink i was skin offer it is a porcine but that is toke no i think that that the cool thing about this experiment is that the subjects are unaware that they all got the exact same amount of relatively low nicotine containing tape pen that that they basely under measuring it from their bloodstreams they all have fairly low levels of nicotine but one group was told you got a lot one group was told you got a medium amount and the other was told you got a little bit now a number of things happen but the most interesting things are the following first of all people subjective feeling of being on the drug match is what they were told if they were told hey this is a high amount of nicotine that feels a high amount of nicotine and these are experience smokers if it was a medium amount that feels a medium amount for the low amount they think it was a low amount now that is perhaps not surprising that you just a ship tutti and that's simplism account but if you look at the activation of the thalamus in the exact regions where you would predict a redo coming transmission to impact the function of the thalamus of these include areas what is called the centromedium newcleis event troposterian nuclear the names that really do not matter but these are errors involved in attention it scales with what they thought they got in the happen meaning if you were told that you got a low amount of nicotine you got a little bit of activation in these areas if you were told that you got a medium amount of nicotine and that is what you raped that you had medium amounts or moderate amounts of activation and if you were told you got high amounts of nicotine you got a high degree of activation and the performance on the task believe ere not scales with it somewhat keep in mind everyone got the exact same amount of nicotine in reality here the belief effect is not just changing what one subjectively experiences of other is the effect of high nicotine or low nicotine it act e is changing the way that the brain responds to the belief and that to me is absolutely wild now there re couple of other things that could have confounded this first of all it could have been that if you believe you got a lot of nicotine you are just faster were you are reading the lines better were you are response time to hit the button is quicker i tell you have a drug that is can improve reaction time you might believe that about nicotine and you are quicker on the trigger and you are getting they have a deer activation it is more activation there could be they rule that out they also rule out the possible cohabit rule that out by looking at rates of a of pressing and themes or of nothing and incensory areas of the brain that would that would represent that kind of difference they do not see that the other thing that is very clear is that the connection between the salmis and the venturamedial prefrontal quarters that pathway scales in the most beautiful way such that people that were told they had smoked a low or raped a low amount of nicotine got a subtle activation of that pathway people that were told that they got a moderate amount of nicotine got a more robust activation of that pathway and the people that were told that they got a high amount of nicotine in the tape pen saw a very robust activation of the palmette to this eventual prefrontal cortical pathway now of course this all happening under the hood of the skull simply on the basis of what they were told and what they belief and technically the of acari is showing the activation of those two areas and that is how you can infer o you strength of that connection that is right there is a separate method called diffuser tenser imaging which was developed i believe out of the group in minnesota minnesota has a very robust group interns o narrow imaging that can measure activation in fire pathways this is not that but you can look at the timing of activation and it is unknown what we call minivan attic pathway we have not talk much about figures here but i guys if we were gin a look at any one figure and i can just describe it for the audience that is not paying a d isn't have the figure in front of them the ah let us see i the the most a li the most important figure is figure too member i said elect to read the titles of figures which is that the belief about nicotine strength induced a dose dependent response in the thalamus basically if you and figure to be can tell you if they believe that they got more nicotine that is that is essentially the response of t that they saw if you look armory panel e feel like at the belief reading as a function of the estimate inthalmis of of what how much activation there was it is a it is a mess when you look at all the dots at once but if you just separate it out by high medium in low you run the statistics what you find is that there is a gradual increase but a legitimate one from low to medium to high in other words if i tell you this is a hihdose of nicotine your brain will react as if it is a highrise of nicotine now what they did not do was give people zero nicotine gets about to say there is control tit is missing ya yes what they did not do as give people zero nicotine and then tell them ah this is a high amount of nicotine the sort of the equivalent of the cruel high school experiment you are no alcohol but then that the the kid a drunk now in the in the high school example it is unclear whether not the kid actually felt drunk or not am it is unclear whether not they had been drunk previously if they even knew what it would be ti feel drunk et veteran there is the social context what i find just outrageous and outrageously interesting about this study is simply that what we are told about the dose of a drug changes the way that our physiology response to the dose of the drug and in and in my understanding this is the first study to ever look at dose dependence of belief of facts writ to really and why would thou the important wealth for almost every study of drugs you look at a dose dependent curve you look at zero loose medium dose high dose and here they they clearly are seeing a dose dependent response simply to the understanding of what they expect the drug ought to do in otherwars you can buy pass pharmacology somewhat right now look at figure to be at my reading is correctly it is got a four bars on there you have got the group who were told they got a low dose the group who was told they got a medium dose the group that was told they had a his dose and then these healthy control right who presumably were non smokers who were just put in the machine that is wary is yet yet this is measuring parameter estimate what is that referring to i they arability play the the the betraying game o the perimeter estimate is the is the activation a rewire related activities from independent famous massing whet the doing is their untangle we just look at the famous what is the level of activation i see this suggests that the only statistical difference was between the low in the high that is right and nobody else was statistically difference but that is not the whole story no that is not the whole story when you look at the output from the calamus to the ventrimedial prefrontal quarter that is where you starts identify the that figure for a that is yes this is where you see oms o figure for be if you look at parameter estimate this is the degree of activation between the famous in the ventrimedial prefrontal quarter and it is called the instructed belief you can see that there is a low medium and high scatter of of dots for each and that each one of those is significant is not it interesting that at the calamus which is and you will you will immediately appreciate my stupidity when it comes to narrow science which is more proximate to the nicatinimi pernicatin the nicetonmi whale you call it the niccetin i seidocalling receptor you have a lower difference of signal strength and somehow that got amplified as it made its way forward in the brain yes that surprise you it is surprising and it surprised them as well the the interpretation they give again this were time i before important it match their conclusions against what they actually found which is what we are doing here the interpretation that they give is that it does not take much nicatenic receptor occupancy in the payments to activate this pathway but they too were surprise that they could not detect a raw difference in the activation of traumas but in terms of its output said the prefrontal quarter that'men because it is show that figure for b is more convincing than figure too because even figure two e if you read the fine print the are the correlation coffisionists point two saves we it is not that is strong right it is weak at the thalamus it is kind of there might be a signal by the way this goes back to our earlier discussion there could be a huge signal here and we are under powered how many subjects were in this you would this you would not have a lot of subjects in this experiment yet this it no you it and this just speaks to the general challenge of doing this kind of work it is hard to get a lot of people in and through the scanner in it is a coin a an intensive ah we have to i should know this but we can due we can go back to the by yous can hero just look at the number of dots on herimang it is in the low tens your right it is li up forty thirty something that it is not it is possible you do the get danish study ye you do this wit a thousand people this could all be statistically significant right it was a they talk about this you will based on this we estimate that an end of twenty en a sample size in each belief condition the final sample would provide ninety percent power to detect an effect of this magnitude at an ala of point her zero point five and at two tail am test oi o no that is that is them referring to what we just talked about which is the pow we believe at ninety per cent confidence to get an ala of point o five which means w one to be ninety five resent confidence we need sixty people twenty per group but if the difference is smaller than what they expected they will miss out on some of the significance which that looks their missing between the medium and high group and i too was surprised that am they did not see a difference in the between the medium and the high group a but they did in the output of the thalamus i was also surprised that they did not see a difference this is kind of interesting in its own right if figure three talks about the belief about nicotine strength did not modulate the reward response the dopamine response how was that measured to dit an i am are y exactly if you look at figure three be other people cannot see it but basically oh yet what you will see is that there is no difference between these different groups am in terms of the amount of activation in these reward pathways if people got a low medium o high amount of nicotine now that actually could be leverage i believe if somebody were trying to quit nicotine for instance and they were going to do that by progressively reducing the amount of nicotine that they were taking but you told them that it was the same amount what from one day to the next you could little it down presumably to a low amount before taking it to zero and if they believed it to be a greater amount than it might actually not a distroppet their reward pathways meaning they would feel am presumably they would feel rewarded by whatever nicotine they were bringing in what would be your prediction if this experiment were repeated but it was done exactly the same way with nonsmokers who well one thing that sort of a interesting you asked about art a potential sources of a artifact the problems with to fa more one of the challenges that they know in the study was yet to stay very still in the in the machine but the subjects were constantly coughing because they smokers oh we press only the data would be higher fidelity are chuckling at that one but i i was how to read that one twice and tho hemin sense a their smokers are coughing against they still movement artifact am but in all seriousness i think that for people that are naive to nicotine even a small amount of nicotine is likely to get this pathway activated to such a great degree the first time of fact of pretty much any drug but i wonder if they would be more or less susceptible to the belief system yew that is a really good question right because hey have no prior to compare it to have no pleasant they have no experience to compare it to with respect to the obviously beneficial effects of nicotine that the smokers are well used to this is the the poor kid that got duped into thinking the none calcic beer was and it'll although there actually the winter we know because it did not up n call calls bad for you in the end that kid winds and the other ones lose poetic justice but ism that kid having never been actually drunk before presumably why would ill parent get moral accept mores essentially that is my guests you'll my belie for this experiment is not ere this paper rather is not because i think it is the be all end all or it is a perfect experiment i just think it very cool that they are starting to explore dost dependence of belief because that has all sorts of implications i mean i use your imagination folks whether not we are talking about i a drug which i you at a behavioral intervention we are taking about a valine and ism not refrained any one specific valine ism just talking vanes generally ism talking about psychoactive drugs ism talking about am illicit drugs ism talking about entity press once ism talking about all the sorts of drugs we are talking about before that former et camera just throw our arms round all of it what we believe about the effects of a drug presumably in addition to what we believe about how much we are taking and what those effects ought to be clearly ore impacting at least the way that our brain react to the of do ya it is very interesting in men when you consider how many drugs that have peripheral effects a or prefer outputs begin with central issue again i think the get p one agonists are such a great example as a ye yet i i do not think anybody fully understands exactly how they are working but it is hard to argue that their impacting that the gel pe one analogue is is having a central impact it is doing something in the brain that is leading to a reduction of appetite and we believe that ye ye id i think the maleate a point to different areas of the hypothalamus that related to society up that that sit is at least possible ye i mean that there is no quicker way to make a mouse overeat er under eat than by pensioning its hypothalamus depending on where you do primally these drugs work there but again it speaks to what do you need to believe in order for that to be the case have they done placebo traces they are where people get something in they are told oh these doe at i mean of course those drugs have all been tested vioclocebo and the closing groups do not do anywhere near as well that is how we know that there is activity of the drug but but again there is that is a little bit different than being told you are absolutely getting at right cause in the r c ts you are just told you might be getting it you might not be getting it it is not quite the same as this experiment this experiment is is one level up where your being told now you are absolutely getting it you just getting different doses of it yet to take this to maybe the eighty h t realm let us a kid has been on eighdiate we gets for a while in the parents for whatever reason the physician decide they want to cut back on the dosage but if they were to tell the kit its the same dosage they have always been taking in it had a certain positive effect for them according to the results at least in this paper i which are not definitive but are interesting the lower doses may be as effective simply on the basis of belief and and this is a part that makes it cool to me is that and it is not a kid tricking themselves of the parents tricking the kid much as the brain activation is corresponding to the belief right that is where this in arteries why because it is done in the brain i think we can am it gets totes kind of abstract a nearly mystical but not quite mystical aspects of belief effects which is that your brain is a prediction making machine it is a a datary interpretation machine but it is clearer that one of the more important pieces of data are your beliefs about how these things impact you a it is not that this by passes physiology people are not deluding themselves the thalamus is behaving as if it is a high dose when it is the same dose as the loose croup while ye i mean you think i think of the implications for example of blood pressure italic we do not really understand a central high pretension which is the majority of people walking around with high blood pressure it is unclear etiology a lats of people being treated how do we know that the belief system about it cannot be changed and a o this is this is i don't this is i open ye it is cool stuff and alycrumb is on to some other really cool stuff for instance i just to his where these belief effects are staring to show up if you tell a group that the side effects of a drug that they are taking are evidence that the drug really works for the purpose that they are taking it even though those side effects or kind of annoying people report the experience as less awful and they report more relief from the primary symptoms that they are trying to target are our belief about what side effects are that is i can really impact how quickly and how um compatible a we feel about how quickly a drug for excuse me and how compatible we feel that drug is with our entire life make if we call them something else outside effects but a d tonal benefits for something it is kind of craze an you do not want lie to people obviously but you also do not want to send yourself in the opposite direction which is reading the list of side effects of a drug and then developing all of those side facts am when and then maybe later coming to the understanding that some of those wo ere raised through belief effects a we definitely see that that is the noseebot affect right that a that is the one we see a lot a with all sorts of drugs and it is tough because how do you how do which is which and i think there are some people who are really impacted by that and it makes it very difficult for them to take any sort of armeclogic agent because they basically they cannot help but incur every possible side effect is it is it true that medical students often will start developing the symptoms of the different diseases that their learning about is that very well an it'll tell you i do think that in medical school you start the you start to think of the zebra more than the horses all the time like you known ism referring to it tin a you see footprints you you see ho prints you should think of horses but of course medical students you only think of the zebras there are some really funny things in medical school there are certain conditions that you spend much time thinking about that you have a very warped sense of their prevalence you i can medical schooners is condition called sarquedosis we i feel we never stop talking about sarquedoses ice seem three cases in my life i it is just not that common this it provided great teaching tool or something i do not know a concur t some of these things i do not no how much time did we spend talking about cuts an verses this is when people embryo logically have a reversed rotation and everything in their body is flipped literally everything is flipped their heart is on their right side their livers on the left side their appendix's on the left side and ism not making this common is have never seen eh a thing about boxing in the liver shot you go it you can easily be going for the wrong side of the via i swear to god as a medical student if you were told someone had last coded lower quadrant pain to which the answer is almost assuredly that they have i vaticulitus you would think i could have a pendicitus in the context of cities and verses li the fact that that would even register in the top and things that it could possibly be why yes you just have a totally warp sense of what is out there on well am this has been pure pleasure for me i do not know ago ass i do not about our listeners but for me this is among the things said i just delight in and and even more because you are the one across the table for me teaching me about these incredible find in and li addend and the gaps in those findings which are equally incredible because they are equally important to know about let us do this again in often absolutely next time on you are home court very well and bring a little bit of that

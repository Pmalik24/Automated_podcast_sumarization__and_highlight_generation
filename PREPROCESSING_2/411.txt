welcome to the hubermano a science science pace to for i maendurhubermen and on a professor of neurobiology and opthomology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor avid andiron doctor andiron is a professor of biology at the californium institute of technology often commonly referred to as called university doctor andiron's research focuses on emotions and states of mind and body and indeed he emphasizes how emotions happiness sadness anger and on are actually subcategories of what are generally governed by states that is things that are occurring in the nervous system in our brain end in the connections between brain and body that dictate whether not we feel good about how we are feeling and that drive our behaviors that is by us us to be in action or inaction and strongly influence the way we interpret are experience and our surroundings today doctor andiron teaches us for instance why people become aggressive and why that aggression can sometimes take the form of rage also talk about sexual behavior and the boundaries and overlap between aggression and sexual behavior and that discussion about aggression and sexual behavior also starch to focus on particular aspects of neral circuits and states of mind and body they govern things for instance male male aggression verses male female aggression verses female female aggression today you will learn a lot about the biological mechanisms that govern why we feel the way we feel indeed doctor andiron is an author of a terrific new popular book entitled the nature of the beast how emotions guide us have read this book several times now unwell you it contain many gems that are firmly grounded in the scientific research in fact a lot of what is in the book contrasts with many of the common myths about emotions and biology whether not your therapist or euros biologist or a simply just somebody interested in why we feel the way we feel and why we act the way we act i cannot recommend the book highly enough again the title is the nature of the beast how emotions guide us to day's discussion also ventures into topics such as mental health and mental illness and some of the exciting discoveries have been made by doctor andiron's laboratory and other laboratories identifying specific peptides that is small propenes that can govern whether not people feel anxious or less anxious aggressive or less aggressive since an importantarea of research that has direct implications for much of what we read about in the news both unfortunate and fortunate events and that will no doubt drive the future of mental health treatments doctor andiron is considered one of chemist pioneering and important researchers in neurobiology of our time indeed he is a member the national academy sciences and a toward hue's medical institute investigator have mention the oh my once or twice before when we have had other oh to my guests on this podcast but for those who ether not familiar the towards use medical institute funds a small number of investigators doing paretic surely high risk high benefit work and it is an extremely competitive process to identify those toward high's investigators they are mentally appointed then every five years they have to compete against one another and against a new in coming flock of would be station my investigators to get another five years of funding they are literally given a grade every five years as to whether or not they can continue not continue or whether not they should worry about being funded for an extended period of time doctor andiron has been an investigator with the toward hue's medical institute since nineteen eighty nine before we begin id to emphasized that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and efforts to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme i to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar now salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolyte concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to deposits in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back telectorolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one gram of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doom slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element element doctor slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor avid andiron avid great to be here and great to finally sit down and chat with you great to be here to thank you much i have a ton of questions but i want to start with some thing fairly basic but that ism aware is a pretty vast landscape and that is the difference between emotions and states if indeed there is a difference and how we should think about emotions what are they they have all these names happiness sadness depression a anger rage how she we think about them and why might states be at least as useful a thing to think about if not more useful that is great am first the short answer to your question is that i see emotions as a time of internal state in the sense that arousal also a type of internal state motivations of type of internal state sleep is a type of internal state and the simplest way i think of internal states is that as you have shown in your own work they change the in put to output transformation of the brain when your asleep you do not hear something that you would hear if you were awake unless it is a really really loud noise from that broad perspective i see emotion as a class of state that controls behavior the reason i think its useful to think about it as a state is it puts the focus on it as a nurobiological process rather than as a psychological process and this gets around all of the definitional problems that people have with the word emotion where many people it quite emotion with feeling which is a subjective sense that we can only study in humans because to find out what some of t feeling you have to ask them and people are the only animals that can talk that we can understand that is how i think about emotion its the you think if you think of an iceberg its the part of the iceberg that below the surface of the water the feeling part is the tip that sort of floating above the surface of your consciousness not that that is not important it is but you have to understand consciousness if you want to understand feelings and were not ready to study that an animals yet and that is how i think about it what are the different components of a state you mentioned a arousal as a key component what are some of the other features of states that represent this as you m beautifully put in your book that represent below the tip of the ice bright right a you can break states up a into different fascist or people would call them dimensions and a there havebeen people who have thought of emotions as having just really too dimensions a an arousal dimension how intense is it a and also valiant dimension a which is is it positive or negative good or bad a ralphadolfs and i have tried to expand that a little bit to think about components of emotion particularly those that distinguish emotion states from motivational states because they are very closely related a one of those important properties is persistence a and this is something that distinguishes state driven behaviors from simple reflects its reflects tend to terminate when the stimulus turns off the doctor hitting your knee with a hammer it initiates with the stimulus onset and it terminates with the stimulus offset emotions ten to outlast offer the stimulus that evoke them it your walking along a trail here in southern californium you hear a rattle snake rattling you can a jump in the air but your heart is going to continue to beat and your palm sweat and your mouth is going to be dry for a while after it slithered off in the bush and you are going to be hyper vigilant if you see something that even remotely looks snake a stick you are gan a stop and jump persistence is an important feature of of emotion states not all states have persistence for example you think about hunger once you have eaten the state is gone you are not hungry any more but if you are really angry and you get into a fight with somebody even after the fight is over you may remain riled up for a long time and it takes you a while to come down and that may have to do with the arousal dimension or some other part of it a and then a generalization is an important component of emotion states a that a make them if they have been a triggered in one situation they can apply to another situation and my favorite example of that is you come home from work and your kit is screaming if you had a good day at work you might pick it up and and soothe it if you hat a bad day at work you might react very differently to it and scream at it and that is generalization of the state that was triggered at work by something your saw said to you to completely different interaction and again that something that distinguishes emotion states for motivation states motivation sates are really specific find and eat food obtain and consume water and there there involved in homeostatic maintenance states are very mufti fascine and just asking questions about how these components of states are encoded what makes a state persist what gives a state a positive or negative vigilance how do you crank up or crank down the intense the state it just opens up a whole bunch of questions that you can ask in the brain with the kinds of tools we have now you mentioned arousal a few times and you mention vigilance realizing that there are these other aspects of states like to just talk about arouse all a bit more and vigilance because at a very basic level it seems to me that arouse all we can be very alerts and an past off street worried you have ransom ne a we can also be very alert and be quite happier of o theveilance flips i we can be very you people con be actually aroused be we be aroused in all sorts of ways is there any simple or simple is negro chemical signature that can flip valiant safer incite is there anyway that we can safely say that arousal with some additional dopamine release is going to be of positive vigilance an arousal with a very low dopamine is going to be of negative veiling ah i i would be reluctant to say that it is a chemical flip i would say its more likely to be a circuit flip different circuits being engaged in it might be that a given negro chemical even dopamine is involved in both positively vigilance arousal and negatively vigilance to arousal that is why people think about these as different axes i think the interesting question that that you touch on is is arousal something that is just completely generic in the brain or are there actually different finds of arousal that are specific to different behaviors you raise a question of sexual arousal feels different from aggressive arousal for example and we actually published a paper on this back in two thousand nine in fruitflies where we found some evidence fer two types of arousal states one of which is sleep wake arousal your more aroused when you wake up than when your sleep and fly show that and the other is a a startle response and arousal response to a mechanical stimulus a noxious mechanical stimulus if you puff air on flies kind trying to swat the wasp away from your burger a picnic table they come back more and more and more vigorously and we were able to direct this and show that although both of those forms of arousal require dopamine they were they were exerted through completely separable nerd circuits in the fly and that really put number one the emphasis on its the circuit the determines the type of arousal but also that arousal is not unitary that there are behavior specific forms of arousal and i think the jury is still out as to whether there is such a thing as completely generalize arousal or not i think some people would argue there is but i think more attention needs to be paid to this question of domain specific or behavior specific forms of arousal it is a super interesting idea was i ways thought of arouses along a continually unit been a panic attack at the one end of the extreme organ be in a coma and that somewhere in the mid your alerting calm but then this issue obeisance really as you as you say a presents this opportunity that really there might be multiple circuits for arousal or multiple mechanisms that would include nor them clues as well as different normal pathways to talk a bit about a state a if if it is indeed a state a which is aggression your laps worked extensively on this and if you would could you highlight some of it the key findings there a which brain air is are involved a the beautiful work of day in and others in your lab am that point to the idea that indeed there are and of switches in the brain but that thinking of switches for aggression might be too simple a how shall we think about aggression and it'll just sort of obscure the question a bit more by saying we see lots different kinds of aggression a this terrible so schoolshooting down in texts recently clearly an act that included aggression and yet you could imagine that is a very different type of aggression than at it in all outrage or control aggression when mother's there is a lot of variation there a what are your thoughts on aggression how its generated the neral circuit mechanisms and some of the variation in what we call aggression yet this is a great question and its a its a large area i would say that the first of all a the word aggression in my mind refers more to a description of behavior than it does to an internal state a aggression could reflect an internal state that we would call anger in humans or could reflect fear or it could reflect hunger if its predatory aggression and this gets at the issue that you raised of the different types of aggression that exist a the work that did did when she was in my lab a that really broke open the field to the application of modern genetic tools for studying circuits and mice is that she found away to evoke aggression in mice using of the genetics to activate specific neurons in region of the hypothalamus the ventrimedial hypothalamus v m h which people had been studying and and looking at for decades following first the work of a a in in hats the famous no well prize winning work of water hes and and then followed by work don by menocrook in the netherlands in rats where they would stick electrical wire into the brain and send electric currents into the brain and they could trigger a placid at to suddenly spare its teeth hiss and almost strike out at the experimenter a and they could trigger a a rats to fight with each other and even in messes original experiments he describes two types of aggression that he evokes from cats depending on wear in the hypothalamus he puts his electrode one of which he calls defensive rage that is the ears laid back teeth bared and hissing and the other one is predatory aggression where the the cat has its ears forward and its batting with its paw at a mouse object it wants to catches and wait he already had at that stage some information about segregation an the brain of different forms of aggression fast forward to a a two thousand eight two thousand nine a when dare came to the lab and we had started working on aggression and fruitfulness and i wanted to bring it into mice that we could apply genetic tools and we started by having die who was an electrophysiologist just repeat the electrical stimulation of the ventrimdial hypothalamus in the mouse just people don in rats in cats in computers even in monkeys and she could not get that experiment to work over forty different trials it just did not work what she got instead was fear behaviors she got freezing cornering and crouching and finally in desperation and we got a lot of in put from men crook on this he really was mystified why does not it work in mice we realized why there had been no paper on brain stimulated aggression in mice in fifty years cops the experiment does not work and the the one bit of credit i can claim there as i convinced dare to try the genetics because i it just had sort of om in to use deep in the brain from crawldice both in others work a and i thought may be because it could be directed more specifically to a region of the brain and types of cells and of the genetic stimulate then electrical stimulation it might work and divusaid never never we a work if it does not work with electricity why should it work with top the genetics and the fact is that it did work and we were able to a trigger aggression in this region using of the genetic stimulation of ventrimedeal hypothalamus and in retrospect i think the reason that we were seeing all these fear behaviors is because right at the upper part if you think of vent of ventrimedial hypothalamus a hair sitting on the ground the fat part of the pair o near the ground is where the aggression irons are but the upper part of the pair has fear neurons and it could be e use it small in a mouse when you inject electrical currents anywhere in the pair it flows up through the entire pair and it activates the fire circuits and those totally dominate aggression and that is why we were never able to see any fighting with electrical stimulation were when you use of the genetics you confine the stimulation just to the region where you in planted that channel redopsin get into those grants o and in fast ford from that from a lot of work from die now on her own and why you and with her stock and aigret walker a there's as well as work of other people there is evidence that the type of fighting that we were that we elicit when we stimulate v m h is offensive aggression that is actually rewarding to male my they it they it male mice will press learn to poke their nose or press a bar to get the opportunity to beat up a subordinate male mouse and in more recent experiments if you activate those neurons and the mouse has a chance to be in one of to compartments in a box they will gravitate towards the compartment where those neurons are activated it has a positive valance and when i went into this field when i was thinking well what goes on in my brain and my body when ism furious it certainly does not feel a rewarding experience its not something that i would want a repeat because it feels good when ism in that state it does not feel good at all when ism in that state and it is still i think a mystery as to where that type of aggression which is more defensive aggression the kind of aggression you feel if you are being attacked or if you been cheated my somebody where that is encoded in the brain and how that works still i think is a a very important mystery that we have not solved and predatory aggression there has been some progress on my show predatory aggression they use that to catch crickets that they eat and that involves different circuits than the ventrimedeal hypothalamic circuits it is become clear that if you want to call it the state of aggressive nests is multifaceted it depends on the type of aggression and it involves different sorts of circuits there is there is a paper suggesting that there might be a final common pathway for all aggression in a region which is one of my favorites its called the substantial in nominate the substance with no name i anaterisar yetis for the nucleus ambiguous you know or the zone insert of these are places that no one can think of what they are anyhow that might be a final common pathway for predatory aggression an offensive and defensive aggression but it can be really hard to tell just from looking at a mouse fight whether it is engaged in offensive or defensive aggression we have tried to take that a part using machine learning analysis of behavior but in rats for example it is much clearer when the animals engaged in offensive verses defensive aggression they direct their bights at different parts of the opponent's body in punacularss offense give aggression is flank directed defense give aggression goes for the neck goes for the throat have seen some nature specials where in a very am barbaric way at least to me it seems a hyenas will try and go after the the reproductive a axis they will go after testicles and penes and they busy ane o it seems they want a limit a future breeding potential butter pain that or area or creating or both ya i mean in terms of a offensive aggression and and the your a reflection that it does not feel good i mean i can say i know some people who really enjoy fighting am of relative who a lawyer he loves to argue and fight am i do not think of a in as physically aggressive fact he is not be loves to fight and loves to prosecute and go after people ants and he is pretty effective out it of a friend former a military special operations and very calm guy had a great careering in the a in military special operations and he he will quite you'll plainly say i love to fight it is one of t one of my great joys he really enjoyed his work ye a and and also respect to the other side because they offer the opportunity to test that that and to experience that joy in a kind of bazaar way to somebody me who it'll certainly a defend my stand if i need to but i certainly m do not concern myself somebody who offensively goes after peel just to go after them there is no a quote quote dopamean hit here are acknowledging that noblemen does many things of course i have a couple of questions about the way you describe this the circuitry i should say the way the circuitry is arranged and of course we do not know because a we were not consulted that the design face but why do you think there would be such a close positioning of neurons that can elicit such diverging states and behaviors mere talking about this pair shaped structure where the neurons that generate fear are cheek to jowl with thenurons that generate offensive aggression of all things it is a putting the neurons that control a swallowing next to the irons the control vomiting it seems to me that a on the one hand this is the way that nail circuits are often arranged and yet to me it is always been perplexing as to why this would be the case i think that that is a very pro found question and a i have wondered about that allot a if you think from an evolutionary perspective a it might have been the case that defensive behaviors and fear arose before offensive aggression a because animals first foremost have to defend themselves from predation by other animals and may be its only when the comfortable with having warded off predation and made themselves safe that they can start about start to think about whose n to be the alphimal in in my group here and it could be that if you think that brain regions and sell populations evolved by duplication and modification of preexisting sell populations that might be the way that those regions wound up next to each other a and developmentally they start out from a common pool of precursors that expresses the same gene the fear neurons and the aggression turns and then with development it get shut off in the aggression neurons and maintained in the fear neurons now that that new says gets just in it is an accident of evolution and development but i think there must be a functional part as well one thing we know about offense of aggression is that strong fear shuts it down whereas defensive aggression at least in rats is actually enhanced by fear it is one of the big differences between defensive aggression and offensive aggression and you think about it if you think about if offense of aggression is rewarding and pleasurable if you start to get really scared that tends to take the fun out of it and may be these two regions are close to each other to facilitate inhibition of aggression by feet the fear neurons we know for a fact that if we deliberately stimulate those fear neurons at the top of the hare when two animals are involved in a fight it just stops the fight dead in its tracts and they go off into the corner and freeze at least hierarchically it seems fear is the dominant behavior over offensive aggression and how that inhibition would work is not clear cause all these neurons are pretty much excusatory there almost all gludimaturgion and one of the interesting questions for the future is how exactly does fear dominate over and shut down offensive aggression the brain how does that work is at all circuitry of their chemicals involved what is the mechanism and when is it called into play a but i think that the way i tend to think about why these anurans are are all mixed up together and it is not just fight and freezing or fight and flight there are also metabolic neurons that are mixed together in i my is well controlling the body while metabolic ya they are furans there that respond to glucose when glucose goes up in in your blood stream there activated and the my has a whole history in the field of obesity because if you destroy it in a rat you get a fat rat the way most of the world thinks about we m h as they think about oh that is the thing that keeps you from getting fat as the antiobesity area but in the area of social behavior we see it as a center for control of aggression and four behaviors and again why these these anurans in these functions i i to call them the for is feeding freezing fighting and mating that they all seem to be closely intermingled with each other maybe because cross talk between them is very important to help the animals brain decide what behavior to priorities and what behavior to shut down at any given moment one of the things that we will do is linked to the incredible videos of these mice that have a selective stimulation of neurons in the via douse and the other studies that you have done one of whenever i teach i show those videos at some point a with the caveats and warnings that are required when one is about to see a video of a mouse trying to mate with another mouse were mating with another mouse and they seem both to be quite happy about the mating experience ills as far as we know as observers of mice and then upon stimulation of those we eh neurons one of the mice she tries to kill the other mouse and then when that stimulation is stopped they easily go back to hanging out they do not go right back to man i some reconciliation clearly that needs to happen fir yes we assume but it is just striking i think equally striking as the video where the mouse is alone in there with the glove the veemahinarons are stimulated and the mouse goes into a rage at looks his it dance to kill the glove basically a striking i encourage people to go watch those because it really puts a ut a tremendous amount of color on what we are describing and it is just the idea that there are switches in the brain a to me really became clear upon seeing that o one of the concepts souse me one of the concepts that a you have raised in your lectures before and and that i think was he's idea is this idea of a sort of hydraulic pressure maybe as call tat could comrade cant speak dow s use me coward lore's earn who talked about a kind of hydraulic pressure towards behavior i'mfascinated by this idea of hydraulic pressure a because i do not consider myself a hot tempered person but i am familiar with the fact that when i lose my temper it takes quite a while for me to simmer dow i cannot think about anything else i do not want a think about anything else in fact think trying to think about anything else becomes aversive to me which to me under scores this notion of periodization of the different of states and potential conflicting states what do you think funnels in to this idea of hydraulic pressure toward a state and why is it perhaps that sometimes we can be very angry and if we succeed in winning an argument all a sudden it will subside am because clear that means that there are external influences it is a complex space here that we are re creating i realize them creating a bit of a crowd and ism doing it on purpose because to me the idea of a hydraulic pressure towards a state sleep there is a sleep pressure there is there is a pressure toward a it that all make sense but what is involved is it to multifactorial to to actually i separate out the variables but what what is what is really driving hydraulic pressure toward a given state ye a really important question ah i think one way that is helpful at least for me to break this question of part and think about it is to distinguish home static behaviors that is need base behaviors where the pressure is built up because of a need ism hungry i need to need ism thirsty i need to drink ism hot i need to get to a cold place aspasicaly the thermostat model of your brain you have a set point and then if the temperature gets to hot you turn on the a c and if the temperature gets to cold you turn on the hetero you put yourself back to the set point i do not think that is how a egression works that is it is not that we all go around at least subjectively i do not go round with an accumulating need to fight which i then look for something to an excuse to release it now maybe there are people that do that they go out and look for your fights to get into tor quitter ye twit water send to your arms or half joke and gets twitter seems to draw a reasonably sized crowd of people that are there for combat of some sort i even though the total intellectual power of any of their comments is about that of a cap gun the seem o really to fire i off that patron but it in but i agree it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called a one is a vehement mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundation a nutritional needs have been taking athletic green since two thousand an twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i starry taking athletic greens in the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets o me in the robotics that i need for got health i got is very important its populated by got mycrobioda that communicate with the brain the maun system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probation and athletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition it lentic greens contains a number of adaptions fitments and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it tastes crime if you to try at lentic greens you can go to at let greens dot calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin three k too again that is that let greens dot cams slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the year supply a vitamin three k to ye you can think you can think of this accumulated hi drastic pressure either being based on something that you were deprived of creating an accumulating need or something that you want to do building up a a abri or a pressure to do that and the natural way to think about that at least for me is as gradual increases in curl activity in a particular region of the brain and for example in the area of the bring of the hypothalamus that controls feeding shot sternson and others have shown that the hungrier you get the higher the level of activity in that region in the brain and then when you eat boom the activity goes right back down again and a that state is actually negatively veiling it is the animal on feels increasingly uncomfortable just we feel increasingly uncomfortable the hungrier we are and then when we eat it tamps it down but there is this increased activity and i think in the case of a egression our data another show that the more strongly you drive this region of the brain ontogenetically the more of just ta hair trigger you need to set the animal off to get a to fight and the interesting thing is that if there is nothing for the animal to attack it does not really do much when your stimulating this region it sort of wanders around the cage a little bit more but it will not actually show over attack if unless you put something in front of it and the same thing is true for the areas we have described the control making behavior is what mindset is working on you can stimulate those areas till you blue in the face and the more just sort of wanders around but if you put another mouse in was you will try to mount that mouse if you put a combust in the case he will try to mount the combust and its it becomes a sort of any port in the storm there is this idea that the drive is building up pressure that somehow needs to be released where that pressure is actually being exerted if you accept that it is increased activity in some circuit or circuits some place what is it pushing up against that needs something else to sort of unplug it in the in the moment's hydraulic model that is you do not see the behavior until you release valve on this bucket and let the accumulated pressure flow out and that is one of the things were trying to study in the context of the making behavior is we've how does the information that there is an object in front of you come together with this drive state that is generated by stimulating these neurons on the hypothalamus to say o k pull the trigger and go it is time to mate it is time to attack and were just starting to get some insights to that now fascinating i should mention people a a doctor arson mention mindset mindset has a former graduates tune of mind that is now a nostoc in davit's lab and a i have not caught up with her recently to hear about these experiments with say sound fascinating i ism would love to spend some time on this issue of why is it that a a mouse will not attack nothing but it will attack even a glove a or in why a we only trying mate if there is another a mouse to mate with sash a i think fortunately a for you you aren't spending a lot of time on twitter an insturambut or youth a but there is this whole online community that exists now as far as i know it is a almost exclusively young males who are obsess with this idea a all to say it has a name it is called no far of no masturbation as a way to maintain their motivation to go out and actually seek mates because of the a ready availability of online pornography there is any probably a much larger population of young males that are never shall going out and seeking mates because the getting predicted et camera the as ye serious issue that came up in our episode with on olempky who wrote the bookdopemi nation o a because they available build the pornography there is a whole social context that is that is been created run this in genuine addiction a humans a are not the mice r mice or not the humans a humans ism seem to resolve the issue on their own yon ways that might actually impede am seeking in finding of dextral partners any were long term mates serious issue there a i raise it as a serious issue f that that i hear a lot about s i could asked hundreds if not thousands of questions about this is there any physiological basis for what they call no far and i never actually reply cause here is a data but a but what your raising hair is a very interesting a mechanistic a scenario that a that can cannon as you mention is being explored what do we know about the internal state of a mouse whose venerate is being stimulated or a mouse whose a break other brain region that can stimulate the desire to mate what do we know about the internal state of that a mouse if it is just alone in the cage wandering around as it wandering round really wanting dilate and really wanting to fight we of course do not know a but is its heart rate up is its blood pressure up an is it wishing that there was pornography ais it a a some things going on presumably that is different a then prior to that stimulation and is it arousal a and what you think it is about the visualaral factory perception of the conspecific that gates this tremendous repertoour behaviors right that that that is the central question i can say at least with respect to the fur neurons that sit on top of the aggression neurons we know that when those irons are activated up the genetically in the same way we would activate the aggression neurons that there's clearly an arousal process that occurring you can see the pupils dilate in the animal there is an increase in stress hormone release into the blood stream we have shown that a heart rate goes up in addition to the drive to actually freeze which is what those animals do there is autonomic arousal and negro endocrine activation of stress responses and some of that is probably shared by the aggression neurons and the madynuronts although we haven't investigated it in as much detail but i would not be surprise because they project to many of the same regions that the a furneronts project to which is a interesting issue in the contacts to discuss later may be in the context of why were comfortable with mental illnesses that are based on maladaptations of fear but not mental illnesses that are based on maladdaptations of a egression if they have pretty similar circuits in the brain but a that is that is how i would imagine there is an arousal dimension as you say their stress hormones that are activated these regions cremate projects to about thirty different regions in the brain and it gets input from about thirty different regions i kind of see it as both an antenna and a broadcasting center is a satellite dish that takes in information from different sensory modalities smell may be vision mechanical a merchant sensation and then it sort of synthesizes and integrates that into a fairly low dimensional as the computational people call it a representation of this pressure to attack and at broadcast that all over the brain to trigger all these systems that have to be brought into play if the animal is can engage in aggression because aggression is a very risky thing for an animal to engage it it could wind up losing and it could wind up getting killed and and s o it is brain constantly has to make a coss benefit analysis of whether it continue on that path or to back off as well and i think that part of this broadcasting function of this region is engaging all these other brain domains that play a role in this and of cost benefit analysis one talk more about making behavior but as a seaway to that as were talking abut aggression and making behavior i think hormones and whenever there is an opportunity on this podcast to shatter a common myth i i grab it one of the common myths that is out there i think that persists is that testosterone makes animals and human's aggressive and estrogen makes animals placid and kind were emotional and as we both know nothing cod be further from the truth although there sumpter to the idea the these hormones are all involved a robertsupolsky a supplied some information to me when became on this podcast that if you give people exogenous testosterone it tends to make the more of the way they were a before if they were jerk before that become more of a jerk if they were very altruistic the become more altruistic and then eventually i pointed out you will aromatize that testosterone and estrogen in you it are getting opposite vet it is a it is a mercy space it is not straightforward but if ism not mistaken testosterone plays a roll in generating aggression however the specific hormones that are involved in generating aggression via v m h are things other than testostronks you tells o la bit more about that cars some interesting surprises in the ye that is a really important question the when we finally identified the neuron's in m h that control aggression with a molecular marker we found out that that marker was the estrogen receptor that might strike you as a little strange why should a egression promoting neurons in male mice be labelled with the estrogen receptor a other labs have shown that the estrogen receptor in adult male mice is necessary for egression if you knock out the gene in v m h they do not fight and it is been shown and a lot of it's work from your colleague near you shaw at standard who is one of my former oh d students that if you castrate a mouse ah and it loses the middle ability to fight not only can you rescue fighting with a testosterone in plant but you can rescue it with an estrogen implant you can by pass completely the requirement for testosterone to restore aggressiveness to the mice and as you say it is because many of the effects of testosterone although not all many of them are mediated by its conversion to estrogen by a process called a romanization it carried out by an ensile called aromatic in fact people may a most of your listeners may have heard of aromatastecaus aromatics in hitters are widely used in female humans as advent chemotherapy for press cancer they are away of reducing the production of estrogen by preventing testosterone from being converted into estrogen and a fact there a lot of animal experiments showing if you give males bromates an hitters they stop fighting as well as also a stop being sexually active a and that is one of the counterintuitive ideas and neral has shown the progesterone also seems to play a role in aggression because these aggression drops also express the progesterone receptor here are two hormones that her classically thought of as female reproductive formothis is what goes up and goes down during the extra cycle estrogen and progesterone and yet their playing very important role in controlling aggression in male mice and presumably in male humans as well fascinating western is doing many more things than i think most people believe an testosterone is doing maybe different and fewer things in some cases in more an others have known some aggressive females some have been alive what is involved in female aggression that unique from the pathways that generate male aggression great great question a we and other labs have studied this in both mice and also in fruitfulness a one thing in mice that is distinguishes aggression an female from males is that male mice are pretty much ready to fight at the drop of a hat female mice only fight when they are nurturing and nursing their pups after they have delivered a litter and there is a window there where they become viper aggressive and then after their pups a wand that aggressiveness goes away this is pretty remarkable that you take a virgin female mouse and expose it to a male and her response is to become sexually receptive at to mate with him and now you letter have her pups and you put the same male or another male mouse in the cage with her and instead of trying to mate with him she attacks him there is some presumably hormonal and also neuronal switch that is occurring in the brain that switches the response of the female from sex to aggression a when she goes from virginity to maternity and we recently showed in a paper this is work from one of my students among you let that with invehemation females there are two clearly divisible subsets of estrogen receptor anurans and she showed that one of those subsets controls fighting and the other one controls mating and effect if you stimulate the fighting specific sub subset in a virgin you can get the virgin to attack which is something that we were never never able to do before ah and if you stimulate the mating one you erased mating the reason we could never get these results when we stimulated the whole population of estrogen receptinurans is that these effects are opposite and the angel out and it turns out that if you measure the activity of the fighting and the mating anurans going from a virgin to a maternal female the aggression anurans are very low in their activity in the virgin but once the female has pups the activation ability of those errands goes way up and the mating anuran stay the same if you think of the balance between them a sea saw in the virgin there is more activity in the mating anurans than in the fighting anurans whereas in h in the nursing mother there is more activity more activation in the in the other way around the fighting anurans in the mane did i say fighting and mind the first mating guards dominate fighting in the virgin fighting anurans dominate mating in in the mother that is a really cool a a observation and its not something that happens in males and we do not know what causes that or controls that a interestingly the the this gets into the whole issue of neurons that are present in females but not in males we have known for the field is know for long time that male and female fruit flies have secspecific anurans and most of the anurans that we have identified in fruit flies that control fighting in males are male specific they're not found in the female brain but recently we discovered set of female specific fighting anurans in the female brain a together with a a couple of other laboratories now they do share one common population of anurans in both male and female flies that in females activates the female specific fighting anurans and in males activates the male specific fighting anurans as kind of a hierarchy with this common euro on top and in mice we discovered that there are male specific anurans in vihemach and those anurans are activated during male aggression now the neurons that are active in females when females fight in viemach are not see specific they are also found in males this is already showing you some complexity the male ma ousvimach has both male specific aggression neurons and generic aggression grants and then the female am h the making cells are only found in females they are female specific and not found in the male brain and were thing to find out what these sex specific populations of neurons are doing but that indicates that that is some of the mechanism by which different sees show different behaviors ism fixated on this a transition from the virgin female males to the maternal female males i have a couple of questions about whether or not for instance the transition is governed by the presence of pop tolerance if you take a virgin females she will mate with a male a one she is had pops shall try and fight that male or presumably another intruder female i equally towards females and male intruders does that require the presence of her pops meaning if you to take those pops and give them to another mother it does she revert to the more virgin behavior is it related to is it trigger by lactation or could it actually be triggered by the mating behavior itself cause its possible for the virgin to become a non virgin but not actually have a litter of pops right those are all great questions and we do not know the answer most of them what i can say is that a a nursing mother does not have to have her pops with her in the cage in order to attack an intruder male or an intruder female a a she is just in a state of brain that makes her aggressive to any intruder and those aggression neurons in that female's brain are activated by both male and female intruders equally whereas in male mice the aggression irons are only ever activated by males not by females because males are never supposed to attack females their only supposed to mate with them that is another difference in how those neurons are tuned to signals from different conspecific does it require lactation i do not know the answer to that i think there are some experiments were people have tried to classical experiments people have tried to reproduce the changes and hormones that occur during pregnancy in female rats to see if it can make them aggressive and some of those manipulations do to some extent but there is a whole biology there that remains to be explored about how much of this is hormones how much of this is circuitry and electricity and how much of it is other factors that we have an identified yet i don ant a anther promorifies but a well just asked the question said the other dale is watching a ferrets mate i musteline er their must lids and ha their making behavior i guess i did not say who was watching this does not matter a ai it simply does not matter but if one observes the mating behaviors of different animals we know that there is a tremendous range of many behaviors in humans am there can be no aggressive component that count be aggressive component humans have all sorts of kings fetishes and behaviors and most of which probably has never been document because most of this happens in private here i always say on this pock has any time we are talking about sexual behavior in humans were always making the presumption that it is a consensual age appropriate contacts appropriate in species appropriate lets they were talking about a old different species with that said just to set context as watching this video of ferrets sting and it is quite violent actually there is a lot of backbiting there is a lot of squealing if i were going to project and appromorifies it'd say it is not really clear they both want to be there it you would just one would make that assumption and course we do not know we have no idea this could be the ritual am it seems to me that there is some cross over of aggression and mating behavior circuitry during the act of the mating and do you think that reflects this sort of am a stew of competing neurons that are prioritizing in real time because of course as states they have persistence as you point out you can imagine that states overlapping afore different states that the motivational drive to made the motivational drive to get away from this experience the motivational drive to am to eat at some point a to delicate at some point all o the things are competing and what were really seeing is a biasimprobabilities but when you look at mating behavior of various animals you see and aggressive component sometimes but not always is it species specific is at context specific and more generally do you think that there a is crosstalk between these different urinal populations and the animal itself might be kind of confused about what is going on right great great questions i cannot really speak to the issue of whether this is species specific as ism not a naturalist zoologist have seen you have in the wile for example lions when they mate have seen them in africa there often biting component of that as well one of the things that surprised us when we identified neurons in vim vile the control aggression in males is that with in that population there is a subset of neurons that is activated by females during male female mating encounters now you do not generally think of mouse sex as rough sex but there there is a lot of what superficially looks violent behavior sometimes especially if the female rejects the male and runs away and there is some evidence that those female selective neurons in viemach are part of the mating a behavior if you shut m down the animals do not mate as effectively as they otherwise would a what happens when you stimulate them we do not yet know because we do not have a way to specifically do that without activating the male aggression anurans but i i think they must be there for reason because the emacheis not traditionally the brain region to which male sexual behavior has been a sign that is another area call the medial peptic area and there we have shown that there are grants that definitely stimulate making behavior in fact if we activate those making grants in a male while its in the middle of attacking another male it will stop fighting start singing to that male and start to try to mount that male until we shut those grants off those are the make love not war grants and we mate are the mate war not love turns and there are dense interconnections between these two nuclei which are very close to each other into the in the brain and we shown that some of those connections are mutually inhibitory to prevent the animal from attacking mate that it supposed to be making with or to prevent it from making with some a enanimalat supposed to be attacking but it is also possible that there are some cooperative interactions between those structures as well as a antagonistic interactions and the balance of whether it is the cooperative or antagonistic interactions that are firing at any given moment in a making encounter as you suggest may determine whether at a moment of of a of a coital bliss among to lions may suddenly tern into a snap or a growl and a bearing of fangs we do not know that but certainly the substrate the wiring is there for that to happen insure people's i e minds a running wild with all this it'll just uses as an opportunity to rest something have wondered about for far too long which is a have afrenusae psychiatrist to works on the treatment of fetishes is is not a psychiatric that i was treated by altos point that out but a they mention something very interesting to me long ago which is that when you look at true fetishes and what means the criteria for fetish that there does seem to be some what one would think what be competing circuitry that suddenly becomes a a line for instance a avoidance of a theses dead bodies feet things are very infected typically those states and of disgust a antagonistic to states of desire as one would hope is that present a during sexual behavior fetishes often in solve exactly those things that are aversive feet a dead bodies a disgusting things to most people and true fetishes in the pathologic sense a exist when people have it a basically requirement for thinking about or even the presence of those a ordinarily disgusting things in order to become sexually aroused as if the circuitry has crossed over and there the statement that wrong my mind was people do not develop fetishes to mail boxes or to the color red or to random objects in things they develop fetishes to things that are highly infectious and counter reproductive appetitive states i i find that interesting i do not know if you have any reflections on that as to why that math be a ism tempt tod to ask with an i you've ever observed a fetish behavior in mice but a i find it fascinating that you have this area of the brain that highly can serve the hypothalamus which you have these dense populations intermixed and that the addition of a forebrain it especially in humans that can think an make decisions could in some ways facilitate these the expression of these primitive behaviors but could also complicate the expression of primitive behaviors right i i would agree i think one way of looking at fetishes from a nerbiological standpoint is that they represent a kind of a headitive conditioning where something that is naively aversive or disgusting bi being repeatedly haired with a rewarding experience changes it is valance its sin that now it somehow produces the anticipation of reward the next time a person season i know how i do not know that literature in animal i do not know if you could condition a mouse to eat fesses for example although there are animals that are naturally coprofag that is in maybe mice do that occasionally ism not sure but a that is one way to think about it and that could certainly involve in humans the more recently of all parts of the brain the quarter that is for of orchestrating both what behaviors are happening and whether reward states are turning on in association with those behaviors that are happening and that is the that is the part that i think is difficult in challenging to study in a mouse but a certainly certainly bears thinking about because it is a really interesting again for o counter intuitive aspect again rough sects people that want to have fighting or violence or aggressiveness in order to be sexually arouse and a a fetishes in fact that when we made that discovery initially it it raise the question m i mind whether a some people that your or serial rapists for example a engaged sexual violence might in some level have their wires crossed in some way that that these states that are supposed to be pretty much separated and mutually antagonistic are not in our actually more rewarding and reenforcing a i think it is gan to be a long time before we have figured it out but when you think about it there is know treatment that we have for a violent sexual offender that eliminates the violence but not the sexual desire and sexual urge whether it is physical castration or chemical castration it eliminates both defileanarea that i think i human narc science in general needs a lot of a tools i a in terms of had o probe and manipulate neral circulatory it'd love to turn to this area that you mention the medial peptic area a ism fascinated by it because just as within the via ate you have these neurons for mating and fighting regression a minor standing is medial peptic area a contain anurans for mating but also for temperature regulation and perhaps ism making too much of a leap here but have always wondered about this phrase in heat a as certainly the a menstrual and a or extra cycle in females is relate to change s embody temperature that measuring body temperatures one way that womingcon verily reliably predictopulation et camera although additional this is not a show about contraception please rely a multiple methods has necessary do not use this discussion as your a guide for contraception based on temperature but if you stimulate certain neurons in the medial peptic area you can trigger dramatic changes embody temperature and or mating behavior what is the relationship if any between temperature and mating reduce simply not know ah i do not know what the relationship is between temperature and mating neurons in the peptic area a i suspect that they are different populations of neurons because it is become pretty clear that the peptic area has many different subsets of anurans that are specifically active during different behaviors even different phases of mating behave there are mounting neurons there intermission thrusting anurans and ejaculation neurons and sniffing neuron what i i id think have heard this before but i just one to make sure that ye will get this i wont make sure i get this your telling me within me to met thin medial preopticary their specific neurons that if you stimulate them will make males thrust as if there making no this is not based a on on stimulation experiments is based on imaging experiments rights now that we see when we look in the peptic area at what anurans are active during different phases of aggression we see that there are different anurans that are active during sniffing mounting thrusting and ejaculation they become repeatedly activated each time the animal goes through that catering mating during the mating cycle there are also some nuronszer that are active during aggression which are distinct and we do not know whether those anurans are there to promote aggression or to inhibit mating when animals are fighting we have some evidence that suggest may be the latter but we do not know for sure yet the the thermosensitive anurans are really interesting because you mention a the phrase in heat and that in the context of aggression you talk about hot blooded people or hot heads there is just recently a paper showing there are thermos regulatory anurans in vehemach as well all of these homeostatic systems for metabolic control and temperature control are intermingled in these nuclei these zones that control these basic survival behaviors mating and aggression and predator defense and i would imagine that the thermoregulation is tightly connected to energy expenditure a and and that again these anurans are mixed together to facilitate into ration of all these signals by the brain in some way that we do not understand to maintain the proper balance between energy conservation and energy an sumption during this particular behavior or that behavior may have always been fascinated by the question why is it that a violence goes up in the summer time when the temperatures are high does it really have something to do with the idea that increase temperature increases violence seems hard to believe because where home thermic and we pretty much stay around ninety eight point six farenhite a could be other social reasons why that happens people are outside out on the street bumping into each other but i think there could well be something that is thermoregulation to aggressiveness as well as to a mating behavior fascinating a i as a in the hopes that in may be in the years to come mere lab part some of the temperature relationships it at i realize it could be also a regulated by hormones in general its tapping into two systems for completely different reasons but a anyway at aware that that inintreates me because of this notion of hot headed is i school common collected and also a the fact that i or be should have asked about this earlier that arousal itself is tethered to the whole making i reproductive process n without a sort of sea sawing back between the sympathetic omparisympathetic a arousal relaxed states there is no mating that will take place a it is fascinating the way these different competing forces in seesaw us operate several times during the discussion far we have a hit on this idea that the same behavior can reflect different states and different states can converge on a multiple behaviors as well you had a paper not long ago about mounting behavior a which i found fascinating a maybe could tell us about that result because to me it really speaks to the fact that mounting behavior can in one contact be sexual an another contacts actually be related to we presume dominance and i think that a my friends a who practise augite a will say they when i talk about that result this say of course mounting the others in dominating them it is there is nothing sexual about it it is about overtaking them physically literally being on their next side as opposed to on their own lying on their own back a fascinating very primitive and yet a i think speak this idea that mounting behavior might be one of the most fundamental ways in which animals in perhaps even humans express dominance end or sexual interactions ye and that fascinating question and it was harder to figure out than you might have thought we have there is been this debate for a long time in the field when you see to male mace met mice mounting each other is this homosexualbehavior is this a case of mistaken sexual identification or is this dominance behavior and if you train an a i algorithm to try to distinguish a male male mounting from male female mounting it does not do a very good job because meteorically those behaviors look similar and a how did we wind up figuring outs that most male male mounting is dominance mounting the two important clues one is the context and male male mounting tends to be more prominent among mice when they have not had a lot of fighting experience and then as they become more experienced and fighting they will show relatively less mounting towards the other male and more attack until transition quickly from mounting to attack and the mounting is always seen in this contact of an overall aggressive interaction and then the second thing which believe it are not wit suggested by a computational theoretical person in my lab and kenned who now is r own last north western she said well males are known to sing when they mount females ultrasonic vocalizations why do not you see what kinds of songs there singing when their mounting males may be it is a different kind of song will we found out as they do not sing at all when their mounting a male you can easily distinguish whether mounting behavior by a male mouse is reproductive or agonistic aggressive according to whether it is accompanied by ultrasonic vocalizations or not and it turns out that different brain regions are maximally active during these different types of mounting v m ah the aggression locus is actually act give during dominance mounting and you can stimulate mounting if you ominous mounting if you weakly activate v m h were as empty a is most strongly activated during sexual mounting and that is always accompanied by the ultrasonic vocalization this shows how difficult and dangerous it can be to try to infer and animals state or intent or emotion from the behavior that it is exhibiting because the same behavior can mean very different things depending on the context of the interaction with the animal now a even more with when that animal is a a human or or is multiple humans that is right and there are many examples animals show chasing to obtain food a prey animal that they are get to kill and eat and they show chasing to obtain a mate that there can have sex with and the intent of the chasing is completely different and we do not know in all these cases whether there are separate circuits or comment circuits that are being activated ism obsess with dogs and dog breeds and et camera et camera and a one thing i can tell you is that female dogs will mount and thrust we had a female it'll mix very sweet dog a but in observing her it can it convinced me that one can never assume that male dogs are more aggressive than female dogs it there is a it turns out in talking if ye word is quite skilled it doginetics and dog breeding that there is a dominant irked within a litter and it crosses over male female a delineations yuan get a female in the letter that is very dominant a male it's very subordinate and it no one really males what what relates to this also by little dogs sometimes will well get right up in the face of a big doberman picture and just our barking which is a idiotic thing for it to do but they can e they can be dominant over a much larger dog very strange a to me anyway female female mounting you observe it in mice a are there known circuits and o what evokes female female mounting or female to male mounting if if it occurs good yes there is female there are clear examples of females displaying male type mounting behavior towards other females we see this most commonly in the lab where we are housing females with their sisters say three or frena cage we take one out and we have her mate with e male where the males doing the mounting now we take that female and we put her back in the cage with her liter mates and she starts mounting them what the function of that is if it has any function or what it means what is driving it we do not know but we do more that if we stimulate the mount the coranto control mounting in males in the medial peptic area if we stimulate that same population in females it evokes male type mounting towards either a male or a female target in fact we have a move where we have a female that has just been mounted by a male the males on top and she is underneath and we stimulate those that region of empeawa in the female and she rolls out from underneath the male who is just mounted her circles around behind him and climbs up on top of him and starts to try to mount him and thrust at him that has a name on line it is called a switch the do not ask me how i know that o a but it is a pretty wait is a it is a term let that ye hear a you'll hear that the the term topping from the bottom which it sounds that is a literal topping for i obey that is a more of a psychological phrase from what i hear i friends that are are educating me in this a language mostly because i find this kind of norbiological discussion fascinating at some point right it we i attempt in my mind to superimpose observations from the the online community that ism told about and asked about ism to this but i wish shoe point out it is always dangerous and and in in fact in a party to make a one to one lea link you don't a humans are they maintain all the same neral circuitry in pathways that we are talking about to day and mice but a that forebrain does a allow for context et camera what the function is of a of a female mounting i do not know it could be a type of dominance display it is hard to measure that because people have not worked on female dominants hierarchies to the same extent that they have worked on male dominants hierarchies but it indicates that the circuits for male type mounting are there in females as a early work from gathering pooch suggested some years ago fascinating fascinate i love that paper because as you point out for chase that a for mount ting behavior and we see it and we think one thing specifically am an after hearing this resoled she ism not a big fan of of fight sports i watch them occasionally cause friends are into them but i have seen boxing match is am a ma match is were at the end of a round if some one felt that they dominated they will do the sportsmen thing of a thrusting on the back of the other person rlityg off almost dominated you and i know it mimicking sexual behavior but there is no reason to think that its sexual but there sending a message of dominance is what what implies it'd love to talk about something am slightly off from the circuitry but i think that is related to the circuitry at least in some way which is this structure that have always been fastening by and i cannot figure out what the he it is for seems to be involved in everything which is the p a g the periaqueductal gray ice l bet further back in the brain for people do not know it is been studying the contacts a pain it is been studied in the contacts of the called lord doses response tho the receptivity or arching of the back of the female to receive intermission and making from the male how shall we think about p a g am clearly cannot be involved in it everything ism messing it is at least as complex as some of these other regions that we have been talking bout different types of neuron's controlling different things but how does p g play into this in particular i one i know is there is some mechanism of pain modulation and control during fighting and or making and the reason i ask is that i while ism not a combat sports person years ago i i distal of bit of marshal its and it always was a impressive to me how little it hurt to get punched during a fight and how much it hurt afterwards right there clearly as some indigenous pain control am that then wears off and then you feel beat up am release in my case i felt beat up what is p g doing vs v pain and vs v and what is pain doing vest of e these other behaviors good good i think of p g a old fashion telephone switchboard were there are there calls coming in and then the cables have to be punched in to the right whole to get the information to be routed to the right recipient on the other end of it a because pretty much every type of innate behavior you can think of has had the pay implicated there is a whole literature a showing the involvement of the pay in fear different regions of the pay the dorsal pay is involved in panic behavior running away the ventral pay is involved in freezing behavior a the both the my away and v m h send projections to the pay to different regions of the pay in cross section i hate to say this but in crossection the pay and looks the water in a toilet when you are it landing over and open toilet bowl and if you imagine a clock face projected on to that it is the pay has sectors from one to twelve may be even more of them and in each of those sectors you find different anurans from the hypothalamus are projecting could turn out that there is a topographic arrangement along the torso ventral axis of the pay and the mediolateral axis of the pay that determines that type of behavior that will be emitted when anurans in that reed in are stimulated and i think for of all of the evidence is pointing in that direction but by know means has it been mapped out now the thing that you mention about a it not hurting when you got beat up during martial arts there is a well known phenomenon called fear induced a analgesia where when an animal is in a high state of fear if its trying to defend itself there is a a suppression of pain responses and ism not sure completely about the mechanisms and how well that understood but for example a the the adrenal gland has a peptide in it that is released from the a renal medulla which controls the after flight responses and that peptide has analgesic activities was that septa is called bovine a renal medullary peptide of twenty two monoacid residues and i only know about it because it activates a receptor that we discovered many years ago that is involved in pain and we thought it promoted pain but it turns out that this actually inhibits paints an indigenous analgesic whether this is happening this type of a of analgesia is happening when an animal is engaged in offensive aggression or in making behavior i do not know but it certainly is possible and i do not know whether these a analgesic mechanisms are happening in the pay they could also be happening a little further down in the spinal cord the pay is really continuous with the spinal cord if you just follow it down towards the talk of an animal you will wind up in the spinal cord and a a and it could be that there are influences acting at many levels on pain in the pay and in the spinal court as well and it may well be known i just do not know what i want it distinguished clearly between things that are not known that i know are unknown which is it a fairly small area where i have experts from things that may be known but ism ignorant of them because i just do not have a broad enough knowledge base to now appreciate am does define actions a thank you a also i think this description of is it old fashion telex phones which word and a and now every time i look into the toilet it'll think about the pariah i never time i see in image of part i o i o gas a about a to that is tat at a not description a because in fact drew a circlthinga a a well it'll put up pose at a link to a picture of page and you will understand why why avid and i are chuckling hair because indeed it looks a toilet a when staring into a toilet tell us about take kina give talked about this a couple times on different podcast episodes because a it is relationship to social isolation and a in part because the podcast was launch during a time when there was more social isolation a minorsany is that take kina and you will tell us what it is in moment a its present in flies in mice and inhuman and may do similar things in those species that is right take kina is a refers to a family of related negro peptides these are brain chemicals a there different from dopamine an ceratonan in that there not small organic molecules there actually short pieces of proline that are directly encoded by genes that are active in specific means and not in others and when those neurons are active those negro peptides are released together with classical transmitters ultimate whatever take kinas have bee famously implicated in pain peace particularly take khan one which is called substance pe one of the original hair modulating this is something that promotes in lavatory pain but there are other take kinangenes in mice there are two in humans i think there three and a in drysophl of there's one and the way we got into take kinas is from studying aggression in flies we thought since negro peptides have this remarkable parallel evolutionary conservation of structure and function neuropeptide y controls feeding in worms in flies and mice and in people ocitosen peptides control reproduction in worms and mice and in people we thought we might find peptides at control aggression in flies in a people and we did a a screen by a screen of peptides and found in deed that one of the take kinas trysophlataki kina those neurons when you activate them strongly promote aggression and it depends on the release of take can now the interesting thing is that in flies just in people and practically any other social animal that shows aggression sock all isolation increases aggressiveness putting a a a violent prisoner and solitary confinement is basely the worst most counter productive thing you could do to them and indeed we found in flies that social isolation increases the level of take kina in the brain and if we shut that get down it prevents the isolation from increasing aggression since my lab also works on mice it was natural to see whether take kinas might be unregulated and social isolation and whether they play a roll in aggression and this is work done by a former postocmorial zelicovski now at universe aspic city in stay and she found remarkably that when mice are socially isolated for two weeks there is this massive regulation of take kina to in their brain in back if you tag the peptide with a green florescent proline from a jelly fish genetically the brain looks green when the mice are socially isolated is there much of this stuff released and she went on to show that that increase intake kina is responsible for the effective social isolation to increase aggressiveness and t increase fear and to increase anxiety and effect there are drugs that block the receptor for take kina which were tested in humans and abandoned because they had no efficacy in the tests that they were a analyze for if you give those drugs to a socially isolated mouse it blocks all of the effects of social isolation it blocks the aggression it blocks the increased fear and the increased anxiety and that moral described at the mice just look chill its not a sedative which is really importance not that the mice going to sleep most remarkably is once you socially isolate a mouse and it becomes aggressive you can never put it back in its cage with its brothers from its litter because it will kill them all overnight but if you give it this drug which is called osanatan that black blocks takikinan too that mouse can be returned to the cage with its brothers and will not attack them and seems to be hap about that for the rest of the time this is an incredibly powerful affect of this drug and i been really interested trying to get farmasuiticl companies to test this drug which has a really good safety profile in humans investing it in people who are subjected to social isolation stress or be reverent stress and this is one of the areas were i learned and i opening lesson as a was sic scientists who naively thought that if you make a discovery and it has translational applications to humans that farmasical companies are going befalling all over themselves to try it and they are not interested because once burned twice shy these drugs were tested for efficacy in skits phrenic i have no idea why there is very little preclinical dated to suggests that not surprisingly they failed when a a when a drug fails and clinical trials and face three it cause hundred million dollars to the company that a that carried out that clinical trial there is a huge slag heap of discarded farmiseuticles many of them in hitters of narrow peptide action that a could be useful in other indication such as the one we discovered but there is a huge economic disincentive for farmiseutical companies to test them again because the conclusion that they drew from all these fail tests particularly in the two thousand tends and before that is that the reason they failed is because animal experiments with drugs do not predict how humans will respond to the drugs and therefore we should not try to extrapolate from any other data that we get from animal experiments malceraticperiments to humans because they lead us down the wrong tract and i think that that is probably wrong in some cases it may be right but in other cases there is good reason to think because these brain regions and molecules are evolutionarily conserved that they ought to be playing a similar role in humans in fact there is a a paper a a showing that in humans that have a a borderline personality disorder there is a strong corelation between their self reported level of aggressiveness and serum levels of attack kina in this case takikinin on as detected by radio immunoassay this is work of ego anal coward who a clinical pcychytris at the university of chico there is a smoking gun in the case of humans is well and a i was actually trying to interest of pharmaceutical company that was testing these drugs actually for treatment of hot flashes in females in humans where there is actually good animal data to think that it might be useful but i realize that this clinical trial was going on during the loved pandemic and i approachments ad look nature may have actually done for you the experiment that i want you to do was some of the people who are getting drug are p less sea region to have been socially isolated and some of them will have not why do not you get them to fill out questioner's and see whether the ones who were given the drug and socially isolated felt less street and less anxious than the ones who were not socially isolated and they would not touch it because there in the middle of a clinical trial for a different indication for this drug and they have to report any observation that they make about that drug in their patient population if they were to ask these questions and get an unfavorable answer oh my god i felt even worse when i took this drug and i was isolated they would they would be obliged to report that to the f d e and that could torpedo the chances for the drug being approved in the thing that it was in clinical trials for is better not to ask and not to know a and a than it is to try to find out more information that could lead to another clinical indication i remain convinced that this family of drugs could have very powerful uses in treating some forms of stress induced anxiety regressiveness in humans but it just very difficult for economic reasons to find a way to get somebody to test that yet a true shame that these companies will not do this and especially given the fact that many these drugs exist and their safety profile are established as that is always a serious a consideration when embarking on a clinical trial perhaps in hearing this discussion someone out there will understand the key importance of this and a will reach out to us will provide a ways to do that a to get such a study going in humans because i think of enough laboratories ran smallscale clinical trials farm certainly would prick up their ears right i there the om street g sometimes to their own i man i would just i would say also it'd to see this tested on pets i mean there is a huge number of pets right now that a suffering separation anxiety because humans bought them to keep them company during the covet end and otheother home alone eh and if this thing works in mice is certainly a higher chance its can a work in dogs or in cats than it is get a work in humans and if it did that would be even more encouragement to continue along those lines people sometimes forget that although we work on animals and we ultimately one understand humans we care about how our are results apply to the welfare of animals as well and particularly domestic pets which is a billion multimillion dollar industry in this country there ways it that they can be made to feel better when the separated from the a their owners that would certainly be a good thing absolutely we will put out the call we are putting out the call and i i know for sure there will be o response just under scoring what were been talking about even more every time we here about a school shooting li in taxes recently or i happen to be in new york trying the time when there was a subway shooting i for whatever reason i listen to the the book i about columbine that when into very detailed way about the origin of those boys and that that committed that and every single time there is the person who commits those acts is socially isolated as far as i know there might be some exceptions there and sometimes this crosses over with other mental health issues but sometimes no no apparent i mental healthishuse social social isolation clearly drives powerful negro chemical in neurobiological changes really hope that ism take kind in one and two those of the main one humans will be explored i in more data also i did not know that take kind in one is substance pean yes as he is take kindred that the tack kind on one is the we name and tack kin in two in humans is called negro kind an b that is the name of the proline i just referred to it by the we name was it makes it easier and i do not have to keep remembering two names for each thing and i if ism not mistaken you see or you you put yourself in the company of genetics because of your original training was in genaciminology and there is it was knell biology and i did not actually have formal training in genetics as a graduate student but i think ism a geneticist of heart that is just the way i to think about things and when i start o working on flies that sort of i came out of the closet as a genetics as were wonderful calls were talking about humans i love thy a your thoughts about human studies of emotion i know you wrote this book with rape are also you have this new book i which will provide a link to which have read front back twice it is phenomenal i mention it worupot gas its really there are books that are worth reading and then their books that are important and i think this book is truly important for the general population to read and understand and neuroscientist should read and understand the contents because we as a as a culture are way off in terms of how we think about emotions and states and behaviors well put a link to that it is really worth the time and energy to to read it i and it is written beautifully i should say very accessible even for non scientists there is a heap map diagram in that book that i think about a this is a heap map diagram of subjective reports that people gave of where they experience a an emotion or a feeling a somatic feeling in their body or in their head were both when they are angry sad calm lonely et camera et camera and i would not want people to think that those heap maps were generated by any physiological measurement because they were not and yet i do not think we can have a discussion about emotions and states and the sorts of behaviors that were talking out to day without thing about the body also and ism not coming to this as a northern californium mind body a been excellent once i did not go in the baths i went there i give a talk and i laughed it is very beautiful am if anyone wants to n what it looks i think that final scene of madmen is shot at sedan a the very beautiful place and yet mine body is a to me as a nerobiological construct because the nervous system extends through the out of the cranial vaulted into the final port and body and backhand forth of how shall we think about the body and in terms of states and at some point i of you to comment on that heat map experiment because it does seem that there some regularity as to were people experience emotions when people are in a rage for instance they seem to feel it both in their gut and in their head it seems on average and people love to extrapolate to got intuition and nor that the the chacmas or anger is in the stomach and a dingoes to eastern medicine et camera how shall we think about mine body in the contacts of states and think about it a scientists may be even as no scientists surgeon crisis good a for the answer the first question about the heat maps and people associating certain parts their body with certain emotional feelings a this goes back to a something called the somatic marker hypothesis that was propose by anionic demausio who is a neurologist that a use the the idea that are subjective feeling of a particular emotion is in part associated with a sensation of something happening in a particular part of our body the gut heart i do not see the liver invoked very much in in in emotional a characterization but a gal and the gall was somebody having a lot at go o noway i make a fist when i say that but have missing ta gall bladder shape a fist a and and if there is a physiology underlying these heat maps it could reflect increase blood flow to these different structures and that in turn reflects what you were talking about that is emotion is definitely involves communication between the brain and the body and its by directional communication and its mediated by the primeval nervous system the sympathetic and the parts sympathetic nervous system which control part rate for example blood vessel blood pressure a and those neurons receive in put from the hypothalamus and other blood a brain region central brain regions the control their activity and when the brain is put in a particular state it activates sympathetic and p our sympathetic servants which have effects on the heart and on blood pressure and these in turn feed back on to the brain through the sensory system and a large part of this bidirectional communication is also mediated through the vaguest nerve which a many of your a a listeners and viewers may have heard about because it become a topic intense activity now people of known for a long time the the vaguest nerve is a a bundle of nerve fires that comes out basically of your skull out of the central nervous system and then sends fires in to your heart your got all sorts of thiceral organs when you have us and that information is both used the words earlier in our discussion afferent and efferent the the vagal fires sense things that are happening in the body when your the reason you feel your stomach hide up in not if your tens is that those vagal fibers are sensing the contraction of the gut muscles and there also difference which means that information coming out of the brain can influent those peripheral organs as well and there is work from a number of labs just in the last six months or where people are starting to deep home the components of the different fires in the vaguest nerve and its amazing how much specificity is there are specific vagal nerves that go to the lung that control breathing responses that go to the got that go to other organs its almost a set of color voted lines a label lines for those things and now how those vagal difference clay roll in the playing out of emotion states is a fascinating question that people are just beginning to scrape the surface of but i think what is exciting now is that people are console developing tools that will allow us to turn on are turn off specific subsets of fires with in the vaguest nerve and ask how that affects particular emotional behaviors your absolutely right this brain body connection is critical noxious for the gut but for the heart for the lungs for all kinds of other a parts of your body and drawing recognize that as well and i think it is a it its a central feature of emotion state and i think what underlies are subjective feelings of an emotion credible avid i to say as a true paean of the work that your lab has been doing over many decades and am first while i was delighted when you stopped working onstemselves not cause you were not doing incredible work there but because i saw a talk where you showed a a move of octopus am spitting out ore not spitting but a sporting out a bunch of ink and escaping and you said you are gin to work on things of the sort they're talking about to day fear aggression making behaviors social behaviors a it is been incredible to see the work that your lab is done and i know i speak on behalf a vermin of i know i speak on behalf of a tremendous number of people wen i is a thank you for taking time out of your important schadual to share with us what you have learned my last question as is a simple one which is a will you come back and talk to us again in the future about the additional work that is sure to come i would be happy to do that and i really have appreciated your questions they're all they have all been right on the money you have hit all the critical important issues in this field and you have you have uncovered what is known the little bitt is known and how much is not known and i think it is important to emphasize the unknown things because that is what the next generation of nervous scientist has to solve and i hope this will help to attract young people into this field because it is important particularly for our understanding of mental illness and mental health and and an psychiatry we have got to figure out how emotion systems are controlled in a causal way a if we ever want to improve on the psychiatric treatments that we have now and mat'skon to require the next generation of people coming into the field absolutely i second that will thank you it is been a delight thank you great really appreciated thank you for joining me to day for my discussion with doctor avid andiron please also be sure to check out his new book the nature of the beast how emotions guide just it is a truly masterful exploration of the biology and psychology behind what we call emotions and states of mind and body if you are

welcome to the hubermansciencesciencepacetoi man druwhuberman and om a professor of neurobiology and theology at stamford school of medicine to day my guest is doctor peter area doctor at is a physician whose focus on nutritional supplementation base behavioral prescription drug and other interventions that promote healthspan and life span his expert stands from exercise physiology to sleep physiology emotional in mental health and pharmacology today we talk about all those areas of health starting with the very basic such as how to evaluate one's own health status and how to define one's health trajectory we also talk about the various sorts of interventions that one can take in order to promise vitality while also extending longevity that is life span doctor alas uniquely qualified to focus on the complete depth and breadth of topics that we cover and indeed these are the same topics that he works with his patients on in his clinic every day doctorate earned his bachelor science an mechanical engineering and applied mathematics and his eddy from stamped university school of medicine he then went on to train at john's bodkin's hospital in general surgery one of the premiere hospitals in the world where he was the recipient of several prestigious awards including resident of the year he is been an author on comprehensive views of general surgery he spent two years of the national institutes of health as a surgical oncology fellow at the national cancer institute where his work focused on a mu base therapies for melanoma in the fields of science and medicine it is well understood that we are much the product of our mentors and the entering we receive doctor at has trained with some of the best and most negative lipodologists under chronologist gynecologist sleep physiologists and longevity scientists in the united states and canada the experts that funnels through him and that he shares with us to day is really harness from the best of the best and his extensive training and expertise by the end of today's episode you will have answers to important basic question such as should you have blood work how often should you do blood work what specific things should you be looking for on that blood work that are either counter intuitive or not often discuss and yet that immediately and in the long term influence your lifespan and healthspan we talk about hormone health and hormontherapies for both men and women we talk about drug therapies that can influence the mind as well as the body and of course we talk about supplementation nutrition exercise and predictors of lifespan and healhspan it is an episode rich with information for some of you you may want to get out of pen an paper in order to take notes for others of you that learn better simply by listening just want to remind you that we have timestamped all this information that yo can go back to the specific topics most of interest to you before he begin i to emphasize that this podcast is separate from for teaching and research rolls at standard it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero ass to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is element element is an electrolyte drink with everything you need and nothing you do not that means plenty of salt magnesium and potassium the called electrolytes and no sugar ow salt magnesium and potassium are critical to the function of all the cells in your body in particular to the function of your nerve cells also called neurons in fact in order for your neurons to function properly all three electrolytes need to be present in the proper ratios and we now know that even slight reductions in electrolikhe concentrations or dehydration of the body can lead to dephisites in cognitive and physical performance element contains a science back tolectorolite ratio of one thousand milligrams that one graham of sodium two under milligrams of potassium and sixty milligrams of magnesium i typically drink element first thing in the morning when i wake up in order to hydrate my body and make sure i have enough electrolytes and while i do any kind of physical training and after physical training as well especially if have been sweating lot if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is elements doctor slash supermen to claim a free element sample pack with your purchase again that is drink element elements doctor slash supermen and now for my discussion with doctor peter area peter thanks for joining me to day thanks forhaveia then looking for r to this for a very long time am i huge fanning your podcast i know that you went to stamford and worked with the number of people that are colleagues of mind for me this is already a thrill just just bedding this likewise have a ton of questions but i want to start off with something i wonder a lot about and then i know many other people wonder about which is how to assess their current health and their trajectory in terms of health an well being specifically as it relates to blood work what your thoughts on bloodworm is it necessary for the typical person this is money who not dealing with somecute centrum or illness and at what age would you suggest people stare getting bloodworm how frequently should they get blood work how often do you get bloodworm done et camera you luck there n the warlock about this patience is first take n everything back to the objective what would it wits the which the what is the thing we are trying to optimize if if a person says look and ism trying to break ten hours for an iron man do not know that bloodworm is going to be a game changing aspect of their trajectory in their training another on o better benefit much more from our functional analyses of performance ism assuming base on the question that you are really coming at this through the lends of living longer and living better through the lifespan healthspan most lends y and just i think most people have some sense of their vitality or lack of vitality but i think everyone wonders whether not they could feel better and whether not bloodworm will give them a window into how they might g about feeling chatter ye i think it does to some extent but i also think the it has a lot of blind spots i can of break things down into the two vectors that make up longevity which a life span in health span life span is the easiest of those vectors to understand because it is it is it's pretty binary ut you are a liver you are not alive you are respiring or your not you may c to ere you do not and of story a what gets in the way of life span is essentially the four horsemen of disease right athroscorodic disease cancer narrodygener of disease and metabolic disease which directly is not the cause of many deaths but you do not be be basely crates the foundation to all of those other diseases am you know if you are a non smoker what i just rattle t office about eighty per cent of your death how does blood work help address those it varies on the athroscorodic standpoint it is a very good predictor of risk if what to look for a primarily ago b would be the single most important a like a proline that we care about i get explain what that means in a second and then also other markers of inflammation and ethereal health an metabolic health when it comes to cancer blood testing in the sense of bookmarkers is not particularly helpful outside of knowing that the second leading environmental or modifiable cause of cancer is metabolic ill health after smoking we do not actually know a lot about cancer in the sense of what cause is it it is it is really sarcastic and it is a lot of bad luck we know that smoking drives it and we know that even though epic don't epidimuologically we say of city drives it what really means is metabolic poor health it is probably the hyper in anemia that comes with o best that drives it big marker's help with that but there still an enormous blind spot to answer we could talk about liquid bosses side cause those are not really bookmarker studies but but that away on the your degenerf decide you i soft think we have a lot of insight that comes to understanding parkinsin's disease but when it comes to dimension particularly claimers disease which is the most prevalent form dementia i think the markers can be quite helpful they overlap a lot with the athroscorodic diseases the same things that drive the risk of hart disease are drawing drawing driving the risk of dimension and then there is some novel stuff as well if you include genetic testing which you can get out of a blood test we get a whole sweet of geans not just ago e but far more knew on stuff than that that can also place roll you can stratify risk in that sense in aggregate i would say you know blood testing o bookmarkers provides pretty good insight into life span when you get into health'spand you have kind of the cognitive physical emotional remains i think here the the bookmarkers are far less helpful and here we can have rely more on functional testing when it comes to sort of the cognitive piece you can do cognitive testing win terms of long term risk a to of the things that imply good cognitive health is you age i are in line with the same things that you would do to reduce the risk of dimension all the big markers that you would look to improve through dimes risk production you would be improving through cognitive heart on the physical side mean outside of looking at hormone levels and things which we look at extensively an understanding how those might ism aid in or prevent some of the metrics that matter it really is thesis a bi marker aside thing i mean it'd be much more interested in a person's debts a see pat testing i two attesting son to lactate testing autoxidation those what i concern more functional tests that give me far more insight into that and the of course the emotional piece which depending on you know who you are might be the single most important piece without which none of this other stuff matters or if your totally miserable human being your relationship suck o of my in this other stuff matters and certainly there is nothing that ism looking at in big markers that is giving me great inside into that do you ask about emotional state would you try to less a emotional state in directly when you down in take with one in you patience ism probably not much in the intake because i think it takes a while to former relationship with a patient before that starts to become something that they are necessarily can want a talk with you about but i definitely think of it as an important part of what we do and i think without it none this other stuff really matters again the irony of thinking about how many years i spend sort of pursuit of fully optimizing every detail of everything without any attention being paid to that dimension is not lost on me and and look there are some patience who they that is just not something that that is something that is compartmentalized maybe there other they are doing well on the department may be they are not but they just are not willing to engage on that yet jump of frequency o blood testing if somebody feels pretty good i and is taking a number of steps exercise nutrition et camera to try and extend life stand and improve hell spend i is once a year frequent enough i and should a twenty year old star getting blood work done just to get a window into what is going on assuming that they can afford anger their assurance can cover i meant look i i certainly think everybody should be screened early in life because if you look it what is the single most prevalent genetic driver of athrosgorosis is espy little ay unforsunly most physicians do not know what ell pe little i is and yet in a somewhere between eight and twelve percent of the population has a high enough and depending on who you ai had a recent guess on my podcast to suggest that it could be as high as twenty per cent have a high enough espy little that it is contributing to throw sorosis to not want to know that when it is genetically determined it this is something that you know you are you are born with this and you only need to really check at once why we would not want to know that in a twenty year old when it can contribute to a lot of the early athroscorosis we see in people you no just casino it is leaving money on the table in my inion the frequency with which you need to test really comes down to the state of interventions i i do not think it make sense to just do blood tests for the sake of doing blood tests there has to be kind of a reason is something changing i a blood test is for the most part static intervention it is it is it is a it is a look at a window in time and there is benefit in having a few of those over the course of a year if you are unsure about a level something comes back and it does not look great yet might make sense just to recheck it without reacting to it but typically you know impatience we might check blood two to four times a year but were so probably doing things in their to to now check hay you know we gave this drug did it have the desired outcome i you knowhow put on three pounds of muscle and lost three pounds of fact did it have the desired outcome i speaking of tracking weight and i fat mean mass per censes that something a you recommend your patients you pretty often i do not people at step on the scale every day and not people myself that i might step on the scale three times you are only care care i pay attention to other things at are far more subjective maybe i making a huge mistake what your thoughts about i quantitative measurements of wait a be am i a for the typical person i think they are pretty crude i i think a decks i it'd rather take a deck annually i and then maybe fall o weight a little bit more closely to get a sense of it and with a decks you are getting at least the way we look at the date a four pieces of information now most people when they do a deck a should i explain what that is i think some people i not know at decks is i in fact i confess i have crude understanding of what it is i my tell me of where ism wrong and i poppy were in part least partially right understanding is that there number different ways to measure lean mass to only mass ratio and the there is one where they put you under water there is one where they put you into some sort of non under water chamber there is callipering and then there is the looking in the mirror and am pinching in and now changing the lighting the e it is funny if you've if you have done it enough you can i can sort of tell my body fat by my abs right i can sort of tell by how good the six pack or how bad the six pack is what the leanness is and that is that is actually not a terrible away to do it the r be n a body builder for example which have never been can can tell you the difference between being six per cent seven per cent eight per cent ten per cent just based on the degree of visibility within within the abs m but basically a deck scan is an ex ray it is the same principle as you have just getting a chests ray where ionizing radiation is pass through the body and there is a plate behind the body that collects what comes through and they are the denser the medium that the black turns are trying to go through the less of them that are collected when you look it an ex ray s everybody's probably seen an next ray that which is white is most dense if you had n a piece of metal in your pocket it would show up as a bright white thing that is why ribs and bones show up as white and the things that are the least dense the lungs where it is just air are the blackest and everything is a shade of gray in between a deva is just doing that effectively but it is a moving ex ray you lay down on a bed and it takes may be ten minutes and this little very low power early count of goes over your body and the plate beneath it is is collecting information that is basically allowing it to differentiate between three things bone mineral content fat other and the other is quantified as lean body mass that is organs muscles everything else when most people do a dens of the the you to get the report back and the reports are horrible at have yet to see one company that can do this in a way that is not abjectly horrible we we have crated our own templates we have our own dashboard for how we do this as were just given up on trying to use theirs but the first thing mostpeople look at is whats my body fat and this is the gold standard outside of more or something that is only used for research purposes a deva is going to produce a far better estimate of a body fat than calipers or a buoyancy testing or things that provided the machinery is well calibrated and the operator knows how to use it a have heard some people argue that in the hands of the guy who is been doing calipers his whole life it can probably be comparable with calipers but nevertheless for an off the she ten decks amazing of the four things that get spit out of the deck o we think that the body fat is the least interesting and i would rank that is forth on the list of what is german to your health the other three things that you get spit out are bone mineral density visceral fat and then the metrics that allow you to compute a to subapically comps what is called appendicular lean mass index and fat free mass and debts and those three metrics are significantly more important than body fat and the reason is as fall is right bone mineral density basically speaks to your risk of osteal paresis a an ostiopenia and that does not sound very sexy to people our age fifty year old guides listening to this it is a big deal but for if fifty year old woman is a huge deal right a woman who is just about to go through menopause or has just gone through menopause is it an enormous risk for ostiopenia and and then ultimately osteal paresis because estrogen is the single most important hormone in regulating bone mineral density and we can come back and talk about why that is the case but it is it is very interesting how the how the big mechanics of of a bones work and why estrogen specifically is important and this is a huge cause of morbidity right you know with your over the age of sixty five and you fall and break your hip your one year morbidity is about thirty to forty per cent which you gan just put that in english you are sixty five or older you fall and break your hip there is a thirty to forty per cent chants your dead any your well bones matter we want to really get a sense of where you stack up for your age for your sex and if you are anywhere off the pace we have to ramp up our strategy and be superagressive about how to increase that or an minimum prevent any further decay and are there age relate charts for the sorts of things yet this is this all get spit out into what is called a rescore when you are looking at your the end it is going to give you a zeascourse was seashore of zero means ad you understand that is but it is it is re seashore referring to a probability distribution in a standard mode rescore of zero means you are the fiftieth per gentile for your age and sex as seashore of plus one you are oncetindedeviation above in us one below et camera u there is also a tea score which is doing the same thing but comparing you to a young person and the seashore is technically used to make the diagnose of ostopinaostic process we d we tend to look more at the seashore and basically say look if you are rescore right now as in us one in four years i want your zeascoret to be zero not necessarily because you have increased that entire way but maybe you've increase slightly wile it is expected that you would have declined i see what are some things that we can you to improve boneminerolthensity at any age it turns out there is a real critical window in which we are malleable depending on the age at which some one's listening to us discuss this if you are if you are under twenty twenty five you are still in that time of your life when you are able to reach your potential it turns out that strength training is probably the single best thing you can do and this was a surprise to me cause we we did in a m a on this topic a little while ago and that is when i got you a really deep on this with our analysts my assumption was a running must be the best some sort of impact must be the best thing you can do is you i assumed running would be better than swimming in circling but it turned out that power lifting was probably the best thing you call do an i think once you understand how bones work it became more clear which is you now power lifting is really putting more of a sheer force from the muscle we a the tenant on to the bone and that is what the bones are really sensing there sensing that sheer force its being alive through the bone in in compressive way depending on the bone of course and that is what is basically activating the osteal blasts which for the cells that are a allowing bone to be built it is this is this turns out to be probably more important for females because how i you can get during that period of development say till your twenty or twenty five basically sets your trajectory for the rest of your live were we get into real trouble is with patience who for example used large amounts of in hat in hailed steroids during that period o their life was that say they had really bad agma were patients who needed lards amounts of corticosteroids for some other retune related condition during their critical window of development they were taking a drug that was impairing this process you now we have some patients that in our practise and that is you love just an enormous liability that were working really hard to overcome you now with nutrition with hormones with drugs with training i and you know it is you know just something you have to be aware of i was not aware that i yoinhalments a for shmo an thinks that sort can impair on several density ow there stairroid base s some of them of course are just bath agonists and their fine anything cortical stern why using and then always get ask this question and an i always reflectively want to say no what i don't really know the answers i do not reply hat about topical am corticastero you own people put sort his own cream to me it seems almost in conceivable that the haves osteal effect but then again when i now it is all it is all dose and it is all those and in time related you no if you are talking about have got a little rash under my skin omen to put corticastarits on probably not i but but certainly with enough of it put on a men it is absorbed i it could be in issue but that is not typically what we are concerned with hem an we are mostly concerned with people that a taking even modest amounts of cretin is own for months years at a time ism more i said kids that are using steroid in sailors for years and years and years can ism not suggesting that if your kids on asteroid an sailor they should not be you have to solve the most important problem in if asmaasthe most point promise be think you just want a turn that into key well how much more imperative is it that our kid is doing things that are putting a high amount of stress on their bones and the other muscles to make sure that there in that maximal capacity to build you think that somebody in there thirties or forte's or fifties could still benefit from strain training in terms of bone mineral density in longevity i as a relates to bonemeal density i given that there is this see window earlier r they might have miss that oh ye no this is essential for the rest of life because you are now trying to prevent the fall off basely the way at works is you your sort of from from birth to say twenty year on you are in growth from twenty to fifty you plateau at fifty men start to decline but it is really small women start to decline in its precipitous it is related to the drop an estrin jester with mananas orpremanopaus and and can we get into any of the broad a contours of of what that strait training looks we had are not doctor any galloping on the show talked a lot about ways to build strain for as i pertofevers endurance et camera think there is pretty good agreement cross the fields of use therapy et camera o physiology in an medicine terms of how to do that a manerstending is fairly low re petition ranges that s anywhere from one to six repetitions typical not sing for a pompipertrophy that sort of thing but heavy loads that are hard to move i eighty per cent of one repetition maximum or more done with long rest periods i the re good you three times o we tight things that about raise you if you look at the literature on this it is gin o tell you it is get a differentiate power lifting from weight lifting in other words yet you do need to be kind of moving against a very heavy load now again that can look very different depending on your level of experience i really dead lifting now i mean i can count the number of days left in my life when ism going to want o you says over four hundred pounds but it'll pick an choose the days that i do but but i grew up doing those things ism comfortable with those movements if i had a sixty year old women whose never lifted weights in her life who we now have to get lifting i mean we could get her to dead lift but think i would not make perfect the enemy of good it'd be happy to put her on a leg press machine and just get her doing that i you know it is not as pure a movement as a dead life but who cares right we can still put her at a heavy load for her and do safely i now that sad i mean there is a study it was done in australia i hope we we can find you ninth to it it is there is a video on you to that actually kind of has the p eye fort of walking through the result i can send it to you ye and it is it is just amazing yet they took a group of you know older women they look there in their sixties or seventies who had never lifted weights in their life who had ostiopenia and some probably already had oasis paresis and they make we just put them on a strength training photo call and it is remarkable to watch these women they're doing good mornings there do wing dead lefts there picking heavy things up off the ground in think one woman was picking up i want to say she was picking fifty sixty fellows up off the ground mean just staggering sums of weight for these womenwho have never done anything and their bone health is improving at this age i the goal frankly is to just never get to the point where you have to do this for the first time strength training is such an essential part of our existence that i there is count it is never too late to start but you should never stop of that advice is it a atomic office or a local effect for instance i let us say that well my mother's in her late seventies i she she is to be really strong when were get she could move this fish tank that was in my room long before i could move it and mum she is really strong over the years i i would i would not call her frail by any means but i certainly think she could benefit from some strength training let us say she were o start doing some leg presses or start even with air squads and may be work up to some pushups the effect's all local meaning if she were to just train her legs or just do push ours i would only be the loads applied to the limbs and muscles in wishes the we have long that is where the bulk of it is yeohyes you need to train the whole body essentially ye now keep in mind the diagnosis of ostopaenia and coste paresis is based on only three locations the left hippie the right hip in the lumbar spine ism that is just the convention by which we make the diagnosis and and i think part of it has to do with that is where the majority he insults occur now not all of the insults have seen people that of because of horrible bone densityeither the you other fracturing ankles and tibia fibula there having low tie fib fractures just walking ism clearly bone dens the outside of those regions does matter but much of it is really focused on and by the way fall you break a wrist this is a systemic issue ism but the majority of the response is a local response cause it really comes down to putting a low directly on that bone and then having that bone in kind respond i laying down more bone it'd to take a quick break and acknowledge one of our sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called g one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that covers all of your foundational nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve am delighted that their sponsoring the podcast treason i stay taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once are usually twice a day is that it gets to me the probiatics that i need for got health i got is very important at populated by got microbioda that communicate with the brain the man system and basically all the biological systems of our body to strongly impact our immediate and long turn health and those probation unathletic greens are optimal and vital for macrobiotic health in addition athletic greens contains a number of adaptions vitamins and minerals that make sure that all my foundational nutritional needs are met and it taste gripe if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock calm slash supermen and they will give you five free travel packs that make it really easy to mix up athletic greens while you are on the road in the car on the plain et camera and they will give you a year supply of vitamin d the k too again that is athletic greensdock calm slash supermen to get the five free travel packs and the years supply o item and three k to you mention falling and the problems with falling and breaking things and mortality related to that i wonder whether not there are also am health related effects have just having week bones that are not just about falling and breaking a bone and dying a year later even that that is obviously very severe ism because i think what we will here about that some you might think well eat just be more careful tears me more slowly it'll sit in a wheel chair if i need to if a even though i might be able walk thaws befalling some people think adopt that mentality wonder some of the benefits of having i hi bone mineral density for men and women that are perhaps independent of risk of injury y think it is actually the inverse of what you just said right it is sort of you have the sort of be able to articulate what it is you want in your marginal decade we we use this thing in our practice called the marginal decade marginal decay is last decade of your life every one will have a marginal decade that is the only thing i can tell you with absolute certainty i i believe you there is no mentality there is no hid in the sir that is going to help us live to be whatever i mean we are all going to be in our last decade at some point ism an outside of people who die suddenly your through an accident ism most of us know when we are n that marginal decade you might not know the day you enter it but most people who are old enough if you tell them are you in the last decade of your life they probably have a sense that they are i think the exercise that we to go through with our patients very early on is have them in exquisite detail more detail than they have ever considered we have to prompt them with fifty questions ism lay out what their marginal decade should look well that is a serious exercises a very serious exercise right what tell me everything that is going to happen in your marginal decade i do not now what it is going to be under it could be eighty seven to ninety seven if we are doing well right it might be seventy nine to eighty i i do not know but i we would really be in a very new once exploration of that topic and i think until you do that all this other stuff is just abstract and kind of nonsense you know until a person can tell you what it is that they want to be doing in that last decade you cannot design a program to get them there i meant think about it you some one wants to do an iron man we take it for granted that we know what the objective is i have to be able to swim two an a half miles it we able to get out take my wet suit off hop on my bike ride a hundred and twelve miles get off my bike take the bike shoots off put the run show on run twenty spent two miles we get it we know what the objective is and only by knowing that can you train can you imagine if i said to you and ism going to have you do an athletic event in a year start training i might not tell you what it is just do it could be playing basket ball you know it could be swimming to cattalina island it could be running a hundred miles you wouldn't measly do it similarly if we do not know what our marginal decade is meant to be there is no way to train for it you think this is a good exercise for anyone an everyone did you on their own regardless an age here ism hearing is ani thinking i mean to think about when my last decade might be in what i want that to look lie absolutely i man when i say we do with our patients that is only because that's the population it work with but there is simply no reason everybody should not be going through this exercise and then you you's sort of baxscript from there you grout what we i show you wing et in our current hellcat its exactly what we call it backdating the first step we do is once we have really delineated what the objective function looks we then say one how do you break down that into a metrics that we can measure youknow you describe doing a whole bunch of things rant just to let to do that we will require a vet two macs of thirty silly leaders of oxygen permit per kilogram the personal say okay what does that me we will say well that is a measure of your maximal uptake of oxygen and that declines at about eight per cent to ten per cent perdecade if you have to be at thirty unless yous assume you arguing to be doing that at ninety what do you need to be at eighty seventy sixty fit you hearts what it would need to be at fifty oke what are you now ah there is a big gap you are below where you need to be nu you are obviously higher than thirty now but if you are only at forty two now and you need to be at thirty and forty years i cant cut it you have to be a lot fitter e now's do the same exercise around strength and stability and without exception most people when they do this exercise will find out they are well below where they need to be the gravity of aging is more vicious than people realize and therefore the height of your glider needs to be much higher than you think it is when you are our age if you want a pebble to do the things we probably when bell to do when we are ninety i absolutely love for this approach have never done it in terms of my health have always thought about what i want a accomplish in the next three to six months or next year or and by thewy that is a great approach that is forecasting forecasting is fantastic forecasting is really good at short term things it does not work for long term things long tern you have to do backdating this backcastig approach really appeals to me because in my career i never anticipate see me i never intospade i be podcasting i but that is what i did at some point as an undergraduate i look professors that looks a pretty good life they seem pretty happy i talk to few of them and the i figured out what i need to do at each stage in order to get to that next wrung on the later in just con figured it out in in a backdating kind of way as you refer to it a i thing is incredibly useful because it puts all the questions about blood work and how often hey get blood work and what to measure in in a really nice contact has highly individualized have never heard of this before or i and i should given nod to any duke i used to always refer to this is reverse engineering but in any duke's books you wrote about this exact thing and called it backdating in i was i to tern backdating better i think it more intuitive an reverse engineer yet there is a real genius to it and i think it cause i set many things into the appropriate been in trajectories have heard you talk before about some of the prime movers for longevity and allows mortality a and it'd love for you to review a little bit of that for us am think we all know that we should not smoke because it is very likely that i earlier if we smoke nicotine ism neither a maroanta nor a nicotine smoker si you will on stable ground there abut ant ti we see smoking nowadays people want really wanted distinguish between cannabis and nicotine ism i am curious about any difference is there interns of ism impact on longevity but in that context what are the things that any o n an every one can do should do to to live longer he finally how long you go well you tell me you tell me i lied to live to be it'd my final decade to be between ninety and a hundred onoaand will we spend from now until you are ninety i abs el there is a risk of that but ism top contrary's fine and you have done a lot of conte in this and w we will give people length to some of that morning kept content but the get see was non a short flight from here to san dingo were loss argues now a and we got take off in landing and we do not want a pink our back too much by doing this thing i u said hey you know give me that the extended version of the three by five card what is that look line i let us start with a couple of things that you have already filar it is o smoking how much to smoking increase your risk of all cause mortality and and the reason we to talk about what miscalled a c me all cause mortality is it is really agnostic to how you die and that does not always make sens o m if you are talking about as a very specific intervention a anti cancer therapute at you really care about cancer specific mortality or heartspecific mortality but when we talk about these sort of broad things we to talk about a c m using smoking smoking is a proximately a forty per cent increase in the risk of a c m what dis that translate to you an a that means ism ism shortening my life by forty percent it means at any point in time there is a forty per cent great greater risk that you are gin a die relative to a non smoker and however smoker that what is important to distinct does not mean your life span is giving to forty per cent lass it means at any point in time standing there your risk of death is forty per cent higher ism and by thewy that will catch up with you right at some point that that catches up i high blood pressure is about a twenty to twenty five per cent increase in all cause mortality ism you take something really extreme onstage kidney disease these are patients that are on dialysis waiting for an organ and get there is a confounder there because there is what is the underlying condition that leads you to that it is you a profound hight pretension significant type to diabetes that been uncontrolled that is enormous that is abut a hundred and seventy five per cent increase in a c m the hazard radios like two point seven five ism type too diabetes is proving about a one point to five as well twenty five per cent increase now the question is how o you improve what are the things that improve tho now here we do this by comparing low to high achievers and other metrics if you look at low muscle mass per is high muscle mass what is the improve men and it is pretty significance about three acts if you compare low muscle mass people to high muscle mass people as the age the low muscle mass people have about a three x hazardratia were two hundred per cent increase in all cause mortality now if you look at the date a more carefully you realize that it is probably less the muscle mass fully doing that in it is more the high association with strength and when you start to teas out strength you can realize that strength can be probably three and a half ax as a hazard ratio meaning about two hundred and fifty per cent greater risk if you have low strength to high strength my strength is yo ability to move loads at ad and i do in i won i it it is all to find by given studies some the most common things that are used are actually they are used for the purposes of experiments that make it easy to do o don't think they are the best metrics they are usually using grip strength i leg extensions and wallets squats things that how long can you sit in a squatted position at ninety degrees without support would be a great demonstration of quad strength a leg extension am you know how much weight can you hold for how long relative to bodywaight things that a we we have a whole strength programmed that we do with our patients we have something all the pessimal ifs ta strength metrics of assessment and we put them through a even tests that ism are really difficult you would a dead hang is one of how long can you dead hang your bodywigh of that we are turn i be more granular in that insight but tie it back to these principles if you look at carry respiratory fitness it is even more perfaund ism if you look at people who were in the bottom twenty five per cent for their age and sex and terms of via to man and you compare them to the people that re just at the fiftieth to seventy fifth per gentile i you are talking about a two a difference roughly in ism in in the risk of as am if you compare the bottom twenty five per went to the top two point five per cent you are talking about bottom quarter to the elect for given age i you are talking about five as we four hundred per cent difference in all cause mortality that is what be the single strongest association i eve seen for any modifiable behavior credible i when you say leaves are a people that are running marathons at a pretty rapid clip not necessarily its just what the via two man is for that my view two mass would be in the elect for my age group my view two mass you now's but a again it is ism be training very deliberately to make sure that it is in that i would not consider myself to let at anything any more but i still maintain a you two mass that is a let for my age a can to you in a we physician and and guy all around but true am but in terms of it for the point is you do not have to be a world class athlete to be a your ya got it am may we talk a fit about the specific surround the training to get into that a top to tiers there because it seems that those are enormous positive effects of party o scuba exercise a far greater than the sorts of numbers that i see around that is just say supplement a solve tan a and that this is my whole petpeevean life for i did i just cannot get enough of the fascinating and arguing about this supplement versus that supplement and i feel you should not be having those arguments until you have your exercise house in order am you should not be arguing about your this new once if your carnivore dietverses this new one of your pale diverse this new one of your vague an diet until you can deadly your body weight for ten raps then then you can come and talk about the things are simply lets is a wits om metrics i until your view two man is at least of the seventy fifth per gentile and you are able to dead hang for at least a minute under able to wall sit for at least two we could rattle off a bunch of relatively low hanging fruit i wish there was a rule that sett you could not talk abut anything else health related e we can make that run no on listening to it i do not know about that we can make whatever us we want we can call at teas rule at one they have done before in this pod casting on social needy as just barring from the tradition in science which is it is in appropriate to name something after yourself unlessyou were a scientists before nineteen fifty am but it is told a proper to name things after other people's omen a call it a teas rule until you can do the following things am do not talk please refrain from talking about supplements and nutrition ernes hereafter thought of referred to and reference as a was rule i join the phrase not him we there is know ye go involved but to us now a tea's rule watch out hashing a he's rule goat am wiccapedia entered a teas rule in all seriousness and i am serious about that a dead hang for about a minute seems a a really good goal for a lot of people at least tens a that is our goal i think we have a minute and a half is the goal for a forty year old woman two minutes as the goal for forty year old man we adjust them up and down based on a age and gender great and then a the walls what is what ares some nnoeaso walls we do as as just a straight squat air squat at ninety degrees a and i believe two minutes as the standard for both men and women at forty great and then a because for some people think interns of you two maxes will more complicated they might out have embassy equipment or to measured et camera am what we talk about thing bonkers of party of askers a run a mile at at seven minutes or last eight minute la o question there are via to there a really good via to man estimators on line and you can plug in your activity figure up be at a bike run or rowing machine and it can give you a sense of of that and i i do not i used to know all of those but now that i just actually do the testing i do not recall them but it is exactly that line of thinking can you run a mile in this time if you can your view two man as a proximally this great n i think somewhere in my podcast round have got all those chart charts posted of this is by age by says this is what the via two maxes in each of those buckets trip it will provide line to those who will have our people find those links and then am you mention dead letting body weight ten time i just made that one out i not that is not one that we include but but something something that i we used we use farmer carries we will say for a mail you should be able to farmer carry your body weight for i think we have two minutes or that is half your body weight in each hand i you bible to walk with that for for two minutes i for women i think we are doing seventy five per cent a body wait or something that you great i love it am as in direct measures of how healthy and yah yarn how long weka it is basically grip strength it is mobility i mean again walking with that much weight for for some people initially is really hard youknow we use different things vertical jump ground contact time if your jumping off a box things that it is it is really trying to capture and it is it is an evolution right i think the the test is going to get only more and more involved as we as weep as we gout evolved cause it took us about a year beth louis did the majority of the work to develop this i beth runs our strength and stability program in the practice and near bask i just pastor with liege got the literature and come up with all of the best movements that we think our proxies for what you need to be the most kick ask you now what we call centenary into catholic which is the person living in the marginal decade of the best well what ism about say is certainly at a mechanistic leap but if look at the literature on exercise or lad her of genesis in my am or brainatrophy or brain a hypertrophy et camera am animal models it is very clear that the best way to get a nervous system to atrophy to lose neon shrink anurans and or lose connections between furans is to stop that animal from moving or to d an riches environment dedeprivate of some sensory and put or multiple sensory and put's in the best way to enhance am the size of means the umber of connections betel organs and made even the number of means is to en riches environment and getting moving while en ricing that environment under i think it is it is very difficult for me to say the same as not true in humans and and the first time this became clear to me was in two thousand fourteen i i had an analyst and palikar and i said can in to give you a project it is vexing me to know and which is i i want you to look at all of the literature that we have both mechanistic and clinical trial data that talks about all timer's prevention and i want to know every single type of in put and i want to have a a clear sense of we o what mechanism does it offer what mode of protection and it took can n this was i beset we we iterated a lot on this together i and he came back with can of en amazing presentation that took am in nine months to a year of work and what amazed me was when he came back to it he said these single greatest efficacy we can point to his exercise and law's danio is i to be nonsense do there is no way exercise is the single best thing you can do for the brain there has to be some drug you have miss there has to be some other thing that you have missed and he is now the is is hands down the best thing cause you are it is not just what its doing to b d and act that is not just what it is doing to vascular an dithealium it is not just what is doing to glucose disposal in seen signing ally sings it is just touching every aspect of the brain and is very skeptical for about six months can one really pushed on him and i was think you are missing something down i think your missing something and then finally in the end looped in richer sacs and who is an neurologist that we work with really closely on all timer's prevention and you know ultimately turned into a paper that we wrote basically o you know about this abut this this topic and n a few others use again i thought are you sure it is not e p and d oh that is got to have a bigger impact and am again there lot of things that i think do matter and there is a whole host of things that we do for all timer's prevention but i think you are say right there is not one thing that it'll tell patients is more important than exercising and by the way it is not the sort of pathetic recommendations that are made like it is you have to exercise a lot more if you want to get this maxima benefit you will you will get the maximum benefit comes going from nothing to something if you go from being completely sedentary to doing fifteen met hours per week you will get probably of fifty per cent reduction and risk a met hour a met just for people who do not know is a metabolic equivalent is were were exerting about one point three gets sitting here talking if we were sitting here being quieter be about one mat ism walking really briskly would be about five gets fifteen met hours per week would be three one hour really brisk walk that is not a lot of work but just going from doing nothing to doing that would give you fifty per cent of the benefit that you would get from going all the way now i again i think ism personally a little skeptical of how much that is i think it is probe a bit less than that i think there is more upside than people appreciate but the studies i do not think an can truly capture that but look there is there is no reason to not be exercising more than that and and capture more benefit even though the rate at which you r true it is last and it also speaks to the healthspanside of this which is not necessarily captured in those data the healthsman get's back to the functional piece we opened with which is what you want to be doing in your marginal decade you won't able to pick up a great grand kid if they come running at you you are able to get up off the floor down be we play on the floor with a kid and then get up on your own and have not notheople r thinking final a years of life there rising you how can they a take themselves to the bath room there thing how they sit up off the toilet thenyou mean a really was vegetative time functions right am at some level i love this again this idea of marginal decade in using that as a way you backlash you i a to actual methods and behaviors and om orator calls at once you be doing on a daily basis a it'll use animal data as it is now called am locate just i know three nabob prize winners which does not mean anything except that they did beautiful work but the point is that they are all in their nineties i i it'll name them case and complimenting them for what they have done not just their work but when ism about to describes the tricking dell at colombia noble prize wont for work o memory torentsim seas of work on narrow plasticity and then a richer axe who is also at colombia no a prize when he work for molecobology of smelling and ism lecabiology generally all three of them still alive chard's younger compared to the other too all three of them either swim jog or play tennis were racketball i think is chard's thing multibal times per we arc was they are all cognitively still extremely sharp still interested in the arts doing science curious about science running laboratories writing books going on focus and it is is incredible again that is anecdota but i was ad a surprise to learn that colleagues that were intellectually strong were also obsessed with exercise am that they really are obsessed with their exercise routine and er early on linked that to they are i some of their intellectual vigor over time i wont wanted just aloes as a jumping out when to ask about one kind of niche thing but it comes up ism don't my am an out which one of those told me this but one of those three individuals ism choose an excessive amount of nicorat used to be a smoker and i asked him why and he said because in his estimation it is protective against parkinsons and alshimers or at least the niccotennec a seat of calling augmentation of nicotine was nicotine as she cling receptor obviously ism is known to create a state of focus and and curl enhancement what are your thoughts about not smoking let us to say en you really clear people do not smoke nicotine tape nicotine is con shorten your live just terrible idea addictive et camera in my opinion but what a your thoughts about augmenting a septal calling through the use of nicotine in order to keep the brain healthy and focus again this is one noble prize winner does not truly end of one but he is convinced that this matches up with the mechanistic data on a seat of calling and cognition that i lovely t your thoughts on it i cannot speak to the a d prevention component of it it'd have to run that by comply my colleagues who i collaborate with him that but i can definitely speak to the cognitive and handyman piece of it and lecture did in am on this i probe a year ago where i went into all of the gory details of it and talked about my own use of of nicotine which it'll cycle on and off have been doing for last ten years haven't what forme d you take it in hi used to use the gum i do not the gum any more now i these little laws angel i that no i a funny story about the our mutual acquaintance avid sin care mention the copy company to me a year ago he is i a have you heard this company and i forget the name of the company but he gave me some name i go on line and it is this company selling nicotine i m i wonder why he is asked me to do this well ill all dish order a bunch and then we will figure it why cause we were there was some reason we were doing this potential through investment i get up literally order a lifetime supply of this stuff and it is pretty good is actually it is a rally nice little patch cause i the thing i did not about the gum was i hated just the the the taste of it am then the next we om talking a day ban i by the way i ordered all that nicotine stuff you told me about house what an he got oh the company's name was something else li ism ism the short answer is i think the stuff is absolutely a concentration a enhancing substance am it is addictive and people need to be weary of that not'snot addictive everybody i personally experience no am addiction to it what soever i can i could do it every day for thirty days and stop and experience know withdrawal i could forget about and it does not really seem to matter ism you have to be careful with the dose truthfully i mean remember one cigarette as about one telegram of nicotine and a lot of these laws hinges we will plot four to hate milligrams intoyou in one shot and for someone who is naive to that i am four milligrams is a lot of nicotine in one bowlers just have to be very mindful of it ism i got a lot of flack when i did this a ma for obvious reasons but people were how can you as a doctor encourage people to use nicotine and i was first while not encouraging anybody to use it i just one o beagle to talk about the big chemistry of it ism and if disclosing that i use it from time to time is is an endorsement than i apologize for that ism but on the list of things that you can do to make your brain a little more focused i would consider that infinitely safer than what a lot of people are doing which is using stimulants mean to me i i you do not i just tell patients outright we are under no circumstance prescribing stimulants i resting i were just were not giving anybody at er all not giving anybody five ants or any of these things ism not to say they do not have an appropriate clinical use but they should be prescribed under the care of somebody who really monitoring the use case for it and causing that as a tool to enhance concentration in coat performs is not something were comfortable doing yet it is rampant on college campus an us i can only ism armadapina madapina which are slightly infinite course but i s a non clinical us not prescribed for eighty eight but just it is rampant recreational use study based use dad have seen on maharani suggest that it only really provides in inotropic benefit in some one who is deprived i sleep is there data that in a totally well rested person there is a inotropic benefit of madapina i do not know i have one experience with armadapina where i took a half a recommended costs was prescribed by a doctor ism went to give a talk this is in why and a four hours into the talk at my cost speaker came up to me and just said while first while you yellow tit of a spit in the corning your mouth and said whileyou haven't linked in three minutes and third a here's only two people left in the audience i was layered in that i a forgot the contact aomaloo it of a and of a tonal vision o c d type anyway but one that was all at tuck i never i never took any more of it it was a powerful stimulant i take a three hundred telegrams of alpha pa now and again before some cognac of work sometimes before work out and i do subjectively feel that narrows my focus in it in a nice way a but i do not take it more than once or twice a day and more than once or twice a week is an example of were you know we are talking about exercise verses cart a nutrition and supplements for longevity i think there may be a whole bunch of things that are find of interesting around focus but nothing would compare t a changing our environment i think that if i compare my focus to day to my focus when i was in college there is no comparison in college i was truly a robot but i think a large part of it was there is no distraction there is no male there is no social media there is no inner net i mean i was in college when mosaic launched in the early nineties i in n had to walk a mile to get to the computer lab on a big sung work station to do anything in some computer cot language you mean you are sitting in your room studying there was no distraction and i think that is a far greater component of what it means to be focus than the challenge we have to day my thoughts on this would be if we really wanted to return to a state of focus were in a half to individually do something about you are environment dandy do not matter nor what the answer is have tried every little trick i can think of closing my browsers when ism writing an staff but you know just not strong enough well all pick up my phone every twenty minutes to look and see if i miss the text message or something stupid that is pretty infrequent i did a episode on habits and looking at the data a it seems that a people are getting interrupted or interrupting themselves about once every three minutes in the typical work place now that typical as changed with lotmore people working at home i do put my phone away when i trying work that nothing focuses me a dead line you bit of a fear based urgency as that that is it grand dead lines yet drop deadlines as i call them or podcast work in a record to day that nothing works quite it but such as lie a what thanks for that a office about nicotine a again you are not recommending it ism not recommending it but it is clear that the that augmenting the asexual calling system which is what nicotine does in its various forms and some related type form a college dozen hands focus and pretty potently i think its tome an interesting area for real clinical traces nothing of that sort love a chat about ut hormone therapies and hormones generally a when robot supposed came on the pod cast we talk to littlest about menopause in the date around menopause very interested in these findings that i thing going to get this right that whether or not women benefit from estrogen therapy to offset menaces really depends on when that therapy is initiated ism not your aware of those data but ut he claimed that if they begin estrogen therapy in the middle to tale end of menaces the outcomes can be i quite bad whereas if they initiate those estrogen therapies as they enter menaces or even before menopause can the outcomes can be quite good i do not know what percentage of the patients you treat our male viruses female and what ages those patients are of course but ism what are your thoughts about estrogen therapy for women menopause and ism hormontherapies generally for women maybeven tostostron therapy yo here about that here days and ten we'll talk about men our practice is probably seventy thirty male female we have lots of women and this is a very important topic i it is also probable me think a on to make sure om not being hyperbolic when i say this i do not think i am it is hands down the biggest screw up of the entire medical field in the last twenty five years o again it is possible the next hour it'll think of no there is a bigger screw up but another another giants yet but but i do not think i will ism pretty confident that i will not be able to think of a bigger act of in competence then what happened with the woman's health initiative in the late nineties in early two thousands which is effectively the study that turned the entire medical field off hormones placemen therapy for women it is important i think to explain what the study looked at this was a study it was conducted in response to the widely he belie in the seventies and eddies that women should be placed on hormones as there a going through menaces right menopause is i guess may be it'll even take a step back i do not know amateur audience is familiar with how estrogen progesterone work is it worth going into that girly worth mentioning a bit of the top contour some of them might be familiar with it we done piss on estrogen tostoctro but frankly s i think back to those we an't really go into the biology of estrogen testosterone enough yes i mean actually an interesting aside that i always tell my female patients to get a kick out of this i when you look at a woman's labs you will see her estrogen her protestor on her eyes age her all age her testosterone for sexmore dining glob an all these things but based on the units their reported in it is a very distorting picture of what the most common androgen is in her body if you actually convert them to the same units she has much more testosterone an her body than estrogen interesting ye i did not know that then again have never been a woman getting my hormone prophalga yes even though a woman's testosterone is much less than a men a than than a man's level a it is still more than she has estrogen in her body phenotypically right estrogen is the hormone that is dominating and ten it is the in she has much higher estrogen than a man and much lower testosterone than a man but in absolute amounts she has more testosterone than estrogen just worth pointing to a what what is happening to a woman from the we she starts menstruating till she goes through manias outside of pregnancy and birth control an stuff that is she has this cycle in a roughly every twenty eight days but it can vary where at the beginning of her period we call that day zero her basic her estrogen and progesterone are very low you cannot measure them and then what happens is the estrogen level starts to rise and it rises in response to a hormone called physical stimulating hormone pholicalston eating hormone emanate that is getting her ready to ovulate and she ovulates it about the mid point of her cycle for just can o make the math easy on day fourteen she is going to release apholical from one of her ovaries and the estrogen level is or rising rising rising we love to measure hormones on dative because i will not t have a standardize way in which i measure her hormones our women know if we are in the business of trying to understand her hormones the day her period starts even if it is just a day of spotting that becomes our bench mark and then dative i want to see every hormone on that day and if everything is going well i know what her effs h l h estrodyle and progesterone should be on that day the estrogen rises starts to come down a little bit as she ovulates and then the utilizing hormone kicks on because it is now going to prepare her a uterus for the lining to accommodate a pregnancy now you start to see estrodyle go back but now for the first time progesterone goes up progesterone has been doing nothing for fourteen days and now it starts to rise and actually progesterone is the hormone that is dominating the second half which called her piphilic a preludial cycle the first fourteen days of the follicular cycle second as the ludo local cycle once you get to about the half way point of that which is now just to do the math twenty one days in the body has figured out if she is pregnant or not and again most of the time she is not going to be pregnant the body says oh i do not need this lining that have been preparing ism going to shed it now progesterone and estrogen start crashing and the lining is what is being shed and that is the mercies by the way it is that last seven days of that cycle that in a susceptible woman is what creates those me symptoms it is the she the is something you would probably have a better understanding of than me there is something about this in a susceptible woman where the enormous reduction of progesterone quickly is probably impacting something in her brain this is this is a legitimate thing right join it is not oh she is crazy because she is having always me symptoms know we know that that is the case because if you put women on progesterone for those seven days those symptoms go away f you can stabilize their progesterone during the last half of there audial phase and sometimes we would just do it for the entire audial phase just put them on a low dose of progesterone all mama symptoms vanish very interesting it'll have to look up where the protester on receptors are locate in the brain the allow a raininstitute now as beautiful data inteatou fabrication which r s the donates a look at a ana and a weregenes and a proteins ought to be expressed in the human brain by using shall human braingticusactions as plusagas myself take a look i think it a hemin lain bikers not what that a protester own emotionality link might be in where where it might exist normal circuit was then when the estrogen and progesterone reach their faitor again that starts the cycle that just that cycles happening over and over and over again cate it became well known in the fifties that woman's going stop menstruating at some point her estrogen goes down why soft we just give her estrogen cause that is clearly going to help with some of the symptoms of mananas what what the women experience when thy go through mananas the first symptoms are what are called vasa motor symptoms this is usually in the form of a nightsweats hot flashes and depending on the women this can be really significant right these are women who can have a hard time sleeping they can be having hot flashes during the middle the day they can wake up soaked in a pool of sweat a those ten to pass after a couple of years and then they get into sort of the more long term complications of mananas we call vaginal atrophy vaginal dryness and then the stuff that we talked about a while ago which is the a ostiopenia osteoporosis a a lot of women will comet complain of brain fog a i mean clearly this was an issue and it was recognize seventy years ago why do not we give women estrogen back to replace that hormone and that went on for he couple of decades may be let may be a decade and then it was realized way t a minute we were driving up the risk of veteran cancer a and the reason for that is if you just give estrogen with no progesterone to antagonize it you will thicken the endometrium endlessly and you will increase the risk of hyperplasia well you will you will definably undergo hyperplasia and then ultimately dysplasia displeased is precancerous and ultimately a we were seen that people figured out well actually if you want to give estrogen to a woman who still master uterus you have to give her progesterone as well you have to be able to have a hormone to oppose the estrogen and then that became effectively in the nineteen call at the nineteen seventies is the standard for a for eh a the in the early nineteen nineties a the and i h said lock we have not really study this we have a ton of epidemiaholi g that says giving women hormones seems to be doing really good things they feel better there all their symptoms go away they seem to have lower risk of heart disease lower risk of a cardiovascular perm loweriscof herracities lower risk of a bone fractures a everything seems to get tater lawrisk of diabetes but we have not tested this in a randomized prospective trial let us do this that became the w h i and it randomized it had two parallel arms it had a group for women who did not have ha uterus a these are women that had undergone historic me for some other reason and then it had a group for women that did have their uterus in the first group the there is a placebo arm and then an estrogen only arm and in the other group there was a protestor on plus estrogen verst is a placebo everything about the way this study was done is a bit monkey some of it is justifiable but it is i portent to understand first the women were all way outside of menopause none of these women were started when you would normally start h artel and ism there were nobly us several reasons for that but one of them is and i think this is e legitimate reason they wanted hard outcomes they wanted to know death rates and if you are doing this on women in their fifties you just work in to get it right you could not wait yo low yet get a way too long and that this was only gin to be a seven to ten year study they had to do this on women who were much older they also disproportionately took much sicker women i believe the prevalence and gan i goal to get some of these numbers wrong and people a gang to get all phosphorelated but i mean ism in the ballpark right something thirty forty present oaths women were smokers the prevalence of obesity diabetes was enormous they they they they really dis proportionately pick the most unhealthy population they could that was pretty advanced in age and again i think part of that was to say look we want to make sure that after seven years we really know if there is a difference in these causes of death ism the other thing is is a count a heard allhogagant it i understand their ration ell for it but this is a great example of be very careful when you look at a clinical trial that it remotely represents the patients your interested in treating they also treated no patients who were symptomatic the rational being if we include in the study patients who were symptomatic those who were randomized to placebo will drop out o g make sensenterms of study design makes no sense if the said design is a intended to mimic the real world that is right now let us just keep tract of the three issues we have a disproportionately in healthy patient population who are not symptomatic and we are starting them more than ten years after menopause the next thing that they did which again understand why they did it but it is now the fourth strike against this study is and have spoken with the p i of the study and asked this question point blank n mi she on to have her on my podcast at some point soon to go over this and more detail am is why did you use conjugated equine estrogen an m p which is a synthetic form of progesterone horse yes let horse it is horse ruin is the they collect horse ran they are getting the it is nurses do you remain a lot ore at least when they up in a it seems a large volume of your from what give observed you have lotic merino what my sister rode horses for a lit while my hescadofran had a horse and that thing i mean the the the pes were legendary male horse yest the conjugated equine estrogen is the estrogen that is collected from from female horse is and then it is a synthetic progesterone and i said to to a the positive why did not you use what we use to day which is by identical estrogen in progesterone to day when we put women on estrogen we use ait is an fat product called the level dot it is a patch that you just put on and it is extra dial but it is by identical extra dial and we use what is called micronized progesterone by identical progesterone and she said well at the time we just wanted to test what was currently being used i said told make sense but again now you have four considerations that you have to keep in mine o case despite those four considerations dim gong to make a case for you why i think the m p a crated a real problem in that study the synthetic progesterone when the preliminary results we are first made available but not yet pure reviewed and not yet published there was a huge fiasco huge press announcement about it suggesting that the women receiving the c e e plus m p a in the a group with the outer as had a higher incidents of breast cancer and that basically became the headline that never went away though it turned out not to be true let us talk about the numbers what was the increase in the risk of break cancer in that group which gets to my one of my ti you everelistein g on a podcast rail on something as an i have about thirty eight hundred pet leaves an counting my laboratory staff know the a no good number of them you are plan w am not to to apologize for having many that pees because as long as they have a experience indited to support them it proviso one my legs pet leaves is i my my them knows this was sometimes they will occasionally they will do this i oft for mine them you never talk about a relative risk change without an absolute risk accommodating it i what is that look the the relative risk increase of break cancer in the estrogen plus m p group verses the place to was went five twenty seven per cent and the it became the only headline h or t increases risk of brescancer by twenty seven per cent now i do not think that is true at all to day but let us even look at the data what was the a r what was the absolute risk increase it was the difference between five cases per thousand and four cases per thousand the a r r was zero point one per cent one case in a thousand and it is true going from four in a thousand to five and a thousand is a twenty five per cent increase but it is a completely in appropriate context i agree and i feel headlines of that sort which have come up recently around various dietary interventions we will not though there at least ore not for the time being a are nothing short of criminal because they really history people's thinking but also they steer the course of science in medicine for as you pointed out for decades if not longer and they can really take us off our health track in serious ways it'll bring this meandering to a close which is to say even though i could spend the next hour talking about all the ways in which the study was food and all of the very unethical things that were done by a number the investigators who went out of their way to mask the truth of this study from the world it'll tell a woman to day we begin a start you on this when you are going through menopause were using by identical hormones and if your upper bound risk of bees cancer is to one case in a thousand you should at least way that against all the other benefits which it'll talk about now there's something else i want to say because a moment ago i alluded to the fact that i think the m p a might have been the biggest issue in that study the who findings in that study that were negative one was the install increase in the risk of hart disease and a small increase in the risk of brescancer but consider the other group we forgot about the group that did not have a uterus cause remember those women got estrogen only verses placebo what was the difference in breascancer there well this is interesting cause it did not reach the tactical significance but it is p value was point o six or point o seven it came very close but it was in the opposite direction it was a twenty four per cent risk reduction about one in a thousand as well when you had estrogenplus m p a you had a bare least statistically significant that pe value was point five it just hitstatistical significance one in a thousand cases four breastcancer and then you had one in a thousand cases but p value of point o seven for reduction of risk of break cancer which to me suggest that the m p the synthetic progesterone was playing more of a roll than anything else the second thing i point out is oral estrogen which we no longer use does in ease coagulability it does increase the ability the blood to clot a little bit and when we look at the more recent data on h r t using topical estrogen or patches of estrogen we do not see that at all infect we see the opposite now now we see the risk of hart disease going down in women with strobile and some women will be arriving to those treatments permutations and things fact or five light and in other clotting factors it is it a appropriate to say that everyone both man if he knows should know whether not they have mute forms of factor five like and youknow we do not tepidly test people for fact or five a my wife act she has it but we did not learn it until she at helpsyndrum giving birth to our first daughter am but we we kind of look for more family history reason to be testing things that we took a pretty detail family history well con look for clotting issues there about am your reflects now it is is to what women on a these topical as well as there the basically have the discussion rash here is were we still struggleright is we if it were up to me it'd prefer for a woman's a h or t to be provided by her g we n because we want o beagle to work in partnership with the g we and who we would to see an undemetral ultrasound done every year am that is somewhat argue that is over kill but we think she be showing a cashmere every year as well if we are looking at the services we want to look at the end matrix me wen o make sure the lining is not too thick the other thing i should say under is to day we now realize that not all women can tolerate extra upparme progestorom you have to be careful assuming again a women still has her uterus the estrogen solves most of the problems but then you have to decide can she tolerate the progestorom and it needs to be if given systemically a hundred to two hundred telegrams and for some women that is a life saving intervention in mean they start sleeping better their hair gets thicker they feel better but for somewomenit literally drives time crazy it it is probably the reciprocal of what we were seeing in the case of women with pajamas in those situations we say great we are done with oral progesterone we just use a progesterone voted i u d then you get the local progestorom in the uterus for protection in this systemic estrogen fascinating what about a or contraception am for it in women the use of estrogen chronic my through to you know college years or twenty thirties make even teen knows am what is known about the long term effects any i got a on the i do not i do not think i know enough to comment on it it is not it is not something that really impacts my patient population am at least in what i see more women are using buds for a for for contraception than then o ss n we use o ss sometimes in women who are free menapozzle for symptomatic control but we will typically use a solo veterans a very low ism synthetic estrogen which do not using these very much but if it is anything we can get to control certain symptoms and we will use it half her cycle but it is typically not something we are we are that experienced with what about testostromis you mention that anagram am permit a when you said everything to the same i guess is anagram prodeseleader as it would be to to kind of normalizers a tangram primal you right ya and you that is what a peters point out before is that you look at your charges in they are all in these different measures and when you normalized to stostronis she tho higher than estrogen when that is a surprise to me do you prescribe testosterone therapy to women ever we do sometimes but i do it with much more caution because i do not have the data right wherein what we will say as luck and we are now really outside of an area were i can point to a lot o day when it comes to estrogen and progesterone i ill it'll happily go tattoo with anybody who wants to make the case that it is dangerous similarly when it comes to using testosterone an men ill it'll spend all day and i can go through that literature until the other person cries and wants to just call uncle right when it come within forscab them testogio when it comes to estrogen in testosterone and women do not have that data and it'd love to see that trial done how what is the what is the sweet spot how do we how we reconcile that i it is not something i consider standard and basically if a women is after mesotron firstmall is staggeringly low and again even though her testosterone's low compared to a a male we shall have a range if it is really at the bottom of that range she is really having difficulty putting on muscle mass and really complaining of low habit i think in that situation we will go ahead use topical testosterone u and and replace her to a level that is still physiologically normal now that is key because when people here h or t they think about superphysiological seems to be the term you i do not now never seen a single symptom in a single woman that have put testostronon in terms of anybody here things that those are real symptoms that you have to be aware of but you don't literal and large men and things it that that does not happen under physiologic normal conditions love to talk alibi about on on replacement there be in men when one looks on social meeting in the inner and at there seems to be a younger and younger cohoritof guise people n they're teens and twenty is showing up to the table thinking ah that injecting testosterone simian ait or taking an of or whatever it is is going to be the right idea they are mainly seem to be focus on cosmetic effects ism not a physician i cannot say whether or not they were actually have a canal et camera but it seems to me yuan crept me if on robot it seems to me that similar to the alias rule as it relates to longevity that we could come up with a abroad contra rule in which if the male of any age is not trying to get decent sleep exercise appropriately profit nutrition minding their social connections et camera et camera the idea of going straight to testosterone simply a bad idea that said just with depression and ante tor presence there is a kind of a cliff after which a low enough testosterone or low enough keratose and prevents people from sleeping exercise social connection et camera i do not acknowledge that but with that in mind how do you think about ism perhaps occasionally prescribe and direct your patients in terms of hormone replacement there be in men person their thirties person in their forties whose doing almost all the other things correctly what sorts of levels do you think are meaningful because the rangers tremendous in terms of blood test three hundred anagrams for descender i thing on the low and now an the you as all the way up to nine hundred or twelve hundred that is enormous range what are some the other hormones you to look at estrogen d h t grandson i you will lot lots on pack their i let start with the ranges it ism teethe the ranges you gave or for total teststron of course and we do not spend a lot of time looking at that the way we use the way we i use to spend more time looking at total and free when i had when i used more tricks to modulate it it's actually far more simple in my manipulation of testosterone to day than i was six or seven years ago six or seven years ago i mean we were we would use a microcosm of nova to lower s h b g in a person who had normal testosterone but low free testosterone but what was em the low dose of nova in that context ten milligrams sibling two to three times a week an of our basically being d h t a i wander alone logan hos its exactly is again we are not recommending this as actually if your playing a compete sport can get you band from that no i tan apsis mas it can also get you band from having children if you do it in correctly yet stand a microdosiv this has to be small enough that it does not superior bodies ability to make testosterone but nova has such a high affinity for s h b g that basically distracts your ease to be from binding your testostro freeing up testostas exact it the goal was how do i just give you more free testosterone if you patient shows up and the have got a a total testosterone of nine hundred tangrams per desolator which would place them at depending on the scale you look at the sale we look at that would place you at about the seventieth per gentile but you are free testosterone is eight anagrams per desolator that is pretty bad that means your less than one per cent free a guy should be about two per cent are t that died should be closer to sixteen to eighteen anagrams per desolator in that situation that i just gave you his s h b g is really high is es h b g is probably in the eighty tenant in that is very high yeas i think the upper range is somewhere round fifty five fifty six x am we would first baxstall for what is driving is es h b g the spacey three hormones genetic plays a huge join is there is no question that just out of the box people have a different set point for es h b g mine is not crazy low my es h b g is kind of in the thirties twenties to thirties am but from a hormone perspective thesis basically three hormones that run it estradiol being probably the most important insolent and throw we we in a look at all of those and decide if any of those are playing role insolent suppresses it this is actually the great irony of helping a person get metabolically healthy is in the short run you can actually lower their free testosterone all things equal because as insolent comes down less h b g goes up and if testosterone has not gone up with it your lowering free testosterone somebody who goes on a very low carborhidra died an attempt to drop some water and drunk drop some weight is going to increase their es h b g after insane goes being to gustostron less free testosterone am i can i can tell the carnivore diet people can becoming after me with a with bone marrow in hand but thanygon that after this discussion extends all further ism sure the vegans will be coming after me with celery stock its a a then the same as of extradite except in the opposite direction higher estradiol is higher es h b g ism again occasionally you will see a guy with secret i normal testosterone but he is a very high a coma taste activity person he has a lot of the endsi'me that converts testosterone into estradiol you can lower estradiol a bit within a comatose and hitter and that can bring down as h b g now again these things individually are rarely enough to move the needle the last is this dioxin if you have a person whose tirade is out o wack you have to fix that before you if their for is out o wack you are gin to interfere with s h b g they're also some supplements which i think you have propytalked about these on the podcast if yell have heard you talk abut these on a pod cast there a few that will adjust that you no there is this idea now there is a a much better review that just came out it'll send at you id love your thoughts on it and have been perusing t a line by line but a love in put om experts you on a the use of tonga all for during es h b g in my experience it does free up some testosterone by which mechanism it is not exactly clear and the effects are not that dramatic by their probably multiple effects o for all we know it increases libido and it does generally by way of increasing estrogens lightly which can also increase be known in some individual we do not know the exact motive of action were talked about a few the one that few years back people were claiming but over ss h b g was a a stinging nettles am stinging nettle i loll just ruin seems to be cooler your abating seems to be coming ut mental times on the son destroy whatever reason a sting nettle extract i took the the a most p pronounced effect of that was you could baby turn an't over a car and when taking message b u what the underlying mechanism of that was i do not know i took it for a short while it did not drop my s b g very much i but did drop by d h t sufficiently than i sat a on it i do not anything that impedes t h t i i do not care if my hairline retreats i do not care about any that d h t to me is something to be fetid and held on to because you feel much better when your d h t is in the appropriate range in lover thoughts on that see it really depends on the guy and it depends on what risk your trying to manage right prostate size starts to become one of the issues with t h t luckily my profits s again to in is low i inch t ism the things i no can reduce it our things finasteri proper things i a laser i things to that people take to try and avoid hairless can ism dramatically reduce t h t and leads all sorts of terrible sexual side effects mood massive effects et camera but i yes ism not aware of anything they be taken in supplement form that can really profoundly dry and do do not spend much attention on it any more basically i used to have a much more complicated differential diagnosis eight years ago i i mean it was i would drive patients not with the whiteboard diagrams i would draw for them wen thin the and i think they were just to just put any to take ism to day we take it much more simple approach the first question is should you re should you have your free tistostron being hired that is the metric i care about is free testosterone is the first most important the second most important is estradiol and starting trouble you set if you look here total testosterone want the are t to be about two per cent of your willing should b risk i i might not change that any more in other words if a use at one per cent then i know i have to really boost his total testosterone if he is only going to get one to one and a half per cent of it converted to free aware not to boost and mesh do not care if he is outside the range nohow a go who is are t i might have to get a guise total t up to fifteen hundred to get his are t to eighteen i sees a free t is the target i t is got and d you still use an of uric a i iran for sorry to trying lower less h b do it is because it is too potent no because it s too complicated for patients it is it is ait is a drug that cannot be taken only you we to take under the tongue esrocor som ray than an i had one patient ones to even though we told him about eighty seven times that he was swallowing the an of ours and his liver function and he was toward tug an ten milligrams three times week as a tiny dose and three months of him or whatever two months of him swallowing that every time tripped is liver function was it's it is just i was you know it its just not worth hassle of doing this i fur perfection in reality we can fix this another way the first order question is do we believe clinically you will bend it from normalizing your free tistostron were taking it to a level that is call it eightieth to ninetieth per cent also per normal limit of physiologic ranges am that is the first wort of question and that is going to come down to symptoms and that is going to come down to some big markers i think there is am two years ago istitu or may be a year ago very good study came out that looked at prediabatic men you pony talked about this study and looking at insolent resistance and glucose a disposal within without testosterone and the evidence was overwhelmingly clear a testosterone improves a glaseemic control tistostron improves insane signing this should not be surprising by the way given the roll muscles play as he glucose rest of ornigluco sing now i include that is one of the things that we will consider as a factor for using tistostron now again it is not the only one you can accomplish that with exercise you to compressive these of the things but then you get into a little but of the vicious cycle of will having normalized teiststron facilitate you doing those things better let us just assume we come to the decision that this this this person is a good candidate fruit for testosterone placement therapy the next question is what is the method we are going to do it ore we going to do it indirectly or directly now we used to use a lot of closed in our practice and have you talked about common i talk too much about it a a no we talked a little bit about the fact that some people taking things an astray all to reduce a rotates activity run can potentially run into trouble because they think o well more testosterone good lower estrin bad and then the and up with issues joint paying memory issues and severe drops in libido and i think a lot of the mean even emphatic cumulation if estrogen is too low you you'll you can develop at posit in a way that you would not otherwise eras a great numen journal paper is probe ten years old now that looked at my i before five different doses if testosterone cipianates these men were chemically castrated and divided into ten groups is pretty remarkable somebody scented out for the study e you were within without an astray all and five doses of teststron now you basically had five tistostron levels plosermine us high or low estradiol and the results were really clear that the higher your testosterone and the more your estrodale was in kind of that thirty to fifty range the better you were if estrogen was too low even the presence of high tistostro the outcomes were were a less significant and this is thirty to fifty anagrams priestly a not third fifty percent of your o once testosterone go of as to we have not taught abut closest is no we have not talked a lot about clomedad left to get your thoughts on cloven clomping is a fertility drug it is a synthetic hormone it is exactly two drugs m chlonophine and i forget the other one and it tells the pituitary too secrete affixation el age you ad the advantage of of closed is its oral and it is meant to be taken orally a typical starting dose would be fifty milligrams three times a week and if you do that you will notice in most men especially young men effasatia each goes up in any man the effasation allege go up but if a man still has to saccular reserve he will make lots a tistostron in response to that i cause that is the first order question we are trying to answer is do you is your failure to make testosterone central or primal and i think a swamp went out gan crept me for all but my understanding is that a lot of the drugs that we are talking about i the synthetic compounds to stostro an estrogen things i relate to growth wen et camera we are discovered and designed in order to treat and ascus me in order to iciest and treat exactly these kinds of sindrums weather not it was tehiothalmis the pituitary or the target tissue the the overs or the or the testes correct ya i mean i think the easiest way to go about doing this is just give the hormone that is that is missing without attention to were its where the deficiency is why this becomes relevant is if you have a thirty five year old guy whose tustostron is low but you can demonstrate that it is low because he is not getting enough of a signal from the pituitary why would you bother giving him more tiestostron when he has the carat he has the at excels mister tools sells to make tistosron he just needs the signal i sometimes though not always just a course of climate can wake him up and he is he is back to making normal tistostrom he do this three times what fifty mill that fifty milligrams three times a week for a short course and the wed do it for eight to twelve weeks and then we reevaluate and estrogen and tiestostron will increase in in parallel yes and again it depends a romances activity is dependent on how much body fat you have and genetics i and if strobile gets two guy we think if it gets over about fifty five sixty we will give microcosms of an astrosall but it has to be real microcosms i mean you cannot pound people with an astrosalty to give you perspective the the the sort of on label use if you just go to a pharmacy an order and astroslal you argon to get one telegram tablets we cannot give anybody a telegram an they will feel garment we we have to have it compounded at point one milligrams and we might give a patient point one two to three times a week that would be a big dose of an astrosall i think that the typical tarty clinic out there is giving two hundred milligrams promise one mill to inter milligrams of testator once every two weeks and then hitting people with am multiple milligrams of than asters all and they are all over the place eve never really understood am and i guess i should not be surprised but it is cannot blows my mind that these tart clinics are up all over the place given how bad i mean i see the results cause i have patients that come from them and i do not understand wither in competent i actually think it is worse tin that i think that they simply do not understand and do not care because it is a a pellmell and it is a money mill i think that down is it seems almost everybody who is doing tart is take in lower doses more frequently every other day or twice a week dividing the dose and being very very careful with these estrogen or romataste blockers am we we we most of our patients do not take a romatases inhibitors it is not needed it is really only the high aromatizes that need it ism and yet when we will all about testosterone will talk about dosing there cause i agree the more frequently you can take it the better and ran frankly do not need to go more frequently than twice a week is it is sea i yet et the half life of the drug is s i think is about three and a half days is the plasma half life for something hi can be off little bit but but twice week dosing is is really nice sofyour if if you if if you go to the tostostrom clinic that is giving you two hundred every two weeks fifty twice a week is the same total dose which by thewy is a physiologic dobs that is not going to give somebody any of the side effects you would see you are not going to get acne with that you are nocking a get kind a camass ya you are not ginny gat ingythngs the only real side effect you get from that is you will get testicularatrophy that is enough to suppress yet to maintain a fertility what ha typically due for less this where it'll finish the story on closet cause we currently do not use closet and that is that is am due to a really interesting observation that i we we made that i do not think has been reported in the literature yet which is that closed was increasing levels of a start that we also happen to measure called desmostral not familiar with that in the in the in the way that clusterall is made it is made by a there is two pathways that make central it starts win with two carbons up you i sic asealokoay an a counter march is down a pathway by hates and clestrall is the finished product of both but in one of those pathways that the mothemolecull ride before clestrall is called does mistral an the other pathways called lethlostral we constantly measure lethostral and desmostral because we want to know how much clestrall is being synthesized in the body not just what you are central is we wont no how much central you reabsorbed and those markers are really important to us when we are looking at cardiovascular disease risk when we gave patients closed we were noticing a almost universal rise in their desmostral levels now the most obvious explanation for that though i the last time i looked i could not find clear explanation for this in any of the clinical the clinical trials that led to the approval of closet i do not know it was describe in fact maybe it was not known i suspect it is inhibiting the ends ism which i think it is called deal ta twenty four saturate that turns desmostral into central make sense if you inhibit that ends ism you are going to see arise in desmostral this would not have been a concern to me if not for the fact that tom dayspring hots one the physicians we work with of one the world's experts in lipids pointed out a very obscure story which was that the very first drug ever r approved to treat carry of vascular disease at least to treat hyper clustrolemia was a drug that attacked the same engine a this this this is in the early nineteen sixties i believe maybe the mid sixties this drug was approved and it lowered cluster bandit was approved on the basis of lowering cluster now to day no drug for a c v d is approved on the basis of it lowering cluster that is not a high enough b you have to reduce events exhefto show that your preventing hart attacks and death but at the time it was hate lords clustrolts got to be good well in late sixties it was pulled from the market because events were going up claustral was coming down events were going up how could that be we do not know what we are suspecting is that does mistral which is still a stall was potentially more damaging and crated more oxidate of stress in the end of helium in the subbenthedial space than cluster is which would at least suggest to us and again we are taken a lot of leaps here that maybe having high was mistral very high was control is is not a good thing and once we con a piectall let together a few years ago we were the at where just not can prescribe coat any more i and we then switch to h c g which we used to use sometimes instead of closed but it is more cumbersome to work with it needs to be refrigerated it is a much more fragile molecule i think we talked about this once is almost a if you accidentally a knock over the little a bottle it is basically gone bad ya with it as is very rate with it a it is a needle notes an injection such easy to administer it is not i am or anything that but it just more of a haste factor am but that said it has the benefit that closed does which is it preserves testicular function it preserves testicular volume you do not body builders will often use this in their pocychael therapy as ta waiter can have recover function and we would just use it now as of going therapy for a guy who still has testicular reserve on its own no testostro no aromataste in visitor nothing just awaiting crank out a bit more testosterone from the testes maybe some national in in all h c gs a different model ash c g is just an analogue of utilizing hormone it is basely giving them mutinying hormone it is goon to crush indoginis utilizing hormonmomosriht because actually a can unit i you do not really see much of been impact on all h but you do see and dozens tostostron production go down i she it not correct that both affixation elate will go down on a high enough dos a just as a mansion and here ism not making recommendations but one supplement have take to lot about a publicly is fidogia arrests which is this weird nigeria shrub the that a days the the sometimes boys on tinspocastin jobs podcast and am there was a bit of a back lash because it does turn out that at hi doses in rod studies it can cause a some toxicity the testes but a at lower doses it does seem to increase aluminizing hormone and after talking about this number of he one out there did prone post blood work and the they consistent effect seems to be an increase in utilizing hormone there is a noticeable effect on testa testicular size and volumes a lot of you all take is tot go there the balls are getting bigger and they get all excited that something good as happening but we do not know that long term safety in efficacy of something fidogio weather not was beside yetis is that i ism ism also very learn of the supplements in this space because at least when we are using h c g or tostasteron we have many years of data you not remember how many women are using this stuff for reproductive medicine know i think the f t i the t has a lot of faults i i think i have an entire podcast devoted to the corruption of the f the and all of the mistakes that have been made with respect to they are over site in especially generic drugs but it is way more regulated than the wild wild west of nifty supplement land absolutely i think that the reason for talking about things tongue out up fidogia was to provide some intermediate discussion between doing all the correct things but no supplementation or hormone therapy and then going straight to hormone there sort of to leap from i cannot folks very well to riddle right without a real diagnosis of eighty h s to oh ell make you some things alpha pa low doses of nicotine right but i agree entirely i mean the forcing is important the dosages are are worked out empirically on individual basis and there are not canalize control trials they are they are just art you do not have kind of a seven this another peter principal right i'llget a lot of patients that come into the practice and your during our intake we go through what it what drugs and supplements r you taking right now and not people come in ore not takin anything peter i just you are in you rein charge now tell me what you think and then you get look people that come in an there began need next a few pages for this part of the document i she blue travel with the suit case yo can hear as they walk through the owning all the pills and ism i give these patients a little homework exercise which is you have to answer these seven questions for every supplement you take and here is the spread sheet and let us talk about it and it basically just runs through it is it is basically walking you through the logic of why do you take this colic you will and i i think for many people it is when they do that it is very sobering right they kind of the lot o them will come back and be what i do not think i can come up with any reason along this really rigorous line of thinking as to why ism taking eighty percent of the stuff i know people and act you we nose on the same peopleere fanatic about red red light on the testis sunning their testis putting ice packs on their testis is have all over the place the number of things that people are trying and doing in order to increase testosterone out but from their testis's pretty remarkable and that said am among some of the women i know the number of things that they are doing to try and promote longevity and fertility and in particular skin in health here health and nail health its also kind of outrages everything from ollegent o red therapies which may actually have some ethicasiin certain cases but am it is an interest the de hider there i he for sure i one of the things that i hope gets a lot more attention is the use o rap a mice and for preserving a vary in health the animal literature this is pretty pretty impressive right in mouse models rap a mice and will preserve of a of i vermin life and and make sense right a in it totally make sense why the most potent hero protective molecule we have would also preserve and extend varying life at least in mice am it'd love to see the clinical trials done in in in women to test the hypothesis i defy one to come back to this is us a a key thing i know the lot of you for just in female fertility out there am when their male partners am going back to now i unperson why you do not prescribe clomophine because of this a this mosterall i potential dismosterall link am what about tistostron thereto lest as e frequent lower dose is a less less it or no estrogen in mission or romicagain a bit only onlywere only using an a romataste blocker and we use a remains when we do it is just a is just to get that strobile into the range we want i to see it between thirty and fifty that that is the sweet spot and a i do not now i would say a third maybe a not even a third it say probe twenty per cent of men require a microcosm of masters all to get into that range most do not aim and it'd rather air on the side o being a little high than a little low i never really one to be below twenty five if unless sometimes its just below twenty five an it is it is what it is that is fine but but if we are suppressing it to below twenty five i never want to be in that zone a and then yes tear ta is ultimately giving tostostera rincipienate is usually what we use injactablesos was a creamer pellet correct aim i use to use deletes with women am for some who were really animate about the convenience of it but for a bunch of reasons i i just ism ism mostly not doing that and have never been a fan of deletes in men am cannot control the dose once i anal i know the dose yet that is amuse problem but i do not think there is a big difference in putting a delete into a man and a woman whenyou are putting a estrogen pellet into a woman it is it is that big when you are putting enough deletes into a man for six months of testosterone it is two sums of deletes that are longer than my fingers you are putting a v putting this putting it into the a glacial fat is just is just a more morbid procedure and i d orderly is necessary i think of you if how to manage it through through sort of the injections and now was rob yapwill especially now f your doing worth having them do subdue injections anyway it is not i am they are using a five eights inch to one inch twenty five gage needle which is but the smallest need you can push the oil through i once the twice a week depending on and bathe way if thee real needle folks we use instead which is a reloaded pen and are you having all men take h c g to maintain fertility and only o us to got it and by the way we do not to use t r t and men whose we do not to use testostrn specifically and men who still want to maintain fertility we just steer them away from that because totalspurm countless at we just say why is we rather use h c g fetus on its yet just wait just wait till you're done reproducing banksfirm wait tillyou are done reproducing before we go to testosterone what are some of the benefits and what are some of the a cautionary notes with appropriate tart meaning of the on a contrary re talking about here a lower dose with the yes or no lo asterism control people what it generally people report how to they feel a what is allow them to do that they can ism doer feel before and then in terms of what are the markers to look for is the ell yell blood pressure a water attention acne those kinds of things other some other thing yet on an the doses redamiand again we are using these and really low dose it is pretty rare that we would have a patient on more than a hundred milligrams a week of tistoseron ism i think for comparison a body builder could easily take five hundred to a thousand during a high growth phase i know somebody's guys they they go realistic or they're doing moderate levels of zestostron hippie nae but they are also taking dinar oleander alone i arms and a bunch of others they ask hemming their stacks are kind of ridiculous i man that not no list respect to that for it but i mean people a time right crazy and that sport sides outside of physioligyyen i sent for ninety nine per cent people listening they just they look the hear body builder in they like we would somebody do that anyway right i think that is the tiptoe wit in also through the point is a lot of but but we owe those guides a great deal of gratitude cause they have shown us the boundaries including the women that is right y now and those those body builders have taught us a lot about what happens and y the the rebooting the water attention acne hair lost hair growth all of those things we understand the truth of it is we just do not see those things in our patients that a hundred milligrams for week is a very low ill put in is the the tibia object of me your oui is its enough for house people mean there is probably the highest we have ever had to go as may be seventy twice a week what is the youngest patient you have ever had to put em on her t actual testosterone willy ask are something about maybe maybe forty i think that is great for people to here because i know that the lotas in their twenties are thinking to a tees the way to go at i would argue less you are doing everything else i tin your still hyprocan admen you really struggling put that put that time off because all the fertility issue you want to delay well i gan its pensive wood when we say to or t if you are in you are twenties and there is no other way i would i would hope you would be steered toward h c g to at least preserve to circular function you again we do not actually know if after being on h c g for ten years you are pituitary well still work t you will not be able to make your own lignins exactly it might be the case that you are going to need something upstream of that closed to kick started and then we are but again i will not i don't want anybody use messing o this who is using closet for fertility to think that there is anything on i was my concern over this became if you begin to be on this for ten years is at problematic not if you are using this for a course of ivy a for something that again if if if we felt that some one's pituitary was not working i would be happy to put three months of closet on them to can o trytose if we could blast of that do you have men cycle on and off testosterone at these low dose as you are they taking month vacation from it an robs can wholly depends in o son of patient yesterday were we're going to too we just such change of cycle eight weeks on than eight weeks on h c g eight weeks on and eight weeks on h c g that is going to be a cycle but maintains his testosterone level but fluctuates between androgen's erogenic and yogis exognes sometimes we will just do testosterone on off on off and there it is how much can he replenish naturally but understanding his tea will dip during those off cycles seems to me there is a tremendous incentive for somebody to develop a molecule that can directly target s h b g besides oxandanima right if you one could just drop a ah b g just the tiniest bit seems one could adjust the are t in it in a way the would be great i soft know why that molecule hard to target but somebody ought to do it can ye three p can tat i took with iatric areola about this many many years ago i wish i could remember what his i he had a comment about this that at the time made sense i do not remember what it was cause i i had that thought to man be especially for that subset of give you have normal testosterone but they are just overbidding it really glad that you brought up this issue of total testosterone verses free t and the reason is i never since going on podcast and talking about the stuff and time to on this podcast a people will send me their numbers they will send me their charts and then they'll send photos of themselves and i can tell you while i not a cognition and having done fancy statistics on it there is very little correlation between some one's absolute testosterone and how they appear i mean somewhere guys look really lean really strong and they'll say oh total testosterone is five fifty for eighty right and then other people testosterone is eight sixty but they you look at them anything i kind of came the kind of doughy look to them and it is got to be this free to stostrone the estrogen et camera well the o training training and nutrition a right a man i i just think i think for all this talk about tistostron which i enjoy talking about and i enjoy talking about the data on longer health consequences of testosterone as is another controversial topic ism i also think people kind of overstate it is importance i agree ism and i think thegoper people who think if i could just fix my testosterone everything will be better and it sort of no actually that is not true at all really the only purpose in my mind o fixing testosterone is to give you the capacity to work harder it is really going to help you recover more from your workouts this should just give you a greater ability to experience muscle proline synthesis you know if i just give you a munch of testosterone and you sit on the couch and your nutrition does not change and you're not exercising any more you are not going experience any benefits of this thing i mean my testostrom level has fluctuated quite a bit throughout my life and when i think about as an adult not not sort of including when i was sort of a fanatical teenager but as an adult when was i at my absolute most insane physique my best performance on a dexascam would have been thirty as thirty eight years old by deva i was seven per cent body fat my fat free mass and decks was twenty three point tho twentythree point three kilogram's perimeter squared i mean i was huge strong and totally ripped my just often was in the toilet i was overstraining crazy i was exercising probably twenty six hours a week killing it in the him swimming a banshee cycling my life depended on it grossly overstrained low tea but i mean physically looked twice the guy i am to day you now today my teas probably twice as high as it was then not you could say hell peter what if you took tea back then how much better to do agent sure ism but began i think to take home is just giving somebody tea does not do much of anything it probably helps me the insolent resistance front without any other thing but to me that is a waste that squandering the gift that it is giving you which is the ability to do more work and capture the benefit of it sea muscle proline synthesis i agree and i think that the psychological effect of testosterone weather not exotic as are indoginis is it makes effort feel good ye at some level it really seems to do that and suppulsky tells me the main reason or mechanistically the main reason that it can do that is by a busting levels of activity in the imignola is and there some interesting imaging there it'd love to chap more about the collateral pathway and i know this is a huge landscape as well but i think were going a good job of diving in deep but not getting stuck in the underlying currents at all there is tremendous debate about whether not dietary cluster all directly relates to you for dos not relate to serum clesterall elder an each die here is my thither i think well let me put it this way there are people that argue ism certainly i argue u there are people that argue that if one eats a ton of saturated fat that elder goes out in o down a but does not literary clesteral leer said no not turn clestroper say but and then there are people that argue that am any increase in saturate fat and take its going to be bad that you already since enough clesterall for home on production et camera it'd to talk about this in terms of how one should read their charts am myeldielas in what ism told is healthy range my h yells an one's healthy range i do trying not over eat things butter cheese and red meat but i do eat some of those things and i feel pretty good but most people are operating under the a sumption that eating saturated fat is bad and you only do it in far as you want to taste it am and then of course is a small group of people that a love to eat organs and meats and and really pack molester all am and would argue that does not matter if your eldiellas ait seventy am it is not an impact your health what is the reality around eldiell i ah dell dietary clesterall saturate fat a at least in your view a first let us differiendship between cluster a and fat just for the listener i because we use them thingthat don't make sure people outstand clues her all is a is a really complicated molecules what is a ringed molecule a got i used to know exactly what its structure was but it could have thirty six carbons for all i remember a it is a lipid it is a hydrophobic molecule but is synthesized by every cell in the human body it is important that without it if you look it sort of genetic conditions that impariclesteral synthesis depending on their severity they can be fatal in uteri in other words anything that really interferes with our ability to produce clesterall will is a threat to us is a species and the reason for that is cluster all makes up the cell membrane of every cell in our body as but maybe the listeners do not even though a cell is a spherical thing it has to be fluid right its not just a rigid sphere a you are blow up all right it is got to be able to kind of move in this way to mash with other cells it also has to a accommodate having poorest structures that traverse its membrane to allow ions and things that to go across and it is clesterall that gives the fluidity to that membrane it is also is your alluding to the backbone of some of the most important hormones in our body estrogen proves heron dust astern corpus all a we have this thing superimpose look then let us talk about does celesta can you get collestral in your diet yes you can eat foods that our rich in collestrall what was known in nineteen sixty but somehow escaped everybody's imagination until finally the america hart association acknowledge this a few years ago is that the collestral you eat does not really make it into your body and the reason for that is it is esterified we have and not to get too nutty but i think people think if i really think it iscimportant people understand how this thing wore we have cells in our gut and enerocites that they are the epithelial cells of our gut they have each one of them has basically two transporters on them the first is called the leman picks we one one transporter the second is called the high t p binding casette g five g eat of the demon pics one one transporter will bring in any steal collesterall zero steal fit steal any steal that fits through the door will come in virtually all of that is the collesterall we produce that gets taken back to the liver that the liver packages and bile and secretes that is that is what aids in our digestion which is another thing i should mentioned early in addition to using cllesterall for celmembranes and hormones we would not beagle to digest our food without colestrall because it is what makes up the bile salts our own collestral is basically recirculated in a pool throughout our body and this is the way it gets back into the body it is through this demon picks one one transport when it gets in there the body this is the check point of regulation this is where the body says do you have enough celestial in the body yes or no if yes i will let that collateral make its way into the circulation it will go off the bilateral side of the cell not the luminal side into the body alternatively the body says youknow what we have enough colesterall man to let you poop this out and now the high t p binding casette will shoot it out it will go back into the luminal side and a way it goes the all the cllesteral on our body is not a esterified and it does not have that big bulky side chain attached to it the celestial you eat is esterified and in esterified olestra molecule simply cannot physically pass through that demon picks one one transporter now we probably manage to d esterify ten to fifteen per cent of our dietary collestral in motherworts there are small amounts of dietary collesterl that do make their way into our circulation but it represents a small fraction of our total bodies pool of celestial again this was known even by anvil keys the the the guy who turned fat into the biggest boogie t of all time anvil keys acknowledge this in the nineteen sixties dietary cllesteral plays no role in serum collestral again it took the america hart association another sixty years to figure that out but even now they acknowledge that diary cllesteral has nobody why is it that it is pretty easy find studies are at least people withwho are highly credentialed from good institutions claiming that eating saturated fat under that's different saturate fat red meat things that are rich in collateral to be more specific is bad for us in terms of for vestal elder this is two different things saturated fat con sumption in many people will raise deal collateral is important to differentiate between the what what is saturated fats a saturated fat of course is a fatiacid just people understand totally different molecule from clesteral clusters is very complicated ring struck multiple ring stuck together safe saturated fat is just a long chain fatiacid that is fully saturated meaning has no double bonds and it can exist in isolation it can exist in a triglesteride tryicyl glesteride aroma phospholipid are all sorts of things that when we eat foods that contain fat basically there are three distinctions for that fat is it saturated is it monsoon saturate one double wonder s at pollen saturated two or more double bonds the observation that eating saturated fat raises collateral is generally correct a but again now it makes because a press or talking about elder we have to explain what elder is this is another one of those things that is just grossly misunderstood that it is a it makes having discussions about this very complicated a let us go back to the collateral problem it is o every cell in our body makes collateral and almost without exception they make enough there are a handful of times however what a cell needs to borrow collateral from another cell so how would you do this rights if your if your sort of if your playing god for a minute and you wanted design as system you have to be able to transport cllesteral from one cell to another the most logical place you would transport this is through the circulation and the problem with circulation is its water plasma is water now you have this problem which is i want to transport cargo that is hydrophobic in hydrophilic medium cannot do it you you think about all the things that we transport in our blood sodium electrolytes in a glucose things that the water soluble is easy they just move back and forth in our blood with no chaperone but when you want to move collateral you have to package it in something that is hydrophilic that something is called elyproproti they have these we have these spherical molecules that are lipid on the inside proline on the outside lips proline and inside they contain clesteral and triglesterides to not you've get the spherical thing triglesteride central on the inside and it is chaperone by a hydrophilic molecule that allows it to move through our circulation and those like approtines exist in different densities if you run these out on a jet lectriphresis plate you'll you will identify different densities the density is a function of how much proline and how much limit is in it the highest density of this is called a high density like atropine and the lowest density of this is called a very low density like approving a v l d l and then next to that you have an l d l a low density like approving and the next to that you have an id l an intermediate density like atropine a neighs b l d l ill l deal but am when people say my l d l is i or my l d l is one hundred what are they saying there's saying the collateral concentration of my l d l particles is a hundred telegrams perdesoletor the total clesteral concentration you have in your circulation is that number that says total central some one's blood panel says my total centrals two hundred it means that if you take all the like approaching in their circulation bus them open and measure the clesteral content it is two hundred telegrams prodesoletor and for all intension purposes because the idle or short live that is basically the sum of your el deal clesteral your v l d l clesteral in your heal clesteral those three things sum to your total clesteral what about l d l little a that you mention you el pi little es l others a he is another actor he is a special type of l d l that again in sort of ten to twenty per sunder the population is a really bad actor that is in l d l that has another ago like approving on it called ago like approving little e the other thing it'll just say on this because earlier i mentioned ago b there are two broad families of like prolines there are those that are wrapped in ago is and those that are rapped in ago as the ago a family is the h d l family the ago b family is the v l d l i d l l d l family for somebody who lets ay their total clesteral is as to stay with two hundred ye simplicity what ye to see in terms of the l l d l ratio could not care less i only care about ago b i only care about job i care about the positive agent of others sorosis ago b is the thing that drives others sorosis and what levels are attractive or repulsive for you when you see l levels of ago b that are blank you get really concern what depends on the persons objectives again we take k a very different view man we have vitality now lived and i want to live to be a hundred yes o you coming some tape a you tell me you want to live to be a hundred your an and to keep your ago b below thirty milligrams perdesoleter but say i want to live to be a hundred but i all well how about i i do not care how long i live but i want to feel great while i live again it depends right anybody who is how to heard attack is going to be compromised in their ability to feel well after right i guess that i what i make say that way because if you are gong to tell me that ism in order to achieve that live to a hundred level ism going to have to a give up my personal life in my a non i might my getting functioning than that ism not really interested sure but but o get el d a levels and really again people think of it as el day it is really ago b right ago b is the total concentration of el d l an v l do and that is what matters those are the big pathogenic particles el do also includes o the the espy little a though the concentration of opulitla is relatively speaking small that it does not generally show up as much in the ago b we treat ago b and basically what it comes down to is you want ago b to be as close to the level as it was when you were born we start developing hart disease when were born that is just the way it is ism the autopsy studies make this abundantly clear when you look at autopsies of young people who are dying in their twenties and this was first done in the nineteen seventies it was again repeated against always done after we have a war right in the nineteen seventies it was done on people you who died in v atom and the early two thousands it was done on mostly young men but some young women who were eat dying in in broken afghanistan and we saw without any ambiguity that cartiavasker disease is already taking hold in people who ware eighteen nineteen twenty years old and to be clear they aen'tgoin to die of throw sorosis at that age there still forty fifty years away from it but this is a life long disease and we also know that the disease cannot really develop until ago b reaches a certain threshold and that is the threshold that most of us get to by the time were in a sort of in fourteens it is this really young ago b level of con a twenty to thirty milligrams perdesoleter that makes it impossible to get throw sorosis ago b is necessary but not sufficient to develop a c v b now that o motive you can to ask whatever some of the top behavior of nutritional supplementation if any based and prescription drug base ways to target ago b well nutritionally you basically have two big tools right and it depends on what is driving up ago b ago b remember is the concentration of el d can v l d l particles and what do they carry central and try glycerides anything that reduces central and reduces triglycerides is going to red sap b triglesterides are generally driven by carbohydrate and take more insolent resistance more carbohydrate and take more triglycerides we going clinically this is readily apparent to anyone who treats patients if you restrict carbohydrates you will reduce triglycerides that that just happens all day long but if you reduce triglusterides by raising fat in take much it can still raise ago b you have to be able to think about it in an ideal world it is can you lower saturated fat which tends to be the one that is most driving ago b while lowering carbohydrate and then see what you can get but here is the reality of it is there is nobody with dietary intervention that is going to get to a level of thirty telegrams perdesolator have never seen it here watery in convention gat what are the other things on to be marnicalogic at this point state type in drone you have musical classes of drugs them tried an true is the station states work by inhibiting clesteral synthesis and the net effect of that is that the the liver is really sensitive to clesteral levels it does not want too much it does not want too little when you inhibit clesteral synthesis the liver says i want more clesteral it puts more elder receptors on its surface and it pulls the elbeel out of circulation that is what lowers the el been in the circulation am do not gan nine states in use today we typically use four of them a the side office profile contrary to can of all the sort of station hating propaganda out there very benign it five percent of people experience muscle soreness which reverses upon cessation am you do notcogmal the facts again i think it is in terms of actual comparing it an splice not no effect whatsoever it right does that mean that you put a patient on it they will not complain of something no but if you look at clinical trials there is no evidence whatsoever that states in precognition the is also no evidence in clinical trials that they accelerate the risk of naris enerbusies in fact it is the opposite now we will there is there is a very new ant's case we make drew which is will look at patience we highly suppress does mistral levels we will back off we we do want a maintain does most above a certain level a because of some evidence that is still i think very preliminary but enough for us that we say why take the chance we have many other pools to lower clesteral why would we oversuppress synthesis in a susceptible individual a the next tool you look at is a drug that blocks the absorption or the reabsorption of central that member that leman pics one one transporter that guy has a a drug called acetamide that just mechanically blocks it in people and that is why i mention earlier we men we measure all those step all and people we also measure things called hit a steals and the final steals give us an indication of how active that to s porter is the higher your fight usderrils the more likely y ware to respond to retina next class of drugs is a drug that blocks clestrall synthesis but only in the liver the station does it global a the this other drug called bembidoic acid does it only in the liver has a very similar mechanism to stations different enzyme a not quite as potent but was you were side effect any patients having a response to states it is adverse will try this other thing what is ta called one cult bempidoic sand dnoicasi the most potent drug of the lot is the pic canine in visitor pic nine we proline that was discovered in the late nineties i believe a is responsible for the degradation of dial receptors this was first discovered in people who had a condition called familial hyperoclestrolemia or f h to these people that have incredibly high clestrall typically their plus total claustral level is three hundred their dial clestrall is typically in a north of two hundred milligrams perdesolator this is a disease that is defined by the pen type not the gene type the pen type has a very clear definition which i basically just gave you the gene type is there is a million paths to get there there is over three thousand mutations that are known to produce that pen type this was discovered to be one of them in people who had hyperfunctioning piece i a pic es c pa nine this proline was just constantly hammering and destroying the deal receptors and their dial would be huge and my extensionther total clestrowoul be nineteen us a in two thousand six hell hobs and colleagues discovered an opposite group of population people who had dial central naturally of ten to twenty milligrams pererdesoleter which would an ago b of about twenty milligrams r desolate a and who never got heart to sees the retune to paradises no matter how long they live and they had the opposite they had hypo functioning pic nine and that was two tutor six hin wangle vernal medicine that basically got a wholebunch of drug companies hot on the trail of producing a drug to mimic it now we have these antibodies and their wildly effective what percentage yo of eurpatiente over forty fave a you have on either station or on one of each other loden is is combinations and i would say eighty per cent we have to remember what our objective is we are in the business of trying to make sure people live as long as possible and you have to take a sort of world view of this right if you what is the most prevalent cause of death global saint cardinal was and an how close is it the the last year before bovid covicona metis up these numbers limit but if you go on two thousand nineteen eighteen point six million people died of heart disease number two cancer ten million nothing's in the zipicode of athroscorosis and if you remember what i just said if you if you had if you took e everybody in their twenties and reduced them to a level of that of a child you make a c v d an orphan disease the crew why don't t we run the why do not we hear more about this i realize there is some nuances it is it is not straightforward is not as simple at saying eat less cheese red meat and and watcher eld yell yet on a station but why do we hear little about ago b in the general discussion lot i cha me is such a asci landscape as we know people shouting into tunnels of a a very a clarity some a beautiful bronze tunnels with clean walls and others are suer lines am and they all converge in the same place i as we know but why don't we hear belittle about this i mean ism not nystatin a but now beginning to think that maybe that my be a good idea to consider one of these other compounds i do not know the last time i look at my job specifically ism messing my physician did but u why do not we hear more about this this is sound important something the most important conversation as all the hormone stuff in all the stuff about smoking and head injuries and mighty h t and all the rest i mean as is irrelevant if you are debt ye it is a try question i do not think i have a great insight as to why this is not more front in center i i think the bigger problem is why do not we even understand how to think about it i mean that the the finders whole chapter in my book ism working on that really gets to this problem a why why are not we looking at athroscrosis in terms of treating the positive agent instead we look at a modifying ten year risk that is the fundamental difference between what i call medicine twopoino an medicine three point that is to twoponow which is what we are generally practicing to day when it comes to a c b d says look we will treat you we will lower that dial claustral they still do not talk about ago b but that is a very america thing if you go outside the united states everybody's talkingabout ago b it is in the guide lines in rope in candid everywhere else the unitedstates is very stubborn on this and it is due to a couple of really weird personalities in the lipid world but but the the the paradise is when you are ten year risk reaches five per cent when there is a five per cent chance thatyoure going to have a hart attacked stroke or die in the next ten years now it is time to treat you a medicine three points says that is not the way to think about it you treat the positive agent if there is a positive agent you treat it if blood pressure raises the is of hart disease you lower brood blood pressure if smoking raises the risk of something you treat smoking and the reason that the risk model is bad when you are looking at ten year risk is ages the biggest driver of risk am a not right to if you take a seventy year old with perfect lipids and perfect blood pressure and perfect everything there ten year risk of a c v d is probably four to five times higher than the most unhealthy thirty er from it is not even clothes it is a lo e disease you there are exceptions of course we always say that the biggest reactor for going blind from glaucoma is being an older person frankly sir if you could identify what the risk factors are for glaucoma imagine if the paradise was we are only going to treat it when you are risk of blindness reaches five per cent which is not trigger until your old enough anyway would not you rather know that when you are thirty and say was if maybe being in the sun without sun glass is or using this type of i drop or something that as a negative impact it'd rather know that sooner that is the fundamental difference it is a philosophical difference with respect to prevention and i will acknowledge that in one element of prevention i make no consideration i am only coming at this through the lends of the individual i am never coming at this through the ends of society that makes my life easier an it makes the problem ism solving easier i do not have to answer the quality adjusted life your problem i do not have to ask the question is it economical to treat people at thirty i do not know the answer that question but i i also know that when your turnsole really complicated problems ham more you can simplify the better have just acknowledged openly not solving that if you want to criticize me for it that is fine let us be transparent but all i care about is the person ism sitting across from and in that situation it is really their decision if they can justify the cost of treatment an esoteric question and then a less street question the esoteric question relates to something that i think it is a little niche but not necessarily which is am peptides and themselves in per p i do not want to go off on too much of attention on re have but i know you have done ha number of posts on sociomenia recently that we i have to sell you really thoughtful and i reallyappreciate that you are killing to share your own ism tissue rehabilitation experience and point people that because this is a landscape that a lot of people are in and they do not know how to navigate it and a you dual friend of ours not to be named send me a tax in said men we talking to a t a and what about studies on things b piece one five seven is gastric peptide that anecdotally again anecdotally people report getting injections of this and the shoulder me at camera and feeling much better much faster but there really are good studies controlled studies and you hear all the same sorts of things about plate rich plasma p r p which i some one tells you they a lot of themselves in them they are lying they are not also themselves in them and you hear also your about themselves which are not f ta approved it lease in this for most uses in this country but are certainly people are flying down to colombia and getting injections and what is your understanding or experience with things b pa one by seven specifically cause baptize is a huge landscape i pried you hole icon them it is am things p r p a pops now approved for women are injections of this into their ovaries to improve a logical account we know this i people going injections a part in every tissue an organ in it how men are getting injecting their penis i hear am for all sorts of reasons that are unclear to me am what is the deal at or p b p c one five seven and stemicelves do you ever s interesting effects are you curious about these am compounds do you prescribe or direct people towards these the fat approved ones yes short answers ism definitely curious about them and it'd love to see the work done but i also think this is about as wild wild west as it gets happy p less a but certainly themselves and peptides and i just think if you are going to do something without a clinical trial you got a shop with a lot more data right us use rap a bison as an example right ism a huge propound in a rap a mission and you can say what peter how can you take or prescribe rap a is and for bureau protective effects when we do not have a human clinical trial demonstrating that at lengthens life and the answer is because i have eighty for other pieces of data that all point in the same direction across every model organism going back more than a billion ears and that is really different from joy mammy and sally did this thing and i think it works andthat you would they just cannot be compared now i have no idea if stemselles work i have no idea if p p c one five seven works have no idea frankly of p r p even works though it might seem to have some efficacy in some indications for example maybe when it comes to early hair lost maybe when it comes to certain joint i issues i but the real of it is i think we just have to accept the fact that everything we do has an opportunity cost and that opportunity cost is sometimes financial but i actually find a lot of times it is in time and effort and energy that goes into something now when i was waiting to get my shoulder surgery this is an injury that have had for ever right isn't injury i i i this this injury was actually probably the greatest source of discomfort i had swimming e rattling a channel the last time into thousand nine that is tells you how long have have this injury i but i sort of knew at some point ism going to have to have it fixed and i sort of went down this habit hole hay is there anything i can do to avoid having surgery i would infusing a million stemsells into it work am and in speaking with is many wore the poetic surgeons as i could the answer was out of unambiguously know and by the way does not mean you would not feel better if i injected a bunch of stemsells into your shoulder there lot of reasons that might make you feel better just the bunch of reasons you can feel better if somebody in jet sailing directly into your joint that the questions is at going to fix the underlying problem in if will it do by what mechanism ism pretty sure that if you took a thousand people with my particular injury and injected them with themselves it would not do a thing because of the nature of my injury at a completelaboral tare are there some injuries that might benefit from it possible the question is how would you design the trial to narrow down your patient population correctly that you might see a signal cause the other risk of doing a trial is you have too much of a heterogeneous patient population it is you do not know what the heck your really doing and you get meaningless results you get a null result when in fact there is a small signal but you were under powered to pick it up because you know you only had ten percent your patient population that was the right patient population to get that you know will we ever get there i do not know because i do not see what the incentive is right you have people who were making money hand over fist doing procedures on the basis of ism not sure what what would their motivation are incentive be to o sort of see this legitimize you would really have to e able to say whether there really needs to be sort of a farm angle to this it sort of one of the wishes i had right if i was if i was a a billionaire i feel the way i would probably waste all of my money would be running clinical trials on stuff nobody cared about now it might just likewise i ha showing you because that would be yesterday recorded as sit down with somebody from called who works on a egression an rage in think and other things lay to that and as identified peptides that or approved yet the a for other reasons that seem to adjust anxiety might even in justiggression and pathologic aggression and went off onto a long description of why none of these drugs exist on the market for the treatment of psychiatricalness and yet probably would work and what is missing is a billionaire or a billion dollar company that is willing to invest in something that very likely will work but the market value is not quite there or it failed in a previous trial and no one wants to touchy with it enfootpole i of we some one let in this will been sensitized to provide this sort of avenue for that a the kind of work that we are talking about i have to ask but about one o make one other point under which is to me the problem with a lot of these things is it gets it it is a crutch it for at would be talked about with hay just fix my tea man and everything's going to be fine and it is now that is just the beginning what i worry about when i see people who are clamoring for this staff is a lot of times they do not realize that whether it psychologically or otherwise the sort of say while now that have had this thing done i do not have to do the hard work of the real happen mind if have learned anything through my shoulder surgery and ism now three and a half months out how is it feel amaze him meant look i still cannot do a lot of e it is going to be a while i have nylon enable to shoot a bad yet and it will probably be a year before it'll go back to long dead hangs and heavy dead lips man it i do not ma be nine months but it is en ism not there yet but what i learned through a really amazing are have and re have process is wake you just got a do the work and it is free and hard shoulders are the most tedious boring thing in the world i mean three days a week i am doing for four days a week i am doing one hour of just dedicated stuff for this shoulder that is superdissuperuncomfortable superposing superfrustrating am but i i mean i have faith in the methodology right and and i think a lot of people are saying just shoot the themselves into me and soft have to do any that stuff and the re out of it is i i think that is a very dangerous place to be have you ever tried to be peck when france them a ya we tried it a we had you know again may be seven y years ago we had a bunch of patients ask about it my view is a i was pretty convinced that there was no safety downside to it as well i would not prescribe to a patient unless i tried it myself me and another dock in the practice rape we headed it for i don't know a couple months i did not notice a single thing interesting thank you for that a shifting to a less esoteric band i think hate more important topic over all metabylomics firing about this before we set down to record what what is what are metabylomics why shoal w be thinking about them i have some idea what it might be about a what most people i think are not thinking about metabylomacs at all and for those that are ism sure theycould learn more tell us about metabylomics in what you would to see more of in the world of metabolizes gesso comic is just the term that we use to describe the study of o something for gene makes riot is the broadstudy of genes and a you no photo makes the broadstudy of prolines and things that metabylau makes us to study of metabolites and metabolites unlike lot these other things there there r relatively finite number of these things a many of which are known but some of which are not known gluecosts is a metabolite the settle come is a metabolize lactate imam metabolite and the the question is what do we know about these things and how they work and more importantly what do we know about certain physiologic states and the metabylomake profile that results from them what is use two extreme examples exercise everybody understands the data are unambiguously clear exercise produce is about the most favorable plena type imaginable if you wanted to take a genomic approach to understanding that you might look at is there were change in the venom when you exercise i the answers probably not but maybe maybe if you looked at the mephylation patterns an epigene you could look at epigenomic studies a but you might instead look at kind of the prodiomic side of that what is gene expression doing and there you would see a lot of changes well what i do not think people are really understanding all the was a very interesting paper that just came out a two weeks ago that looks for novel metabolights there changing austere re huge signal in a metabylomic profile that looks different in the state of exercise verses non exercise and could that represent part of how exercise is transmitting its benefit through the body a youknow people always talk about the holy grail of metabylomics wo be can you find pill to mimic exercise and i think the instar that question is going to be undoubtedly know a for for couple reasons one even if you could mimic the long levity sort of life span parts of it you could never mimic the healthspan parts of it but what if you could do both right what if there were small molecules that can replicate some of the protective benefits of exercise and you could combine those with exercise what if those could be treatments for other disease states diabetes things that that is why i think this field of metabylomics is you know relatively untapped a and and i think potentially the next sort of frontier speaking of frontiers i hear a lot nowadays about help one and farmechology that prescription drugs that mimic or increased copy one directly a who go on peptide a people are toying about this as the block busterobe city drug i have not heard wits much talk about a drug to a just human body weight a favorably since the discussions of fencing when i was in college and then of course vegan was pulled from the market a because people were dying not left in right but enough people died that they pulled it for the market a which by thewy is an interesting a story it was the elastomer that they chose to use that was the wrong and another and what it resulted in was a i think it was mitrovel et elapse as id was at end p at with something in the mistral valve a the i think the courtetendan a were rupturing and the mistral have a an it was mostly young women i think were getting horrible pulmonary disease as a result of it probably luminary high pretension or something that am but there were therefore two an antlers of the drug and had they just used the other one this issue would not have happened and there was a stupid reason why they made the choice to use the one they did and it is one of those things were once you make the mistake you are never going back it is not that company could same ozone to do over but we are going to do it with the right version it is a tragic outcome a but but you are basely right i think the grope one agonies a have more efficacy a and a or all intensity and for everything we can see certainly seem safer are you excited about them i am ya and i think i think we are just seeing the connatipithy iceberg they are not they are not miracle drugs right they come with problems right which is they are they are they are catabolic across the board patients are losing fat but they are losing muscle as well you not descend all that the a him jockeys running from some o annoy that is all you have to say i had to say now is about something is that it is going a droptastostron lower fertility change some one skin hair nails and s people it can extend life to be two hundred of to years all than people are gone omens are human that is a that is a narrow science and psychology issue not a not a biology means in issue but i i at pleased to hear that your side by them cause i i hear a lot of excitement i have not heard anything disastrous about them it takes a while to get people up to dose if you are looking at seminally tied the dose that was studied i did a won your trial or may be as little over the in sixty weeks but it took about sixteen weeks to get the patients comfortably up to two point for milligrams weekly which was the dose that they ultimately stayed on in our experience when we use it we do not even usually go up to two point for milligrams we can usually get enough benefit between one and two milligrams and we usually move people along a title bit quicker but we have definitely had our share of patients who cannot tolerate it due to the nausea interesting which might be part of how it is working right is the sort of suppression of appetite which have taken to an extreme can produce nausea interesting you i think most of the effect of of comical tied o central not peripheral i do not know i saw one paper that i gel pe one is acting both on cells in in the prefer ism two cause got distension some ways their sort of take people feel full through promotion of a literally mechanic receptors that make people feel as if their stomach is tostenud even o their stomach is empty and then perhaps some central hypothalamic of facts is that yeti think it is doing i would bet eighty percent of its in hypothalamus i it is also improving insolent sensitivity in the periphery but i do not think that that is accounting for much of its benefit superinteresting an there is next get i versions at see that seem to be more long lasting right now if you look at coming off semi glue tide you are going to see a weight regain there is new reversions that seem to preserve the wait loss even off the drug to begs the ultimate questiomich is what is the what is the total use case for this gong to be as this on to be a drug you cycle on and off or as it going to be a drug that of person has to stay on indefinitely and if will they become tacky plastic will they gain a resistance to it but still superiorly days on these things my hope is that it would be albeit the way they describe to stostron in estrogen therapies that it would allow people to do more of the behavioral work that is absolutely required for horsemen an listen yo and we have also seen in the flip side of that you can cheap true senmicluti r people wo you you can drink a lot of calories and sort of get around the drug you a forexample you do not we we always encourage patient wo one ta lose wait to really just eliminate alcoholic that is butts the cheapest easiest trick to to lose way and if you are still drinking a lot of alcohol which is incredibly colonic and just drinking a lot of cleric stuff i we've seen that that is less hits is justanmic total in are we are patientswull be seen that that is it is easier to get around the benefits of of the drug betray si appreciate your answers to day first of ale they are incredibly thorough and pointed towards real world application it'll just one o thank you more broadly for the work that you do because i see you have this a incredible i clinical experience and ad patient population that you work very closely with but i seeyou really is one of the few both clinicians and i realize your needy i did you do appease as well now but i consider you a science cognition clinician scientists is the appropriate wording of that of course in the way that you really still drill into studies in detail i know a lot of clinicians not all of them do that ism for sure and the fact that you are hungry for the new incoming knowledge as well as the the old literature it is an incredibly rich data set in that brain of yours and i really appreciate you sharing it with us both in podcast in the upcoming book which i think they'll certainly have you on here again ism in anticipation of that but i know i and a ton of other people are really excited for the book and in the way that you approach social media and podcast going on podcast thank you much i learn ton i know everyone

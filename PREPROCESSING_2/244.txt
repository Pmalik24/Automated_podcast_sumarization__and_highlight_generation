real america is was the on my god america things are happening to me i get you i said i the beginning i shurdit a is that decide it was doing that summer him says because was full of moments of delight she struggled to really take notice of that feeling i thing of it as a thing a thing that you it was just enjoyable she thought the feeling seemed important somehow and i thought hae this feeling is something worse repeating and the idea that you can go and look for delight and you might find it was i think fully planet that summer you know in me ye like if i actively sort out delight i might be able to find it and replicate it for ever i thought t can will just keep doing that that was kind of a way of organizing my life by the way very unbritish way to in i her himself to embrace the light heartily and myself consciously fundamentally ism fighting against every urging me which is kind of do not do not do that because ism ism still brutish i cannot help that ism always just thinking to myself just a a was that too much i feel by feel very much somebody is disapproving nan yet stop that that is too much omission there is a reason why our national sound is a tut stopsthaits an admonishment is like stop it they used to be a talk show and the the theme song was a little child singing this very sing songyour voice it will never a till nevawim that i tie wets thing i that would never be laser i just at this sole voice and an all the other the chorus of voices join it it'll ne mi t is ma eery o mice i don a her that is the spirit of prison the is poet that i dis covered and a couple of years ago is called rosy and he is written a book where he basically keeps track of the things that delight him and that is things that is people that moment whatever and the word he used was negligence he said it is a negligence if people don't take the time to honor the things that they take delight in the more importantly that they share the things that they take delight in and if you do not do that there is there is a loss the you have to do it to achieve humanity you have to share delight and that is what we can be doing today it yes that is exactly what was to bedding to day we gan a think about what delights us hit delights at whites importance to cultivate delight and with that on me just hand over t showed you your hos the show from here i been to my we satin to be the as chico i readmit i can hid it is it d b easy he sure o get from doubt b was at chico it is this america light an they might one me say with us at one the job of delight it is one thing to be a tuned to delight but is quite another to scrape off e sample stick it on a slight and place it under a microscope enter rosy the part i was talking about a moment ago rob is an english professor at indaba university and a couple of years ago he embarked on a specific mission to think about delight he made it a practice in fact for one calender year rob would ask himself what delights me and then he would write it down he set rules he would do it every day he would drop them quickly and every single delight would be written my hand he called them essay its some of these i say its eventually became a book the book of delight he's rob reading an except of delight number eighty from the book to motor on board in his living room in bloomington would you do not know until you carry a tomato seedling through the a port non to a plain is it carrying a tomato seedling through the i port non to a plain will make people smile at you almost your carrying a baby i did not know this until today carrying my little tomato about three or four inches high in its four inch plastic startapat which my friend michael gave to me smirking about how i was going to get at home something about this at first felt noddy that comparing at tomato a to a baby but carrying the tomato on to the plain and i slit the thing into my bag who going through security which made then pull the bag for inspection when the security guy shit with a tomato smiled and said i donor how to check that have a good day but i quickly realized o one of its terms which i almost wrote his arms whit is broke in from the jailing and it only had four of them i decided it'd better just carry it out in the open and the shower of lave began before boarding the final leg of my flight one of the workers say ice tomato which i do not think was a complex and the flight at pendent asked about the tomato at least five times not in exaggeration every time calling it my tomato where is my tomato how is my tomato he did not lose my tomato did you she event directed me to an open seat in the beg it to i you gas go sit there and stretch out i gathered my things and set the lo guy in the window seats a she could look out when i got my water i poured some into the log soil when we got bumpy i put my hand on the louis container careful not to snap another armor and when we landed an the pilot put the breaks on hard my arm reflectively when across the sea holding the logan place the way my dads arm would when he had to break in that car without seetbouts to speak you in one of my very favorite gestures in the encyclopedia a human gestures the book of delights is a series of daily snap shots into one man's habits and pleasures if you ever wanted an essay about the specific sensation of a plying cokenon oil to a shower damp body that would be delight number onion one reports an the people boss encounters in them come a potent his garden will be spent a very delightful afternoon looking about bumble bees and potatoes is the location of many a delight some of the delights in the book were things that surprised him while others were looking back in time memories of people no longer here a lot of them featured familiar faces and familiar places boss was getting to reassess his environment and consider it through renew lends a delightful line i was learning as is going and frankly s pro learning how my sob these things delighted me the question is always wise i slightly what does it do to a person to study delight or as it injuries to study joy every single day for a year what do you discover one of the things he discovered is the mechanics of how to fined delight every day as a discipline because delight does not just drive you needs to actively good looking for it best it in a state of ah the try to train your curiosity e try to train the sense of that knowing delight curiosity a really tied out you have to be o say with that knowing things you have to be actually invested and happy about not knowing things the book of delights is a peculiar thing an undertaking of serious academic rigor at also makes you feel good those things to meant to go together the book offers up many sorts on what delighted or what it could be but it never defines it explicitly the take away is that delight while important is hard to pin down reading the book and toking to boss about this make me feel i was floating on a chemically enhanced but perfectly legal in eleven states cloud i began to think of him as a sort of personal delight to and my questions for him began to take on the strong wife of a petals busting did you end up with a grand unifying theory on what delight is no a no but i did and that which what feels a kind of beginning in theory of what joys and li i dust attic and delight is their butterflies flied around and landing on the thing that is jo right see petulant to boss an important part of delight is that it is an invitation by loving something we allow other people an opportunity to love it too sharing tapping some one on the shoulder to say hey look often i feel have had the experience of walking through the world and that saying thing in

responds to me an only my best friend this thing about ready in what a nice guide is what if the joy we get from interacting with animals the idea that we can have relation chips of mutual affection

round was a hit ado's they were doing life shows selling out venues across the country and abroad they wont awards they saw merchandise heaven and track were being recognized by fans in the street as it grew the that was getting more demanding to make it needed more money more start more time and they worst getting any of thatched heaven left busby she took a how by the late show with steepen caber and came back to record new officers when she could but things went the same track understood but it was still hard on both of them we did not have a go way to manage that translation and i think that since i was the only one an in the building who was accessible all the time a lot of the work fell on me in my shoulder i which ism happen to do the work but i got tired i did not know it

the miking ow if you were just out of a i a yer vex in my real life that is very true you remember that is all no not that i mean remember that episode that is that but i do not remember the depression napstuff and i think that is because i was depressed an your memory just doesn't it is not there also when everyday feels another day in another day just i could not even tell you what year that happened madam it it sounds sounds at out right i feeling best the thing for a pretty long period of my life listening back to the episodes of the share that end during this talk period it is had to discern that anything was amiss an that is because track proved to be adept it'd employing that a old habit trick she faked it having too fake the funk as it were was driven mostly by i cannot let other people down and it was also a sort of muscle memory i guess ism really really really good at small talk when you all faking delight do you feel delight to it fleet into it yet i i would kind of it lost in can caught up in the conversation i did have chances to get kind of carried away the effects were not long time but it did get me a nice little little bright little pockets of o gayness here and there but i tell you let as soon as the interviewsminself for over stein out of at a stein out the sued it was just i had gone twelve rounds with bison the sherry eventually went on hiatus track went on disability it first it was a relief to just stay how leaving the house would have went reading with new york the noise the people the subway but then track realized she was staying in

the fact that she was doing less made ho feel even was she turned her quick talent end mind inwards turned her self into a tokes an was relentless at attacking herself she could not turn it all track sleep cleaning her portents benny changed close i just remember being in my room on my bid the entire places a miss and i was just lain and i was thinking about how nobody knows the right now this is where i am and i remember getting my pone to text my friend teddy who isn't love and i was just ism having a tough time and i just need somebody to know it and he was very gracious you nim glad that

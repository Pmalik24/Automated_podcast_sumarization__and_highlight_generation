using the crudest tools tell found answering machine and a shiny red boombox stay with us at win he ben in hophead alksplinburg was a producer in our program for many years and aback when he was working here that tiddysho is a rerun he made a decision to return to his childhood he went searching for somebody names sudan jordan who he and my sister hate and their parents knew for about a year when talks is growing up in sinsanatty these have the things that i remember about sudan jordan me and her sitting in the back room and telling about the day camp i went to that summer i cannot get myself to shut up and they had alligators and stinks i can hear myself telling her and this one time this one alligator got out and the councillor had to catch it and on and on that me an sudan flipping through one of this time life books rockenrall through the decades the sixties she is long brown hair she is incredibly skinny it is nineteen seventy five she is wearing bellbottom levis a faded gene jacket she points to a picture of a bloated man in a powder blue tinstone jump suit sitting cross it on a stage before a crowd of crying women that is my favorite picture of elbow she says this in formation seems somehow personal and i portage an sudan writing in her car ism going through this pase when ism trying to notice things when we poll to a stoplight i start trying to notice the guy in the motorcycle next to us he apparently does not want to be notice especially by a peculiar nine year old staring at him through the passenger window what you looking at he sneers i turn around fasted and face the dashboard did he say something to you sudan asked what did he say to you nothing ah he don't say anything it is fine look greenlight tell me what he said what did he say to you i stay silent enough i tell her what he said she will get out of the car try to kick his ass which scares me but comforts me too tit sudan jordan was our baby sir she watch my sister and me every day after school for a couple hours until a parents got home from work we did not know any adults her and we loved her the summer before i started fit grades after being with us for a year sudan got another job the last time i saw her was christian eve nineteen eighty two am sixteen a cashier at thrifty foods super market since an anna where lived the place is packed it'll twenty five registers are going people a lined up half way to the back of the store i look up and there sudan jordan she smiles we talk she does not have many items i check them through as slowly as i possibly can i cannot recall one thing we say to each other although i remember being distinctly disappointed to hear that she is married she hands me some kind of business card her husband's probably something having to do with the building of redwood decks she seems happy meanwhile there is a line of last minute christian shopper is mounting behind her i tell her to hold on it'll try to get my break we can catch up she says great and steps aside i keep signalling to my manager but there is no one to relieve five ten fifteen minutes pass i keep glancing behind at sudan making apologetic gestures i can still remember her standing there holding her one bag of nurseries smiling back on me finally she oarsmen in the shoulder i have to o she says but i come in here all the time ism surely see around i worked tot throw to for two more years i never sow sudan jordan he is me crazy that i never saw her again if i had not run into at the tore i do not thing i care but somehow having her play with to me seemed a huge roll in my life when i was a kid and then getting just the taste of what would be to talk with her as a peer have never forgotten that moment know it is ridiculous but after years of thinking about her imagining what she is up to wondering if she ever thinks about me i decide to find her i start with my only lead the one former employer of hers that i know ism om i oi i you not know ism calling i do i you remember sudan jordan wright an curt curt ye i a bout but i cannot i i she was our baby said her o i a chain mi an my at one of the many ideas that sudan introduced to our household was the concept of the nickname i think that is all i want to say about chicken legs in my red it'd gone to my mother to filling gaps in my memory of sudan but she did not remember much more than i did a a he a really hat or e rely it i o a i i i i he in have a very meaning overly i i you o me the i e real i it you i have wit an at her at a ai a bout e an it an a ever at round en i came home he out e ere the talking to my mim did do was make me look at my childhood memories from an adult prospect of for example what i remembered about her living situation i i a in can an e i i i her handy i go a peon very mi in ut on her very er young i i can mi a en i breaking i her on haring grip a him that is that is what yes he that is that my memory is that i she was an hi school right she went to way out but but i also remember her living on her for somehow i remember her own house ye and ism the reason i thought that she lived by herself as we went we went to some we went to her house or her boy we had to go picked something up somewhere and we were in her card this big blue dust or i think it was and i her boyfriend was there and her and her boyfriend had let the cats out and there they were gone and she was furious and and i got in the car and and then she slam the door and i think we peeled out and he was set of standing he was he was sort of standing there and saying trying to trying to reason with her and we were out of there what i you it made me i think i felt sad for her i remember thinking in this is sort of in retrospect but i think i had some sort of inkling of this idea at the time ism just ism just set of now realizing of it but i think remember thinking that he was one of the few people that she had in her life and she could even really depend on him yo out only i i o an o a you you mi a in now a tat point a tat men her only en o my mind did not have any idea where i could find sudan which made things difficult because a sudan jordan is a very common name and be it is crawling on her name any more i called the county court record's department to find all the sudan organ's married an sincinatty my ma masked a friend who worked for the city to search all the since natty birth records i contact high school along my associations i asked friends at high powered newspapers to run back ground checks finally there was one former sudan jordan who stood out she seemed the right age she was married living at a since natty suburb head a couple kids her husband was a lawyer i got her number from information and it was not until i sat down to caller that it hit me a phone call from some one you baby set twenty years ago might not be a welcome surprise but in fact strange and creepy here i am practising sounding benign one too went too sudan is is sudan jordan is is sudan jordan finally i made the call well hello i this this sudan ye i ism my name's ale bloomers and ism ism calling from from a radio program i called this america life and ism this is a river strange funk call the receive but i was wondering first whale you do you remember me it turns out there are a lot of sudan jordan who do not remember me a lot one got even called his ex wife a former sudan jordan and then called me back to tell me she would never heard of me i was getting nowhere by myself i contacted a professional one irking not winnow a certified new york city private investigate er three days after putting him on the case i got a message saying he would found her i called him back i call it it mornyerlyor a a dirty i you god mort oi i i you great i lie a some one i you visit are i i la pparticulargole a a wit a ti i you join nobody i win number right away beg a you peri part about the today you she all you remember you an h got a carl you hello is this sudan this is ale blooper i o inly ism going o ka how are you i i tin i men me i got your we man years i an i i called you a working that i realize that i it'd also got this number from the from the private investigator sudan and i talked for ever three hours on the founds is catching up comparing notes she asked about my sister and kids that sued to of in the street and our old family day how are you going ism do we it was amazing how much she rememberedand how much we remembered in comment even small incidents the time that we were stopped at the traffic light and i stared too long at the guy in the motorcycle i think i remember that i the going bury tin meter probably probably and you said did he say something to you and i said no he did not say anything to ma you said ut he said something to you did not and you were bout to get out of the car i thin ti agita as ism sure i think i can remember your he i think you were thin very you pul you in in you at we you afraid i was terrified a i did not know that he would notice ma but i i dot worry i i pul akin in i had no fear a till in ye do you remember a time om wed of maybe six or seven or eight years after you baby it us om and i was working bourdon yo y i my o fer i noria my nor way right at the thrift away yet i re member i get you were you bagging my go try ad e but i did not reckon mi you i do not and when you told me her you were an than i did right i i think you said my head t o my go i did for you the people do all you at sudan got married when she was still in college and went to work for the phone company as a repair person she spent the next twenty years or hanging from a telephone pole she said she hated about the money was good and round the time of her t marriage ended she finally got up the courage to quit and find work using her three she now teaches at a special school from went till ill children she lives in florid with her second husband and she seems happy of course when you got back into the pass this you find how partial and in complete your memory is first the are the facts you get wrong turns out sudan had been a college freshman when she baby set us not in high school i thought my sister remember she ridden the motor circle also not true and the guy who she got n the fight with over the cats when my mind was her harry seventy's boy friend turn not to be her room mates boy friend but besides the facts you change though the facts you completely omit that fight one the cats sudan had forgotten totally that it'd been there and it was a little strange because my presence was the only thing she would forgotten other details she remembered fine even the names of the cats themselves cot them an calm we were his butty remember that i and no ut i can't a mad to what i could you fit for ism sure it was for you no think we were just running errands be e like it is it is funny because when i when i i remember these very particular incidents and that was one of them an and probably the reason i remember it is because it seemed very significant to you i think i sense that is a kid that that you were that it was really upsetting to you because it it i think i felt at that time that you did not really have very many people in your life at that point you could trust o i did not have i did not have hardly anybody my whole family moved out a town i had no family come i e i moved out the day i graduate from my and i would didn't in darted year early i had i cut when ow e ad i found to that i got collar said i packed up that night why you one t get out about could my family would be cuntionel tut my mum it would pretty bed soothe girl that i live wit i ad ad time you would taken and i drop and her boy friend and every time i would come home tit would always try to get me ad drug would and and i i really didn't do it i at all and no it would really it would it wold cop to come home an i i get i m i on i title fed i it i really mi my little brother and my little her and e were con yo and no i would i get may be tried at i think may be that is one of the reasons that i remember that we remember you fondly those because i think it worked both ways i think that we felt if that did make you feel closer to us i think that we we responded and if well i would ted for we i tibookin for a family really but i mean it if only you knew you probably wen i me that i mean it to keep were complicated now what i really want to o you in my time it your momma did but i would terrified i mean i i could not i could not do it i shy no a lot of time they i it would i thought they were i tin me e longer and calk and i would u run out the ism sure they were in i o we know would to would cabin i up could not do it she have talked to us instead son yet i would comfortable round kid beau you no i had kid o my family every time the subject of her hard times came up i hear settle habit an see an sun's voice the first i though it was embarrassment but that was not it exactly it was not until we would been talking for hours that i realized what it was she was waiting for the other shooter drop she had not forgotten that her passed it happened she just forgotten that it'd witnessed part of it interfere it became clear the one that had been knowing at her our entire conversation was that i was calling to say she damaged me by exposing me to it i do not think i would to kind back that beau i there was ta wo a turmoil in my life and in my family and i that what my fer that i my a had an con an negative in pack do not people and i know probably i did on a cut people but they were my ay but i be know you jut when i remember yet i would the bay be her t kid of me lobe la bat i i would be nevi in it if i heard any thin different o there parts of your past you do not wan to go back to a parts of your self you soft wan to go back to and for sudan jordan the ear for life that i remember is he a she just the seen forget and to turns out it'd also done my best to forget what i was thaler i did not think of my self this way at all but sudan jordan reminded me in the gentles terms possible when i was nine i was anxious and bookish as kind of up tight not in mi then in thought that i cud get think in me kid do not know had a play when i went to your room i did not i didn't thin mi you had a whole lot of poi i i hope i got to try but u in li i there were to we book and were educational the i meant i remember you had plan it thin your room and a can't dree that and i did not remember that kat had hardly any called you did not mean i quite a i for at theater kid that i had bay be that you did bin more herded than general no many i think tad what i did you tried a play perhaps the most amazing thing about the whole story is how little our members had deceived us about each other even if they had to see us about ourselves as sudan said it one think each of us remembered what we needed to about the other i needed to remember the part of sudan that she does not think about much her toughness in the face of hardship she said she mostly remember a side of my family that i just take for granite that is calm in our house that there were books there was not much fighting it would the first time in my life where i had ever bean that pe people lived differently in the w ay i we what i i did i wanted from my e you can try to return to childhood by looking at powers or visiting the old neighborhood or listening to recordings or you can find some one who knew you back tan some one you have not seen sent

clothes he is clean cut but back in the nineteen seventies in inland where he grew up he was in a punk bed called the automatics her we never really big commercial success but they were respected now in the history of punk but be will care about that kind of thing if he years back here were odd series of connections he ended up re visiting his than age years for the first time but going back on tour in aversion of his band in japan here is the something of that happens i mentioned it to a client and and i said well it'd played in and in a hungry when when i was again and he said i really in his interested an and then a the next day he sent me a coffee of and of a ne a action and said he's this you and i sort of what some it was and i watched this auction i watched tithe sort of price shoot through the roof ye know another i began to realize wait a n ism collectable it is get down to rest hats here how much we get i i think that one actually went at forty eight dollars i i particularly liked looking at all that sort of fer other groups that were going at twenty five cents and music big business offerings along conk lines that you know i don't want a lit of all nonsense at the time and it was good to see that sir that there the records were not valued yes elater i mean it was it was file that history came out on the right side yes that sir there is a sort of darwinism in in in record collecting whatever i i went again see tricky the drama and and a tricky collected everything and he very kindly lent me these two scrap books i took pictures and and things out of there i just put it up on had a friend put it up on a web side and and then i got a hemal from fifty in and in japan saying yo i playing japan's punk rock grant and and if he is at a name of a person yes and you will record change my life well and he found out through the website that there's an unreleased own he asked if he could put me in touch with a audio bema of a base records we we struck up a deal and then they said well which you come over here and play some gigs to a you to from out rice you goo a tort how order you at that point i forty five forty five years old a lot a bit of great here coming and i at a gran hair command and i and and i woe really was a sure whether i it'd still be able to do it because i had not played those songs in twenty two years not in my shower

fir s stet you were unsaid well there was just en at the announcement the light and a moment's silence which last o former and then out at the back i heard the opening i or when the tanks well over pole and i was just this hole ignition of energy from the clerk in front and all these clouds just start a going mad it just click rid i felt i was in an automatics cover band for something that because it was long ago i did not feel that association as the river because i not material and i did not have that association as the right or any more see but i would wonder if are you sing the sags the conviction of the raiding return to you when you remember of feelings of it did that happen here was a muscle memory it was there you know the movements are all locked in the lyric in the beat and the and the parts endless i played them they all started to come out unit was just us or being a marriage or something you know here you punch the air are there you to bring it you remind the drama to come down and the and here there you point of the ear the the guitars for the on yet had you forgotten the thrill of ben loncdar yes it'd forgotten what it was to and have the audience right the before they said you ever a performed a punctual sober never well i unless i had unless i was taking the any by optic not in s is ow much in formation i it is such a brief sentence no it actually was one of the great paradoxes really i suppose that si that was great to do it over whether moments unshared to it were were you felt your age we just that towards the end you really feel yourself you it's it cause it it is a corner ut there i mean much energy going round and it is loud of them baas your wife had never seeing you do this before i there is have been a pride of you which felt please that she could see it yes i felt kind of it'd become this other person and an when i was over there my like over here seemed to have i sort of almost dream substance and then of course since i got back the events i n cover in japan just began to assume that s of mantle of dream i did three shows a too in a too intokio an one in quite and a the e just just great all threes sold out in photo we set a club record for the largest attendants ever it was packed we could not actually get off stage the only way out was over ha to sling myself over the audience and they carried me on their hands back through the crowd gently deposited me at the stage door this is your bast i that was your at gid yes end end end ended with the entire audience lifting you up in n passing you barely out in gently depositing you out out of the club at well not out of the club but to the stage door yes w it was amazing venting avevewe been lifted by a a of teen ages and people in we when's and what walk exactly as the an well in photo i felt pretty good about it ism not sure how i would have felt about it in onion in nighty seventy save where the seem was incredibly violent whenever you played you er you were just as light o get be nous as h were to get pay t his wear was lake to come but after the toe it was hard for me to get motivated again a to do my business after the a after the tore it id just was in its thrilling as being at a stage iffier a cheering well not many things a and is bit sort of my my dad's generation after for of growing up as a kid being fired on and and in you w world

really several able since we first did this interview a few years back a couple of those new songs even became number one hits on the up charts is that his dam west wherever comes at nonmember coming out a fascinating day in the life of a future prime minister maybe that is an minute am cigar baba radio when our program continues is mar from mi from i glass he we can aprgrm of course we choose some theme bring you different kinds of stories on that theme to day so returned to childhood stories if people were visiting the past would they find there would they do not find there refers there to day show a few years back we have arrived to at three of our show at three ariel scherzi chiton parts avid ben german and me sundog hen we re visit our childhood it is not very pleasant what we fined take for example our next guest when you's a than ago he started reading the biography of avid begorra the first prime minister of israel one of things that he warned is that all of his life avid bengoryan kept a diary an will package seem a good idea the job the diary remember third nineteen eighty six wednesday another fascinating day in the life of madam davidson have a attest to morrow ism going to school early to tutor girl in my class for the aforementioned test my math class a joint precalculous and calculous class consists mainly of seniors not e specially interested in learning i guess that i am the quote class expert on quit and the i always do the math problems which no one else can and for this ism disliked i guess that because i clime myself think clearly and do a little work as well as some intelligence helping out i am a geek in truth i am far from it when you first i read that to yourself when you first saw it of your reaction was it was pure horror recently madam davidson an occasional contributor to our program found his old high scold diaries madam's mamas is rally is tat is samaritan madam group in new york is body was in new york is brain asked the diaries reveal somewhere else entirely i remember when i was writing it i remember very clearly although don i do not say this in the diary that it was very clear to me this was the diary of the future prime minister of his me i that that i would one day be prime minister and it would be very important for history for people to know the deep thoughts of a young unionist as he prepared his way to lead his nation that are a regular listeners here in this america li can might remember that that you have been on our program describing a your experience in is rally army summer camp that was right before i started writing this diary great real me another sure see i there is much wrong with news and israel that ism going to have a job ahead of me one thing is the lack of any strong jewfish identity among most news this attitude sickens me you news of the world stop worrying about money and well being i do not know what exactly it'll do but if this situation continues when ism a bit old er then watch out world jewelry here comes madam and wash out what l jenryhere comes madam was all in capital went wow its inserting that you actually are a dressing a readership no that is at that is its kind of making and that readership is is world very ye the news of the world will one day read this book and will say if he knew this at sixteen how could i be living badly could i tend to just read one of the passages where you talk about israel sure e see i mean i have this thing from canary fourth nineteen eighty seven i memorize the hope ho mikva which is the israel national anthem a few minutes ago that will help me in israel i amazing that here i am the surepoin minister israel and and what dad the things i need all got i need to know the national anthem i i a dried upon to recite that its ore to be avagamers artist a a thing your right exacjanuary fourteen nineteen eighty seven wednesday i am getting more and more angered by the effects of arab propaganda they blame the news for everything and the world including news go along with it entirely ridiculous i men i really thought this was this was a testament for the ages i really thought that this writing was powerful and persuasive and any one who would read it would immediately become arsonist at sixteen i had such an inflated sense of myself there was much going on in my life then that i can remember and i was not recording it instead i was creating this ridiculous fantasy of ism not just as sixteen year old kid who haven crushes and a hopeless gee who cannot get a girl a kiss moment being scared and confused about growing old ism ism the future prime minister of israel and everything goes through that but i do not know i mean cause it maybe but may be keeping a diary when one tells the truth may be that is a luxury of being a certain cold of person in a certain kind of situation it it maybe maybe other people in another kind of situation need to actually make up a little fantasy ye i think on i did not have much axed about being the future prim minister of israel is very calm and confident and comfortable with it and i had much axed about every other aspect of my life and i now see is just kind of maybe it was a good solution it was a good way to deal with this with with what i was going through to have this space where i could just be one of the greats i wont to what out the sixteen year old madam davidsan out would feel it knowing that finally an audience of a million people was was getting some of the reading from this diary i think this would feel small to that sixteen year old this would feel nothing i mean i remember i was very disappointed and very sad about my parents mean i was reading biographies of course of all the prime ministers of israel and and i would just think about my parents and just think how do you wake up every day knowing that your actions will not effect millions of people l how is that enough motivation just to have your petty little craft in your petty little family in your small little apartment it just seems tot en an me they have the tindolighe t a me basically i i want en for myself for your saying those is that the sixteen year old you would be crunching an your thirty year old i think just as your thirty year old version is crunching at the sixteen din that is very true ye he would be very very disgusted if he heard the this race for peace it would seem i had settled in a pathetic we added davidson these days the staff rider for r a i when we were angels the story originally came to us from a graduate student henry frank was studying drawing it the new york academy of and and she mailed our radio show a story that she wanted to get on to the programming what she had done is that she had recorded the interviews using her little microcasette answering machine and then to ended the quotes that she had gotten what she would do is that she would record by dubbing and recording on to her shiny red boombox it was crude yes but the story sounded remarkably a story from the samaritan life now for one reason another in time considerations that unsolicited story never made on to the radio for this week shall however we had her put together another story using that same style which we added music to here the radio station to make it fully sound story on our shell it de story about an incident that happened to her back when she was an undergraduate tot's university is a pretty straight place entertainment for most people means fraternity daggers it is not the sort of place you oud expect people to watch a guy

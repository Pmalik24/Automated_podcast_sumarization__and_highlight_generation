the grounds the a of my house o thin gowns the er i arrived in hoisingten about two weeks after the tornado and plena took me on a tor everything as normal on the side there you cannot even tell anything ever happened most actions of the town was still perfect there were people on forces and shiny party balloons tied to man boxes then we crossed over a lot of the westlihdt had already been bolos not was just stir and basement and house parts some ones front steps or a kitchen cut away a room in a doll house and of course this is canvas the main street in town as a red brick road lots of

ledge very prom the night that actually did change their lives i mean is i went to prom i soft morinjuerears and it was a dance it was a prom it was nice it was fine to get all dressed sup but it was the prom that take lesson was it just it became our cars and clothes and worst important and family an friends and it taught it a big lesson about human to i fakes everybody there everybody could had e new perspective of life walking out of that prom i you moment a whole different world oh just have for when actually outside i side tolly post people are in the basements stuff fallen down houses are gone no people are actually lost stuff and we are in the prom still ransom when the tornado hadron after a hands were still just just free of everything s still having a good time it is tolly

an iron o just we us an jo got married of by beg wo ton an on an on ton n on can on coming out of eve ben juniors in high school since the year nineteen eighty two when they say and this is a direct quote we have been dreaming about prominent for years they lend that is in a minute from c cogoboblagradio when our programmed continues this this a meriting life from our glass he yo ten a program of course we chose some theme bring your a variety of different kinds of stories on that theme to days program at the very end of prompseason stories about the prom we arrived the at two of our programmed at two save the last ante for me again pretty and bank and carry a back the future the cosy kids buffoon too many other movies in heave shows to name they all eventually and up at the prom but why why the prom why is it om the present well for answers we turn two franseen pascal who has written or invented the plot lines for seven hundred books in the sweet valley high series which of course is the adventures of elizabeth and cystic week field twins and well seemingly permanent high school juniors she spoke to s from our home in france well i have to gay that the prom it probably the coin think o glory of high school it the moment the come to to the romantic edition of life i think it it it repeated again only one other time and that would be marriage i mean it it tat important in in the his school life in the teanatur life in that are life before a do that you you think as in a traditional a drama where where you were you would want the characters to end up in marriage if your writing about than ages all you have got is the prom hit tat e bout it that rite and to of the even hundred book call i probably from i mention did it we five hundred of them but i would pay the probably a made your go in o thirty thirty five you you mean thirty five or books actually take place at the prom there an actual prom in them and very ta prom a the lot go or a very important part of the plot i can give you the idea of it ta it the can in a reckon book ah i did a plot about to who up going o by the king and queen of the prom and there would fend rigging the election and it hen i jut to give you an idea a pot on no getting a at for the prom nobody who had no date for the prom the roommate for the from the today to for that life for the prom and i know do it a pot about the poor girl a brother had to take her main that permanent prom and et a the over thing with i the money for the prom drat an did the one about you think you could afoul but at me one ell at every i mean when you are when you are invoker i many plot es i am ah they they begin to fall into for categories and things the tat plot though tho what plod bet waiter a waiter bet plot or the pledge plot ah where a you the boy have to girl on a bet to go to the prom or to iritis ye have a the we popular girl in in the class to go to the prom and then show find out and then he really want to go with her but it to like i furious in that to take the who book fettle dell it seems one of the common prom plots is tat the prom forces a choice between potential dates and often it will be the good looking unattainable boy or girl is one possibility and the smart funny best friend is the other possibility exactly exactly of you that sort of thing et do not for i to perfect to beta though the people are not going to be living for their o the live an not legally narriterything but they do have to make that first important choice of the person they are going to end that moment evening with the and if if some of to many marriage kind of choice in book number one forty two in the sweet belly series of a strain called the big night you have not one not to not three but four characters who went up switching their dates at the prom and one girl tries to kill her date e the o it at the ye that mut been a ye a thriller the a court cording tries to push tod off of the off of a boat riling into into the water and elizabeth is in a speed but following ye yet it yet o i tat u to variation on a theme that all you have to do something lightly different with them a when you are no hundred and forty listening to you talk about this it seems what the prom a does and what it gives you as a writer is it gives you a natural om arena where there can be a conflict over love and an am om and without the prom you would have to invent some situation which would feel it has waive were the promptest has the wat exactly because the prom is it e natural it comes filled with all kinds of emotion just the mention of the prom you do not have to create something and build it up and give it terribly important you do not have to do any of tho thing did you got to prom yourself i never went to my own prom i do not interested strangely enough i i did not his cool very much at all it funny that i handed up writing much about it and what did you think of prom i really whet not interest i i i felt that i was to mitigated and mature for that fort of ta and i i isn't a i never i never really participated beyond writing feature for the political candy they can be on a newspaper that what i but beyond that i didn't have an in you never care to go to the province of you now somehow fates put you in a situation where you had to re visited of e thirty i times it ye my punishment tat i it if different that i do not have to show up there the charming friend sin pascal creator of sweet valley hid we r yea gree death and boxes that's go to the prom want you and me back nine to ninety

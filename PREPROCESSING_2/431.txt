welcome to the hubermanlao science science pace to i may drhubermen and o professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are discussing aggression ism going to explain to you that therefore several different types of aggression for instance reactive aggression verses protect of aggression meaning sometimes people will be aggressive because they feel threatened or they are protecting those that they love who also feel threaten there's also protect give aggression were people go out of their way to deliberately try in harm others and there is indirect aggression which is aggression not involving physical violence for instance shaming people and things of that sort it turns out that their different biological mechanisms underlying each of the different types of aggression and to day i will define those for you it'll talk about the naval circuits in the brain and body that mediate each of the different kinds of aggression talk about some of the hormones and peptides and no transmitters involved i promise to make it all accessible to you even if you do not have any biology or science background i also discussed tools psychological tools and biological tools that one can use to better control aggression now right here at the outset i want to acknowledge that any discussion about aggression has to have an element of context within it to be fair human beings invest a lot of money a lot of time and a lot of energy and indeed can even drive pleasure from aggression later all talk about marry circuits in the brain and body that reenforce in other words reward through the release of chemicals that make people feel good acts of aggression however what ism mainly referring to is the contacts in which human beings will pay money in order to derive what we call vicarious aggression put it simply people spend an enormous amount of money and time and energy watching other people engage in for instance aggressive sports and we know that observing your teem winning over another teem causes the release of narrow chemicals in your brain and body that make you feel good and yes that can make you feel more aggressive we also know of course that most governments in vest many billions if not trilling of doers in inform structure technologies and human beings in order to engage in aggression if needed called military warfare et camera to day's discussion will include a description of aggression in the pathological sense while actually talk about an explosive aggressive disorder that most of you probably have not heard of but is cha far more common than perhaps you know we will talk about the roll of things attention defies hyperactivity disorder and how that can relate to aggression through the relationship between impulsivity and aggression and we will talk about verbal aggression physical aggression proactive aggression as mention before and react of aggression ism certain t at by the end of the episode you will come away with the much more thorough understanding of what this thing that we call aggression really is and when you see it in other people i think it will make more since to you and when you observe it in yourself or the impulse to engage in aggression verbal or physical or otherwise i hope that you will understand it better as we've and of course the tools that i will describe should allow you to modulate and control aggressive tendencies or predispositions to aggressiveness and just generally to be able to engage with people in a more adaptive way over all before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate for my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of today's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice a day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they will give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d the k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic grenstoc come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar give talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration end electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues in organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the properties all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength in all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is elements dream slash supermen and you will get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element elements dream slash supermen let us talk about aggression i think that many people out there are put off by aggression although others are drawn to aggression both in themselves and when observing it in others the reason to talk about aggression is that as mention before the context of aggression really matters there re instances where aggression is adaptive for instance a mother protecting her children if she is being attacked or f for children are being threatened i think most people would agree that called maternal aggression of that sort provided the contexts right is great thing protecting are young is after all one of the primary adaptive drives of our species and think goodness it is of course other forms of aggression unprovoked protect of aggression somebody simply being violent to somebody else even when unprovoked most of us cringe when we see that con of behavior it can even evoke aggression in people when they observe that kind of behavior again context really matters but a more general and perhaps an even more important reason to think about and understand aggression is that by understanding the biology and psychology of aggression you will be in a much better position to understand how all emotional states come to be both in yourself and in others for instance many of you have probably heard the statement that i believe arises from pop psychology not from formal academic psychology that aggression is just sadness it is a form of sadness that is amplified and it shows up as aggression but when we look at the underlying biology and the pure review literature on this nothing can be further from the truth we have distinct circuits in the brain for aggression verses grief and mourning those are nonoverlapping now that does not mean that you cannot be sad an aggressive or in a state of mourning an aggressive at the same time but the idea that sadness and aggression are one an the same thing is simply not true and by understanding that or perhaps by understanding that irritability and aggression are not the same thing you willie in a much better position to apply some of the tools that we will talk about in this episode in order to be able to reduce or eliminate or if it is adaptive to you to modulate aggression and yes there are cases where modulating your aggression in some cases even amplifying aggression can be adaptive now this of course is not the first discussion about the biology of aggression where the psychology of aggression and we really can look to the beginning of the last century as the time in which the formal study of aggression really began one of the names that is most associated with the formal study of aggression is none other than coward lore's some of you may be familiar with that name others of you may not be familiar with that name coward lore's studied called imprinting behaviors and fixed action pattern behaviors he is most famous at least in scientific circles for getting geese to believe that he was their parent and if he were to put into gigolo coward with a cay lore's just as it sounds comrade legend geese you gong to see a lot of photos of coward walking down roads with a lot of geese following him ore swimming in lakes with a lot of geese following him he et a habit of geese adopting him because of the behaviors that he partook in he would swim out on a lake in front of a bunch low geese and then they would think that he was the parent and thy would imprint on him even lived with these animals and they lived with him to a strange character from what i hear but none the less all this work was deserving a of a bell prize because what he discovered were fixed action patters that is patterns of behavior that could be evoked by a single stimulus a this is really important the idea that you can get a whole category of behaviors swimming behind a parent or looking to somebody for comfort and only them the idea that that you could get a huge category of different behaviors in a bunch of different contacts triggered by just the presence of that person is remarkable because what it suggested and what turns out to be true is that there are nerd circuits not just individual brain is but collections of brainier is that work together to engage a pattern of behaviors and that is the first fundamental principle that we need to define to day that when we talk about aggression we are talking about activation of nerd circuits not individual brain is but nerd circuits that get played out in sequence he's on a piano but that playing out in sequence means that aggression is a verb has a beginning a middle an an end and it is a process it is not an event and as you will see that turns out to be very important in terms of thinking about how one can halt aggression prevent it from happening before it is initiated or be even prolonging aggression if that is what is needed now coward here's had no real knowledge of nerd circuits i mean obviously he knew there was is thing that we call a brain and nervous system and he knew that there were chemicals in the brain and hormones and things of that sort that were likely to play a role but he really did not take any measures to define wat the nerd circuits were frankly did not need to be that is noble prize and he did all this beautiful work his known for an abundance of work but he did think about what sorts of underlying processes could drive something aggression and he talked about one particular feature that is especially important and that is this notion of oppressive the idea that yes certain hormones will bias somebody or an animal to be aggressive certain a transmitter states and you learn what those are to day will buy a somebody to be more or less aggressive maybe even submissive and passive may be outright proactively aggressive towards any one ore anything in front of them and yes of course there will be historical features based on their childhood et camera et camera he understood that there will be a constellation of things that would drive people to be aggressive and he described o called pressure almost a hydraulic pressure just thing about fluid pressure in a small container been push push push until the can or the container is ready to explode and how multiple features multiple variables could impinge on that and create that pressure it turns out that is exactly the way that system works there is no single brain area that flips the switch for aggression although we will soon talk about a brain structure that generally houses the propensity and the output of aggression this notion of a hydraulic pressure that can drive us toward aggressive behavior or conversely can be very low pressure and keep us in a state of non reactivity may be even passivity or submissiveness is a very important feature because it really captures the essence of owner circuits work when were talk about primitive behaviors generally and you can start to notice this in yourself and in others you can start to notice when you are veering toward aggression or when someone is veering toward aggression verbal or physical now that veering is the build up of this hydraulic pressure that parents was referring to and it really does have an underlying biological basis now it was some years later that the first experiments came along which really tarted to identify the brain areas and the biological called pressures that can induce aggressive behavior and the person that really gets credit for this is he guide by the name of water cats who at that time was working on cats and i know that when say working on cats a lot of people cringe a look people have cats as pats and certainly cats can be delightful some people them more r some people them less most people cringe at the idea of l doing experiments on cats i you should say that these days very few laboratories work on cats most laboratories that work on animal models will work on flies trosopholo fruitflies for their capacity do genetics on laboratory mice sometimes rats but usually mice and occasionally you will find a lab that still works on cats back in the time of hats very few laboratories worked on mice most laboratories worked on cats or rats and the reason for that is nowadays most laboratories use mice if they use animal models because of the genetic tools that exist in mice to knock out this general knock in this gene et camera which cannot be done in humans or non human privates at least not very easily at this point in history when i say he was working on cats and realize that proudly evokesome negative emotions in some of you maybe even aggression in some of you what we can do however is look at the data and make use of the data in terms of our understanding what he's did was he had cats that were awake and he was able to lower stimulating electrode into the brain now keep in mind that the brain does not have any pain censors after a small hole is made in the skull electrodes lowered into the brain this is what is done commonly in human narrow surgery and he was able to stimulate different brain areas and he was sort of poking around and when i say sort of he was doing this with some logical intent and purpose he was not just poking round in there for fun he was trying to identify brain regions that could generate entire categories one behavior allay lore's wright these fixed action pattern behaviors eventually his electrode landed in a sight and he provided electrical stimulation to the cat that cause this otherwise passive purring relaxing cat to suddenly go into an absolute rage arched back hissing hair up called pilot erection where the hairs go up animals try to make themselves as big as possible often when they a aggressive grueling maybe even spitting believe or not cats and other animals can do this and the cat tried to attack him in any one else and anything else even inanimate objects when he stimulate this particular brain area he's obviously took notice of this incredible transformation and behavior and the fact that when he turned off the stimulation of this particular brain area the cat very quickly within seconds when back to being passive calm kitty now of course he repeated this experiment in other animals because he had to confirm that it was not just cabin stands the there was not something unique about this one cat that perhaps ah he had stimulated in area that had been built up during the kittenhood of this a of this cat and had been reactivated maybe this kitten had been aromatized early in life or scared and a reactivation of a particular circuit unique to that cat a created this aggressive behavior that was not the case every cat that he looked at and stimulate this particular brain area the cat would immediately go into an aggressive most rage type behavior n of course we cannot enter pyromorphite we do not know what the cat was feeling for all we know the cat could be happily the that seems pretty unlikely and later experiments done in mice but also in humans confirm that indeed stimulation of this brain area evoked not just behavioral aggression but also subjective feelings of aggression and anger what was this incredible brain area or rather i should say what is the brain area that harbored this incredible capacity to generate aggressive behavior in chess's experiments well for those of you that a regular listeners of this podcast you will probably be relieved to know that today we are going to talk about some new neural circuits oftentimes we will center back on the a eidola or the prefrontal quarter and those names will come up and for those of you that have not heard them before do not worry i make it clear as to what those granaries are in what they do but to day we are gin to talk along about the called v m h or ventromedial hypothalamus the ventrimediohypothalemus is a nucleus meaning a small collection of neurons what are neurons nerve cells and that small collection of neurons that we call the ventrimedial hypothalamus is truly small its only about one thousand five hundred neurons on one side your brain and a matching one thousand five hundred neurons on the other side of your brain and that combine three thousand neurons or not exactly three thousand but three thousand neurons or is sufficient degenerate aggressive behavior of the sort that he's observed in the cat and believe it are not when you see somebody who in the act of rage or an act of verbal aggression or in an act of defensive aggression protecting their family or loved on or country et camera almost certainly those neurons are engaged in that behavior those neurons are perhaps even generating that behavior and next ill describes some experiments that were done just recently within the last ten years or but leading right up until this year and even last month that keep confirming again and again and again that it is the activity of neurons in the ventrimedio hypothalamus that are both necessary and sufficient degenerate the full catalogue of aggressive behaviors now before i go further to describe the beautiful recent studies on the am oh the ventrimediohypothalmus and the important role of testosterone and more importantly estrogen in the activation of aggressive behavior that is right that is soon to be clear to you why that is the case one emphasize that the ventramedio hypothalamus is something that we should all care about why well it turns out that many categories of psychic psychiatric disorders development a disorders and psychological challenges things schizophrenia pits postromatic stress disorder depression borderline personality of disorder and even certain forms of autism can include elements of aggression and even moments now is certainly not the case that aggression and moments are present in all people who suffer from schizophrenia repetiastior depression or autism or borderline personality disorder absolutely not saying that however it can be a feature of those and it is a well described feature in terms of trying to understand the constellation of challenges that people suffer from when they have those thinking about the am h goes way beyond just understanding basic aggression in the contact of adaptive aggression when earlier i use the example maternal aggression that is one adaptive form of aggression it also can be pathologic aggression mean can harm ourselves or others keep this in mine as we go for because later we are going to talk about specific tools designed to modulate or prevent aggression in for instance people with attention definite hyper activity disorder and especially kids with eighty it in the meantime let us return to the bimah this relatively small collection of neurons thereresn i say relatively small as well your brain has many hundreds of billions of neurons made even trillions of neurons e exact number of neurons is in really clear but its a lot and it certainly as a lot relative to the number of neurons this three thousand or neurons living in your hypothalamus that can evoke this aggressive response experiments done by avid andiron's lav at called were really the first to parse the fine circuitry and to really show that the ventrimedia hypothalamus is both necessary and sufficient for aggressive behavior these are important experiments in their worth knowing about what they did was they identified first of all where the ventrimedia hypothalamus was in the mouse that was pretty straight forward to do a sort of known before they start these experiments and then they analyzed which genes meaning which liana which of course becomes area and area becomes proline which data and therefore which prolines are expressed in particular cells of the ventrimedial hypothalamus and it turns out that there is a particular category of neurons in the ventrimedia hypothalamus that make an estrogen receptor and it is those neurons in particular that are responsible for generating aggressive behavior how did they know this well they used the tool that is actually ben described by a previous guest of this podcast we had an episode with the psychiatrist and bioengineer and mycolliat stamford school medicine carl dyceroth he and others have develop tools that allow people to control the activity of neurons essentially by remote control by shining light on those neuron in the contact of an experiment on a mouse which is what avid slap did and these were the beautiful experiments of dale in who now in her own laboratory at new york university put a little fibrotic cable down into the brain of the hit into the hypothalamus that is of the mouse the mouse's able to move around in its cage freely moving even that i has a little tether this little wires a very thin wire and that little thin wires actualalue what we call outrode and the experimentalists in this case dale was able to stimulate the turning on of a little bit of blue light and that blue light activated only those estrogen receptor neuron in only the ventrimedial hypothalamus and the a she was able do that is y it introduced a gene that had been devest by our friend carldiserot that a louse light to trigger electrical activity males anurous if any of that is confusing or if all of that is confusing hearts the experiment there is a mouse in a cage as a little wire coming out of its head it does not notice believe it or not we know this cause it is still eating and mating and doing all the things that mice to do on daily basis and sleeping et camera and the mere pressing of a button will activate a little bit of light released at the end of that wire that light activates particular none in this case it is the estrogen receptor containing herons in only the ventrimediae hypothalamus when that mouse is in a cage with another mouse a couple of things happen depending on what the other mouse is or we could say who the other mouse's if it is a male mouse and you put in there with a female mouse the male mouse will attempt to mate with the female mouse provided that the male mouse as gone through purity he will try to mount and mate with the female mouse now female mice are either in a receptivephase or a non receptive phase of their called extra cycle they do not have a menstrual twenty eight day cycle they have an extra cycle and on particular days of that estracycle they are not happy to mate they will basically keep their hind quarters away from the male mouse at all posse they will even attack the male mouse on certain days of the estracycle however the female mouse will undergo what is called lord doses which is an arching of her back and she will allow the male to mount and mate with her a large number of experiments were done but the first experiment really was to put the male mouse and with a female mouse whose in the called receptive phase of extras that is she will allow mating and he starts mating with her and they go through the standard repotoir of meeting behaviors that you observe in mice mounting thrusting intromission as it is called in the mouse sex world i i guys i soft in what the mice call up ut that is what the experimenters call it and then afterwards that he will dispose k they observe this kind of mounting and and sex behavior is very typical but about half way through the behavior did turned on the light to stimulate these estrogen receptor contained herons only in the male mouse and what she observed was incredibly dramatic the male mouse ceases from thing to mate with the female mouse and immediately tries to kill the female mouse e starts attacking her then she turns off the light the male stops and goes back to try to mate with the female mouse ism sure all this was very confusing and disturbing to the female mouse none the less that was the reporter they would mate to stimulate these ventrimedial hypothalamus neurons the male mouse would immediately try and attack and kill the female mouse and then she would stop the stimulation and he would stop trying to attack and kill the female mouse return to the attempt at least to mate with the female mouse these are such dramatic shifts in behavior triggered only by the activation of only this small set of anurans within the ventramedial hypothalamus and for those of you that think that you can watch the sort of thing without being disturbed i encourage you to go to out a we will provide a link a where you can see avidin of this type of behavior it is incredibly dramatic the shifting behavior is almost instantaneous curs within seconds if not mile seconds thousandth of a second the next experiment that she did was to put a male mouse with this stimulation with capability in its ventramedia hypothalamus into a cage alone but with a rubber glove filled with air or water mouse s walking around sniffing being which is what male mice seem to do they seem to during everywhere assuchally an interesting perhaps interesting feature of male mice and aching many male animals perhaps even humans we do not know or may we do know easily a this been observed time and time again in a experiments mainly by leasestowers lab at the scripts institute as characterize this f you put female mice into an arena or cage they always up inmate in a very small corner of that cage rest if he put male mice into an arena or a cage the are in everywhere they have this him of session with spraying their earn everywhere you can name sort of transpose that to human behavior if you in any event a you put the more in the cage alone but with this rubber glove the mouse is walking around urinating et camera doing whatever is that my do then she stimulates the activation of these ventramedia hypothalamus neurons and the mouse immediately tries to kill the glove it goes into a rage attacking the glove as if it were another mouse or some other animate object but of course it is an inanimate object is just a rubber glove she stops the stimulation and the mouse immediately goes back to being completely calm or at least not attacking again we do not know what the mouse was feeling these are very dramatic videos again you can see them by following the link that will provide in the caption if that sort of thing is going to disturb you by a to see for instance the attack a one mouse attacking another please just do not watch them ism not interesting of aromatizing anybody or you aromatizing yourself that is a number of different variations were done on this experiment for instance stimulating the velate in female mice as opposed a male mice putting the female mice in with other female mice or with other male mice no matter what variation one carries out does it matter fits male with female male with male female with female et camera stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus in a male mouse or female mouse evokes this very dramatic almost instantaneous aggressive behavior physically aggressive behavior subsequent experiments done by darling an her own laboratory and other laboratories have shown that the ventramedia hypothalamus is connected with a bunch of other granary s that are interesting and it'll talk about some of those in a little bit but one of them that i want to call out now is the call p a g the periacuodoctal gray nucleus this is a large structure in the back of the brain that houses things anurans that can create spirits we all know of the opioid crisis with these a neurons that can produce in doings men made by the body chemicals that can cause pain relief you could understand why that might occur in a circuit for aggression might even if one is the aggressor it is likely that they may incur some physical damage and they d want some pain relief the p a g also is connected to a number of nerd circuits that eventually through several processing stations stations souse me arrive at things the jaws and in fact stimulation of the veniremen o hypothalamus can evoke biting and aggressive biting behavior now aggressive biting behavior is particularly interesting because inhuman in a specially human children biting is something that while young children might do as a form of aggression tends to disappear pretty early in childhood and if it does not it is often seen as a mark of pathology i have a story about this she when i was a kid i went to a summer sports camp and i it'll never forget this of we are playing soccer and am in it in a rare stroke of luck or accident i happened a score goal i was not a particularly good socraplayer saucily not at that stage if my life they later figured out that it was just better to make me a full back cause i could distant there and do what full backs do as better at taking the ball or the person out than i was putting the ball in am the goal none the less i again by chance i cortical and i was trotting back to my side of the field and all a sudden i felt the sting in my back a kid not to be named though do remember your name it'll not in tell you his name was a kid jumped on my back and bit me on the top of my back and this of course resulted in a discussion an a a time out and all the usual things and parents i think od involved i do not recall inching much else of it but i recall that this was considered especially troubling behavior because he bit me as opposed to hit me or shoved me down or something that sort and it does seem as if the tendency to use biting as an aggressive behavior is associated with a more primitive circuitry now here ism truly enthropromorphisi i soft know with this other kid happen to be thinking or feeling at the time how could i and i certainly am not going to say that biting in every case reflects a pathology although i think there is general agreement in the psychology community in the psychiatric community that pass a certain age the using of one's teeth to impart aggress aggression and damage on others is at particularly primitive and troubling release for the observer the person experiences a pretty disturbing event dad's lab has shown n that activation of the ventromedio hypothalamus triggers a down stream circuit in the periaqueductal gray which then triggers a whole other set of circuits of fixed action patterns here we are back tolarens against with fixed action patterns including swinging of the limbs right punching this would not necessarily be controlled punching but also biting behavior it is remarkable to me at least that we have circuits in our brain that can evoke violent use of things our mouth or violent use of things our limbs that of course could be used for things singing or kissing or eating or you do not gesticulating in any kind of polite or in polite way the point here is that neural circuits not individual brain areas evoke the constellation of behaviors that we call aggression now many of view are probably puzzled or at least should be because give been talking about this highly specialized brain area the ventramedio hypothalamus and this highly specialize subcategory of neurons in the ventrimedio hypothalamus these earns that make estrogen receptor and yet the activation of those cells triggers dramatic and immediate aggression both in males and in females and both against males and against females what is going on here most of us think about estrogen and we do not immediately think of aggression most of us here testosterone and we might think about aggression although other things as well in order to understand this i just one o briefly refer back to a conversation that i had on a previous episode of the hubris podcast and that was with mint colleague the great robots sopolski of course is a professor stamper do studied testosterone and its impacts on behavior as well as estrogen and other hormones an their impacts on behavior to make a long story short and to dispel a still unfortunately very common myth testosterone does not increase aggressiveness testosterone increases proactivity and the willingness to lean into effort uncompetitive scenarios sometimes this is referred to us that challenge hypothesis but to make a long story short if people are given testosterone or if you look at people who have different lever levels souse me of testosterone endogenously that they naturally make what you will find is that testosterone tends to increase competitiveness but locust in aggressive scenarios if somebody is already aggressive giving them testosterone will have the tendency to make them more aggressive if somebody however is very benevolent and altruistic giving them testosterone will make them more benevolent and altruistic it least up to a point now of course there are certain forms of synthetic testosterone that are known in sport circles and another circles to increase aggressiveness because of the way those particular forms of synthetic testostr one's work but in general most of the experiments that are rearing to have not been done using those they've been done using the let's call them the more traditional biological forms of testosterone that resemble biological forms of testosterone in fact robot supulsyo describe to really interesting experiment in which if you look at testosterone levels or you administer additional testosterone to people who are doing philanthropy giving money to organizations and the are sensually doing good because these are organizations doing good what you find is that increase testosterone or further increasing testosterone makes people more willing to compete to give more money than the other person in the from in order a t to put it in er quotes to alpha out the other person by giving more money this is an act of altruistic or benevolent philanthropy it is not act of aggression of course we do not what the people are feeling underneath all that again we cannot enter promoriphies or a projection tother people wat their feeling but the point is that testosterone itself does not make people more aggressive and in the experiment that we have ben talking out up until now it is actually the activation of estrogen receptor containing neurons that makes these animals more aggressive and it turns out there is evidence that in certain contacts estrogen can make people more aggressive what is going on here well what is going on is that testosterone can be converted into estrogen through a process called a romanization there's an engine called a romatastes any time you have word that ends in a s e t least if fits in the context to biology it is almost always not always but almost always and engine the aromatastes engine converts testosterone into estrogen and it is actually testosterone aromatized converted into estrogen and then binding to these estrogen containing neurons in the ventromedio hypothalamus that triggers aggression i when repeat that it is not testosterone itself that triggers aggression it is testosterone a aromatized into estrogen within the brain and binding to these estrogen receptor containing irons in the ventromedio hypothalamus that evokes aggression and dramatic aggression at that now this effect of estrogen causing aggression in the brain is very robot much that if you take a sauce that lacks the aromatizes engine or a human that lacks the arromatase engine and they do exist then there is a reduction in over all aggression despite high levels of testosterone and if people who or mice who have the arromatases engine have that enzyme blocked well then it does not matter how much you increase testosterone or any of its other derivatives you do not observe this aggression this runs counter to everything that we know and think about the role of testosterone again testosterone increases competitiveness it can increase the desire to work under challenge have said it before and i ran these or pressure tested this of against robot sopolski who is been working on testosterone and its roll in the brain and behavior for many decades now it is fair to say that testosterone has the net effect of making effort feel good or at least increasing the threshold at which effort feels bad or unsustainable and it does that by way of changing the activity or the threshold for activation of brain structures the imigdula and other brain structures associated with anxiety the nexttime somebody says testosterone makes people aggressive you can say ah no actually its estrogen that makes people aggressive and animals aggressive for that matter now of course it is the case that because males have relatively less estrogen circulating in their brain and body than females right because they testes not ovaries that testaostron is required in the first place in order to be converted into estrogen to activate this aggressive circuit involving these estrogen receptor containing neurons in the ventrimediohypothalemis but none the less it is estrogen that is the final step it is the hormone on which aggression hinges and i think for most people that is a quite surprising finding and yet this is perhaps one of the more robust findings in both the animal and human literature as it relates to hormones and psychological states and behavior now of course it is the case that if testosterone is low that a person or an animal will exhibit less aggressive behavior but that is not because of reduced testosterone jersey it is because of the subsequent reduction in testosterone meaning if there is no testosterone to aromatize into estrogen estrogen will also be lower we have established that it is not testosterone but testosterone converted into estrogen that activates these circuits for aggression but none the less it is still surprising right i mean most of us do not think about at estrogen as the hormone that stimulates aggression bit turns out it is all contextual there are beautiful data showing that weather r not estrogen stimulates aggression can be powerfully modulated by weather or not days are short or days are long in other words wether or not there is a lot of sunshine or not now obviously brain is in cased in skull it does not really know if there is a lot of sunshine out there even though you can see the sun with your eyes you can feel it on your skin daylength is converted into hormonal signals and chemical signals and the primary hormonal chemical signals involve melatonin and dopamine and also the streshormons to to make a very long story short in the long days where we get a lot of sunlight both in our eyes and on our skin melatonin levels are reduced megaton is a hormone that tends to douce states of sleepiness and quiescence it also tends to activate pathways that tend to reduce a things breeding and sexual behavior in long days dooming is increased dooming is a molecule associate with feelings of well being and motivation and the desire to seek out all sorts of things all sorts of motivated behaviors and in long days provided we are getting enough sunlight on our skin and to our eyes the stress hormones especially cortical and some of the other stresshormons are reduced in levels if estrogen levels are increased experimentally under long day conditions it does not evoke aggression however in short days if estrogen is increased there is a heighten predisposition for aggression and that makes perfect sense if you think about what short days due to the biology of your brain and body in short days the megaton and signal goes up there is more milestone in circulating for more of each twenty four hour cycle stresshormones are circulating more why short days tend to be associated with winter in winter we are bombarded with more bacteria viruses because bacteria viruses actually survive better in cold than they do in heat in fact tin my laboratory we work with a lot of irises and bacteria when we want to keep them alive we put them in the freezer if we want to kill them if we want to inoculate them we put them under u i light you course from the sunlight shorter days are conducive to aggression not because days are short per a but because stresshormon levels are higher and because dooming levels are lower now here is where all this starts converge on a very clear biological picture a very clear psychological picture and indeed a very clear set of tools that we can think about and use under conditions where cortical is high where this stress hormone is elevated end under conditions where the neuromogulator ceratonan is reduced there is a greater propensity for estrogen to trigger aggression now again i know give sad it before but for males who make a lot of testosterone relative to estrogen you have to swop in your mind this idea that if testosterone is high that means that estrogen is low because while that can be true in the periphery in the body if testosterone is high there is going to be sum a romanization that conversion of testosterone to estrogen anytime you here that testosterone is high you should think testosterone is high in the body in perhaps estrogen is low in the body but that means that there is going to be heighten levels of estrogen in the brain and therefore increase propensity for aggression in females who generally make less testosterone relative to estrogen there is sufficient estrogen already present to trigger aggression both males and females are primed for aggression but that is riding sonic context and that context of whether not you get a tendency for aggression or not depends on whether not cortical is high or low and ism telling you that if cortical is relatively higher in any individual there is going to be a tilt and increase in that hydraulic pressure that lore's talked about toward aggression and if certonan the demodulator there is associated with feelings of well being and sometimes even of slight passivity but certainly of well being if ceretonan is low there is also cant be a further shift towards an aggressive tendency if we return to lozenges hydraulic pressure model of aggression and other internal states we realize that external stimuli things that we hear things that we see for instance some one saying something upsetting or a seeing somebody do something that we do not to others or to us as well as our internal state or subjective feelings of well being but also our stress level our feelings of whether not we have enough resources and are content with what we have all of that is converging on this thing that we call internal state and creating this pressure of either to be more aggressive or less aggressive and now we have some major players feeding into that final pathway that question of whether not will we hit the other person will we say the thing that is considered aggressive will we not say it if somebody says some thing or does something aggressive to us will we respond or will we be submissive or even passive again there many things funding in to that question and dictating whether not the answer is absolutely all fight back or ism going attack them even unprovoked or if they say this ism going to do that or no matter what they do ism not going to respond these kinds of things are very complex and yet we really can boil them down to just a few common elements and ism telling you that those elements are whether not cortical levels are relatively lower or relatively higher again relatively higher is going to tend to make people more reactive why because reactivity is really a function of the autonomic nervous system which a sort of a sea saw that oscillates between called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous sister which tends to put us into a state of readiness through the release of a adrenaline cortical and adrenaline when the circulating the brain embody make us more likely to move and to react and to speak is shall what will induce a kind of low level tremor which is an anticipatory tremor to be able to move more quickly right a body in motion is more easily set into further motion that is and the nurmodulator ceratonan is a demodulator that in general is associated with feelings of well being in response to what we already have when we are well fed ceratonantends to be released in our brain nobody in particular welled with carbohydrates the precursor to ceratonan is trip tolan and indeed there are i we studies exploring the types of diets nutritional programs that can reduce aggressive behavior both in children and in adults an trip down rich diets or supplementation with trip to pan for trip than rich diets things white turkey meat but then there also a number of carbohydrates you can look up its very easy to find foods that contain lots of trip toward those foods contain the precursor to ceratonan now it is not simply the case that eating more foods with trip topaz will tend to reduce your aggression as pose it could do that of you ate a it an abundance it could make youtired in the her less likely to be aggressive i do not recommend that strategy but the idea here is that when it is been explored increasing levels of trip topaz either by supplementation or by food or drugs prescription drugs that increase serotonins for ins its fluoxitine sometimes called prosacors aloft or any number the other essessarize tend to reduce aggressive behavior now not always but in general that is the case similarly because elevated cortical tends to shift the whole system again create more of a hydraulic pressure towards aggressive states if cortical levels are reduced well then the tendency for aggressive behavior is reduced this is supported by a number of pure reviewed studies will provide links to some of those in the caption show notes for can return to the a a bit later in the contacts of specific studies that give looked at genetic variance in different individuals that cause them to make more or less ceratonan or at least to metabolize creatine in differently this is also the case pore called intermittent explosive disorder that can often be associated with get variance that control how much ceratonan is made or how its metabolized or how much cortisols made and how much is metabolized in thinking about tools there a number of things that one could consider first of all the re number of decent studies exploring how supplementation with the megathere fatiacids which are precursors of some of the transmitter systems including ceratonan that can modulate not directly mediate but modulate mood and emotional tone supplementation with the megatheres has been shown to reduce impulsivity and aggressiveness in certain contacts in things eighty eight or in individuals who have a predisposition for aggressive type behavior or aggressive thinking now that does not necessarily mean that the omagathre fatiacids or going directly to the ventral yohypothalemus in changing the activity of anurans there more likely they are causing or modulating an overall shift in mood through the umiak system through hormone systems that are changing the overall tone are the propensity for it neurons an the ventral mediohypotalmus to be activated how much megathere fatiacid what source we have talked about this on the podcast before you can of course get megathere fatiacids from a number of different foods getting them from whole foods as probably the best way to do it but many people including people with depression will often supplement with one drama or more of omega three fadiacids per day some people including myself will take them every day as just a general mood and cancer i do not suffer from depression but have found it be beneficial for my health and some people do that and have talked about before how in double blind plica controlled studies people taking one to three grams of omagathree fadiasids pray typically in the form of a high quality ficioil though their other sources as well ally and forth can experience improvements in mood that are on par with some of the ecessorise to select a ceretonam retaken visitors and of course if you are prescribed in ecessorive by your pediatrist or other doctor please do take that and do not cease to take it just simply to take a megatheres however you might mention to them and you can find links to the studies in our previous episodes on depression that supplementation with yo mama three fadiacids of at this one gram or more of e p a specifically getting above that one gram threshold as highest three grams per day of the e p a has allowed people to take lower doses of excess arise and still keep their mood in a place that is beneficial for them and in terms of keeping cornball in arrange that is healthy and does not byasome one toward high levels of aggression and irritability that is again going to be set by a number of larger modulators ore contextual cues and have talked about some of those on the potcasspital just briefly recap them now overly getting sunlight in your eyes early in the day and as much sunlight as you safely can in your eyes throughout the day is going to be important again because of this effect of estrogen in long days not increasing aggression however in shorter days estrogen increases digression because of the increasing cartesall observed in short days another way to reduce cortical was discussed in our episode on heat in the use of sand and heat but also hot baths it turns out that hot baths and sand can be very beneficial for reducing cortical all the details on that a included in the episode on heat and its time stamp you can go directly to that if you on to learn about the temperatures in the various durations but to just give a a synopsis of that a twenty minute sand at anywhere from eighty to a hundred degrees sepsis is going to be beneficial for reducing cortical you do not have access to a sand you could do a hot bath a just the temperature s you do not burn yourself i think eighty to a hundred degree sepsis going to be too hot for any people of its a hot bath as many people who cannot tolerate that habit cantolerate the sands o safety first always and of course but hot baths reduce cortesall hosannas reduce cortesall of a duration about twenty a thirty minutes is going to be beneficial and of course some of you may be interested in exploring the supplementation proud and for reductions in cortical really the a chief player there is aschowaganda which is known to decrease cortical fairly potently i should just warn you the t if your going to use ashuagonda in order to reduce cortical first of all check with your doctor r health care provider before adding or subtracting anything from your supplementation or health regiment of course i do not you say that to protect us i say that to protect you you are responsible for your health what you take in what you do not take chronic supplementation with ashuagonda can have some not great effects of disruption of other hormone pathways and nor transmitter pathways the limit seems to be about two weeks of of regular use before you going to take a break of about two weeks ashwagonda again a very potent inhibiter of cortical but with some other affects as well do not use it chronically for longer than two weeks but if your goal is to reduce cortical let that your going through a period of increase the irritability and aggressive tendency may be your also not getting as much light as you would and perhaps also if there are other am circumstantial things leading towards more aggressiveness in your goal is to reduce aggressiveness that can be potentially helpful and in light of all the stuff about cortical and estrogen and daylength should mention that there are in fact some people who have a genetic predisposition to be more irritable and aggressive there couple of different gene pathways associated with this we never to think about just one gene causing a specific behavior the way to thing about genes is that genes generally code for things within our biology in the contexts of says discussion things normal circuits or the amounts of nauru transmitters that are made or the amounts of hormones that are made or the amount of narrow transmitter hormone receptors or enzymes at camera that shift the activity of our biology in a particular direction they bias our biology and in fact there is a genetic variant present in certain people that a just there estrogen receptor sensitivity and that estrogen receptor sensitivity can result and increase levels of aggression sometimes dramatic increases however and also very interestingly photo period meaning daylength is a strong modulator of weather not that aggressiveness turns up or not weather or not that person with the particular gene variant is more aggressive or not depends how long the day is and how long the night is one particular study that i that reference is this is trainer at all the title f study is photo period reverses the effects of estrogens on man aggression by a genomic and nongenomic pathways that was a paper publish in the proceedings in the national academy of sciences will put a reference to this in the shoots if you to explore it further but it really points to the fact that rarely sometimes but rarely is it the case that just one gene will cause somebody to be hyperaggressive almost always there is going to be an interplay between genetics an environment and as environment changes such as daylength changes and the length of night changes too will the tendency for people with a it given kinetic variant to be more aggressive or not now of course in the absence of detailed genetic testing for this particular estrogen receptors variant most people ism guessing you are policy not walking round knowing that you have this gene or not regardless i think it is important to pay attention to how you feel at different times of year depending on whether not summer whether not it is winter whether not your getting sufficient sunlight meaning viewing sufficient sunlight or not whether not your getting sufficient sunlight exposure to your skin or not whether not your indoors all the time generally those things correlate with season but not always you can go through long bouts of you hard work in the summer months when days are long but your indoors a lot and getting a lot of florescent light exposure late in the evening and perhaps that is when your feeling or aggressive we hate to be careful about drawing a one to one relationship between any biological feature and certainly psychological or behavioral feature aggressiveness but it is i believe helpful to know that these genetic biases exist how they play out again they shift our biology and in a general thematic direction they do not change one thing they change our variety of things that biases tired or away from certain psychological and behavioral outcomes and the various things that we can do in order to offset them we describe those earlier in terms of try to keep carters a you by getting sufficient sunlight regardless of time of year and regardless of whether not you happen to have this particular genetic variant early er i talked about how it is testosterone converted into estrogen that is activating aggression in the ventromedial hypothalamus not teststrne itself however there are some studies carried out in humans that if a valuated the effects of testosterone and how levels of testosterone correlate with aggressiveness in the short term just going to detail a few of those studies because i think they are interesting and important first of all there is a study that is explored levels of testosterone in men of different professions now before i tell you the data i want to be very clear here with a study such as this one never knows whether not these men when into a particular profession because they had a testosterone level of a given value or whether r not the work itself altered their testosterone levels or both and i think it is fair to assume that it is probably both be very careful in assuming that a given testosterone level is causal for choosing a particular career or that a particular career is causal for creating a particular testosterone level the study used salivary testosterone levels as the measure which to be fair is not the best way to measure testosterone typically blood draw would be the beltway to measure testostromebor none the less provided the appropriate methods are used salivary testosterone can be a reasonable measure of testosterone the different occupy signs that were looked at were and here they just looked at men in this particular study were ministers salesmen they did not say what particular types of salesmen firemen professors of all things physicians and animal players and what they discovered was that the testosterone levels were essentially in that order from low to highest minister salesmen firemen professor physician animal player now we could microdisect all the different stereotypes and all the different features of each of these jobs for instance we do not know whether or not the fact that the firemen happened at least in this study to have lower testosterone levels on average than the professors or the physicians was becasfiremen have lower testosterone levels or because they have a much more stressful job in the martial levels a higher then the professor of the physician and cortical and testosterone not always but generally are in somewhat an agonistic pushball a mode because they derive from the same precursor et camera typically when when cortical is high testostrontents be lower and vice verse we do not know what is causing these effects and again this is just one study and just six occupations but i think it is relatively interesting given the fact that each of these professions involves different levels of competitiveness right we do not necessarily just want to think about the level of physical exertion that is required but also level of competitiveness because it is known that competitive interactions can cause increases in testosterone in particular in the winners of competitive interactions a topic for a future podcast meanwhile studies that have analyzed also again salivary testosterone in prisoners in this case female prisoners these are incarcerated individuals have looked at levels of testosterone according to whether or not the person committed a non violent or of violent crime in order to arrive in prison and higher levels of salivary testosterone were related to those that had arrived in prison because of conviction of a violent crime as a post of nonviolent crime likewise when they analyzed prison rule violations an indirect measure of aggressiveness but in this case it was strongly associate with the aggressiveness because they knew it the violations were they found were for prisoners that had none no prison violations prison rule violations as to say their testosterone levels tended to be lower than the testosterone levels of women that had some even one were more aggressive violations of prison rules will provide links to these a studies in the shownotes if you to go into them further obviously studies this need to be taken with a grain of salt because there many different factors different prisons have different a degrees of a nounal violence to begin with and competitive to begin with but just as a final pass at examining the roll between testosterone and aggressiveness the was a very interesting study from got at all g o e t z publishing two thousand fourteen that looked at serum in this case blood levels of testosterone thirty minutes after application of a gel base testator on the ghost trains thermals that the testostr can go very quickly into the blood stream and then did brain imaging to evaluaigt the activity of neurons in the call cortical medial a ligula the tortoni the medialamigdula is one of the areas of the imigdula complex as we call it because its complex has got about different nuclei know what nuclei are lot clusters of neurons has got a lot of different ones but that medial and that corticomedio ligula in particular is known to be associated with aggressive type behaviors its linked up with is part of the larger circuit that includes the ventromedio hypothalamus another brainarias that we refer to earlier such is the p a g what what is remarkable about this studies that showed that just thirty minutes after application of this called angel this testosterone that seeps into the blood stream there was a significant increase in of course testosterone and corticorticomedial a ligula activation testosterone can have acute effects immediate effects on the pathways related to aggression and i think this is something that is not often discussed because many of the effects of steroid hormones testosterone estray are very slow acting in fact stored hormones because they have of certain big chemical composition can actually pass through the membranes of cells the outside of a cell and into the nucleus of the cell and change gene expression in the cell think about puberty that give that goes home for the summer than comes back looking completely different well that is because a lot of genes got turned on by steroid hormones testosterone and estrogen but the stored hormones can also have very fast acting effects and wit testosterone in particular those can be remarkably fast acting and one of the most apparent and well documented fast acting effects is this effect the ability to activate cells within the emigdula s ye might say well i thought the imigdula was associate with fear would not testosterone than cause fear no turns out that the immigdula harbors both cortical portico stern receptors and testosterone receptors and say each a just activity in the imigdula differently such that testosterone tends to activate a ligula circuitry for inducing states of mind and body that are more action base and indeed in animals and inhuman testosterone application and activation of this corticomedial ligula pathway will make animals an humans lean into effort this is whisky testosterone makes effort feel good at least biases the organism toward leaning into challenge if you recall there is not just one type of aggression there is react of aggression which is triggered when one is confronted with something that sometimes is inevitable right one needs to fight for the life or for somebody ease's life but also protect of aggression and proactive aggression involves activation of those go pathways in the basil ganglia and a leaning into effort to overcome whatever state on happens to be in to begin with and this is very important because it points to the fact that yes estrogen is activating aggression pathways that are in the ventral yohypothalmus but its very likely the case that testosterone is acting to accelerate or to bias states of mind in body board those that will lead to aggression again aggression is not a switch on and off its a process it has a beginning middle and an end remember that hydraulic pressure that coward parents hypothesized well think of testosterone as increasing the pressure board an aggressive episode and then estrogen actually triggering that aggressive episode in the ventrimedial hypothalamus if somebody tells you that testosterone indigenous or exogenous makes people aggressive tell them no testosterone tends to make people lean into effort and if that effort involves being aggressive either reactive aggressive or proactively aggressive well then it will indeed lead to aggression but the actual aggression itself is triggered by estrogen not testosterone now thus far we really have not talk too much about the social contact in which aggression occurs and that is because there is a near infinite if not infinite number a variables that will determine that for instance violent aggression is entirely appropriate at a professional boxing match provided its occurring inside the ring and only between the competitors and within the bounds of the rules of the sport et camera however there or some things that tend to bias certain social contacts toward being more aggressive or less aggressive and not always physical aggression and those generally come in two forms that many of you are familiar with which are alcohol and caffeine thus discuss coffin first we would coffin increase aggressive impulsivity well the general facts of caffeine are to increase autonomic arousal the activity of the called sympathetic arm of the autonomic nervous system which is to put it very much in plain language it is the alertness arm of your nervous system that is it creates a sense of readiness in your brain in body and it does by activating the called sympathetic chain ganglia again as i always remind people spa and sympathetic does not mean sympathy spa means to gather or all at once and coffin tends to bias are brain in body to active the sympathetic changangle which run from about the base of your neck unto the utopia pelvis and deploy a bunch of chemicals that jut out into the restore body activate adrenaline release there is a parallel increase in a do of a adrenalin in your brain creating the state of alertness and readiness that state of alertness and readiness can be for all sorts of things not just aggression however when we are in a state of increase sympathetic tone meaning more alert such as after drinking coffin we will buy us all those brain anybody systems that hormones the chemicals et camera that exist toward action is opposed to inaction put simply caffeine can increase impulsivity no surprise there on the opposite end of things alcohol tends to decrease activity in the sympathetic arm of the autonomic her system tends to make us feel less alert now initially it can create a state of alertness because of its affection inhibiting the forebrain our forebrain prefrontal quartets in particular has what is called top down inanition it exerts a inhibitory or a quieting effect on some of the circuits of the hypothalamus such as the ventromedial hypothalamus the way to conceptualize this is that your forebrain is able to rationalize and think clearly and to suppress behavior into engage the logo pathways telling you do not say that mean thing do not do that violent thing et camera alcohol initially tends to increase our level of overall activity by reducing inanition notorious in that forebrain circuit but in other circuits tends to make us more active we tend to talk more than we normally would move more than we normally would but very shortly thereafter starts acting as a sedative by way of reducing activity in the forebrain releasing some of the deeper brain circuits that are involved in impulsivity but also causing a somewhat serve of effect and then of course as call levels increase even further people eventually will pass out blackout et camera what we have got with aldol in coffin as we get two opposite ends of the spectrum caffeine increasing arousal and readiness and the tendency for impulsivity an alcohol also increasing impulsivity but through a different mechanism a really interesting study and i should just mention that the title of the study is culminated and non caffeinated alcohol use and indirect aggression the impact of self regulation the titles almost self explanatory sos a paper publish in the journal seductive behavior in twenty sixteen examining how ingestion of alcohol that is either culminated or non caffeinated alcohol drinks impacted what they call indirect aggression and just to remind you what indirect digression is these are not physical acts of aggression these are verbal acts of aggression embarrassing others or otherwise somehow trying to reduce the well being of others by saying certain things in particular in groups this study examined both males and females this was done on a by way of a college campus study subjects were eighteen to forty seven years old we there some older students on that campus or may be they use some nonstudnts but these days you have also got some students that are in the thirties an forties they have a fairly broad a swath of subjects included fairly broad racial background as well included not at equal numbers but a at least they included a pretty broad spectrum of people o different backgrounds they looked in particular people that invested none culminated alcohol drinks at a frequency of nine point one eight drinks per weak again this a college campus not that encourage that months people that if never really liked drugs are alcohol is or fortune in that way i can drink ore not drink and tend to not drink a but to me nine point et drink one eight drinks per week sounds a lot but i know for some people that that might actually be typical and then others who were drinking at least one culminated alcoholic beverage per weak and those individuals a and as high i should say as seven point eight seven castle named alcohol beverages per weak this would be energy drinks combine typical with hard alcohol that is fairly commonly available in bars and forth and some individuals drank as much as goodness twenty point three six alcoholic drinks per what total some that were culminated some that were not calfinaded the basic alcove of this study was that the more alcohol some one tended to consume the more likely it was that they would engage in these indirect aggressive the behaviors and in terms of the culminated alcoholic beverages there the effect was especially interesting here i am just going to paraphrase are actually read from the study quote with regard to culminated alcoholic beverage use are finding indicated that heavier califate alcohol beverage use was associated positively with indirect aggression even after considering one's typical alcohol use and disposition aggression what this means is that even though alcohol can buys certain individuals to be more aggressive and even though certain individuals already have a disposition toward being more aggressive there was an effect that was independent meaning above beyond both alcohol and predisposition meaning if some one with consuming culminated alcoholic beverages they had a particularly high likelihood of engaging in indirect aggressive behavior now this makes perfect sense in light of the model they propose which is this self regulation model that that easily self regulation involve several things it involves engaging in certain behaviors and suppressing other behavior as describe the before because alcohol tends to have a sedative suppressive effect on the autonomic nervous system at least after the initial period its going to tend to reduce the likelihood that people will engage in any type of behavior where as cabin will increase autonomic arousal and increase the likelihood that some one will engage in a particular type of behavior aggressive or otherwise the commination of caftan an alcohol is really acting as a too prong system to buy as people towards more an passivity that is less self regulate ton it is really yanking your a volitional control your ability to engage in prefrontal top down inanition over your hypothalamus from too distinct en specific circuits by now you should be getting the impression that self regulation is a key feature of whether or not somebody make even you is going to engage in aggressive speech or aggressive behavior and we talked about a number of tools that one can use to reduce the probability that that will happen i suppose if the context for approbratict even take those tool recommendations in just invert them and increased the likelihood that aggressiveness would happen but regardless self regulation is key and insight of that i want to share with you a study that focus on kids but that has important ramifications for adults as well as you probably are already aware there are many kids out there that suffer from called attention definite hyperactivity disorder or eighty it therefore also many adults we are finding that are suffering from eighty h and there is also an epidemic i would say of people that are concerned about whether not they have eighty it now whether not they have true clinical eighty h or not is not clear we did an episode all about eighty eight and tools fright eight i would encourage you to check out that episode and some of the diagnostic criteria if you have the opportunity can fined that at superman labor come as this study am about to share with you aptly points out there is no objective diagnostic marker of eighty h there is no bile marker or blood draw or blood test for eighty it whether not one has eighty it depends on their performance on a number of different connive tests and behavioral tests and self report in any event the study am about to share with you explored how particular pattern of supplementation in kids with eighty it was able to reduce aggressive episodes and impulsivity and increase self regulation and the title o the study is efficacy of carnations in the treatment of children with attention definite hyperactivity disorder even though they put carnations the title that what they focused on was whether or not a sendal el carnations supplementation could somehow adjust the behavioral tendency of these kids with eighty it and to make a long story short ended it did there was a very significant effect of facial carnations supplementation on improving some of the symptomatology symptomatology excuse me of eight it a few details about the study that might be relevant to you this was a randomized double blind placebo control double crossover study this was done as an outpatient study the kids were not in a hospital they were living out in the world this again was done on younger kids of this o six six to thirteen year old kids that were diagnoses with mighty it they received either a sell carnations or placebo and they did all the good practice stuff that good researches do of making sure that the placebo and the apsidal canine had similar look n taste a it was consumed twice daily after meals i should mention that bedel carpeting typically is taken in causal form a or occasionally an indictable form here that they were using this as a drink which essentially the same as capital form but the powders just going directly into liquid and the carnotite dosage was one hundred milligrams prkilegram the doing this according to the byway these kids with a maximum dosage of four gram per day the quality of the medication was supplied here on reading for a period of eight weeks and every eight weeks a new quantity of medication was supplied basically this is a fairly long term study am exploring behavioral outcomes and psychological outcomes in week eight sixteen and twenty four they also looked at blood things that you could only get through a blood draw things hemoglobin matier redbloodsell count whitebloodsell countisaider that they these are kids and even if it were adults i they were quite appropriately examining a old of the physiological measures that one would want to carry out to make sure first of all that blood levels of carnations are increasing an indeed they confirm that but also that no am negative effects are showing up in the physiology as well as a psychology of these kids first ill just tell you the basic outcome the study which was here in paraphrasing given twice daily carnations appeared to be effective and well tolerated treatment for a group of children with eighty eighty they showed significant the abnormal behavior compared to these other boys and now ism moving to the table of results they showed significant reductions in their call total problem score the total problem score is a well established measure of behavior of problems in kids with eighty eight shy and i should say adults with eghdisty has to do with challenges in social and learning environments and how well or poorly an individual tends to perform reductions in attentional problems over all reductions in delinquency and most important forsake of to day's discussion significant reductions in aggressive behavior now what is especially nice about the study i think is that even though is a relatively small number of subjects and certainly needs to be repeated in other studies and other laboratories that they were able to confirm the shifts in a carnations within the blood stream of these kids that is they were able to correlate the physiology with the psychological changes know in studies this and frankly in all studies of human phrompharmochology you have to worry about effects that show up not just because of placebo effects but because of called off target effects or related things totally independent of the drug over the particular supplement they happened be looking at not to put in the words of a a great cousin is unfortunate he passed away a some years ago but he was a member the national academy extremely accomplished a near scientist a once turn to me and said never forget a drug is a substance that when injected into an animal are a human being creates a paper meaning you can see effects of pretty much any drug or any supplement in most all conditions however it is in cases such as this study where you can quite convincingly see that the particular feature of physiology that you expected to change actually changed and you see a psychological outcome that you can gain much greater confidence that the changes in delinquency in this case reduce delinquency improved attention reduce aggressiveness and forth was at least somehow related to the shift in blood physiology and levels of alcarnatine or a sendal of carnations and carnations in the blood stream of these children as opposed to something else alcarnatine going and effecting some downstream target that you have no knowledge of now of course that still entirely possible but i think studies such as these increase our confidence that things alcarnatine can be used perhaps in concert with things o mama three supplementation diets that are by as towards increasing more trip tofanine therefore or ceratonan obviously avoiding things caul and as it appears from the study i just described reducing once intake or not consuming any culminated alcoholic beverages seems could be good idea of your goal is to reduce aggressiveness to think about the hormone context and whether or not you tend to have her testosterone and estrogen or lower testosterone o estrogen maybe en thing about the work environment whether not you are existing in a particularly compete work environment and even daylength time of year and whether or not your getting sufficient sunlight whether not your avoiding light in the evening and on studies such as this i think are useful because they point to the fact that very seldom if ever will there be one supplement or one nutritional change or even one behavioral change that is going to completely shift an individual from being aggressive and impulsive but rather that by combining different behavioral regiments by paying attention to things time of year and work conditions and school conditions and over all levels of stress and likely therefore levels of cortical et camera that you can use behaviors diet and supplementation as a way to shift that overall internal mill from one of providing a lot of internal hydraulic pressure as it is been called throughout the episode toward aggressive impulsivity and relax some of that hydraulic pressure and reduce aggressive tendencies once again and frankly as always we have done a deep dive into the neurobiology and the psychology of what i believe to be an important feature of our lives in this case aggression on a point out that in a episode in the not too distant future ism going to be hosting doctor professor avid andiron from calcic university who is the world expert on the neurobiology of aggression in fact he is the senior author on many of the studies related to the ventromedial hypothalamus that i discuss to day our discussion will touch on aggression of course hearing to days up some will help you digests that information but we are also going to talk about other emotional states he is an expert noncihous in aggression but in motivated states related to sects and making behavior a social relationships of all kinds and how those relate not just a biology and psychology but also certain forms of pathology things p t s t and the relationship for instance between anger fear anxiety and depression and many other important topics that i know many of you if not all of you will be interested in in the meantime i want a point you to his recently released and wonderful book entitle the nature of the beast how emotions guide us and again the author is avid andiron from called this is a wonderful book it serves as a tremendous introduction to the history of the study of these areas the current science and discoveries being made in these areas all made accessible to the scientist and non scientist alike its have a very engaging read and much that even though he was gracious in sending me a copy i also purchase myself a cop be to give to somebody who is a therapist and i have purchased another copy to give to a high school kid that i mentor because he is very interested in the nohow science of emotions and i think we are all interested in emotions notjust fear and some of these negative states not just aggression but also the positive emotions of our lives and the nature of the beast how emotion guide us by avid andiron is a wonderful read i cannot recommend it highly enough if your learning from and ore enjoying this

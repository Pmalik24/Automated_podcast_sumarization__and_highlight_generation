welcome to the hubermanladconcas as science science pace to r ism enterhubermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of venison my guest to day is rick rebel rick rebel is a world renowned music producer having worked with an enormous number of incredible artist producing for instance red hot chilly peppers beauty boys daisy johnny cash a dell lady gaga tom petty and of course slayer this last year rick also authored his first book which is a truly incredible exploration into the creative process his book is entitled the creative act away of being rick has appeared once before on the hubermanlab podcast and during that appearance he offer to answer listeners and viewers questions those questions were put in the comment section on you two and we received thousands of them to day rick answers your questions about the creative process i also took note of the feed back that when rick previously appeared on the hubermanlab podcast that perhaps i spoke a bit more than the audience would have preferred to day i refrain from speaking too much and trying give as much air time as possible to rick in order to directly answer your questions you'll notice that to day's discussion gets really into the practical aspects of the creative process the most frequent questions that i receive for rick were ones in which people really want to understand what his specific process is each in every day as well as when he is producing music or other forms of art and of course people want to know what they should do specifically from the time they wake up until the time they go to sleep even whether not they should take note of their dreams at camera we get into all of that today's discussion is very different from the one i held with rick previously and at least to my knowledge from any of the other interviews or discussions that rick has had publicly before we begin it'd to emphasize at this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy effort to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to think the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is man new venison now we knew e venison is the most neutrino dense and delicious red meet available give spoken before on this podcast and there is general consensus that most people should strive to consume approximately one gram of proline expound of bodyweight now when one strives to do that it is important to maximize the quality of that proving an take to the carry ratio because you do not want to consume an excess of calories when trying to get that one gram of proline expound of bodyweight now we knew e venison has an extremely high quality proving to carry ratio it makes getting that one gram of proline propound of bodyweight extremely easy it is also delicious personally i the ground venison ill like the venison stakes and then for convenience when a m on the road i the jersey the jersey is a very high proline to carry ratio it has as much as ten grams of proline our jerky stick and has something only fifty five calorie again making very easy to get enough proline without consuming excess calories if you would to try more new venison can go to make newevenison do calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off youreferst order again that is make newevenison do calm slash supermen to get twenty percent off to day's episode is also brought to us by eight sleep eight sleep make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity have spoken many times before in this pod cast about the fact that sleep is the foundation of mental health physical health and performance now i see component of getting a great night sleep is that in order to fall and stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees one of the best ways to make sure that those temperature changes a cur at the appropriate times at the beginning an throughout and at the end of your night when you wake up is to control the temperature of your sleeping environment and that what eight sleep allows you to do it allows you to program the temperature of your mattress and sleeping environment such that you fall and stay deeply asleep easily and wake up each morning feeling incredibly refreshed and energized i been sleeping on an eight sleep mattress cover for almost three years now and it has dramatically improve the quality of my sleep much that when i travel and i men a hotel or an air bean band i do not have access to my eight sleep i very much look for to getting home because my sleep is always better when i sleep on my eight sleep mattress cover if you would to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep dot calm slash supermen to get a hundred fifty dollars off their pod three mattress cover eight sleep currently ships and the u a candida you k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep dot all slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by waking up waking up is a meditation a that offers hundreds of meditation programs mindfulness training and yoga near which is sometimes referred to as an s t are ism a long time fan of meditation i start meditating when i was back in my teens and i star doing a daily ten or twenty minute meditation and i kept that up for a number of years but then it became more operatic and an eventually i stopped and then it'd start again and then it stop what i found with the waking up a is that it makes it very easy to take on a meditation practise and to you meditation if not every day very close to every day and and that we know based on a lot of research has an outsized plosive effect on everything from stress regulation to sleep you come up with better ideas indeed meditation can make you more creative more focused and on and on and then about ten years ago i got introduce to yoga near or an it are non sleep deepest which is a practice of laying completely still while keeping the mind very active your relaxing but keeping your mind active and i use enemy are essentially every single day it'll do it anywhere from ten to thirty minutes and i find it to be incredibly restorative it really resets s my ability to think and to engage in physical activity and with waking up i can select different lengths of meditations different lands of yoganedros a nasty yours that i keep up my practice if you would to try waking up you can go to waking up dock calm slash supermen to try a completely free thirty day trial again that is waking up doc calm slash supermen to try a free thirty day trial and now for my discussion about protocols for creativity with rick rebel rick rebel well come back tank you sir happy to be here we are gan to answer or rather you are going to answer the questions of the listeners of our preathious podcast episode before we do that however when we we are out in the lobby you mention that you have a breathing exercise a coherent breathing exercise that you thought might be useful for us to do now and perhaps for some of the listeners to join in let us do it and then if you want to talk about it after we can sounds good the reason i started doing this is i have relatively low heart rate variability and you will not to have a high one is i looked at all the things that can raise your hart are variability and i started doing this breathing technique specifically for heart rate viability an it went up also it is great test it great let us do it together here it will a take a deep breath and then when you will hear the sound of a if you follow me for the first in heller hell you will know what sound means w and you do this eyes close typically i do it is close it will close our eyes stinky as five minutes that feels nice as not yet i notice i do not spontaneously breathe at that cadence i enwreathe quite a bit faster it specially on the exile once i got into a rhythm of it the other mind just goes pseudo random for me what about for you does your mind tend to go one place i do now i count i the reason i knew was five minutes is because it is express per minute and i counted i one one one to one three one or one five on six to one i was occupied with a task how often do you do that at least once and sometimes twice a day i aim for ten minutes a day but if i get to twenty minutes to day it it is a noticeable in my harry verbality results do you do the coherence breathing at a particular times of day or just whenever it occurs to you i think it depends on where i am in what else is going on in my life it it it was i had a window a very specific thing that i was doing i would do coherent breathing and i would do squats just air squats and a in one location ore i did not have any other equipment and and then i found a way where i was doing treading water which you got to experience with me i would tread water and then after treading water i would get out of the pool sin the sun an do the coherent breathing great i wish you jolly mention what i the treading water was about ex people wonder i very briefly i went visit rick over sees this summer and we spent a fair amount of the daytime i treading water while listening to podcast from a speaker on the side of the pool and it was assume i time together as friends as assume time in the sun is assume learning from podcast and listening and being entertained by podcast as sum and then treading water as assume your much better at treading water than i am i was fatiguing it is just ass as i said when we were doing it it is it is say it is doing stairs if you practice doing stairs it gets easier to do stairs but nobody's good it doing i a marathon runners cannot run up the stairs it is a units a particular thing and treading water if you just do it in even en little bit of time that we were doing it every day by the end of your stay it was easier for you than when you started definitely yet you acclimate quickly ye i was able to adapt as it pressed at your endurance in treading water early on by the ay have continued the treading water practice because i fortunate to have a pool in my new place him i listen to your podcast truly get yogramaton love it i love love love it i listen to a few other podcast and have started listening to more episodes of the podcast that you introduced me to which was history of rock music and five hundred songs an your hickeys an english podcast great podcast real indepbth information about music if i was such a great our of thanks for having me over there thinks would command loves fun treading water it was loved the time with you in your family ism an it'll invite myself again i always well on the topic of meditation i one of the questions in this list of questions we will talk about the list itself in a moment i was about this anecdote that you have told me and you have mentioned a few other places apparently that y you've once meditated all the way from was it san francisco to new york where at lost angles a to new york flight it was either elate in new york or new york to else cannot remember and i may have done it when then once the question specifically was which meditation did you do t m t m was the first meditation i learn transcendental meditation learned when i was fourteen it is it is pretty much of default a setting for me now sometimes it's evolve from t m in to breathing i might start by doing breathing before the t m piece starts and and the breathing may just take the whole time or it may turn from breathing into a gratitude practice or m met practice which is a for phrases may i be filled with loving kindness may i be well may i be peaceful and at ease may i be happy and you repeat those phrases over and over and it starts may i and then eventually if you have done it for year you could start saying may we for your f immediate family and then may even as you build up the charge for your immediate family in another year or you can spread it to your community and eventually after may be five years you can do it for the planet that is the met met m eta may as i loving kindness practice and are there any particular links may be could pass us later and we could put on the my actions may one that you learned it from jack cornfield whose a buddhi scholar and the brilliant etcher terrific what you thing meditation is a loud you afford did you as well as what it is helped you avoid in terms of a daily practice or i maybe just how doing it once in a while has wicked out into areas of your life that is brolly long list of things but if you were to pick maybe the top three well yet when ism meditating regularly blank happens and blank does not happen and when ism not those things cause have been doing it for such a long time it is om parton parcel of who i am that without i do not know who i would be without it that is said i do not always do it but i do not have at this point i do not have to always do it to be in this down where i been for almost for we know forty five years as seen a big part of my life a great deal of the benefits have art in me now when i practise it its amplified but i as maharishi described it every time you meditate is making a deposit in a bank it is always there every time you do it it is your building a base and the goal of the practice is less about the practice is about the practice is to change the way you are in the world it is a practice for life do t him saying tithe changes that come in the meditation a to help your reactions in the real world in some ways not the trivialize it but it is physical exercise yet cheering the go to work out your blood pressure is really elevated your secreting all sorts of inflammatory side o kinds beef we would've were to draw your blood mid work out you would say this person is in trouble but then all these wonderful adaptations occur that allow you to sleep better better mood walk upstairs easily and on and an it is funny about sleeping abetter this morning i was walking on the beach and and my headphones on wired headphones and i was listening to podcast i cannot remember what i was listening to but i was listening to a podcast and some one flagged me and interrupted me who i did not know and went over to talk to him he said i heard you talking about see mark not podcast and and he told me story about steep martin that he got see him in nineteen seventy nine i would say this person was probably midst into late sucksties and he was wearing all black he was wearing shoes on the beach a tens shoes he was wearing dark sun glasses and a hat and he said just wont talk about comedy and things that he heard me sound a podcast an we talked about it for a while and then he said something about tat he loves podcast and he listens to him at night cause he is got terrible and somneand he cannot sleep and ism looking at a quit in the sun wearing sun glasses and i say well the reason you cannot sleep is because you wearing sunglasses now said what you talking about said will the way the the human body works is we react to the sun the in is what tells us we are awake and that at night when it is dark that is what tells us to go to sleep you are mixing he signals to your body by wearing the sun glasses and he said well well ma dermatologist and you give been adore said he was a term dermatalljus for lass forty years and my whole practices about getting people to get out of the sun and and i si we start talking about it and a he he was all covered up i was wearing am my my board short an nothing else and and i solo in the sun hours every day and and i as i ain't you wearied about ta can her and i said i i feel pretty healthy i feel okay and then he said let me see you aback and i turned around he looked at my backing like you have perfect skin that they should study you in a in a a in an institute i said this is what normals this is what normal healthy skin looks if you expose it to the sun any sits your thing everything have been teaching in my in my a medical practice for last word usually wrong suggest everything this funny funny conversation gets interesting in we could go down a deep habit hole with this but in a listeners of this past will know that ism you very much proponent of getting those sunlight signals to the eyes at least once a day in the morning but also in in the evening the us it'll just share with you i now i learned from a a ghost us up we have an ism aired yet that the what is special but that morning an evening sunlight are the contrasts between blues and oranges blues and reds blues and pinks the we cannot always see if there is cloud cover but they come through and it is the mathematical difference in their presence of traction of a lot of blue an the next to it a lot of orange or a lot of blue and the next to t a lot of pink that triggers the body's understanding that this is morning an evening and that night is coming in the evening and the is time be awaken in the morning and throughout the day in the middle of the day when the sun is out and it is overhead it looks white light and white light includes the blues in the oranges and the pinks and the reds but the they subtract to zero because they are all mixed the other that is why it looks just blue and white and while bright light is great throughout the day it is this morning signals now the i think the dermatology community is starting to come on line with the idea that low solar angle sunlight early and later in the day sunrise and surprising and sun setting and i say that because people always go old you have to see across the horizon that would be ideal but rising and setting do not create the kind of skin damage i damage that they have been concerned about and i think the next step for the field of dermatology is going to be to start communicating with the narrow scientists and the circa an biologists and and really a learning that tho thanks for bridging that gap on the beach this morning i i do think that is how it starts and then it wins out head phones i i made the choice a few years ago to stop using the blue tooth headphones based on my personal experience which was i kept getting these sits behind my ears which i was told were limp swellings of limp they would actually drain limp if they got big enough is there is really gross and c troubling i stopped using them i did not get them i start using them again is a gain those limp things and and there was some significant heat effects as well i and i t interviewed a couple people including a our surgeon on the pod cast about um the level of thermals that come from them and they were not concerned others have spoken to are concerned i when a trying balance out the conversation over time but my feeling was look if there is any concern whatsoever who would i use them and i i use the ones with wires but use the ones with wires there even one step further away from i while i transmitter ill ones with air tubes that i used o in on was going on and those have no electrical am there is no electric near your head it is just an air to where the sound is travelling this actual sound is travelling in the tobsterious i do not only sleep better with the phone out of the bedroom some people are now turning off their wife fie at night i think you and i are both really aline in the sense that we have seen enough things coming go in the health space disparaging remarks about lifting weights that is just for body builders and at now everybody know of muscle bound you rake a muscle count right now men and women elderly and young are encouraged to do resistance training a yoga us to be cast in this kind of magic carpet realm breath work all this snuff is become over time mainstream but it is taken a very long time in the road has been choppy an sometimes my opinion really in fair to the to the practice es and and their value i these are zero cost practices in many cases that can really help people and when i look at something sunscreen or or blue to head phones or we are talking about some of these things i wish i had a portal into the future where we look back and of course of course to what your thoughts on just could of a health and wellness as you have observed it in the last twenty thirty years am you have been in this for a while am you have paid attention to mindfulness and mine body stuff yo what your thoughts i i try to live in as natural way as possible i tried e is few process foods as possible tried e grassed animals a and and i use hardly any products of any kind that that are not just something that grows or lives on the planet there were couple questions about this all last now am you lost a tremendous amount away you look great by the way think you look superfix overtime i seel her in better in better shape am and a that that is in that is your perception it is not in fact the case i were your pec oh no when i see each time you coming your extremely mobile you you sleeping well have a robot life you no in all the marks of health and vitality am have heard you mention before that you lost a significant amount of weight how much weight and how did you do it a hundred and thirty five pounds through a hi propene low gallery low carbide and that went against the convention at the time well the person who suggested it was a a some one at you see a la it was a mainstream doctor who helped me with my hayloft i had been avian at that time which was not mainstream then and it was very unhealthy but i did that for twenty somehow years because i believed in the fury of it but it proved not to be a healthy for me do you think the different diets likely work for different people yes that not every one necessarily should do what you did but i think most people would probably benefit from healthy read me ism saying that only because it vilified in our culture ye i agree and i think the healthy pieces key there to olfactory farmed animals ism which fortunately reasonably cost sources that are becoming more available well eminent start pulling from the list of questions a by the way folks there were more than a thousand questions in just the one third print out that i did a than intimidating stack in front of yet the most notes have ever put in front of me during a guest a discussion here on the podcast and we are not going to ask you every question but have organized a minute in as some sense of coherent order i did you organize a mar a i organize them i organize them but that is a great opportunity to ask you one of questions that came up several times which was i what are your thoughts on a and its ability to ism shape how music is made how visual arts are made are you one of these scared of i a u embrace new technology i do not know enough about it yet to to talk about it what i will say is what what i find interesting about art is the point f view of the person making it and i do not know that a i has a point of view of its own ism at i do not know how interesting it would be a is point of view but i people's points of view and what makes an artist a great arts to me is something about their point of view does something with to me childhood a question for rick rebel was what activities did you find most enjoyable and easy to get lost in as a child i love this question for you in particular reading was a big part of my life listening to music la big part of my life playing we tar along with music cannot really play but the idea of playing along is a did not have to actually be good enough to play along i did not have that skill set but i the experience of doing my best to play along with something i was listening to and i also magic a learning shuffling carts in front of the mirror and clown tricks and a slight of hand was just interesting to me do you still do magic i do not at the time that music took over my life i had to choose between the two's both of them were full time life pursuits i went saw mentalist in new york the summer with my sister a s wind is his name a s i first name last name wind every time i see him mentalist especially e when i see si i'veseen him twice it it blows my mind what a your thoughts on mentalists as my favorite form a magic really most interesting because it it does not rely on crops it re it is it is it is pure it feels pure magic if it if you have a box and you pull something out of the box it probably something tricky about the boy but when some one can look at you and tell you ware you thinking it is just wild it is really wild s i love that after are did his his act when we pseudo return to reality cause it really does change the way you look at things after that for quite a while maybe forever i ask him if he was willing to share maybe just like one nugget of inside into how he does what he does with and of course i was not expecting he was give away the whole thing and he said a lot of ass to do with forming in a racing memories in people quickly which sounds very kind of dark and mysteriously interested yet that maybe it is possible that two race memories why let it like maybe what we thought we saw we really did not see or here so i it'd tie that description ye ism in to bring him out here wile a we should all get another and love y all wanted at him on the podcast they a fool ten per cent of the questions for you we are around writers block sticking points this kind of thing feeling stock in the creative process now people didn't specify whether not they were stock at the beginning the middle of the end but based on my read of all these questions i got the sense that people were feeling there is something in them that they want access to they want to create but they do not know how to get past that initial stage i suppose to somebody's nine were cent done and they just cannot finish the last ten per cent what are your thoughts about these kinds of blocks and how to overcome them any experience you have had with them yourself and perhaps with i working with other artists the first thou s to go past the idea of the block and think about what what is what is the cause of the blow and the block is usually something it is either a personal ism not good enough it is it can be a confidence issue i do not have anything to say or it could be a thinking about some one else nobody's can alike what i make did i saying is either a a self judgment or fear of outside judgment if you are making something with with a freedom of this is something ism making form myself for now that is all it is it is a diary entry everything i make is a diary entry the beauty of a diary entry is i can write my diary entry and you cannot tell me my diary entry was not good enough or that is not what i that is not what i experienced of course it is what i experiences ism writing a personal diary for myself you would no one else can judge it it is my experience of of my life everything we make can be that can be a personal reflection of who we are in that moment of time it does not have to be the greatest you could ever do it does not have to have any expectation that it is gin a change the world it does not have to be this has to sell a certain number copies for any reason it does not have any of those things all it is is ism making this thing i making this thing for me and i i want do it to the best of my ability to where i feel good about it and where it is honest it is honest of where ism at and if you are living in this world of just being honest where you are at there is nothing blocking that did t ism saying there are no blocks the books are all based on dealing with a different force or a different perception that is made up you make up this story and you are living the story ism in this block because i just cannot do it the reason you cannot do it is because here afraid some one else is nocking a it or you are there are no blocks is there is infinite amount of information out there to work with because it does not it also does not stem from us it where were vehicles for this information and it is coming through us all the time if you do not have an i dead when your sitting at you desk if you go for black chances are you see something that will spark something in you as a as a seed to take off from that makes a lot of sense and had a thought while you are saying that one of the challenges that i have in completing work in getting into a good work grief is that ism especially nowadays because of phones and easy to communicate with other people it is not that they interrupt me it is that an this happen the other day i set up my new off ice really nicely am living in a very quiet place now it is almost completely silent unless ism playing music it is really interesting what the iota sometimes come around and start doing their thing at night but completely silent and i realize i was having a hard time getting into a work proof and i realize that i felt compelled to continue to reach out to people and then i realize as you would just provided your answer to the last question that there is probably something in me that has a bit of a fear of separation are abandonment from people a based on my own experience and i feel very well supported by my friends and to workers these days very very well supported ism in i con a pinch me place around that and but i realize now that what is happening in my mind is it is not a challenge of getting into the work it is a fear that if i spend a couple hours really in that tight tunnel of creation that there might not be anyone there when i exit it which is a crazy thought it's the crazy bi that is the anxiety i only realize that now thank you great i trust that you guisi'll be there when i when i it the tong wo and when there is a dead line i have no choice but to jump into that tunnel that that's i shall what helps deadlines really help me to deadlines help you do you deadlines i deadlines do not help me at the beginning of a process they can help at the end once the codes been cracked usually when i start something i have no idea whats can to be sit is a very open process in the beginning and if there is any sense of required timing that would undermine the freedom needed frit to be all that it could be but once the codes cracked and what it is and it is all there and your just the you dealing with the fine points then it can be really helpful to have a deadline as many of have been taking a one daily since two thousand twelve some delighted that their sponsor in the pod cast a one is a vitamin mineral robotic drink that is designed to me all of your foundation a nutrition needs of course i try to get enough servings of vitamins and minerals through whole food sources that include vegetables and fruits every day but often times i simply cannot get enough servings but with a one item sure to get enough fitments and minerals and the robotics that i need and it also con trains adaptagens to help buffer stress simply put i always feel better when i take g one i have more focus and energy and i sleep better and it also happens to taste right for all these reasons whenever ism asked if you could take just one supplement what would it be i answer a one if you would to try a one they will to drink a one doc cam slash supermen to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k to again that is drink a one do calm slash supermen a number of questions were sort of comments about what people b leave your process is and one of the repeating things there which i thought was interesting was it seems that rick rebel is comfortable with uncertainty and the unknown yes that is true t yes and yes i am comfortable with it because i accept that is the way things are that said when i start a new project i always have anxiety because ism uncertain of what is can happen and i want it to be good now i know it will not be done until i feel good about it son that way there is no here is no real pressure but i do still feel this anxiety of i wonder what is con a happen to day i hope it is good when you have worked with musical artists let us say i how important is it to you to know what challenge is maybe even what success is but certainly what challenges they happen to be going through at that period of time put differently you an finding yourself playing therapist and guide and i psychological slash emotional mentor to artist you work with during the creative process orbs that separate if they are going through something that is interfering with the work anything that gets in the way of the work is something worth discussing our focus they are together is to get the work done sometimes it ends up being more thereputid to allow that to happen one of the questions that really stood out to me in this vast list of questions m involved a quote from your last discussion on the podcast our last discussion on the podcast i some one a read a little bit of it cause it is fairly long but ism give found this to be a really important question that we should get into an a bit more depth i somebody i do not know who said if you happen to talk to rick happen to be talking you am asking this for me in his book in the section on self doubt rick said quote one of the reason many great artist die of overdoses early in their lives as because they used drugs to numb a very painful existence the reason that is painful as the reason they became an artist in the first place thereincredible sensitivity if you see tremendous beauty or tremendous pain where other people see little or nothing at all you are confronted with big feelings all the time these emotions can be confusing and overwhelm an overwhelming excuse me this goes on for some pages and then this person says and i think they are speaking for many people when they said this resonate with me personally and i wonder whether not this is something that maybe you have experience yourself or that you just notice about artist and similar situations and what sort of advice do you give the artist you work with in order to embrace those painful tones within them and transmute them into great work ice definitely felt then myself i unusually sensitive in the world a wearing red glasses in here for reason i live very protected monk life because stimulation get's in the way of my ability to beth want to be i tend to stay away from things and it seems to be the case with many artists i desire for nurturing their internal life and if if the gold is to nurture are internal life it it it invariably leads to sacrifices did you spend a lot of time alone as a kid ism asking the i did ye i was only child and i spend most o my time alone when you talk about controlling this amountandtype of stimulation in your life to protect that inner let landscape is that retain to certain personality types even voice types give i found it verbs times in my life i love people but there there certain voices that just great on me and i cannot be around them i camp be around then the driving it brings out that just it is coffin inside i just feel ism being asked to drink something that taste awful does it does that resent i i try to curate the people around me to be people i want to have around me whatever that is right whateverwyou said you protect the inner landscape but certainly you are not averse to high intensity stimulation i last night we went t the a w and by the way thank you for taking me that was such an incredible experience he wasretedit was really fun eteryminding me of early unlock shows where t the some of my first unfrock shows or i went like all my hash this is exciting and scary and i love it and it felt loving too yes which is also the community of unfrock that i observed and have been blessed be a part of it is like i it is there y others a passion but there is also love and then there is romance and then there is also betrayal there is all the elements but there is still a sense everyone wants to be here and t at there is a sense of goodness behind it all even though some of it was bloody and violent yes for you what it what is it resting allow you to feel in those high intensity in viroencs it completely relaxes me because there are no stakes nobody every one's working together in the show to protect each other no one's trying to hurt anybody regardless of what the story linens it is a ballet where there is a fight in the ballet there is no there is no actual aggression people towards each other it is just the opposite but you get to experience this wildly dynamic exciting serial theatrpiece where people are doing these a gymnastic and acrobatic things that are truly dethtifing and it is fun in the the story lines absorb you in a way were you never know what is true and what is not but we know we know wrestling's fake were told wrestlingsfake but there is something legitimate about it that seems to me more legitimate than anything else the most legitimate because it is the closest to what the world's actually people do not always tell you what they really think and when some one tells you story it might not really be the true story they may even think they may be they may think they are telling you the real story and that might not be the real story we do not know we know little we we we experience something and then we make up a story to understand it ourselves and then forevermore when we tell that story it was our version of of an experience but we do not know that is what happen that was our take on it wrestling it is that is what the real world is because we when you watch wrestling you never know what is true that is what if you watch the news you a wrestling and you never know what is true it is more it would be more accurate you would you would have a better sense of the world if you took it all in it was a resting i think we are in a place in human history where people are starting to feel that way about the media it is also why wrestling popular you know is a more popular than it is ever been ye that is interesting things you have see can gladiator octagon fights and wrestling are increasing in popularity despite the fact that suppose we were revolving adding at reflect something both primitive and evolved about the human bring yes my primitive in the sense that tether some violence it is physical that is down in the hypothalamus as we would say nit scratches that much but they are actually protecting each other the wit scratches that itch of seeing the gladiators but it is watching a move it is not they are not really they are not really hurting each other they get hurt but only because the things there doing are crazy i think in order to be able to thoroughly enjoy wrestling one has to be able to give up narrative distressing just a little bit my narrative distancing is this sense that this is a story it is a move it is not real but there were moments yesterday that the jump off the top rope on to the guy who splayed out on the latter the latter breaks this was right in front of us it could not have felt good no he walked away he seemed fine a is but that and then am there was a match between two women where women put a metal plate into her a into the bottoms of her suit in then ran on than jumped on to the other women and you hid her with the metal plate in the the metal plate kind of slipped out she was walking round and everyone knew she had sheeted cause you are not spa see is the met plate but sort of exciting cause she had done it exciting cashed gotten away with it and at the same time exciting upsetting that the refer saw it but then did not call it antis is twitter ax this as long in step dam this is politics this i this s reluct right seeing people get away with things this frustrating with e fellation that is all part of it it is e have got it it is very a accurate representation of the world of it have ism it is it's where because i never would have thought it'd be fucked it archery and professional wrestling now on of you busy guy and twenty four ism man to come back to this very practical question and ask a different question first there a few comments in here that are just priceless by the way do not want to point out that your pieces and asinine couple of historical questions i know you are not big on answering historical questions am necessarily maybe you are but i cannot help every time i see you asking a question about the moments ore asking a question about jostromer but i i this question first of all it starts off i love rick rebel he is fascinating there are many questions that start that way on the pod cast at you did with jo organ i you talked about your experience with johnny cash and see him in a new light after doing interviews for a book about johnny something that i the question this person asked was from your present view what was the most impackful moment or moments from being with him in working with him or simply do you recall a moment work in a johnny cash that you particularly enjoyed i enjoyed any time i got spend time with them he was really sol full serious shy quiet man incredibly knowledgeable you knew a great deal about history and ad much about music ho knew every song he did not he mean not of known modern since but he knew the history of music am really well and there was just a humble nasty about him that came through i think that the strength of him as an artist was when he said words even if he did not write the words if he told a story in words you believe that story he had a credible gravitas and he was great because of who he was it was not his ability is a singer it was not his ability as a song writer although he was a great song writer and he was a great singer but that is not why he was johnny cash who was johnny cash because of the human being underneath and anything that that i would have done we would be interested in because that is how much of a been of light he was on the planet it just happen to be music just happen to be music allow that one question that came up a lot and i i think i can understand why which is how does one convince themselves that what they are doing an working on is worth that and i think here we have to defend worth that beam and we can find any number of ways but i think this is a feeling that i her people express a lot how do i know if om on the right path and i just one remind you are earlier answer that youyou are pretty comfortable with uncertainty this and the unknown and i think that is a rare trait the question of worth it is reliant on an outcome we do not make these things for an outcome it is it is it is not the mind set to make something great that outcome happens you are making the best thing you can make it is a it is a devotional practice whatever happens after that happens and that part that happens after it is completely out of your control putting any energy into that part that is out of your control s wasted time all it is all it does is under my new work your work is to make the best thing you can any thought you have about outcome undermines the whole thing let that one sink in an that is important for people to hear and it'll say it is cay to think about outcome after you have finished the thing you are making once you have made it then you can say hm what can i do to turn people on to this but in the making of it it is premature which brings my mind back to that diary entry approach because when you do a diary entry if you lie to yourself you are going to get a lot less out of it it is is a ridiculous idea lying in your diary and its is is well it is inserting as when you learn how to do really good science and i was fortunate to work with some one who was truly committed to the truth and accuracy she is just say whenever there was a scandal publish some one fabricated day was us this is o crazy out why would you get into science you be of you want to makes e warp you u the at er off going to something also clearly they were not those people who make up data were not in science for discovery of truth as best we can understand it they were into it for something else butts the same way you do you formulate question than a hypothesis and then you just go see what is an what is not and then afterwards you decide well as this a paper that send to a top journal or a mediocre journal that you cannot control the outcome to us very somewhere exactly the same and and it you will see it in many different aspects of life beyond art it is it is i think one of the things hit was interesting that came up in writing the book is it started being about art and i came to realize as i was putting the ideas together that it seems regardless a what you do in life if you follow these principles your life will probably improve you probably be a better husband or better father or better whatever it is it is sum it seems the the art is an outgrowth of as why the subtitles a way of being is you create yourself in the way in the world where the things that you make or tapped in something deep but that comes from you being tapped into something be hence out works tapping itself growing itself not thinking about outcome diary entry approach to creating stuff seems to be the and i think one thing else it'll say ten they say tapping into self it does not come from the self but you have to tapping yourself because you are the vessel to allow it to come out everything in the vessels coming from somewhere else it is not it is not you are creation you are the it is you are the sculptor or the you are the data an analyst were taking these things from different places that you have noticed somethings that you have notice somethings that you do not know that you have noticed but you did is how we learn in a we takin a lot of information that we do not even know we are taking in but the way we can take these datapoints that are inside of us that came from outside of us and create a constellation that is what that is what the artist job is but also that is what we all do all the time and to get better at it it is getting moreintune with yourself and opening yourself to things outside of it'll say if you have a narrow belief system you will have less information to to work with less tat points being open minded and am allowing surprise to be surprised holding all f your beliefs very loosely it is inserting because it the way you describe this and from knowing you as well it seems that this whole process is best served by having really good boundaries not getting ism foggy about what is about you and what is about somebody else or about what other people want or the world wants but also having really good intend and being able to see what is happening in the world you cannot be cloistered and and this no but part of the creative process feels hand looks your you are in we're in a tunnel but then you have to bring inform the outside i mean the i it seems making these two separate compartments that you can bridge i seems important and healthy being here as you mention it is a way of being it is not just about creating things that is also a healthy way to be in the world because if you are constantly getting pulled around by everything emotionally in things are upsetting that is not good but if you are just cut off from everything that is not good either do you cultivate that way of being through these practices i or do you think you have been there is something about the way you are wire that you you started off that way was natural to me if yokels natural to me and it'll tell you when i was younger i thought i would live in new york city my whole life and there was a time when i felt having that energy and noise around me felt good now i feel best in the jungle or the first i did not decide that haven't decide what feels good you knowing it just happen s you are clearly willing to update and adapt change her nutrition change here alacrity change you the way you feel new information update of it you are scientist e i do not know anything again we start with i know nothing we all know nothing if something sounds interesting worth trying it'll try it we does at work does it not work i thought at one point in time i thought veganism was a good idea i was excited about it and i did it for a long time i did not get the repulse i was hoping for i did not have better help id much worse help i had a tremendous man i wet gain an a i was very ill through that diet i did not my intentions were good how do you approach resistance especially resistance in other artists you work with you do not presently people hire you that they want a work with you they they do on a work with you but i think what the person is asking here is if somebody you are working with is stock their stock dido you asked them to think do you asked them to feel you asked them to take a day off do you i do a penis roman on them and send them to vaguest a party for a couple days cause that is what worked for penis i into you leave on them alone let them come to you i think people are very curious about what those sorts of interactions are i think it is always the case by case situation it really depends on the artists depends on the situation and a and usually by the time that we are working together any resistance they had in the past has already been overcome usually we ism together with some one who were we make a teem with the idea of making the best thing we possibly can and we will both do anything we cant about thing to be the best it can be we are pass the resistance i knows yous remain friends of the lot of the people you have worked with which is a great testament to you and your work and who you are it is one to mention that that is not always the case folks with the other producer artists relationships it is worth pointing out a practical question but i think one that is is worth asking is ah do you handle the finances around your work with artist seed you have some one else do negotiations and all of that kind is honestly of no idea works at noble it is see everything seems to get done but i have no idea in the inner workings of any of it i try to i try to stay out of is much if it is not about making the beautiful thing in the moment i do not really want to think about it too much i don't want o be involve that aspect as interesting when i was visiting e the summer we had a really delightful dinner conversation with one of your other guests and at one point proudly due to me frankly the conversation feared a bit into the business realm and it'll never forget ye said in a very polite way that did not feel dismissive at all you said let us talk about art instead right enough about business less talk about art instead and and in that moment i do not remember that well i gland a lot of gems from that visit i i was not there to study you of there to hang out with you but i glean many gems treading water in the pool some of the other practice will talk about but remember that and i think about that in myself a lot in the morning the males and things coming in and then i think my purpose in life at this point of my life is too collect organize and disseminate health and science information that for me is art in the sense and anything else feels kind of one else can do that right in else t you have a particular gift and that you can take complicated scientific ideas and explain them in a way that all of us wore not scientists er not medical students can understand and it is really helpful and you do it in a kind and living way where we get the sense that you care that we understand you explain it way that there's a a a care in it that really speaks to us thank you for thank you for teaching thank you thanks for the words that means a lot to me that is indeed wat it is from my want people to know the information because i think it is cool and important and they need the information and it is not about me e xi's they have to know and you did this morning for this my on the beach he will see the light n unintended i to take a quick break and thank our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood end an e to help you better understand your body and help you reach your

do you prefer the w r the red he om both here resting foresting is great how often d you abandon an idea o project think is there a is there a pile of journals with crossed out ideas somewhat place in rick rubes they either there many ideas that have not yet come to fruition but i would not say have abandon any they it seems the ideas have a time when they want a come to fruition and regardless of what i think i do not get to determine the calendar the ideas come i can get excited about it i can work on it and then it wall nothing else and nothing it just impenetrable and then they will be another project that just sailing along easily and the universe is working to help support that idea i tend to work with their several balls in the air at once and i do not fight against if the universe is not helping a project ism weary to fight with the universe how many projects are you working on right now or typically it is impossible for me even say they are many there is many ideas and some of them are in i dead has and some of them rain mid mid making stage and some of theory in the final final detail stage this always something happening and always thinking about foodstuff and some of it is stuff that i get share with the world but some of it might be remodelling a space or a ism always thinking about some creative a puzzle have to imagine that for you when the internet came to be that it must been really exciting because me you love for aging for information i used to go to the library and zero's copy papers and i loved looking through the stacks but frankly was physically exhausting in time consuming and financial it was hard for me at the time and then yod always get those copies where the book crease u know obscured a that that the take closer to the to the spine of the book and tow i love pub not i mean the world's at my finger tips the world of researches that my finger cops my goodness a how do you feel about smart phones and the internal i man a tenias that feel a giant gift for your creative process or is it n inhibitor it is it is both you k i love that all the information is at our finger tips and sometimes having much information is som it is hard to sort tell you quick a quick story which was when the music streaming revolution happened i was really excited the idea that all of music is in my pocket now and i can listen to any any song ache album from any point in my life were i get to hear about something and it is all accessible right now in this moment and i was thinking at that time ism just inadeja mailman a dustejand ism an ate listen to anything i can think of that ism excited about have not heard the talking heads on whilst listen the talkingheads just how great that that freedom is to have everything at your finger tips and when i came to learn very quickly is i do not want a delay all day i love that i have the ability do delay all day i love that when there is something i want here i can find it but i do not want to have do do the work of picking everything ism in a listen to i being programmed to and i the discovery of somebody else playing something that i was not expecting and getting to enjoy that now it'd do more listening to either somebody is curated playlets or online radio stations and i do less picking music to listen to but i never would have known that before because i was thought well if i can listen anything i want i want t listen what i want to listen to i did not know that i did not want a have to pick it i love the e rare lie versions and i besides and whatever besides that one can find on you too the other day you sent me just at random a a clip from my thing was a japan's tell vision show with the demons opening up i and johnny opens up with you low moubaby you be shut up and then they they dive in abalone and i it is the song i could have heard anywhere else but it was the fact that it was shot from above that it was black and white and that he adds this little riff at the beginning you low moubaby but shut up and then just dives into it that made it for me as a huge demons fan else i it think i did that in my kitchen yet you hope because when you going just listen to a song that is record as part of an album you are not can to get those additional pieces back in the day and still now you went to a live show you might see that and hear that never forget that but in that sense to me you too and and the areas a it is the art ark hive of jets that out mentally have been there maybe of seventy i would bee four years old and i and we thinks for sending me that club loved it came how much i love the demons but i things that i just think to the internet is just amazing and spectacular and the amountelectures you could find on you to unbelievable the the greatest thinkers in the world i want i do not wont to say our on you to because they being post on you to but their material this got you do and it is unbelievable things from old films from fifties and sixties it is all on you to i been messing a bible interpretation on you too and there is just it is interesting to hear different interpretations and ever perspectives and i would have never found these people must have learning things pleased the other good ism ism train of work through the old testament start to finish now as a as a learning in a practice and well o case the question was are smart phones the chains that bind us and prevent our creativity i but i think you answer that it is both a rocket ship to creativity ana and and chains to the ground and it is all other tools the toolston't make or break your art it is just it is another tool you can use it for is used some one wanted to know and i would to know whether not you have any recurring dreams and what are your thoughts on dreams and dreaming in general do you write down your dreams to you spend time have think on about them have gone through phases of my life rave written down dreams ism not doing it right now i think we can learn a lot from from writing our dreams i can not to analyzed them in the moment but have noticed when have kept a dream journal and looked at years later the sere el things that made no sense were all same the same thing and they were all very clear based on my life experience at that time gives us close as to what is actually going on the we are subconscious is experiencing our lives it is giving us i do not know if i would call them pointers u reflections may be be better word our mutual friend pal county believes that the unconscious or subconscious u both used interchangeably is the supercomputer of the human brain that the misconception is that the forebrain which is involved in planning and constant and anticipation of outcomes et camera people think that is the supercomputer but that the supercomputer s the unconscious that is pal's belief hes stated that very clearly on the podcast and elsewhere and he believes that in dreams the unconscious mind is controlling more of the dialogue which makes a lot of sense but also that the unconscious mind is constantly trying to teach us things in the way that we learn best that my dreams for instance are all analogies cause that is pretty much if people listen an he talk on the pots i often we use analogy a and or very visual will present things to me in visual symbols pal said interns of dream interpretation that we would all be wise to think about how we learn best and our unconscious mind is trying to toss us things in dreams to explain things in the way that we learn i make sense and i would say also unconscious and our instinct the way we act instinctual is a reflection of our unconscious and as artist that is a tapping into that the instinct and unconscious is were the great ideas are and then things that come from our u intellectualselves are are much less there they have much less of a charge they are much smaller ideas i think the ad that the conscious mind and the intellectual mind as ye here calling it are bound to outcome in a big way ism an injected a question of my own ism fascinated by the way you have discussed people's real underlying motive patience and how that shapes there creative process but also their career if you would be willing to talk all bit about the story of andrewdise clay that is the story that to me captures it best endudice clay a was a a comedian who told really offensive jokes and is audience leveled for it but the people who warrant his audience did not really understand it and they vilified e and he became a comedian because he want people to love him he did not become a comedian to hurt anybody he wanted o entertain people and while he was playing to sold out malison square gardens full of people newspapers would write terrible things about him and it really got to him and he decided to change his artistic output to try to make the people who did not him him and when he did that it undermine his whole gift and it just it seemed things fell apart i think he is in a better place now i have not i have not seen him in a while but i think he is in a better place now and he is back to a caring less about the reaction and in turn getting a better action i because he is being pure in what he thinks is funny i liked him very much in fact i thought he did a spectacular job as playing the female artist's father in a star is born gently goon i bragcoop e a really good actor is great actor what i really the story about him because it encapsulate much that if people can think about why they do what they do they are gan avoid pitfalls i potentially but how much time do you think people should spend introspecting about what makes them take and why they want to entertain or make jokes sir m i do not think it is one siseitsi know now that i could answer that question is it true that arch and courage you to give legal cool jay a chance yes that is true arch heard the detonate and insisted that i listen to it wat of that this is a kind of generic question but i think it is good to put these in everyone in a while what is your advice to a starting comedian he not the of the the sort of as i i ways thing the is i sophomore and high school kind i question but that does not mas silly mean their bad in some sense that is what makes it such a great question what would be your advice be to a starting comedian be treat to yourself a not to listen to any one there you go he will be a great book except to be a very short book butter o also make it very great be i wok could be a blank a just put all e things that you want a put in it and i working on a book now an it'll tell you it is hart by the way i asked rick for advice about bookwriting i because ism been trying to wite this book for a while and and he gave me this the falling advice am injackin my own question he said the sooner you can get to a complete right that you are happy with or happiest with the better the process will go ism working on getting that complete drug i would say do not focus too much on any the individual details unto you have the whole thing down man you can focus on all making everything better that you want to make better do not get of found in that at the expense of getting through the project your advice has really been helping me by thigh ay doing it like diary entry great i know and have kept a diary for many years that somewhat natural tell me little bit aback diriintris how long how long is the dirty sure yet i a diary entry is anywhere from i one to eight hand written pages single line spacing going back and forth between es start in all capitals and then which over to curse give as i speed up have been doing that since godson's high school have got a drawer filled with them dated in everything and i it is usually a process a just trying to get something out of my system that i feels is clogging me some frustration wit the outside world but it some times this morning i journal a in the room before you showed up and i just was thing one writing high off r nestling last night i was marvelling house similar the great experiences of my life a now as they worked it every other stage in my life in the sense that they give me this feeling of get there these gems and ism and of people you and others and experiences and ism finding them ism experiencing them and reminding myself that they are they are long periods in between those moments where things feel kina not empty certainly not empty but e him frustrating in the sense that am busy and ism dealing with a munch of things and things do not feel smooth and i but have ben through enough for these cycles that i just it in really learning to enjoy the cycles and that was it and i and i think the last line in my entry with something in it and i cannot wait for more or something this morning is just a very plosive entry but sometimes i ben there deftly some tearstained entries and there dutifully come entries where ism just pest i can barely get the writing out but it is it is a process one getting that stuff out than i can lean in to the day do you ever go back and look at them i did the other day because i recording an episode on a very particular type of journalling that supported by over two hundred purerevieed studies which is called expressive writing i can all you about it i cannot reader it is a process that was developed by names pennabaker who is a professor university attests busting and he had his students it as part of an experiment for fifteen minutes a day for just four days other consecutive days or a week apart but about the same thing and the thing that they ares it to write about as the most challenging upsetting or even aromatizing experience of their life and it shows that the data from over two hundred studies show incredible positive shifts in psychology physiology immune system function and ability to combat infections i was struck by the data from this work that i decide to dedicate a whole podcast episode to it it probably out by time am this episode airs but am i have not done that one yet man to do it it is little bit of a her big of entry cause i o clan i here that the first day especially as pretty upsetting cause you are purposely picking something really hard but am ye but most of the journal i do is just kind of diary hears what happen here is what is going on and my biggest fears that somebody would find them but in preparation for that episode about pen baker i went and look to my journals and like what do i write about and i realize their pretty autobiographical ism sometimes about troubling things but never before had i written four times in a row about the exact sympathy interesting now the penobaker give think deserves a noble prize if you look at the date on this compared to and ism not disparaging description drugs person but accessory eyes for depression it is at least as good a treatment s zero cost stuff but it and and on an on you do not otto be careful let are given the podcast again now there were a number of questions about quote quote entertainment and music industry none of which unfortunately were particularly complimentary of quote the industry and i think the cyst something that comes a blot because people often focus on the marketing the personalities that may or may not be pleasant at times ism sure their to pleasant personalities in the industry to but the question is this how do you deal with the and these are their words hole crushing anti creative aspects of the entertainment industry and hold on to that sense of creativity and love for the work ism just focus in the work i do not think of myself part of the em the entertainment industrial complex i just make the things i make an man the are other people who are thou it figuring out has seldom or get them into stores a getting on to services do you have a process of capturing ideas you write them down and the reason this question came up many times i think is that lot of people feel it get great ideas write upon waking or while driving or in the shower random times and they were wondering whether not you have any way of collecting and curating your ideas prior to embarking on quotenquote a project i i write them i make notes in my then i do it all the time i do not have a great way of doing it and sometimes i make n to and then come back to it later and have no idea what it means do you make those notes a by writing or by a voice mamma writing that said voice mama might be a something worth trying have not never tried that how do you viol money in relationship to your work meaning how do you place it in the constellation of things related to a project et you mentioned early you let other people do the negotiations but money is just another form of energy how do you place it in t in the contour of what you do i do not i try not think it at all and i because i come from pom crockbackground which was a do it yourself background it was always more about the idea and the execution of the idea with what ever you could use to do it if i did not have a enough to go to a professional recording s studio than i would find a friend who had homes recording studio in record or whatever it was or borrowing a drum machine when i before i had to drum machine i would always find ways to make the things i wanted to make and dam i cannot remember a time where a financial boundary got in the way of making something and i see it happening a lot around me and it dam i think some people look at it as the money is what allows it to happen and i think i jut see it as the ideas what allows to happen and then the ingenuity is figuring out how to do it with by any means necessary just go to make it whatever the that version is it may not be the dream version but whatever version you can execute is the one for you to make i can attest the fact the i launch my podcast in my closet in to panga canyon which felt teethe natural cause i also come from the scape boarding poncrock thing were when ever occur to me t get a professional studio built were now we have this one built for us but at the time course he is a closet cause you just need a black back drop and i think starting from there make much sense and you also realize in the minimalist approach anything added is just something added say you do not really know what you need if you start with a lot of stuff around y ye it is it can just be a distraction am friends were therein arinaski his great director and his first move you was call pi and he made it for practically no money and it was really well loved and then the next moving he made was also withwildly successful and he made it for very little money and then he made this huge hundred million dollar move and it was not it turned out not to be a success that move and it was a case of where having more money did not help him tell a story it is just one particular case am and it is no rule to follow but there is something about make king reversion that you can make with the means that you have that adds something real to the project that may be better than the one that has lot of money thrown at it thing that sink in around a lot of online tutorials for science have a lot of visuals but we knew we wanted to do you two but all such just pure audio and there is nothing more frustrating than somebody talking about something or somebody that you cannot see cause you are dustless thing to it ah and the visuals were really expensive to do right and in the end i think if p i firmly believe in the class room as well as via podcasting if people can here something clearly enough in great an image in their own mind of how they would visualize it then it is in there for good whereas just having people look at a slide with with a bunch of beautifully illustrations on it that does nothing for retention of material i think the minimalist approach i think sometimes is really the best one maybe it is always the best one because it forces the better solution the in any case i do realize i editorialized their folks i entered the answering portion of the not just the question asking portion have you ever felt that something was too obscure for main stream audience appeal to the point where you did not release it ever tell tell us more if i lack something someone else maybe they it i do not know how can i judge how can i judge every have been told with every nothing that have done it is a terrible ideinitle work every single time really every single to get o boys eel cool j nasty boy slayer a dell every one of them madam every one every time when i went from producing rerecords to produce slayer you cannot do that your sure rap producer it is going to be terrible do not do it or then johnny cast you cannot do that you are a metal rap producer you cannot do that is going to be terrible do not do it every single time still to the day still to this say i was excited when you launch tetrogramatson and it is going well i listen to every episode i love the interviews give been fortune to be on their twice i thing the second one is still has m man release yet but i mention tetrogrammaton because it just feels you like the deletes chi talked about it during my into but the aeries are amazing i listen to the drives over and over again because there clever and they i do not they put me in a state i fee am watching ism em transported to as if i was born in the nineteen forties ism listening to television for the first time there is there is something there there is really something there it it is it came out of solving a problem the problem was a when i decided to do the podcast idea even reported the first several episodes ism a friend of mind said well you can have do if you want to have a adds on the show to support being able to do the show then you are gong have to read the adds and i said i do not really feel comfortable reading as i do not think that something i can do well i said ism cool with the idea of only advertising products i believe in or that i use us that is if i get to essentially promote something it'll do that with things that i use but do not feel comfortable reading it mum and is who you have to it is going to be expected of you and it was just an opportunity was a o ka i understand its expected of me what can i do that is true to me that ad something instead of it being less than how can i make it more than and it was just solving this problem of needing a way to have not advertisement that i did not feel bad about and then got inspired and had this idea an start making them and now there my favorite thing in the podcast when it when it in many podcast honestly when hit adds come up i forward through them when i as a listener on petrogramaton when i when it commercial comes on i always listen to them it is it is a it is a highlight and they make me smile which is it get an again i did not set out to do that i i just was trying to solve a creative problem sometimes the yum the invite of ideas do not come when you are looking for an negative idea it is just there is this slot to fill this is the way it is normally done ism not comfortable doing it the normal way how else can we solve this problem and sometimes it does not just solve the problem but it becomes an actual feature yo there is something about that likesolution seeking that is part of or at least as a line with the creative possess my a yet the afar or extraordinary we let thing tit in italy i played that when again i love the way the i says there were shilagit it is that shellaget there is something like but in it but i i gat to the as at for dot do not take what i just said is as a evidencing what the added australia accent i that dash yologet and the chime is in the back says cad you do not drink alcohol cat correct have you ever had a sibovalcol i had i drank alcohol once as part of a class experiment and had to mix all these drinks and taste them and i it was a terrible experience but it was it was a requirement in the class i was taking while out school was different back than or that school was different i think school was different he's to prick our fingers into our own blood toss in the sin never did i i ways always needlefobic but that was definitely something that was asked of us to do yet you and never get away with that now n in he high school classroom the reason i ask about calls it firs s all ism not the anti ill call crusader even though i do an episode about it'll call which discourage many people from drinking more of it but i think for a lot of people the idea of smoking cannabis drinking alcohol for them in their mind is synonymous with the creative process especially music i for the lot of reasons that people can imagine i think it is remarkable and impressive and worth spending a few moments you sharing with us how is that you were around all of that you are clearly part of the part of the true a meaning your part of that the creative process presumably people offered you ia'lcohaul drugs et camera but something in you seems resisting to any kind of pure pressure and and as an adult that impressive but to think i can old g when i was six fifteen sixteen sure it for regret it but y i drank i i had my experiences and then eventually stopped that but most people are not good at i not drinking if they do not want to drink ever or just once from a high school class what what was the internal narrative in your mind ism when that stuff was around and what allowed you to just i not man it i belong here but ism not gan do that it is just was never interesting tin me and i i think maybe had to do being only child i it'd never being only child i think made me less resisting to pure pressure because i felt more confide in who i was whatever that was i just from being with my being with myself and not with other siblings ism guessing i do not know that is right but that is my first my first inclination is to guess that would be the case also have always known what i and known what i do not and know there are things i want to try their things i do not want to try and i feel very good about not doing something i do not want to do if great about it have you ever been curious about psychedelic's given that ism very curious have never done it but ism very curious and have been curious for a long time the may be time when i experiment if there two psyched helicon particular that i find really interesting one is a macro sylisivin which have done as part of a clinical trial ism in my understanding is it reveals in a very intense and experiential way some component of the unconscious mind and allows for plasticity and rewiring of the brain that is permanent if you come to some understanding through the called integration it is not without its risks the other one that is really interesting that have been hearing more about and i have not tried and carries some dangers as i begin which is twenty two hours long and people experience the world as normal with their eyes open but when they close their eyes they get a high resolution move version of prior experiences but they have agency within those movies they can reshape their reactions this being as to treat pities and veterans at to great success it has some cardiacarisk associated with it and it is not legal in the united states it is not being explored in clinical charges yet but the state of kentucky recently took i think it is forty million dollars from the ox contain settlement and it is putting into again research interesting now those are the two that kind of spring to mine the onconthe classic sycodelic experience heard things bout tibia mad but i n yet i have done em a may is part again as part of therapeutic trial it is a strong in pathogen the danger with em drama i think is that if you do not stay in the mask or if you are listening to music or something you can easily get anchored to some external cut and see a plant to be i love plans and spend the whole forth six hours thinking about your love of plants which might be valuable but i think the strong introspective work it is best done with a therapist there and you in the eye mask and occasionally leaving the eyelash in writing things down the reason i put that detail in their is that the psychedelic experience is very different with eyes open verses in the mask with a cognition there versus recreational and that is not just about dangers verses safety it is also about they it is a big investment and what one stands to get out of it i think depends on how much introspection you are willing to do we will not be doing it this afternoon there were at least a thousand questions about a tension definite and fanaticism people who feel they cannot organize themselves and i thought a lot about these questions and tried to distill them into a single question and eventually i did and it is this for many people they associate the creative process with disorganization i think what is striking about you is that you embody both the creative process but also a strong sense of organization around it nothing seems heir brained or in random or haphazard about anything that you do and yet for a lot o people who call themselves creatives the they will say of a creative this that in et you will look at the space therein chaos where they or there life is kind of chased not all of them but is what ism saying making sense cause i think why people orient toward you and one of the reasons for your success with the creative process is that you are extremely organized but not to the point of being rigid you willing to embellishable bit on that perception weather not it is accurate in alert say there is a part in the process early on where it is before it can get organized were it is free and it is playful and it can be chaotic ism it is just not the it is a by product of whatever happening if it is not it is good because its chaotic and it is it just happens to be sometimes chaotic in that and that experiment in the beginning you were we really playing with this idea of having fun and creating stimulation and seeing how it makes us feel an try a lot owe could try wacky things to get there am but then when it happens when you get that that feeling of all this is interesting haven't seen this before then it gets more um controlled but it starts in a very free place and i do not know if i would really use the word chaotic but it could be it certainly would not be wrong i would seem more free would be the word free no no expectation and total immersion in and improvisation that you are participating in that can go wherever it wants to go and you are cool allowing it to go wherever it wants to go and sometimes when it goes somewhere dangerous that is when it gets interesting the the i can understand that that danger aspect may it is why i wrestling i do not know but there is something about when you get to this the edges where this is not for everybody it can get very interesting speaking of stuff that is not for everybody and that to some people might have been shocking i remember here and get boys for the first time and a they are takin certain things pretty far when you are working with an artist and they venture out into that place where things are maybe even a little shocking what is that feeling for you internally is it how do you distinguish between shock value for its own sake and something that is really opening up a new creative avenyou are insight how yo do you recall the first time you you heard bushwhack and egis do their thing well what was your internal narrative i cannot believe it i cannot believe what they saying it is really a pushing the boundaries of what any one has said in this music before it had switch because the the original in originally en rap there was a lot of boasting about themselves dragging and then we got to the message happened and there was some social commentary then there was banks to rap and then the ghetto boys took a version of banks t a and turned it into horror rap which was much more graphic than gas to rap gangster rap was talking about a a real life situation where is the get boys took it into horror move territory it was more fantasy but it seemed really scary at the time in the way that you are scared at a great harm move do you harmony i do not do you monster movies o where it is not real it is impossible a as suppose to her movies where it is people getting killed by another human stuff that could happen in the world verses you in a monsters and somber and that kind of thing i do not think i really through them very much i things that make me feel good i do not really a preplan i do not to be excited for some reason in audio i something that makes me excited but in visuals i cannot toke things that make me excited interesting and you are able to con of clean yourself of experiences easily i it seems if you listen to something it is really shock and you do not carry that shock to your sleep beats of the next day it does not trouble but a move can can impact me there was a move called melancholy that i saw years ago largsvon tree move and i thought twas very beautiful move but i was in a bad mood i would say for three months from the time i watched that move on it just did something to my brain that did not feel good and it could not snap out of it senhor there there are few movies that have done that to me the move blue valentine which has done really well m which is with a ruin gosling and some one elsewhere it is a relationship i will not explain what happens in the a to the relationship but it just the move haunted me there is one seen where he is wearing a is fit shirt and all i i and that is a a particularly good seen where he is singing to her i but the rest the move just brings about such feelings alike just how hard life can be sometimes and how misguided peopled can be in relationship and it it is interesting how movies can just kind of in bed in us it is not pleasant i want talk about anymore there were a number of questions asking about how you consume information in the world related to what is happening in the world where do you get your news from you not talk about the lot how how do we know it to trust these days ism did should we have ever trusted the news worse is it lest trustworthy now i where do you get your in formation about what is happening in the world and stay a breast of world affairs i i honestly i do not fee i know anything about it i am i tend to look at t all wrestling if the story good i might be more interested in the story but i still do not hold much a belief that that story's true i do not know what to believe any more a i was asked to comment on a particularly well known person who is not considered very savory why a couple news avenues in the last couple of years and am i soft know how people haw in mind that i would have knowledge about this person and and i gave zero information to these news outlets and ism none the less they they they did not publish quotes for me but they they publish things that i know to be completely false and they know to be completely false i i was just struck by the fact that li can scientific publishing that would get you if you would lose your job you for ever well at one point in time you would have lost you job now i do not know if that is true if you lose your job cause we see it happening a lot right e it is wild have you ever read anything about you that is not true oh ye o ye case we base on absolutely i mean that some of it is playful stuff on readmit and now they've flagged as as play they have a little flag that they can put as comedic or something but oh sure i mean things not just taken out a contact with things completely wrong i just that i do not don't even power if you wild get the stuff from i keep waiting for the thing that men to see that says that ism dead that will be the moment base on that experience why would you believe anything you read about anyone else you u u get to see first hand that there just stories just not true and presumably you have seen things written about you that are not surely right absolutely right an arrest i know friends of mine they writ things about i i know it is not true wild what do you think about the state of play and is the experience of being apparent and having a young child has that allowed you more opportunities for play and desex the world through child lenses in a greater capacity or i be anal just separate from their creative process i would say ism fairly child all the time i ti to stay as a open the beauty of childhood is that you do not know you have not been am in indoctrinated yet you you see things and you have wonder about them and it is a great feeling that feeling of wonder and now when summer i out tell you story this is a be true story my friend own came over one night in the middle of the night and he had just seen am luminescence in the water for the first time and he had did not know what what it was and thought he was having mystical experience and the is excited that you will not believe what happened the the waves were there was light everywhere it was cool it'd never saw anything it and i ye that a luminescence and i explained what it was and it destroyed the magic for him he was really having a child magical experience and i destroyed it i telling how the science behind it i try to live in a world where i can experience what he experiences and i do not let be story ruin what is i low the possibility to go past what ism told the story is but that things can be even wilder than the rational explanation for me learning the reductionist science behind something to me dad's depth and beauty but then again i realize on have been in indoctrinated into the the field of science the matrix they call it bema tricks this one i did not understand madam as soon that you understand because it has to do with people you have worked with if rick had casually dropped that the round's name themselves after the fake last name palmar carney used to check into hotels during beedolmania with that of blown mandrel's mind this a got a were chit i guess the question is is it true that the round's name themselves after the fake last name that palmar carney used to check into hotels during beedolmania hum i do not know that i do not know if that is a true story i do know that pal my carney used the name pal bemoan when checking into hotels but i do not know if that is where the remount's got the name got it and here is how rumors turn in to cotton cot facts on therinernet we had not also maybe the pal remind story is not true either but that story have heard right that reminds me and and i think this is a important case in point that there is a what i consider a very famous photograph of you johnny cash jo strummed and henry crawling you are wearing a dead kenned sure the four of your facing one another and i love that photograph because if who as in it and i remember hearing a rare track from strummed in the mescaleros called on the road to rock and roll and then for some reason probably because my phone is tapped in to my brain i was served up of video on social media of henry raglans telling the story of that gathering of the four of you where crawling as describing the story of of job strummed leaning in to johnny cash and saying hey i wrote a song for you it goes on the row to rachoqe and i remember coming you and saying rick guess what remember that photo you you remember the photo i said you have raglans has the story of what was happening in that moment now excited and his et you said yet i do not remember that it might be true it might be true but it might be entirely made up also we are not calling henry a lyre but henry i i believe enrilyly has remembers that story and that was this experience that was not my experience or i do not remember being my experience but who knows anything could have been said it is true anything could have been said it had as much to do the fact that i do not remember has much to do with whatever i was thinking about when that happened and the story that henry told had s much to do with what was going on and henry said when it happened we have no idea it is we have no idea you remember somebody shooting the photograph i do not it'll put a link to that photograph on the air at a really incredible gathering of have seen the photo but i do not remember it kingship ism looking for a high resolution version of that photo if anyone can find me wen all be happy to compensate you well there were a lot of questions about your daily routine people of this the morning routine the daily routine and wile i have to believe that everybody's necessary routine is quite different from the next um if you would not mind just giving us a sense of the first couple hours of your day what that typically looks one yer not travelling in your settled into to a place it is different depending on the place that ism in but typically it involves waking up going out into the sun as naked as possible to start the day i try to tie slowly a wake up slowly and probably within an hour of that i love the house and go fer as long as ti beech walk as possible or if i in a place withe's a him several days a week it'll go to the him instead but some it'll do some activity i would say about an houraphter waking up sometimes its an hour and a half s betimes less tepennig on the place on that i also might do stretching before i go on he walk undo to several stretches on bogamats on the floor work a with fumrollers or balls or some different things i do not start my day until those things are out of the way i try to avoid any work related anything now that is that said if a thought comes up that ism excited about it'll knot it i will not due avoid thoughts but i tend not to engage in any work in till probably eleven o'clock eleven a and would be the soonest and in and some days not until one o'clock and then i do focused work until may be six and than it'd spend the rest of the night ah trying to wine down out of work m one p m to six pi to really the peak probably pita work hours an could be eleven to let to day we started here at eleven and that felt i felt it'd be good by eleven and i ready did my my morning walk i had to argument on the beach i a was in the sun i was in hot tab a hat a whole whole morning already and then what is your evening line down look in terms of the space that you are in ire trying to create and your internal landscape well it is only red light u ism usually wearing i from the time sunset some working red glasses ism mini space with only red light an ninety nine per cent o the time home with my family and we talk i might watch a resting or a documentary with red glasses on we eat dinner together or we eat dinner in shifts depending on how it is working but were all were altogether and i find something to occupy my mind that gets me out of the work day that said sometimes the ideas still flow and it'll note them but i avoid i avoid any kind of a work phone call or anything that is stimulating or that will get me thinking about it i aim for sunset and then ism usually in bed i'musualg in bed by ten and and befallsleep within fifteen minutes your relationship to light is fascinating the sunlight piece makes a lot of sense and will make sense to the listeners this podcast we have not done too many episodes but we will do more that covered the trying to avoid bright light exposure in the evening i you are wearing the red a lends glasses now even thauhi's the middle of the day that is because we have got these bright lights around us correct and have you found that limiting your bright artificial light exposure in the evening has benefited you and resolutely and and once you have done it once you have changed and avoid the looking at screens or might my phone turns red at night when i see someone ease's phone if someone comes to visit and their phone lights up at night it is blinding and it is disturbing and for them that is normal they are in this heightened blown out place all the time ism staying at neutral ism saying it at the then the more natural how how the world would be if man did not create all desk these loud things you had loud you devices have switched my phone thanks to your in put in we will have released a clip on this i by time this episode airs on the triple click approach to the phone that you can put in very easily i too allow it to go from regular screen to red screen at night the you soft have to go into the settings yo show me just triple click an will provide a link to that am explanation and rick taught me that when i was over in italy even in is home turned to me and a said way your phone is bright you got to do the red light thing i said i do not know how and it taught me that s it's a very useful treat i have you notice the difference since looking huge positive difference i sleep better there a great dado now cause of course i go then find the data that i you now for shift workers people that have to be up at night working if they put them under red light the ye amount of cactus all at that time is suppressed which is great m as compared to wen they're under bright artificial lights without red lends glasses were if there and red lights its far far more beneficial lass charts all you want costs all high early in the day viewing some light early in the day increase it by at least fifty per cent than you want to taper off ah and on and on i heard something recently which is going make a lot of sense one thing that is happen in the last thirty years which may at least partially explain the obesity crisis is that calories which are depleted of nutrients much neutrinos are very cheap now see their very cheap to get calories but they are not nutritious chcallories in addition there is been a change in lighting technology that blue light photons are her e cheap when i was a kid they my prance is a turn off the lights it is costing us all this mint now it is very cheap to keep the lights on in a home the heat is a different story but with respect we have a lot of cheap phaetons i think of blue light as cheap phaetons not the good for you photons not nourishing photons it is and consuming calories too often earth the wrong times of day we know as bad for you consuming phaetons in the wrong form at the wrong time a day bad for you and i think those the two things combined plus all the downsthrough negative cascades can largely explain the obesity and in some sentimental health crisis interesting i just a there i editorialized again i realize that replenish if the ratio the more rick less drew you cannot help cannot help himself and rick indulges me sis you there are umber of questions in here that asked me what how is rick help to you and i ism refraining from i answering those coins people want your answers for them but i do all the things that rich referring to ism not wearing red let's glasses now but i have changed a lot of my health practices and or sought out science to tasked whether not some of the things that you have been doing for a while make sense and indeed in every case they have made sense ism not just saying that to because you're here but you and i do a lot of the same nan were were interested and if it did not work we probably stop don eventually it the would testing rights right and i do believe that what starts out as crazy mike fence er stuff of low volume weight training with heavy weights it work much better than the high volume that all that stuff is being shown to be true in these the review trial yew that is the nature of science it often comes science often follows the practitioners by many decades it does not get there first because it is a slower more iterative process but some people need to see those clinical trials to feel comfortable doing something i think that creative process is uniquely separated from academic science and academic scholarship in a way that i think has really benefited am youmaginet if the get o boys had to get a degree in music theorem in order to do what they do they wen you gentoboys my or slayer hey would not be slave year public enemy year are year emblem and it is it is almost by virtue of the fact that there is no degree for that per say that allow them to do what they did right absolutely what are your thoughts on schooling and higher education or just education em you were at and we you when you launch your record label you graduated and why i dit what your thoughts on getting of a join duo formal education it seems i an obsolete idea i think maybe there was a time we would have been helpful i maybe depending on if the thing that he want o study can only be learned in institution maybe it would make sense but i think the real world m getting an internship or a m finding the right mentor and going into whatever the thing is that you are interest in learning about learning from people who do it a supposed to the the system i think i think might be more better use of your time the creative process does not exist in a vacuum and relationships are a huge part of life one thing that have heard you say and that certainly have been working to internalize s this idea that whatever relationships one has in their life romantic relationships are not married or not kids or not that the ideal circumstance is where one's work is the most dreadful part of their life yes you tell us more about that ye the home is the em the safe place from which you can go out and be a warrior and do all these great things and these crazy things youknow i have ism fearless when it comes to art ism not fearless when it comes to life life is my relationships art is where we can do these crazy things and have fun and try extreme things and see what happens and its ta sit that is a safe place to do that because it is it is just expression it's not them the things we make do not have to represent who we are there just the things we make and that is a point of views this is interesting to me in this moment check it out that is all it is may have a completely different feeling to morrow what's in relationship it is it is long term hopefully and it is it is as long term as it is pprodtive relationship where everybody is getting what they want from that relationship everybody's needs are being met and everybody cares enough to meet each others needs have always admired how rational you are about relationships and this notion that if everybody is not being honest there is no relationship actually not it is a bad relation but there is actually no relationship now because if you if you if some one's not telling the truth then each person is experiencing a different understanding of the world you're living into different worlds they are not there never actually together when you are experiencing a different world s unless you can you do not have to agree ism not saying you ill have to agree on everything t you have to be truthful in saying this is how i see it and your partners clear and yes this is how i see it or no this is how i see it you are on the same you are on the same page even even in disagreement but it is real it is your your being who each of your being who you are for and with the other but if you are not opening yourself up in that way to your partner you rein a different world they have an idea of what is happening that is completely different than what you have an idea of what is happening that is not that is not being together no masks no no it is it is the same as when you said earlier about lying in your diary you would only be doing it a service to yourself lying in a relationship would only be doing it a service to yourself minas of social distortion as a song called cheating it solitaire which seems an appropriate title to mention right now an lying in the diary cheating it solitaire is ridiculous does not make any sense no your not you are not actually playing the game you don't i mean if you are cheating at it you are not actually playing the game the whole point of the game is the game if you cheat at it you are not playing the gate do you have any must read books for people it'll all throw one out ricks book on the creative act a way of being a but in addition to that book what are some books that you recommend to people for stimulating thought or for a i i do not know health purposes or things that you found particularly beneficial and book for my favorite book about meditation is called wherever you go there you are and i just got sent the thirtieth anniversary edition which is completely rewritten i have not yet read the retie rewritten version but i love the original version and i know the rewritten version ism guessing that the rewritten version is just more refined and even better such a great book that book was given to me y when i was bout fourteen and a half when i was a released from a particularly uncomfortable nova voluntary a state of affairs and if one of the things that i remember about that book that help me through many years of life and i have to go back to is this mountain visualization meditation being a mountain i do not know i was helpful but goodness was it helpful for m a beautiful idea it is a beautiful idea know i thought of that just now but ism to go back and read it do you think that there is genetic abiogenetic family lineage stuff unrelated to genetics that leads us to create things that are really about our ancestors the for instance am is it possible that ah let us take let us take johnny cash for instance or an artist save you worked with more recently chilly papers that when they got together to make music that something from anchovy's family line was being transmuted through him in into the songs ah n is that happening do you thing that we can work out and and include things that are generations far back enough that we do not we do not even really know what happen to them i m it is coming through in ourgenes i think it is certainly possible but i i do not think we can know and i do not think it is necessarily even helpful to know it just is one of those mysterious things i do not think we know why we do many o the things we do and it is just another example of that and that is possible fury you explain why we do the things we do maybe but there may be another one it may be a euros are controlling us i do not know do at ism sayings it could be anything there are people on the interthat things that seuefos that are controlling i i would not am i would not disagree with that more or more evidence is coming out that that unidentified flying objects might hint i should be a documented phenomenon by the you us government i have not looked into it yet but i would not be surprised when you were on this podcast before and on several other podcast you mention that you do not play music at least not routinely a you do not play an instrument in that you have limited knowledge of how a sound board works when you are listening to artist are you listening for something or your staying open for something that you might here it that that will trigger a certain state in you that you recognize ism opened just see what is happening i i feel what is i i listen and recognize is this making me lean forward am i curious to see whats can happen next is hit thing that happens next different than what i thought was can happen next that could be interesting you i listen about of music when it does not do what is expected that is really interesting specially if it sounds good for works ism just open to experiencing what it is and it'll say something funny about it which is this this all sound a mystical i do not understand it but often you can tell lot about the piece of music ligan listen to based on the first sound you hear the first moment it is not about what no od it is it is not about what instrument it is it is ah intention in the performance and that performance could even be a machine the way when something starts sometimes is is feeling of up this is going to be good just out of the don't the down be cannot explain reminds me of dating and within half a nan o second this going to be a fun night to be interesting night this person's interesting or bouquet this is not a night to continue rid at another something an and it is not what said necessarily or even how it is said just it is a it is a the feeling i know that depending on how ism feeling it'll avoid listening critically to something film not feeling well if ism if i do not fee i can be completely there an open it'll not listen i i know i know i want e really be there for the thing that ism all listening to do you inform people if i am not here to day a i cannot sometimes yet sometimes as somebody who has never been part of the music production process how long does it take for an album like ell let us throw out an artist of worships you were to theine how long did that but you did some songs on that albumen the whole laid them songs did he come in with those written and then you got work together on this songs how long was that a week a month a day i think we were together for several weeks it is been low enough now that i cannot remember the specifics but there there is no rule of how that works and sometimes things come together very quickly and how can be made in a weekend and some albums are years in the making when it is use in the making it is rarely every day for years in the making it is usually more episodic but there is something both versions are very interesting and it something that comes out almost fully formed very quickly has particular energy and then something tit is made over time can have all of those individual moments all the changes that happen within you over that period of time those can all be reflected in be the difference between a daily diary journal and reading three months it is different the two different things cannot say one's better than the other they are just to different things some projects are more a years diary and some are more a weekend its same you know you watch a move movie the moving story takes place in twenty four hours and sometimes it is a person's lifetime one's not better than the one's not a better method than the other it is whatever suits the work speaking of your work with them an em but also with case and w the by boys and others you are featured in a number of the virus you show up in those videos whose decision was that and on what your thoughts on music videos i remember when music videos first came out oh empty the era and just thing this is local i can see the artists see how there draft the the crazy styles and all of that that accompany the music two questions one whose decision was it to be in the bios hit is producers often are not included in the videos you would always be if the artists ask they would be the only reason would be there and too o what your thoughts on music videos and the idea that then it puts a very strong visual to the the song whereas were there not to be video people could just imagine something based on what there hearing and hearing alone they are two different their two different things is not a better or worse or sometimes where the video makes the song better and there is often the case where the poetry of the words ah if you close your eyes and listen to what the words are as e listener you get to participate in that in creating that world in your head is sometimes photographs can tell us too much information it is too leading it limits the story to just this photograph the photograph tells you much more than the words the words can be interpreted in many ways and then we each get to have that experience it is something in the book that i was a cognizant of in picking the words was never to be specific to the point of where the reader does not get to par anticipate in this act it does not tell you what to think it is an invitation to think it is an invitation to say where am i in this what is my version of this it is not about anyone else it is about the reader and that was some it was a from the beginning that was always part of the my understanding of what i thought would be the most helpful the cover certainly embodies that that it it is not clear exactly what the cover design is coating wat suppose to be it is help into antelurtation interpreted as you wish and different people see different things let us get current what what a you working on now that you are excited about if you can share you see what i can cannot share could be broadcategories of things too began ism working on a couple of documentary projects that ism excited about and some albums that have been working on over time or are coming out i one is a credible singer gatartplay in a makes king his albums about to come out i the gossip is a band that i may bum with ten years ago and we just made a new album or we made an album may be eighteen months ago and that is coming out now those are the first ones that come to mine is the documentary process fun for you and how how do you approach that i watch a lot of documentaries to learn what i do not want to do i do not think have been inspired what may be some cases where i get inspired by what ism seeing but more often i sees things and a salsa these documentaries all have this format i know do not want it to be this format is more of a ruling out and it is fun to find new ways that review different information than the standard for madhouse interesting to me it will see if anyone else care you have an unique approach to podcasting i first all whatever your criteria for her you invite on as a guest and second i what d you have in mind when you sit down and podcast m i have some ideas about your in answer but i think it is important that ism not inject in that d i think people are ingrain this even if they do not want a podcast because i think it it gets to the process of something that you are doing now and how you are doing it now ye i i did not set out to do what have about to tell you i don't set out to do this but it something that after i started doing it i came to realize it is an interesting thing and actually learn this from listening to you are podcast who actually leas podcast with you and i was listening to the podcast and i know let and i know you as a friends and both of you in addition to you talking the let you are talking of the audience and let in addition to talking to you talks to the audience and the audience was a participant in your conversation and i realize that in it the tetrogramatin podcast it is different than that it is to ore of an intimate personal the interview with you that has not come out yet that was me talking to you with no i certainly did not have any idea that anybody else was can to hear it other than yes someone ease's can to hear it but that is not what this is is is i was asking to questions i was interested in and i wanted to learn as much as i could and if you said something either that i did not understand i less you t explain it or if you told me story about something that sent me on a tangent that would i want to know more about this left side of what you said or the right side of what you said i would ask but only following my own interest it has a an intimacy it is turned into when i if i listened to a tedrogramat in podcast it sounds ism overhearing a conversation a personal conversation and it it has turned into parts of certain decisions we have made having there is music at the beginning and then you hear the guest more often than not is in the middle of a story and it is almost as if you have walked into a room and people are in this deep conversation and you just sitting on the side quietly in hearing this conversation and it is a real moment that is happening there and it is just different i cannot say it is better cannot say it is worse cannot say i do not know what what is interesting about it but something about it is interesting to me and when i listened to it i feel a different kind of an intimacy ism and again it was not premeditated this is after the fact ism looking aback and understanding oh this is what it is this is why this is different yet the podcast that i did with you on your podcast when i was featured as a gest the second time i i completely forgot that we were podcasting it was also good we would had a few days together oversees there we are in a very on account of isolated environment that helped me get out of the mode of there are listeners now there is no there is no sense of performance involved it is it could not be more casual and the reason i chose not to figment is because the nature one light's and cameras make it harder to forget that you are doing it i aim for it to be as i natural an experience that you can have the conversation that you really would have if there were no lights in cameras not that not that not to reveal anything it is just it is a level of comfort and openness where you are talking to somebody likens you are enjoying the conversation and that you i just have to she r that you are the first time we met in person you and i had faced time to number of times previous to that for the first time we met in person came over your house we ended up doing son and cold and i was going through a particularly challenging time in my life i mean it did really just hit me square in the face and i remember saying hapless and i i do not no we could talk about this but i just opened up about all f it and that is the moment when we were tot become friends anyway but that is where t things really to coff was i kept apologizing at the and ism sorry you said no no this is actually what we are spot to do and ism feel very grateful that we have remain close friends ever since and that catalyzed a lot but i think that one of the things i love about podcast not just podcasting but podcassis that the really a active podcast yours likes likes rogue and stroll him ferries did they really reflect the love and passion that the person has for that kind of conversation i man i can certainly say this about my podcast i been learning organizing and distributing information since i was six years old my podcast is just that you you real conversation and real things that are unburriered by the idea that may be some one can listen and howl it work out just we talked about earlier and you answer the questions that way and i think lacks likes likes his form of thing and job is doing his form of thing and i think that's to me one of the great gifts of podcasting if any one wants to know how to create us successful podcast quit in quote successful it is have the kind of conversations and talk about the kinds of things you really love cameroon hands as as lift run shoot podcast where you go to his house you would do a work out then you go for a run and then he teaches you archery and the reason it is effective is that he loves lifting running and shooting and then he is must any loves teaching people that the end of the day you are sitting down talking about a great day that embodies everything that he is about in and the person learned and that i could not do that podcast i can go on as a guest and i loved being guest but i think that is the message and it brings us back to what you are time out earlier and throughout to day's discussion just that if you are thinking about how it is gan a land how how could ad ever work it is just a different thing i had a conversation yesterday after the podcast with annul cola who have never met before incredible act her and beautiful human being and we probably talked for about three hours and it was a deep conversation and i feel i might have a dew best friend he is unbelievable to cool sky wasn't doing the podcast i do not know if i would am met am it just worked out it worked out the i got to meet this incredible person well it we covered most of the most frequently ask questions and you have been extra remedy gracious with your time and thoughtfulness in answering them and now what to say except thank you for taking the time to do yet another podcast to answer the audiences questions they were here in this podcast in the form of this very large stack of questions and of course your book includes a lot of information that in capsulate this but i think this really fleshes out some of the the details of how you go about things how certain things cannot be the same for everybody and i think in answering these questions you provided a great service to people whore perhaps still struggling with getting the creative process going or flowing ism certain that it is going to change the way that i focus and lean into my day have got a number different notes here and maybe i would be willing to share them with people but then that would go against the principle of this

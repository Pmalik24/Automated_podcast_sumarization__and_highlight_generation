to that do you have ever sheen on ta la we one can even be translated now which provide sheets with a wonderful opportunity to really all the experiences that she mist out on is yon do we wanerosso that is the thing you did ye repeople we to make friends can i let us go back to the inception of this idea you approached me and you said we should make a fictional film about this topic now be fair i think it'd actually suggested the grantors that they do this as a dock yes i originally went to them and i said you guys should go try after much ladies leagues and that became not possible because as it turns out most ladies leagues do not allowing actually men an brands a they were not willing to go tho full whitens in terms of what it would require in order to the actual hormone treatments in everything to plains from the ladies leas pot in any case it turned into this explain ye whet thing the thing that you have to understand is that i was getting ready to leave the country to go make our pendragon series on jury ninth and somewhere about mid march i thought would not it be crate if between to day and jury ninth we wrote and produce an entire future film lethe the craneboys mentioned the i did that you had given them and and had been in the back of my mind that we really should be making the movies at only we can make effect i think it is a long that you had had come up with an what are the things that only we can do i i thought what obviously there has not been a true comedy made since brokobama became president i mean brokobamma destroyed three things rokenroll comedy and america other than that he's a perfectly average president but it it became impossible to tell a joke during the atom administration cause gamma made this sort of pace with with culture shapers that they should change their fundamental understanding of themselves and in the case of comedians they should no longer you mock the absurd but the should be agents for social change the head rider of sanely famously said o know that they would make no jokes about brokobama he said there is literally nothing funny about this man it is as though he is carved from a a single piece of pure obsidian which in itself is one of the funniest things that any one has ever said cause if anything it was half of a slab of pure obsidian and the other was snow white marble little gracious but us ill a littler is but this is the view that they took a banana because if is sort of singular religious affect you could not make any jokes anywhere ever and you have seen i mean comedy has changed fundamental in that era and hollywood stop making these kinds of films you go back to the early two thousand yet some of the great comedies you know probably ins culminates a tropic thunder its starts with downfall into tropic thunder i miss those movies you miss those movies i think are odiensmiththitismovies and there is never been anything funnier re lockable and re laughably absurd an the main strafe part of our culture then letting grownasdp up if calling themselves checks admit is it is patiently absurd and soy it was lion there is there is a joke that needs to be told that only we can

come went er prumocod band an check to that is the pearl source stop come prumocood ben that is the craziest part of this is that basically they're was a scrap you ended of going through and rewriting a lot of the scrap you and it up tho resting the filming at of being the star of the thine that that was easily demanded by circumstances ties it the to the they are wort actors who are willing to be in the film because of all a i was getting ready to go to rope on the location gout and i sat down two writers that have worked with us in the past bran hodman and nixshian both really talented guys and i said goys ism leaving for two weeks when i come back any rescript uses what it has to be about i outlined for them what i wanted the the moving to be i went and scouted romania bulgaria and serbia to looking for places to shoot pendragon came back and they had had done yeoman's work they put together a script in that in that time they solved some pot elements that were really good but sort of every one that we approached with this idea originally no one wants to go all the way and i did a little work on the script to help assure that it went went the full distance and then we start going out to actors and literally every single actor that we went out to for every single roll told us snow and i want to be clear that this is not they read the ascription said this is not funny many of them told us no just point blank on the form when we pitch the idea and i also when to be cleared these are not actors we did not go out to let de cargo you we are going out to people who are on our side who have been telling us for years since we first got into movies we will do we will walk across broken glass to be in a daily wiremovy this is people who have in many cases already been cancelled and even they would say to us upon hearing this pitch is was the one thing no way that you you will never it is not just hat you will not work again you will be person an untrod and every room you ever w hey will fire you from a cannon into the son yesterday that is correct and it was really shocking i suppose it should not have been but to hear these already cancelled conservative actors who who wanted to do things with us just unwilling to touch the material and and that is when the sort of the idea of well what if it was just us what if the daily wire truly made the move that only the daily wire could make and we all had some trepidation about that going in i want to say though that i i cannot imagine any better way that it could have gone because if we would got any of those actors yes they would have had skills that we do not have they would not have taken the jokes as far as we took them they would not have been willing to go the distance and our guys particularly crane and to ya crane blame crane and avid cone they committed themselves completely to this process and i was telling you in the make up chair before we started the things the physical stuff they subjected themselves too you both from body transformation losing way gaining muscle all of that piece have at be then just also all the stunts the hard days we are working we hadn't eighteen hour day our last day and these guys ye they were they were e li eledathletes before they moved into the sports commentary space and you see you see it when you work with them just absolute dedication and completely hilarious and of course pretty much everybody cannas in this thing some have smaller can then others i no it is not very large but your canamiofs not very large but i will say it is the bluest comedy and the entire film it's true it is it is exactly what anyone who knows that your funny which is apparently no one on the left to never understand when you are making a joke but any one who actually watches your show will be there goes there goes been been and it is hilarious and a obviously we have everybody from rely gains to tad cruel makes an appearance ye in that well yo i i watched chatting crashers and it i ha in have you right an me it tut a has been tad has been itching for this all his life since he was doing i d o and then somehow ended up in the united states and it and also running for president what he actually wanted of use if he ad got in this when he was twenty he never would cavemen in polite i will tell you that that is one hundred per cent true and it is the perfect move for ted because what people may not know the man loves basketball its are play to you place to me can play be me camel and beat him i he he loves basket ball he wants to be an actor in fact have never told anybody this if actual the will be mad at me for telling i you he is in a tough election race right now back and texts an obviously the need ted cruse in the senate but i called him as it hay i know that there is no way you can do this but you should come to hungry and be in pendragon is have got a roll i will physically transform you will not be a cameo no one will know its you we will not market that you were in it it ill just you can actually come transform yourself and spend a week with us and actually act and i thought ism given a power his actual dream and then he reminded me the he has an actual chow wit enormous responsibilities but for this he is willing to come out into a cameo for a sin and was truly funny and i and then we played a little one on one and i do not have a dream of flying basket yes i was also skunked by a be it it is definitely all of your daily wire of favorites yes it matwalsh is it it he is hysterical you saw him there i know you may have missed him because he does not look awash but in fact that is mat wash with a manhunt ye you got got michael bull's and a brad cooper in it as well michael gives the most offensive performance in the film shocker i cannot believe it the most shocking i finally justifying that that is sailor ye and there cameos that we have not announced yet some other e people who who show up and a and get some laughs focus which as the as the day's draw toward the actual prefer will widely some of that input i wont t go through some of the tweets that is a the people been sending son mot most positive s to the reception on twitter particularly has been astonishingly good overwhelming when it is been probably twenty million views to displaying on twitter some where into neighborhood also we talk about this as thought is a controversial issue but cause the left pretense that it is a controversial issue virtually every human being alive to day and every human being alive and till to day has known that men should not competing is women in man's sports i mean that that blamecleb where he is picking up the girl and throwing her to the mat i mean i it is hilarious but but also it is hilarious because it is absurd and that you never be allowed under any circumstances and that is actually happening in the actual world no i can sat watching that be shot was difficult i mean we had a great professional stunt woman a true pro she is wearing of up skeleton body armor basically that is made to do this sort of thing and it is still hurt mean blame is lifting her off the ground an slamming her into the into the mat you have to do it over and over i felt bad for her she with such a trooper and i got in the van on the way home that night thinking man we are genuinely being terrible to women in the making of of this move and then i realized oh no this is real you can fight mama you are the first big logical man to fight against a woman in the idea broke her skull and the left is celebrating this meanwhile everyone knows it is wrong and only this weird virtue signaling social proof culture a causes us well not us but causes many people to pretend that they do not know that it is wrong and what i think it is great about our move is it does what comedy is supposed to do it actually points out an absurdity the move is the move is absurd but it is only is absurd is the real world we are just choosing to frame it in a way that to was you to laugh at it i think this move is is less i kin to dodgeball tonally it is dodgeball but thematically it is much less dodgeball and it is it is much more a a what was your move a that you turned me on to a about stall on death of stay path of stall and think yuan it is much more death of stall eggs underneath's an actual serious its the o tell actually what happened it is just locate laugh right exactly exact look case lit is look it some of the weeks o rely gain to a who is camping and that she says highlighting the absurdity of allowing men in women sports through comedy and whats supposed to be satire this is the way excited for this make sure to wash lady callers featuring me and some he most influential people in the conservative movement on t twelve one yet right rising it she is great you could not make a move about this topic and not have rely in the film set million from the bablonbeesas yes the man is must be mocked well ton chair me iu'llget to mention when i when best supporting actor for my part in this et i i i guess i was not there the day that that set was on at yo i i was trying to side who do we ask to cameo in the film and i needed some one who was the kind of bad low great guy who would allow himself to be tied to furnaces i the kind of grifter who would actually put forth men to participate in woman's sports and the first got i thought of of course with sethfillan a set has been good that this is actually whole i when i called than asked him to be in the film i said within all sincerity there very few people of be n more consistently outspoken on the assuredanc south and you which is the reason he on musk colonelcy owns ax that is e father o set methods in some ways some very directors contributed by making jokes about this topic he changed the world that try contributed to the preservation of free speech in our time and be out to have having station the move was was an honor and he is funny and likeness treated this is what we have all been gritting for long actual comedy lady ballasts can be one of the topblock busters of the year mark my words by the way i i think that is actually true if you saw how wished it over the week and ut i think to significant possibility this at per forms awesome in this night that is a very low blockbusters the lobar n twenty twenty the man of course tailor fisher who is in the film as she like i he toed out a i caught my off to be in the yes he is a method actor much commitment much pa it is it is amazing and and then comedy people people retort of course the vest value this this is truly one of your bit we thank i appreciated a people were trending you ant a man yesterday because sort of his out that there was a move twenty years ago called junk man right what i learned about yesterday and on and i knew that it was there but i d not occurred to me that a people to see the similarity because i mean frankly it is transonic to see the similarity you an a man is the tragic talk of a basketball player in the u b not the u and not the and at u b and a has o being expelled from he u b a and is physically tutty but basketball and bad i and i and he ends up going to the u u b a and playing in u u b a and falling in love with his room made but of course he is suppose be a girl in this create all sorts it is exactly it is the plot of tutty but with that low brow and basketball but to compare that to this is just sic ism sorry it is than as i say how daring you compare lady rollers i moving about beautiful clanswomen with you ant a man moving about a man pretending to be a woman your bigotry is horrifying and it is true it is a public this it is cool amazing them all these people on the left we are blithely comparing a film that is right to you ant a man which shows that they know the thing right because you it a man is about a man literal is not pretend that he's actually a woman he present he is a man pretending to be a woman he does not say i am a woman therefore i get to play in the u b a he is a man pretending to e a woman it is is us advantage he is he is ye it is wrong and he is hiding it right he is afraid to get caught when you guys compare a move to woman a man what are you saying about clanswomen in sports what are you actually saying about trains women in sports also yes if you look back twenty years to a time before brokobama was president there were comedies sire right mean hot checks with ma blame picking up that girl in slam and that is that is rob shelter taking a pillow and just bashing a girl into a wall a grand you use to be able to do that because the idea of it is hilarious and stupid and wrong and this has on to be a criticism that we get a people on the right who are a jealous that we made a moan include them they are going to say the dear miter drag comedy bonobo yes be cause for all of human history dude's dressing chicks as funny because s in congruous tat silly thank you that is right and now were supposed to pretend that that is not funny is it not only not funny it is brave that the bravest men are the ones who dresses women the best men are its you'lway say the best women are men but also the best men a women betray the best of them well wat we we are making the job you should go check out lady callers again it is

man on earth you on musk visited israel they're you met with the families of hostages being held bahamas he toured the sights of the october seven masker and he met with both prime minister benjamin it is now who and president sac hereat musk sat through of video come piled from bodycam footage of compass terrorist that day is the i was horrifying to watch the joy of those derris as they committed their savage atrocities thesis video of that visit is in far ora there he is with prime minister nitinaho by the way when they are wearing the blackest that is not just for show there is till live on fire happening not all that far away dis quite the condo sees fire there are still military operations the commas is attempting in the northern gossips trip right now thesis vidiobviously of musk and if now who looking at one the crime we babies were slaughtered after this tour of far aka masfthen held the press conference at which he spoke the plain truth about the situation on the ground he was here was plan make summing it up i thing ta monthly the can they to see the places where people of mitt waste to get the p the pines a and can i think this an horsy the the three things that see to happen i in in goes situation and is no twice pet kill the you insist on a mean of is ecus an they no vacate their mind stand and the second thing is to change the the education he an any generation of of maters is not chanty meters and and the the things of important is to cat prosperity take this what you alright there that is an excellent three prong plan for destroying compass and the radical terrorist groups to kill the people who murder the civilians that means comas and its allies you will overhaul the education system in the west bank and gosistrip which are run by parties who hate yews and seek the destruction of israel and you bring economic prosperity only after those steps are fulfilled can there be talk of some sort of peaceful settlement of the conflict because only at that point while there be partners willing to make peace this also happens to be the only strategy that has ever worked counter insurgency strategies directed at hostile populations can only be successful over time if the most militant members the terrorist are killed the population is reeducated away from hatred an economic prosperity becomes possible and make no mistake the population of the gosistrip and west bank is indeed wildly hostile to his rail and deeply antiseptic population not just come ass that is not a store that is simply a reality here is video from yesterday of the gowan population harassing red cross vehicles carrying is rally hostages e most to cleared the streets when what do you see here what you see here you see young children following the following the the red cross van making people inside these are the rosin civilians cheering because they know that this has brought them time compass making the hostages who ware taken is a triumphant parade of comas family members and friends then the location children are in the crowd here become any kidshere are making outside these red cross vans civilian children whore inside the red cross vans being being return to their families in sick is is a sickness is a sick mentality that would lead anybody to do something remotely this again those are civilians including children mocking is really horses also including children these are the wages of educating an entire population of pure hatred here for example is video of a kintrgarden graduation ceremony in posit does of quite your kids graduation ceremony from kindergarten and here some he yo from memory give in what you see are kids who are at a graduations are they are there acting as though they are terrine performing quottinquote military operations these is are five planting fake gas canister boys underneath take tangs flanking war ways performing actions that include kidnapping an killing quit inquire enemy soldiers thin a graduation ceremony for five year old for five year old had kindergarten graduation ceremony and gossip in this is insane is a young kids and stab kill the occupier with stones and knives look at tit men have ever been i have four kids three of them have graduated two of them have graduated kinnegarden and i can tell you this nous nothing why ma kid's graduation ceremonies from kennegard by the way we are just starting to hear of the stories of what the hostages went through in gaze according to the ant of one of those hostages it was civilians beating the hostage twelve years old as he entered goal to you latrine a be lance of arabia once compared making war on in urgent quote eating soup with the knife he said was messy and slow that of course is right the model for such counter insurgency tactics is the brutish counter in urgency against commonest revolutionaries in mailed from nineteen forty eight to nineteen sixty by the time that that counter in urgency had started the brutish had already had forces in country for about a century according to historian drew robots in general to the betray in their new book at conflicts the man campaign was a mixture of stick and terror quote providing people with electricity drinking water schools clinics and property rights proved a powerful disincentive for them to support maim but a heavy enticement of security had a dialectical partner firm discipline for those who disobeyed this by the way included in some cases strictly rationing diets to half daily carry account the brutish leadership also new the steadily would take a very long time the general in charge of the operation said he would quote shoot the bastard who says this emergency is over eventually after more than a decade the brutish did win israel can secure its future too but only if it takes the time an effort necessary to do and this means ignoring the stupidity of those who want quick ending to what will be a long struggle the first step in that struggle destroying camass what do on mass said is what israel is going to have to do that is what is really primnister hinting ow who makes clear here he was yesterday in a live chat with mask if you want peace iscuiamas you wassecurity istihamasi you want a better li o the pas things in gas been hit bahamas tiscuiamas all that is the peeress to the questioned you ass i crest at to get it o the poisons regime as you do in germany has you did n you can to wo or totes were to there is o choice there is no cops a that o there throw rich yet is a at that then look at what happened i mean what you had in germany was teasicecation what you had to can on you autism career was a cultural reformation e an to can that you visit to day is sodefe from gowan of the night e is the germany that you visit to day is bodice from germany of the nag e takes well is that possible in the awol i cant a good e say of course it is because we have seen majority in two places we have seen it in the gulf states and we see that when you visit to buy o when you visit abegaby on visit bay you see something entirely difference in horsiness now who is totally right compass has to be destroying why well because they cannot be reformed their evil terms group in facts camass apparently to transfer control of the entire baby's family which includes a foresail than a ten month old to the popular front for the liberation of palestine another terror group apparently for money compass military leader each was senior apparently appeared personally to the hostages in the tunnels to show them his power one hostage was forced read ridiculous letter before her release talking by hoccmass had quote treated her daughter a queen well in captivity of facetting compass is evil full stop is is why early calls for israel to stop its operations against comas are not just foolish their dangerous when burned standers jabbers about israel cruelty toward civilians he is not protecting civilians he is making their lives more dangerous since heads way they we went up under commands tender protections presumably forever here was burned standers yesterday israel was a tact in an absolutely horificuoy by commas thirteen hundred innocent people was slaughter israel has a right to defend itself but what israel does not have a right to go in my view its to kill twelve thousand people in six seven weeks two thirds of whom are women and children that they do not have right to the thoughts a violation a in national want large seas of the democratic party seems determined t rent israel from doing what the action need to do to secure their future this i center of christmurphy is calling for conditions on aid to israel which by the way is totally vine were america we caput conditions on aid but the conditions that he seeks to place on israel if things compliance with international law israel are to complain with international law at whole point but the idea here is to create a vague definition that leaves open the possibility of the drawing aid they sent israel current gait actions on fridge present abiding had conditioning aid would be a quote worth while fought yesterday national secured adviserspokesperson john derby when rule it out either the posit were taken with israel and quite frankly with their parts in the region is working its getting aid into people that needed its getting a pas in the fighting its getting hostages out it is getting america out and quite frankly we continued to urge and well continue to urge these rallies as they conduct military operations to do with the utmost care for innocence o thin li in a in the party is party who say we ai tar dicing a in fringe stay i thou would stay exactly what he san to oh yesterday when he in ask this quest tat the work will thought but the approach that ism taking now is working approach the we are taking now is working its getting result this is ridiculous the idea that you hand cuff the party that is attempting to protect itself the democracy the democratic ally in the face of a giant terrogroup is ridiculous it is also foolishness for people to treat the quotenquo two state solution as though that idiotic nostrum represent a true solution it does not and it has not in instead holds out the hope that the more pressure is applied to israel the more death brought to israel citizenry by terrorist t more international pressure put on israel the more israel will then conceive to those very terrorist which of course prolongs the conflict have a question does anyone really want a tear a terrestate in the wetback on the gocistrept because that's exactly what would exist if palistinian statehood were declared to day as the apparently the ridiculous government of spain would wish come ass would end up the governing party in a new state with control over its bordered than its weaponry d you think the possibility of global conflict is larger or smaller under those circumstances now president bine has been more stalwart than would've expected far but is language on this matter is insipid here is what he the to quote a two state solution is the only way to guaranty the long from security about the israllian the palsinan people to measure is rallies in palsinians likely in equal measure of freedom an dignity we will not give up on working towards that coal can you imagine in the middle of world for to if the president of the united states had tweeted out what we really need is a peace agreement between america and japan in order to end this terrible blood shed and leave the japan's fascist in charge of japan no cops hat won to made any sense right listen the two state solution may eventually down the line become a possibility but ironically talk about it are maturely prevents that possibility from ever materializing because every incentivization of terrorism increase is terrorism thus making such a solution absolutely impossible how do we know this because what happened on october seventh was the culmination of three decades of large scale terrorism pursued by the placing an authority palsinan is lomatyhod come ass what needs to happen exactly what must said

just parting parcel of a broader intellectual rubric the idea that you want stopcluble warming does not have to be connected with d growth it does not have to be connected with a belief in the innate evils of the west but it virtually always is and grintomberig is just a symptom of this she was caught tape just last week instocum shouting about antisinism what the held is great twonburg have to say bout israel what exactly i did not notice for example that the people of gaze and the and the arapalistinians living in the wetback ore particularly concerned with environmental issues what exactly in fact israel is one of the greenest places on earth in terms of highly industrialize countries what tells show taught again it is all parting parcel of hatred for the west that is all this is she's emblematic of what west has become a suicidal death cult of stupidity here is greditwin again the fact that this was ever she was time magazine person of the year a few years ago for being a stupid child who ran around yelling an adults it is amazing to me re what exactly she chancing she is chancing in sweetish wo what are we going to do you will crush finish an recto twinberry climate activist shouting about this sort of crap privileged white western people shouting about the evils of white westernism amazing amazing stuff and again this is the privilege of living in the west is that you can be as hypocritical and ridiculous as you want me shall be golfer spent yesterday doing that they were considering over on the view the bright minds over the view they were considering why it is that many members the mealybug movement are totally silent about the fact that common raped a bunch of women that there is a give report in the washington post about commons raping women hard their polices broke raping women an shooting them to death while they were still inside the women and what what were all the world the emenistrites on where's line saviour and the woman's march why why is there no comment weird weird well here is hippy golbrg trying to explain why i am still demo fated we two month of the thwart ben under way by the violence from womenscir an this country about that grab a natesthas tan of of war and the the tack the fact that factual violence was as against this railing women and the eager womenscir on the control having out cut out in announce that the began charm and be cut out a grecttingvetio calling for it that violet the every roll of want of warfare at is the height of immorality and the for that thinatinations and and for gander quality and women an empowerment has been violent and that commit on the nomination of discrimination against women has been violent and the anrnational nation women horrid perhaps the reason they have been silence is for the same reason that you just describe they do not long and has what little on exasperate you no listen i i i know that this is really hard for people to sit still worth right now we are glad people are come now and that is what we are going to keep talking about because we want ting courage that the bottom wine truly is this you do not have a trout you have to end this eve to end this and what you mean the people who rape women to death that that is what you have don why whip golfer is silence on all this because while be golfer believes a the news are just white people and white people are bad that is why wipe golfer says this kind of stuff is the same idiot women who suggested that hitter killing news whose white on white violence and was not in fact form of racial discrimination that is liter fly what she said and then chose suspended and show try to walk aback we did not really walkaback that is what she believes the reason she apparently is totally fine with this silence is violence will be golfer going out there and suggesting that if you did not put the black square on your facepok page an little a black life mattes cause you hate black people according to will be golfer not because you disagreed out ass o premise which is the black people our widely victimized in the united states but because you hate black people when news are actually victimized when dues are actually raped weal beers what we mud do have to be we have to keep quiet about that we do not we would not one exacerbate the conflict we would not want to make it worse you are right condemning rape would make it worse will be golfer that nailed it nailed it again there is only one reason will be golfer is happy say that about this particular population and tasks their news that is the only reason tat will be golfer is willing to well we just have to end this if to en really not mentioning their rape ends this the only way the sense is when commons is under the ground that is and i soft mean in the tunnels i mean dead just to clarify but the reason will be golfer believes all the specs again she since this oppressor oppress racialist metrics and that is in evil matrix it is a very very evil metrics that that way of thinking is pathetic and disgusting and just one second will get to lack of moral clarity from our friends in the media first the benshiperosho is

they're people i here's organ nice i consider peers a friend got to say that his coverage of the tissue he is trying to both sides its he is trying say one being objective and being as objective as possible but when he gives monologues the one that he did yesterday about israel activities against compass i got to say he is not both sizing it hers peers organ yesterday he a monologue essentially accusing israel of the same sort of terrorism that compass perpetrated october seven that is insane am third thane is morally wrong it is wrong on a factual level its wrong on moral level is just not true here was peers doing that routine yesterday a being pinto this wee can by people reminding of tweet twenty fourteen by then sell loge to masted bonbabman of gas from his false the bud a three is ready tee made in the west fight happened mas ha e li changed by position warn says opposition swell committed atrosseties in twenty fourteen in estimation it was e complete dis proportion of response to what as happened it lebolat revenge to me that a man its strategy e present baba told i to cold it of we de tat bobboba i also what point dis israel garments o strategy the come the very terrorism profess to be fighting an to day ism beginning to out myself not exact same question based on what based on what and first of all i do not on i do not think that peers ere many the media understand what proportionality means proportionalities does not mean that the original a atrocity has to be responded to quasi that proportionately that is not what proportionality means if you murder my child i do not then get to murder your child that is not proportionality proportion means that the means use to achieve a military end must be proportional to the military end in other words if i want a killed one bad guy i cannot just top an atom right that is what that means a but again this idea that israel has to be hampered in's military aims ore that israel has magical weapons where yo wave the magic hurry poterwan and all badguize to superbug all the civilians are left over that is not true by the way peers was wrong in twenty fourteen the fact in the matter is that in twenty fourteen by the generalize statistics of the people who were killed in that particular conflict bout two thousand one hundred people were killed in that particular conflict by israel in the gossistrip and that was prompted by the kidnapping of than murder of three is daily teen ages as well as a series of rock is fired into israel as for compass's usual arrangement in that conflict according to the measurements available from the frailly ministry of on affairs which is significantly more liable than the can or the got a health ministry thirty six per cent killed were civilians forty four per cent were members of compass or other terrasgrupts and twenty per cent were quoting that uncategrized mails between the ages of sixteen and fifty which civically means civilians ware associated with commas or one of the other terrorist groups this sort of moral lack of clarity of course means the know one can one but no one can win awaruner the circumstances be clear about this there is no war that can be on by western power against a terrorist group in bedded in i civilian population under the circumstances that peers is describing as quotinquo terrorism it is not terrorism to try to kill people in the opposing terrorist group and they are hiding among vikings that is not terrorism terrorism is when you go in and you slaughters civilians purposefully not as collateral damage purposefully as the goal of your attack which is what committed perks tried to extend this to wat to questions that he is asking of along lady who the spoke person for the usually prime minister here it here he was yesterday by an permission a justifies moments ago the says they make it credit be difficult for you to work ow who is a harass garrison who is this of eat seems to me part of the problem that you have with the antics of this to the why the world is at the being horrible immature all day on man is it is just the wasting of ever seen all o the social made all those the only of the scene with the atrocities that a not no o no the sand mud not see thankfully have not seen what many tennis seen which is the forty five minute som of that and i the stand its absolutely terrific i wat mad is is to make candy him in sand but no i i would not say anything is worse of that i for the record a but they horriblimaty old day long it is suggesting to people that there are thousandsand thousands of thousands of women and a lot of children may be as many as five six thousand children now have been killed by these strikes and now the groundatac and i think the problem that you have us say this respectfully the prove you have is at you done not she know how many mamas terror her kill that if your honest you done be i get well i mean under the circumstances who would mean it yet e the answers a lot by the way they do know in approximate numbers how many compass terrors they've killed but if the idea is that the only way thou can fight a terrorist group is presumably by knowing exactly exactly how many terrorist you are killing and only killing the errs no one will ever one a war against the terrier began is not possible it is just not possible to do that by the wayworn we talk about the number of of civilian casualties in gaze is very difficult to separate who is a civilian from who is not when you are talking about a seventeen year old mail who is hanging out with commas is you member of commas or is he is civilian this is happens to going true with regard to thistatistic about quin quit children an you have heard that is reals keeping women and children in prison the many the prisoner is been release are women in children in the same your hearing that describe in in the gods strip i mean they are technically women and miners that are being held in prison for terrorist activity i depends hots being killed again we do not have great statistics on any of that because since when have you in real time bean able to count the exact number of people who are dying in war the you cannot win a war under the circumstances if the idea again is that immunity is bought by simply hiding among civilians that means terrorist win every war from now until the end of time and you have now created a mass of incentive structure for them to hide among civilians in violate n of the guinea conventions to another words the punishment for violation of the guinea conventions a coring to peers and many in the media he's immunity nothing happens to you you sit there in everybody just lives with it it is totally crib by the way even one peer says he is not quitting what happen on october seventh to what happened intygaza he literally did in his monologue he literally said the this now tipping over into the terrorism that israel on october seven that is not even true in that lack of moral clarity is what means that the west loses wars forgetabout israel the west in general loses wars on this basis and tat is a serious serious problem and meanwhile jobidon continues to trail in the poles there is new article out at real claim politics trump shown trend to day and ache points out that right now if yhadput betting money on it trump is the favorite he says in twenty sixteen trump led killer client for all of five days in the national real car politic polling average each of those days in the immediate aftermath of the republican convention he let in twenty nine poles taken over the course of the entire campaign in twenty twenty trump never led bison in the national army p average counting the electives trackers i single pole trump leading total of twenty four a national poles in canary of twenty twenty this cycle he is letting that many since mid september he is letting more pols in the pass through weeks than he did against bison in the entirety of the twenty twenty campaign if you the state level polling trump is currently up in virtually every battle ground state it round never led brocabom in the army diverge an wisconsin pennsylvania michigan or oho where is it today trump is leading the real clepoltics pulling average an michigan he is leading in pennsylvania he is narrowly trailing in wisconsin but he is lead in some often poles in florid he is way ahead in arizona he leads in georgia he leads in oho he leads here is what turn tresses quote an other words analyzing the selection correctly is not just a matter of giving lip service to the notion the trump can win the selection the correct position right now is there trump is better position in the poles to win the selection than any go pe nominee since at least two thousand four not only that hes habitually over performs this poles frankly if you are willing to set favorites this far out sun almost certainly the car dona trump the favorite does this mean the trump willing the presidency their god arguments why perceptions of the economy will improve between now and then although maybe they will not perhaps trump ill under per form his polling this time as the grope didn't twenty twenty two although maybe he will not their good arguments trumps ruminal trials will road his standing the poles although having watched trump scandals unfolds for the better part of for decades make they will not this a makes for fun speculation but when the conversation returns to what we do know there is only one correct answer trump cabin the selection and wright now is well positioned to do and jobidon is struggling man he is having a tough time again he really he is contending not only with firers on the foreign from but also he is contenting with the fact that people just do not think the economy is very good ire's an entire in york time's article titled even most biding voters do not see thriving economy quote a majority of those who back present n widen in twenty twenty say to day's economy is fair or poor ordinarily a batsmen for incumbent seeking re election by swing stay in the thing states the percentage of jobidon's twenty twenty supporters wo say the economy is excellent or good thirty per cent hundred fifty a by income thirty seven per cent if you are from fifty cat a hundred a and forty two percent say the economy is excellent or good if you are over a hundred thousand dollars meanwhile if you say the economy is poor or only fair seventy per cent of people making under fifty ran sixty one per cento people making from fifty to a hundregran and fifty seven per cent say the economy is only poor or only fair if you are making over a hundred thousand dollars and by age eighty nine per cent to people aged eighteen to twenty nine say the economy is poor or only far we are tug about jo bisons twenty twenty supporters we not talking about the entire brought electric thoseyou are amazing numbers by the way that is a serious problem for job naturally he is trying to teach people that done there's wrong about the economy after things are on swimmingly were is do bide yesterday explaining that thanks giving actually was cheap is sher ernes this thinks given dinner was the fourth cheapest ever i reckon much no note to all is chick sat by tricks betook ill in to time that is not all a tabs giving two years ago a hundred contacted ships were waited in doc to dock an ports the lined up hundred long outer yogi this yer we're less than ten me hat to day as folks tor the holiday sloppy shells or stack mete major pliancy is ta stove or fridge broke down over thanks given you you replace is faster an nine per cent cheaper two years i well ism is only one problem which is no one believes that a according to the hill in twenty twenty two the price fray classic thanksgiving feast with sixty four or five that is at more than ten bucks then twenty twenty one it is declined a little bit in twenty twenty three but it is still way way way higher close er still twenty five per cent higher the they were not in twenty nineteen before the to e nineteen pandemic according to the all yet nobody believes that trying to talk people into the idea that the economies on swimming at is a is a failure in imagination by the biding administration and they've got i honestly not sure how they pull out of this set talisman i really do not know fore here in the studio with montane tucker shes a model singer dancer and activist and of course you been a all over social media particularly right now promoting the fight against taintitematism montane great to see thank i for having the thanks much for coming in excited how did you get into this fight against stantisematism in the first place i fuck have been fighting this fight for a long time now i one year go leading up to crested nock lost novamber i release a holiest educational dock series call hos to never forgat i we up with halloos of over gran parents a from hungry and a mania and i grab pa masters maholife s have always been educated bout the holicosts not just in school not to from movies but from direct stories from my grandparents and when my lady passed away four years ago at ninety seven i reached to show a foundation o testimonials and and my grandma is can i was in see to do something with this i actually went to poland and film the whole series i been now for the posse year fighting aunt schematism on my social media in person going around speaking and when everything happened with israel then i have now basically taken over my social media posting about it what is the up taken once hi semis in the use an been since since october seventh i mean i think that out statistic is four hundred perse they say but what is happening on line is something that antisemitism has always been here right it is always been round but now with the power of social media it is been taken to a whole new level and what is happening on social medias now going into the college canvases is going into high schools even there as a high school teacher that the other day had to be looked in her room because there were protest to be in high schools ism seeing it directly to myself on social media but every day were hearing about new stories now what is happening in schools and on the streets at restaurant people boy cutting restaurants because they support israel in some cases there even boy having we trance the service fly food that happening in fell it elf year's totally wild you been doing some amazing act of this to work you even you mean with people on on all sides of the political lie to talk that aunt semi is an for folks who do not watch or feed and have not been following what are the kind of stuff that that you eve ben doing yes have been going to whether it is pole a go going to the my house and speaking about it there or going to different schools or going i just spoke at the rally and d c on which was three hundred thousand people which is in a insane number of people to come together to support israel and to combat aunt schematism and my falling on on social media was not built from my activism it was built from my dancing from my singing you knave collaborated with people of all walks the life all offenescitese all races to use my social media to be posting about israel we know what is risky some may say but have felt that if i have the voice and i have the power to may be educate some one to share what is going on i know that is what my grandparents would want mean to do a what they i wish they had a voice back then and with whish the jewfish people had a voice back then to be able to a voice what was going on i feel i gets our responsibility now with these platforms to make sure be use them and educate i mean divergently a brave thing to take a a social media following that is on completely different topic and soon lit over to something that is insanely serious and really threatening in the world right now i'mnunlucky i i do a political shell which means that i can just talk about wits going on politically pretty easily my audience can with with me it is it is stuff happening the world but for you to take a a complete image that has been built from doing funstuff the the tam in the dancing no and shift that or o something deeply sees had fans reacted to the when i first the the calicos series a year ago i was nervous i was tefillin very nervous i was people follow me to see me be happy to see me dancing in the streets of holly would boulevard to see me collaborate wit tarry crews no one's going o want me to sit here and do something very dark very serious i mean me going to shifts have you have ever bee not en something that any one watching i mean no matter what religion you are what race you are it is something that i think everyone should go and experience to see what can really happen am and that is very dark that is very serious i mean i never went everyone was seeing my my natural reaction i was his hysterically crying half the time in the series an you'ryou are walking over mass graves in the series it was risky and i was what if an impacts o one person if one person sees this and is impacted great and honestly the series took off in away that i never expected i really did not expect it and tit really has changed people's views and opinions have have people it me saying i was taught to hate news my whole life and after hearing your story and hearing your grandparent story you have change my mind or people who are not you or sting ye know you have inspired me to want to go learn more about my hisfamily sister am it is it is been interesting of course there is a lot of the a lot of the hate that has come with it i mean default more hate but there also has been a lot of really positive beautiful things and of come from it after doing that yetis about hollos an obviously you mention going up in in home with with halloos or able ran appetence whore do you think we stand with the in such mucus i in the world we i know it is crazy that it is twenty twenty three almost twenty twenty for and we are still here and were here actually not still here we are in the place what we have i do not think we have been since the holiest people need to take this more seriously i think that this is why keep saying this is how the hllicost begin because people are not taking this seriously enough and to understand people think all the hallcosts can never happen again but that is why israel is important my mystify would always tell me how important the state of israel was because he fell if israel was around that the almost would never happen and that is why it is important that we protect israel it me stand for israel during this time more than ever and people saying artisan ism is not antisemitism ah it is and it is it is really scary time that were in right now and i cannot believe that we half to prove ourselves again back in the day my my my say would tell me stories that he would have friends is entire life and then all the sediment all the announcements came out about how terrible the news were and in all the propaganda friends turned on him say spitting on him in the streets are to beating him up and and saying you dirty do i mean that is what is happening on social media in you are having conversations with friends that you can even imagine having a year ago you woudhave never imagined having the t yes the conversations with them it is a really scary time were in and that is why it needs to be taken seriously u and to make sure that the never forget never again does not happen again and the denial is mi particularly astonishing a me when when you look at the amount on social media of people who are just saying none the have occurred or israel exaggerating what happened or teethe the forty beheaded babies that therefore all the babies are alive or israel lying or all all of this it is boggling to the mine because for those who actually think the truth matters in the facts matter it is pretty evident that for a huge percentage of the population that just is not true the narrative matters a lot more than the fact it makes no sense that at first they saying the hostages are not are not that people are in the streets plying down the upstairs they revisits o people saying they are not hostages om hosted to take them who can now we have all the ideas of them the hostages being returned where is your denial in that one oh they do not really murder them they do not re then you have all the footage that comes out on line every day people are china it's involved in all these grieves sat people are begging people to see this footage i do not want to see that the forty five minute long cause i believe it but the people who are denying it need to watch that foodedge they need to watch that footage because how can you deny that how can you deny that you really is astonishing lower doing amazing work to on tanatuckor think you month for stopping my and thank for doing what yore doing into brave and a necessary thing really breached o thank we much already folk who reach the end of to day shall we back here to morrow with much more ism ensure the sis the venchbereau show

as the economy begins to soften and the cranewar drags on trobidons poll numbers show his vulnerability the will re publicans be able to take advantage and venture of this is the bench very so e benchpurish responserbas pressie pin protect our all mine pray today expressly giant come flashes even lot of speculation for a very long time that the economy was going to soften in now it is finally begun according to the wall street journal earnings for the nations biggest companies are poise to fall for the third straight quarter or hurt in part by the cline in energy prices i exactly antsy technically in procession presumably because consumer spending remains pretty high be while the inflation in the economy these while the extra dollars that button blue into the economy cause the easy many policies the federal reservitaces wile for that t wash its way out of the economy but as that happens consumers are not going to be able to out pase producers producers are starting to cut back they are seeing the writing on the wall they're starting consolidate their gains and theyarestarting to realize that if they continue to expands their actual manufacturing their actual production the they are going to under cut themselves and you are starting to see earnings to lines for virtually every major company the members the lesson we five hundred according to the wall stroturnal on pace to collectively report of five point two per cents the cline in earnings the worst performance since twenty twenty revenue is on tracks lies yer when six percent from a year ago but that is largely due to inflation at this point some of this is due to the decline in oil prices for example the energy sector is taking at right on the chin but it is also happening in materials end its also happening intact apple says fell for the third consecutive quarter amidsoftening leman for consumer devices the only areas that continue to have quarterly revenue growth are areas of help care communication services real estate is continuing to sort of hold steady at this point but we are about to see more of these companies report bad earnings and that means that the economy is likely to see a down turn in the coming quarters employment numbers came out on fridge their weaker then expected that of course is not greatly a shock because as we've been saying for months on this program what goes up must come down the dead that overheated economy was not going to crash off the cliff was always a rather specious presumption meanwhile on foreign policy the cranewar continues a pace according to the near times u cranial forces struck two bridges connecting russia occupied crime to the rest of you crane on sundae part of a broader pattern of attacks on and around the peninsula the i sought to scramble critical supply routs for the drumlin and push the scope of the war fresh territory the all part of the cranial offensive their hoping that they will push the ruffians back much that the ruffians will come to the negotiating table the question at this point is what exactly the ruffians are asking for because everybody knows the lines of the negotiation here and they also recognize that there is a missillimement of incentives the west keep saying that it lens he gets to make the deals lens we keep saying their will be note deal until the ruffians are off of all of russia territory and the ruffians keep saying there will be nodal if they are trying to put if they are being pushed out of what they consider now to be formal russia territory enameling crime and the donnas region sundaes attacks injured a driver and close traffic on a second bridge to the east of chon her near the small town of henichask according to the go governor of the region claimers halo who russia god one of the strikes tor three holes in another road way as well you came to are forces took card for both strikes on sundae another departure for them typically buoy approach as lank an other top officials emphasize their new amid to force ordinary ruffians to face up to the crumble's worst things are likely to get worse before they get batter meanwhile the america public do not have their heart in this any more by poles a plurality of america are not interested in an endless level of support for the crane mar or really for much more support than his already been given at this point and russia and chines forces are also upping the any over the weak end a combine russia an chines naval force patralldinear the cost of plasma in what yours expert said appears to be the largest such flotilla to approach america shores apparently eleven russia an chines ships seem close to the illusion islands according to us officials the ships never entered us territorial waters there we shouted by for us destroyers in the p ate pardon air craft it is historical first said been saddler senior research fellow at the herdic foundation given the contact of the lorn u crane intentions around titan this move is highly provocative a spokesman four thus northern command confirm russia and china had carried out a combine naval patron their lanka specify the number of ships or their precise location russia and china are using the anti and meanwhile the by administration really has no plan because while they are asking for concessions from china while they continue to fun the war in e crane there is no offramp with regard to the war in crane to low us to shift focus to china and meanwhile china is realizing that it is going o be boxed in both demographically in economically in very short order all of which spells the possibility of future conflict now let us recognize something it is the unpredictability in change in media's for policy from weak and passive to aggressive that really throws people off kilter and the fact is that russia ever would invaded crane if it had not been for the sins of the former began a ministration one which ares vice president of the united states you remember that russia actually invaded crane originally in twenty fourteen that is when borokobamos president of the united states over the week and mama did another fawning interview with the glowing media in which he claim that they did all the right things heres christian among poor one the worst judo journalist in the business asking barakobama about america florin policy when russia first invaded crime and part of what happened what both why but also moral who give enormous credit for have to poll in a lot of other europeanse kicked an scream to impose the sanctions that we did and to prevent prudent from cantina e n throw the don bus answer the rest of your crime i actually think that given both were you canvas out of patimman word be your god mono was not the time o we held the line o candles be clear they did not hold the line and the entire attempt to hand over crime two russia in the first place was deeply tied to barakobamas pathetically in transient approach with regard to a run who is trying to con to deal with on a newclearseal throw he wanted russia t help broker that deal until he was willing to hang crime to the ruffians in order to make sure that that happen and then when there is another russia advance in you can this time tobidons president of the united states we can see why russia thought they we going to get away with it again it is confusion in form policy that leads to all of these pots and all of them are strings you stack up with rigid to jobidons administration the poling number show that he is really really weak right now his pulling even with donate trump in michingan in most of the major national pols right now donate trump is running about even with jobidon the latest national poles have abiding up one according the insider advantage tide according to your temsiena up three according to he morning consult and trump up for according to messenger herisaks that says the jobidon is running extremely weak right now an he should be because policies are absolutely awful and when you linked out with the fact that the hunts orbital scandal is not nearly over and could easily break into the man stream over the course of the next year and a half democrats should be running scared if act your daringly if you cracks in the base for the democratic party representing take ashing closstemocrato masschusetts he finally admitted on national levy that if hunter committed crimes you should face penalties for that hunterbidon committed crimes toner bine to pase custos can accountability for those crimes which by the way f the suntans that i have heard vary few republican say about donate true from much more massif crimes this pokes the thesession i would say on hunter bison is really just the walker of what about a to the republicans are trying to the fact to diminish to the tang atonal turn wrong the grave crime of conspiracy a dens the constitution of the named faith gan this is going to be the great mister ran to buy the democrats is going to be to donate trump and the question is to whether republicans can take advantage of jobidon's weakness rest almost entirely on whether the republican base is going to nominate a person who is going to make the entire subject of the next election about his various foils and legal peccadillos get to that momentarily first its time to talk you about dailywars most

slashed to learn more a gay the question to republicans is going to be weather they actually believe that the rest of the country believes they believe about dona trump if you listen to republicans in the base talk about what is going on dona trump in the myriad trials that been brought against him the trial in manhattan the trial in florid the trial now in washington to see when republicans talk about this they say that the subject of the next election should be the corruption of the doggy and i agree then ideal work you be talking endlessly wit then dependance about the corruption of the do jane t weapons action of on foremen in the use of the f be i to go after tonal trump beginning in twenty fifteen at here house of the pillory clinic campaign all that all that should be highly relevant is that going to be the topic the bread and butter topic upon which america vote or are they simply going to make the general decision they always make an every election it which is do i this guide do i trust this guide do i think this person is likely to lead to a more stable america where i can send my kid two school knowing they will be safe and when i can have bread on the table i thou those of the real big questions and re publicans can win on those questions because democrats have made the country less safe with regard to crime because democrats a threaten your kids in terms the values they are promulgating at schools all those questions our questions republicans can win but not if they never talk about it again if the censer issue in twenty twenty four is weather the do j is being mean to donate trump for political purposes or whether dona trump is in fact committing criminal act that is not going to be a winning formula for republicans in twenty twenty four it just is not the only way that is winning formula is if many democrats stay home because they are just unhappy with jobidon the dona trump squeaks by but that is not a recipe for a sort of broad based electoral victory that is ha recipe that relies on lock and you only start our business one than we we said the were beginning of of daily wire was luck is not a business strategy while luck is not a political strategy either and the idea the you are going just going to luck in to twenty sixteen again the basically jobidon will not visit is godson or he will not visit michigan that that he will just go absent in the election where the democraticgan to stay home again there are couple factors the militate against that one of them is the factor that a lot of democrats remember twenty sixteen and they remember that when they thought misery client was a ninety nine percent lock to win they did not show up an to dona trumping can president number two thorn coin in the poles is running well ahead of where jobidon is running right now if you are a democrat you understand there is a very real risk the dona trump is going to get back in the white house which means yore very motivated to go and vote again when it comes to the message of the campaign democrats are gone be able two basically shy away from whatever is the supposed corruption in the okay the elegy eruption corruption i think is very real and very parson they're mettle to skyway from that in just talk endlessly about dona trump and dona trump loves to talk abut dona trump in the entire electorwill be about dona trump if the elections about dona trump he is going to lose if the electionsabout tobidon he is going to lose this is not a particularly hard mouth again whichever candidate is the subject of the ref random we will lose nobody elect jobidons of there din about jobidon at the time they pull the lever there can vote for his opponent and if they are thing about dona trump et the time they vote they are probably going to vote for obit what exactly has trump been doing what just what you would think he is been doing sure he is yo handling his legal troubles and sure he is talking about that stuff but he is spending zero fora s at all on his actual political opponent all of his folk is right now an again he cannot blame him for this because if you are hit with eighty seven charge is or at events if you are it them you youould also spend a of your mental energy thinking about that sort of stuff and presumably truth socializing about that sort of stuff at all and ours that now trump does that even on a good day but on a bad day he is for shut going to do that but the problem is again that were dona trump puts his spotlight is also where the media are happy put their spotlight and were democrats are happy but there spotlight if every waking hour is spend optional trump's truth social talking about how much he hates an ancypolocian jacksmethin my pens that is not a recipe for electoral success and here is the thing i want jo widen not to be president of the united states any more i think he is a terrible president by the way on never think jo bison is really control love done ministration i think that the staff people nmasknis for while choactury runs the the bison administration and the answer is basically everybody who staff for barokobama is a really fascinating in of vie over tablet magazine with avid marry who is a biographer of barokobama hour biography in twenty seventeen a barokabam those largely ignored by the media is t was not complementary that biography o barokabama included the fact to barokobama and he is youngerdays with pretty rapidly antistatic that which is not a shock he set in her my rate church for twenty years as as we will know that he wrote love letters to his goal friends in which he talk by want sees gas it to all sorts of really salacious and ugly material in that biography by avid marry who is a poets surprise winning historian by the way and a avid terror says in n interview with tablet magazine that jobidon is not running large parts of his ad ministration mama is he does not have to pick up the pone betas all his people are already in the white house they hold the profile tony blincoln does not rob valley is just one person bet mac arc and should pear on israel somonico in justice is in rice rung do mystic policy it is turtles all the way down their obviously large parts of the white house policy making that belonged to barokobom because their staff by his people who work for him and not out report back to him personal is policy as they say in washington again this a biographer barokobama avid grass to me this is very odd an kind a spooky arrangement spooky because it is happening outside the constitutional framework of the united states government and yet somehow was been placed awful list of permitted subjects to report on which the pretty good indicator of the extent to which the in formation we get and public reactions that in formation is being successfully control that of course is exactly right but one of the things that is happening here is that were not talking about any of that stuff the only thing that we are spending our time talking about presumably the dona trumps legal troubles which we will get to in just once si going to latest on that first the economy is really on sort of a razors age in clear which way it is going to go ism big into diversification particularly into assets that are likely to a true in value over time days go are long timespons or masterworks de livery seventy seven point three per cent net return to some of their investors that is seventy seven point three per cent that return many my lesser have seen masterworks art investing platform hardback ten seventeen thirty five present that returns from other recent exits as with any investment past performance is not representative of art work that is not yet ben sold it is on a guarantee of future

access to skip the waitress simply by going to masterwork stop come slashed again that is masterworks dot cold slash men important dis closes in risks of in wasting at masterworks dot cold slash c d go check them out right now masterworks dot cold slash bent om meanwhile the trump team is getting ready to go to court and that have a bunch of different defenses that they've ben putting forward one of donate trumps lawyers shame john narrow he's been all over the news making defenses of president true he points out that president trump's expressions of concern over election regularities that is all first amendment protected material he is pointing out also that the actual statues them en broad in the indictment against donate trump are not actually properly formulated very likely there may even be a preempt of appeal to the supreme court to try to get this thing stop a sap as fast as possible the is been courage by people ranging for marble of indicator might lee in u tot a lorry of intros in statements on sundae from trumpet is legatee provide hin the might seek to offend the form presidents against federal conspiracy charges according to lowdown suntan a b sees that the government will never be able to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that president trump had corrupt or criminal intent that is what this case is it bout now that is again that that is the legal issue and whether it is true or whether it is false we are going to find out dona trump has the deck stack against him no question because the judge in this case number one is a dedicated democrat who ashy served to the same affirm as hunter bide an apparently because this is taking place in washington t c which the very in friendly area for jury selection apparently seem trump less to get the thing moved it to virgin because thy believe that washington d c is a place where trump cannot get a fair trial and of course there is only one of three trials the trumpets truly under going and we are expecting the georgia t to drop a indictment on donate trump any moments he'll be four different trials over the course of the next year well all that is true and gain all that is it really is outrageous a are not that the just to go through each case once more the manhattan e ages case s absolute species it is garbage this one about stormy angels and dona trump supposedly taking personal money and spending it on stormy angels to silent her as supposed o campaign money its it is it is all ridiculous it is well beyond the scope of the manhattan he did it any way because he wants to be famous it is a ridiculous case that wen so be thrown out summarily but it is a manhattans who could get con evicted the one down in florid about class my documents of pretty serious case because dona trump ted the chiming on tape do not do chiming on tape first rule of law with that set should be prosecuted the political cases it shouldn't be rescue because killer flint was not prosecuted for essentially the exact same crime but in a sort of law could dona grumpy prosecuted sure but is also in florist which is a much more friendly territory for donate trumpsince one the state twice and then you had on up to washington t c and n incredibly weak case brought by blacksmith on the canary sixth matters again if you want to bring a thargemendightmen that is not actual criminal trargington bother to bring that charge because he couldn't prove it to instead he bought a bunch of ancillary charges ranging from obstruction of justice to fraud none of those statutes really seem to apply all of that can be true and at the very same time on a political level all doll trumpeted over the weekend all he did over and over and over is street about this and that is all the selection is going to be question for you and am normal conservative or normal andipendet is is this top of mind for yous this the thing you wake up every morning outraged about for certain person is the population shore is that population larger than twenty five thirdyto per cent i have serious doubts that that is the case considering again that a solid majority of independence think trump should be invited andthay on really care about what the charge is o me very hard to convinced tats independence not only should true not be invited he should be elected because he is being invited the is a very very heavy left and get i encourage republicans to think pretty seriously about who they think is likely to be jobidon not just about who they think it feels good to nominate those are not the same thing over the welkin dona trump started at going after the judge in this particular case he said there's all caps there is no ad an get a fair trial with the judge assigned to the ridiculous freedom of speech fair election's case everybody knows this and to she we will be immediately asking for a causal this judge on very powerful grounds and likewise for menu change out of d c judo shot can of course is in a point a former president barocabab and get ism not saying that trumps concern here is not we predicated i think that it is as mason be see legal analyst if a henderson says this judge his trumps worst nightmare me that is true this is a very left wing judge obviously in thank turns taken sees trumps worst nightmare and she is legal teams the worst nightmare on discretely real when i say it the black woman with a law degree is at vertical unstoppable force what it comes to the just is is then here is e reason why the take u em on is ben we tat the to tee in forms to discrimination discrimination bacon ginger discrimination basion rase the expecting them on the lawn chess tot how things actually suppose to work then you put this in in environment with a s people get is cheating based on who they are every single day of their career now you have got some body walking into her sort roes thangill hang on is bacon i i her the the the cretin differently be as i used to be sippet powerful person an expect comes stirred cowerfor personangan that is not going to work on her ow gay the fact that the left is excited about this judge demonstrates that trump is exactly one hundred percent right again the case that this person is making is that because of identity as a black woman this will make her trumps work nightmare which is the opposite of being a good judge what means to be a good judge that you in partially decide the case in front of you not the you look deep within the wells of your own soon and then come up with some sort of jerryrids explanation for why the bad orange man has to go to jail that is exactly the prison be signals to want to again trumps complaints our well predicated here about the judge i think there is very little doubt about that the question for re publicans is should that be the basis on which the elections run it does not stop there of course because the posters keep coming and coming and coming over the week n all gets more on this in just one second first i tell you really really rough weekend our baby is doing to have on told he came down with r s v m trouble breathing that meant that we are up a lot of the night like pretty much every night over the weekend and in those car r moments when we its to lie down we need to go sleep right away and here is where relics sleep at mattress was really really useful i relied on may hulicsleep mattress and you can to they hope new high and collection called hulks elect he lies his harness years f i sent of mattress expert he is to bring their customers of truly elevated sleep experience the hell's a we collection includes six different mattress models each tailor for specific sleep positions and firmness preferences have had our quick sleep mattress r seven eight years at this point is firm but breathable which is exactly what i need when i need to get sleep right now without doubt helices is the company i rely upon the mattresire li pong to heck sleep got come slash men take that two merit sleep play find the perfect mattress for your body and sleeps tipyour material come to your door shipped for free plus he will has tenor wasn't he can tried out for a hundred mights risk o free for eliminator he like is offering up to twenty percent of all mattress plus too free pills for listeners it is or best of for get hurry on over to he liksleep got comslashmen with relics better sleep starts right now case o this was not dona drums only complaint over the week ans o dona trump also sent out a a missive saying in all capital letters if you'll go after me ism coming after you totally on clear who exactly he is talking about here the the implication seems to be that the do jays coming after him softies president of the united states afterward that his going to go after corrupt members o the geode with is not timely within his purview that however sent jack smith spiral wing chatsmith is the prosecutor in this case the special council he filed the motion he the in in the motion he set all the proposed to order seeks to presentness the improper dissemination or use of discovery materials including to the public such a restriction s particularly important in this case because the defendant has previously should public statements on social media regarding witness's judge's townies and others associate with legal matters penning against him in recent days regarding this case the defended has issued multiples either specifically or by implication including the following if you got for man coming after you if the defended were to begin issuing public post using details or for example grandeur transcripts obtained in discovery here it could have a harmful chowing effects on witnesses or adversely effect the fair administration of justice in this case trump later defended the claim he said it was not about potential witness is who was not him threatening people he said that was forequote the rhino china loving dossonestspecial interest crusts and super pats like the one's funded by the coke brothers and club for no growth which may very well be the case but again this is just how things are gong t get litigated all the way until all of this is over he did not stop there he went off about his a civil rights being violated again ism not saying that dona trump is wrong about any of this ism just asking whether this is an elect total strategy that seems to be worth while here was dona trump going off on his a civil rights being violated an montgomery albamaraly on fridge the only civil right that bin binate in this matter mi give i the of the countless people the bin that come in this sip en persecution they are come in is o the marks inter the people that do not get it the get the young the vicious this man but is spader and with core than they are now again all of this maybe finland well and good is it the sub jet of the election i feel of beating a dead horse here but the horse are not tad yet in the sense that people keep saying over and over that if the election is room this basis on a trample winded i just do not see the evidence of that over the wee gan he also went after seriously nancy ploy and make pence on truth social he went off on nancy closed cause nancy close suggested tat he looked a scared puppy which is definitely getting his goat and trump put out on truth social i purposely did not common on nancy close's very weird story concerning her husband but now i can because she said something about me with glee that was really quite vicious i saw a scared puppy she said as she watch me on television millions of others that did not see that i was not scared nevertheless hi mean a thing to say she is a wicked witch whose husband's journey from hell starts and finishes with her she is a sick and the rented cycle who will some day live in hell all capital letters who we again i ask you who's this win over wisconsin michigan pennsylvania who is it georgia arizona who are the voters for well now that he did say that she is a sick in the mental cycle will some day living hell ad that her husband's journey to hell starts and finishes with her now ism totally in this sou be one thing if you are running for reelection he is now running after an election that he lost in he is gan are to wind some additional votes who does he win over with this and meanwhile he is going after make pen pence who is said that has no plans to testify against trump over the week en to mike pence he he said that and then trump came back at him and said won it is finally happen little mike pence he is running out of ningnamesly staring to cycle through the sync names over member there is little mama leave be and then there is cricket cellar is now crooked we she is now recycling them which is good for the environments is little mike pence a man who is about to be ousted is governor of indaba anthill like him along and made him v p has gone to the dark side pro the power of the back si sad never told a newly an golden not base on his too per send numbers pence to put me above the constitution or the mike was too honest he is de fusional and now he wants to show he's a toughly i once here ta major magzinarclonmike it said he was not a very god person i was surprise but the article was right sad how many people has don and from selected for positions a power who turn out not to be very good people is it pretty much every one she the the man has the worst selection in a in personal in human history or it is turns out that he cross sword to the lot of the people who went up working for him because he does not do the right thing very often with those people he also ran throughout fellow republicans over the week here he was suggesting that up it is o the republican's fault that he is being indicted right now which again is weird con sideling that is really his own comes democrat'sfault and it is his fault but it is hard to blame say m rondasantis or make ruby or chis christy or mike pence for what dona trump did to thinks can be to once he can be in fairly targeting also in many's cases of pritigood classify woman's case judge made his bad and now he is having ta lie in it and it is not pleasant and he should not be given to french women from heller canton but blaming the republicans for his own failings that at some point w of republican voters look in him and say you are a little responsible for your own actions here no a little but when they died the political opponent and they did that i should know that lobs off he is a cooncan in computer they and he should not be allowed to be sin and the republic is better get to and they better get smart because most of e look a bunch yo week jet strait ow and you got to get to and smart and you have to fight fire with fire you cannot allow this to go on it is the republican's faults the i was present in for four long years and he allowed his entire justice department apparently to be completely run through with people who hated is got and did not that but now it is the fault of grand congress person from iota that is it ye again is this a winning electoral strategy i ask you this over and over and over ism not con a stop askyou because the only thing the matters to me the only thing the matters to me its what the policy of the united states looks going forward don trumps personal peccadillos and his myriad foibles i was going to put those aside when he was doing good stuff for the country the question is is he can have a chance to do those things again by being re elected president on the basis of those things and soon trumps campaign for reelection is actually very simple things were better when i was president jobidon has been a terrible president you want a folks on my legal stuff it'll take car of it an copies ism big and brave and strong and stoic and ill just take care of all of it in court and if they come after me it is because they're corrupt but the real issue here is that jobidon is a terrible president and every day from now until the election ism an talk about a a terrible president in jobidon is and not coin look at the the sort of victimization native here ism not going to focus in it'd how the biggest story in a media's how people are being mean to me legally speaking i can handle that ism a big boy am very rich person have gone through these battles before it'll continued go through these battles but the real issue here is jobidon but trobidon does not ever seem to leave president trump's lips and that is going be a problem with him in a general election and if trump fans and and re publicans decide it the chief fact or in terms of conservative loyalty it is somehow following trump down the primrose path to losing i do not see that here i do not do not see how that works it seems there is certain not theater number of people who are who are very into this sort of thing the the rock stock robots of it more than they the idea of actually taking jordan out of the presidency over the week an lie true the ad the president's daughter in law she a shows talking about how trump is stoic and hes standing up to he baggie anta an she got a big hand for this from republican crowd on handily i saw my father and lot to day i saw on the way to the plane i saw get off the plane i think a whole world the who hi donate today i that is a pretty nightcap i well say bad it is now that i believe that dona trump was made for such a time as that is because any other perse that what hi hall he is fighting for everything america i case i just have a question who what would it mean to crumble i want cut a plead deal what's hi mean to crumble at this point just just purely on a factual level he is being indicted and now he is defending which is usually it happens wen some i gets invited and then defends and again when comes to the day indictment it is complete bull crap the blacksmith is putting for one comes to the florid indictment that is his own fault he did not have to keep those documents he could have given the documents backs the national arrives and as i say in just prosecution sure because it is politically motivated at the same time what would have ben a smart thing is not to keep the documents and not to step on the rake in the first place but our re publicans can run on that basis i want to see the at of the show that the indictments actually make him stronger n general i kep during this i see no dated this effect i see a lot of at of that suggest that trump is stronger an a primary because of the indictments becks again a lot of re publicans emotionally are resonating to him being in justly persecuted i feel it too i get it cay when a re publican is is being target by his political opposition to be put in jail for crimes that any democrat could client get away with that is political prosecution we all know it and it is terrible does that mean when an generalelection i keep asking question over never because apparently no one else will have set have get to see president trump articulate a plan for how he wins re election how what is his plan he is pending all of his money literally all of it on legal bills right now hes spending none of it of building up the voting base necessary to actually when election he is not spending it on ballad harvesting he is not spending it undone knocking he is not messaging with regard to pressman biting at all a the predictable effect of this is the data ism seeing is that it could be a really really rough year for re publicans in twenty twenty four why well there are some early special elections special elections can be a bell weather for how the actual elections of twenty twenty forgo the twenty twenty three special elections i been going horribly for republican far i wonder why could have something to do at the fact then instead of forcing in on jobidon and his terrible governments that every one hates o working to the bulls we are not forcing one i odd on that i goring to five thirty eight they did then numbers quenching they found in thirty eight special elections held far this year democrats have out performed the partisan lean by an average of ten per cent romping in parts of the country the typically support the party and cutting down on grope margins in red cities and counties two for example the democratic handset and wasstont was consol state assembly special election last month lost by just seven points in an area ore publicans have a twenty two point age more trump been bison by almost seventeen points in twenty twenty in a new hampshir special election in may for a state house the democrat one by forty three points that is far beyond the twenty three point edge in the district and these are not good numbers for republicans and for comparison of porting five thirty eight democrats out performed the weighted partisan lean by about four per cents in special elections held between twenty eighteen mad terms and twenty twenty elections when biding one white hos by four point five per see be democrat's under performs in house races now they are up by ten per cents in the special elections does that mean that necessarily nothing can change no it is still really really early but there's no question at this point that if dona true runs an election campaign that is base solely on his incitements that is probably knock in a downs the benefit of republicans and i ask once again what is the plan for victory here ill get to more on this in just one

is that if you can not to sancta town than trumpets up thenominy and get the race presumably that you want thewy newsreel is promoting the idea that don't rondosanc is out it a large number for empty seats at a meeting greet event in i he a went you sector falls before eating breakfast at the intent family restaurant for heading to a meeting gree to livestock off chin in camp but then there is a veralphoto show on social media that chows the don't lot people who showed of at this point the journalist timmiller who is very much a a sort of bulwark type left winger ism a a quake con set i supposed conserve he add a cavy out setting for what it is worth to sans is doing bunch events this we can not all have been this spars is the reality when y reboot and have to do grind it and have to grind it out blots of small events let on be on deal oke butt again it is pictures this that the media are promoting meanwhile you have politico with an entire article to day to mantises that con serve to pouffe lis m has left some donors chafing when rondisant s on veiled economic bracero lassweek he presented himself as conserve populist a septic of corporations inside a party off an o lied with them but panties rhetoric has notes always matches record as governor he is done an share to support corporations has presidential candidate has relight on contribution from tightens of the business world the tension between these two impulses was kept at bay for months as to mantis looked well position to challenge ton trump forms parties nomination but as he stumbled and continued warring with select corporations dinner and but light big business is starting to show signs of irritations again the new narrative that is going to come outs on new is that do mantis is away done for that the campaign is army over and the reason thatyoure being the media mirror that is because despite the fact that it is only august there is not been a single debate yet and we are still six months off from a primary if thing killed the mantis in the grate all right now the really in anybody in the wings the only other candidate's right now in the republican party who are already in the race a pulling in single digest if you look at the real clear politics pulling average right now ton trumps at fifty three points even the mantis at fifteen points heveinchs drop of light three to five points over the last two months the vague run same has jumped into third at six per cent and make penis at five per cents in i by contrast trump is running bout twenty seven points ahead of the mantis in new hampshir he is on about twenty four points ahead of the mantis to mantis is in second place in both of those nominating contests right now a none of whether candidates are clocking at more than single digest in any of those in any of those races right now the media can nock to mantis dawn sizes then the idea would be that trump waltzes to the nomination which at this point is apparently sort of the plan now is that going to be again it does not have to be to panties but it it can be trump but trumps and a half to shift his campaign a wave from everybody jump to my defense because that is how ism going to protect myself to here is is what ism going to do to stoptrobite there is one men do to stoptrobitin name the thing please ism waiting for it up an meanwhile just demonstrating the in sandy of our racial moment i say the media are absolute garbage at pretty much every thing on matters of race this is particularly true the way that this works apparently is that i suppose black people all over the world can be as races in antisemitic as they want to be according to the main streemedia race is man antisemitism or bad except the pending on whose performing them the reason i say this there is an amazing headline in the your times is from a few days ago about a long that was sung at a giant political rally at a leftist south african party rally that party the e f f is it run by personage juries maremma who has been challenged in cop before fort racism and he started chanting kill the beer a kill the beer b o e r is a reference to killing weight people particularly farmers in south africa according to the your times to video clip of that moment shot across the internet was seized upon by some america on the far right we said was a call the islands that notion really took off when melon musk the south african born billion who left the controls a teenager chimed in is there openly pushing for juntiside of white people in south africa well i mean yes i mean clearly if this had been a white party in south africa sing kill the black people i mean i do not know the is out supersubtle what is going on right here is the headline from the yer times over kill the beer song fun's back action south africa and you us oh it is the back lash that is the story it is not that you have full scale political parties in south africa calling for the extermination of white people the story is the back lash the sub ahead from the yer times right wing commentator's claim that an old antiparticle chance is a call to anta by violent but historians and left wing politician when brace it satiould not be taken literally oh we do not take that literally you see kill the white people we do not take literally hell we do take literally obviously is when a nasal driver tweets in a a gorge flood mean that is only taking superliteally and we destroys career over the began nasal suspended a driver name not dragon why well because he a pure to have liked and insensitive mean with the photo of gorge flood on social media least motor cup announced dragon suspension sayings actions guyot represent the valleys wartime askers had graggsand violated the stock a racing member conduct section of its rules which cousin part member should not publicly to spars people based on their backgrounds ism grandson did not a direct dress the elegy meant y knowledge his actions itshati'm disappointed myself for lack of attention ain actions on social media apparently the post has a photo of food's face and includes a reference to his death the immediate response is that he must been racist to report the mam which again not sure why that would be basis that is supposed you just gosh not quite the same thing the same media who will declare that this nasal driver is a racist and must be extirpated from america society in his job there the same people are kill the bore is actually a subtle message about the evil's of white so premise according to the your times the channel s born to time when black south african were fighting a violent races regime and was made popular in the early nineteen ninety's by proper mokaba a former youth leader in the african national congress but in twenty twelve the an see they distance themselves from the song and they expelled mister maremma for his incendiary statements apparently the m the this is all not a ideal according to the in you time despite the fact that again the song was actually band i believe it is been declared a hate speech song in south africa for years and years but now we we have to cannot go back on that because the meant that the right wing america recognized that perhaps there are in fact people who are black war racist against whites in place south africa a if we notice that than the song apparently is good again that is that is the way that this work meanwhile in a in other aspects of race tat are terrible for people everywhere the chico mayor abandon johns is focus later on crime problems in his cities o there is been mass looting all over the city of chico in recent passed and the new mayor who is not lorry lightfoot he is man lorry lightfoot abandon johns ache scolded a reporter for calling a massluting mob saying hat this was races language s again the way that this works in the median on the left is if you say that a mob ran sack to place that is races if you say kill the bower that is not races that subtle political messaging that is not appropriate that to taboo mobaxtions i did not say that that must go what i to on the icon a respectfully these large gatherings these large gathers is hod on e secco a promise you we have time o talk that is importantly that we speak of these dine anmicsiad appropriate a this is not the officiate what has actually taken place this was the then arms about then canal sundae night group for wounded at convenient store more than three in out than teen ages were are not moan twaeralerin and at lease town can i come how many than ages how many teasers that that is a lot o than ages om not mob according to the chico mayor it's just matches gray yet it turns out that the off bigotry of expectations leads to increased racism at also leads to increased from i can meanwhile only tag by the off bigotry of lo expectations the level om antisemitism that is tolerated long as it comes from black lasts is truly astonishing it rallies an amazing amazing thing and the way that that antisemitism is treated in the press is of it is a white fan of dona trump or white non fan of donate trump who white to premises then antisemite is true deep score if its coming from comas hasbela if its coming from any of the radical middle eastern muscle groups that seek to destroy the state of israel then's more o political question than whining the just off the planet and of its coming from prominent black people than it pretty much not a problem at all we just ignore it completely by the way this extends all the way to the very top of how the mediate treat people i mentioned earlier in the day this interview with a historian saved marry about barokobama is the fact that barokobomasantisemitism was overlooked for literally years is an amazing amazing indicator of just how easy people on e left go when it comes to antisemitism coming from members of the black community tablet magazine covering this davitamiels is the is the author he writes to there is a fascinating passage and rising star avid arrows comprehend biography of barokoboma's early days in which the historian examined toboma's accounts in dreams from my father of his break up with his long time chico girl friend shilemiochiager in dreams bomb describes a passionate disagreement following a play by african america playwright august willow in which the young protagonist defend is insipid to brace of black racial consciousness against his girl friends white identify liberal universalism as readers we know the stakes of this decision will be come more than simply personal the black america man bomb wills into being in the scene would go on to marry a black woman from the outside of chico an and shell robins and after mew york rise when election as the first black president of the united states it what barrel documented after tracking down an interviewing sheelameociager was an explosive fight over a very different subject in years telling the quarrel that ended the couple's relationship was not about aroma self identification as a blackmail the impetus was not a play about the america basics black experience but an exhibit at chicagofs spirits institute about the nineteen sixty one trial of ant f iceman at the time that abomasa chili visited the spirit institute chico politics was being royal by a black moral aid namesteive comely when a series of lectures organized by looseferri combination of i slam accused jewishcoctors in chico of infecting black babies with aids as part of the genicitle plot against african america the episode violated a deep rift within the city's power salons with some prominent black official supporting comely others calling for his firing in lager's recollection what set off the quarrel that precipitated the end of the couple's relationship was aromas stubborn refusal after seeing the exhibit and in the swill of the comely affair to condemn black racism hell acknowledging that aromas embrace to black identity have created some degree of distance between the couple she insisted what upset her that day was aroma's inability to condemn comedy's commons it was not mama's blackness that bother her but that he would not condemn antisemitism well i mean yah that again is not a shock remember that barokobama sat in ceramic rite's church for fully for full on twenty years full twenty years as at any show that he would not condemn antisemitism back in his younger days where the latest example of black antisemitism one is being ignored one is one is not being ignored as much amie fox over the weekend grow a post on integral san quit they killed this judge named jess what do you think bad due to you followed by the hash tags fake friends and far love the actor labors leaded the post not before being accuse antisemitism on social media because of course they killed this judge named jess very often tat is used by people who soft news very much prefer to news decipher piston liked the post before us he leaded and then she a she unlike it and said i did not this post on purpose or by accidents apparently was miraculous more importantly i wanted be cleared my friends and anyone hurt by showing up in their feels a d not support any form of antisemitism a truly do not hate tower he of any kind period now fox postal apology said i wont apologized to the used community in everyone who is offended by my post i know my choice of words has cause offense ism sorry that was never my intense said instead he was referring to a far friend who had betrayed him apparently there was also speculation that this sort of phraseology is used frequently the black communities suggesting they killed jess which sometimes in imprecation with regard to news or amie fox backs off that one meanwhile carry bees gets away with surest outrageous jewfish stereo typing available cardie and again as as a person who is not a connoisseur of her entire over a cardiac who is a deeply on intelligent human being she tweeted out the other day a picture of two critic news and these news are in the full o cosmic garb probably in bookman one is wearing a trial which is the can of furry round hat that you see sometimes a the other is wearing a a a a black hat and is also wearing i e a a beccasha which is can a long black jackethies the anemology the sixth go back to plan om and very typical if stereotypical picture of ultra orthodox news and she says remember dot do dot do do do to what exactly s she referring to apparently she is referring to a line in her shakespearian song bike had i in which she says this a soppy pod a to he gotta ugh ism lawyer is a new is the wine my lawyers a new he on an get my money gan that this the idea being that be cut there is the e typical jewfish seriate that that news our disproportionately lawyers son a steritipis that is true news our dis proportionately lawyers doctors accountant there a lot of different industries in which news represent a disproportionate share of members of the industry what is actually serytipical an ansemetic is the implication that if you take a picture of two very holistic news that this is somehow representative of herewith lawyers now we actually have pictures of her jewfish lawyers i her jewfish lawyers look secular reform news at the very very bast to these look the news that you just saw on the streets of new york and the idea that all news are the same is is a hello is a hello stereotype if i was wow i it rappers and the i just posted picture baracalam an aricolder you billion that is a little resist is not it that's an the little basis carry be however says thiskount stuff on the routine and no problem whatsoever and this is true through out unfortunately rap culture this stuff is posted routinely by people ranging from ice cube to carry be and everybody's course it hi whatever is really big git while i mean it would be if we are hung out any other race attacking members of any other race this is that the fact that is let off to hook is astonishing to me but again it shows that when a racial preference in racial hierarchy is create in the name of intersectionality ugly things then occur and meanwhile the a the science crowd is out there continuing their work carry's razors our good friends at carry's you remember carry's carry's is the reason we watch i hate harry carry's racers used to be a sponsor on some of the shows over here and then they realize that our host did not believe that men could magically become women and vice versus and they pulled their advertising and said that they not our audience basically we launch i hate harry and we have well over a hundred thousand subscribers who buy our racers instead of carry's lasers well i thing is time for more of you who are carry's racers subscribers to consider i hate carry's sod come after carry's put out a piece of social media advertising celebrating quote my first pride with facial airs this is a women who had her breast tissue carved out of her and that had hormone treatment to grow facial hair and is now using carry's razors in order to shave her face that tat those are a trains gender stars that are happening right there growing up i always is envious of boys going through puberty getting fashaland running how states as his person i love grongabarn maintaining it haven't fatal hand grommingretine is most gender affirm thing to me the job harry you have turned this young woman into a deformed young woman a really great job you you have you have celebrated the mutilation and selfmutilation of a young woman that is just that is just tremendous a folks if you do not wish to actually give your money to those people perhaps you would to give your money instead to a company that is not hate your got but is all part of the push for science that we have been seeing i sell a real to grasstson we have had on the sundae special before and we had not exchange over transgenerism in in which noegrastison something became very very unscientific expressing many non verifiable ideas about what costumes manhood womanhood i now he has a decided to go even farther here is it real o grasstison talking about talking about men and women competing a against each other in sports on the michael shurmershell it is a little weir that we split people by male and female in this way ism imagining a hundred years from tor looking back do back a hundred years ago the split poison girls in that could compete than expect that just be count of a little weir a o on anele because that can matin then o we as i can imagine that too but the differences are mast on have again have seen the pictures gas at isn't collage wrestler send but the average won an i an the all a the average woman wrestler is not can real to take down you when you were in your your peg maybe at female you we it your you are an old man on the porch in the rocking chair right men ism tell now ow i a telling you not a telling you you are criticizing something that is indeed of modification you mean human biology that is at any to modification inside break o scientist need to grastison but women and men on average o not perform similarly with regard to athletics which is why venue willies and serenalans it their asses kick by a two hundred rings man who is smoking between says and there are the greatest woman's tennisplayers probably ever certainly serena is meanwhile here is tneldegratison trying to explain away his lack of science here is a more complete take on what exactly general is supposed to be according to astrophysicist need to grastison point is a patently the ex ex ex we cronasones are insufficient because when we wake up in the morning we exacgury what ever feature we want to portray the gender of our choice either the one you are sign the one you choose to whatever it is and now here now just to a timber on this i say to you somewhere i read somewhere it'd think i read that the united states was a land where we have the pursuit of happiness yes suppose no matter my camisole to day i feel eighty per cent female twenty per cent m ow or good i what poult o make up i good a good a to morrow i might feel eight y per cent man i remove to make up at a we of must ships why do you care whet why do you care that i care do what you are going to do and then live in the world and also recognize that this does not make you a man or a woman his not scientific have today i feel ice an astrophysicist an eighty per centastrophysicist to day to morrow a wake up do not be ten per centastrophysiist in the day after i will not be astrophysicist at all what does he care if i walk into a lab and stare performing the do of astrophysicist what is that matter mean after all ism identifying his anastrophes test what exactly is the problem but if i also put on a white labcoat and i and i we are we are to wine sure what if i do all those things that would that make me water ism night identify that way it would make me feel is scientificized you feel the science happening do you feel it happening in real time here from nail to grass telson and if if all womanhood is is make up and dresses then i have some bad news for the future of human reproduction it turns out that that is not the case meanwhile again the scientists doing their best to not to science the america academy of pediatrics according to lost journal plans to review the evidence for genera forming medical care and potentially amends is policies that help guys doctors and citations providing the treatment to transgender youth an odd making if you would done the damn research in the first place and cared about it as supposed to simply dictating that we should shoot children full of hormones than cut off their genitals thou's in amazing if you get done the list research first but apparently now it was more importanthat they do the the most tolerant possible thing which is to refer people for physical mutilation rather than mental hell treatment that they clearly require look a time for some things i in than some things that i hate things that i i today over the weaken i had a lot of time to reason's hosing the hospital watching my childbirth is really a terrible weaken but i did read what was a phenomenal book this a book by immortals call a gentleman in mascot and it is the best novel that have read in five ten years it is terrific it is really good it it centers on a a gunyah count roster whose sort of an old school rush in member of the up the upper class beef and he ends up being take in by the red soviets in the aftermath russia revolution and tried and then confined to a hotel and he is not stuck in the hotel metropolis for literally the rest of his life that is his sentence that he is going to be he is going be sentence to live in a fairly small room in this hotel for thereat of his life he's not aloud to leave ever and the entire novel is about what happens to him in this hotel and the people that he meets and how he finds meaning there and it is a beautiful novel it is truly beautiful not just big as the waiting is terrific because it really really is but also because of the generalize take which is that yes there are things that are worth preserving from the old world and those things are worthy of care and that perfectionism and how you approach everyday tasks actually matters and that y you have to open yourself up to experiences o family and child bearing in order to find your most purposeful self and also of course it exposes the tremendous evils of the soviet unionist does in a really subtle and a an amazing way it is it is truly a masterpiece a gentleman in mascot highly recommended by afar tolls a this one is recommended to me my friend drew clean who has am interesting taste of literature there his a nitrate with me about seventy five percent this one is one of his respects here for mean is book really work the read a gentleman in mascot by amartolsco pick it up today okay other things that i i ask you which way western man this ta picture of the prime minister of canada who is now getting to worst and a it is picture of him with his son at the baby move and i just have to say are the chines quaking in their boots at this point he had tweeted out were team baby and is a picture of him and a a pink switched that is his love you more and his son who is wearing a pink teeshirt and star short and there gazing bizarrely and creepily into the camera right in fronton the cargo lobby trying jostling poster from baby here are your choices the people what team baby or the people who are not team baby yes this is union know where i stand on this but where do you stand on this and am and i ask you should does this speak well of the future of the western world is this is this were things are going are they going amazingly while a russia russia and china just ad a joint military exercise near plasma and meanwhile the head of canada is tweeting out bazar votes himself with his son from the baby move and saying he is team baby ah the future is in a best of hands but i love it when people expose themselves for who they are in just intrados can can you imagine it man fell caster must be turning over in his grave to see his son acting this way cat time for some things that i hate already pagan reopen one most irritating people on planned earth a she had an opportunity to push the united states woman's national socratim into the next around now she is most famous for having blue hair and also for really hating america mean the national anthem is bad and america a deeply sexes in races place evenogther pain her was to much money to play sport no one has ever watch except once every for years when we all pretend to be interested n women poker an all the rest of it well repent apparently had a penalty shot and a she mess and the united states lost and they got booted by sweden and a bizarre enough shes started and of laughing and smiling after she missed the shot and she's miss by little she must by a lot now to be fair to a tomagan ripping now theyreall these pictures tat are going around of her laughing and smiling and all the rest of it and tom she i yow people react in bazar ways to terrible things happening to he's som nocking a blame her for a laughing and then crying people do react in weird ways toad situations if you ever ad to tell many truly horrible news you can do not knowhow to do i get that the probe again rhino that is knowing is that she is main repine and she is asked after blowing this game she is asked about the most important things to her her best memories from her career and her best memories from her are absolutely obviously political is there a memory that stands out to right now in this moment oh hum i mean probably equal chance u left to the final m and i think there saying equally but con ben saying a lot of things i think this them is always fought for much more an that is been the most rewarding part from me of course playngin for cups and winning champion ships in doing a that but you enough to know that we have us i really special find ti do something that is really change the world forever the that is not most to me and the players in this backroom here they are just getting started and to all players have played with obviously u what it is to be in the find it is the best part i mean will present in biding treated out you us world national optime you have made your country proud congratulations on an incredible run there seem is something special on looking for to sing how you continuance spire america give written determination on and off the field hat's the worst per romance in years a present biding of course had to sign in because he is big fend of pagan ripping where we all pretend that the woman's socratime is even remotely similar to the mensocrams completely different sporting oms wayless revenue on on for your basis done matter man r you know continued be hailed by the left as a heroine i get the problem main rape now's not such amistippenalty shot lot's people in's penalty shots and h promise not that she reacted weirdly when that happens when breadstuff happens breadstuff happens the problem main rape know is that she is kind f a terrible person and the she is spend her entire career pressing for theine that america is a terrible horrible place the has made her extraordinarily wealthy and famous for playing a sport that no one career about world wide you want to know the the evidence that no one cares about the sport world wide that the united states winds every year that is that is how that no one cares about the sport world wide because they are seven people in the united states who take soccer seriously compared to the rest of the human population for winning at that sport that means that half the population in the rest of the world then you compete in that sport that is that is just the way it is but we h we to pretend that america terrible rowboat very bad place that is that that is that is that and we bid a not

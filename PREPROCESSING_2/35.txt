to day is the day it is the was caucus is the primaries have finally at long last begone the i caucuses to day in of course iota this re publican primary is going to decide well not all that much unless donate true falls on his face the expectations for donate trump jurors that he is going to win by an extraordinarily while march an by the polling data he has the largest need among any republican hominy in modern america history the latest poles that are out from i show him is the one from the demoing register and bisinuws an media coming shows trump with forty eight per cent of the vote that as followed now by nickel hale at twenty per cent governor rondo mantis at sixteen per cent aroma swamp at eight per cent that means that donate trucks a twenty eight per centare point lead in that particular primary going in which means that the expectations are these can blow away the rest of the field the real question is one does he and two by how much that is the real question going in the reason i say that it does not really decide all that much the i caucuses unless trump falls on his face is because we have had a bunch of candidates win the i causes in then go on to fail in the rest of the primaries gorge shall bush when the i causes in two thousand hinted up winning of course but my cuckaby when the i caucuses in two thousand eight rick tantrum when the i causes in two thousand twelves had crews when the i caucuses in twenty sixteen literally none of them became the hominy the i causes are not highly predictive of who will be the hominy but this is a bit of a different race only in the cents that because dona trump is such an overwhelming favorite the question is going to be whether the god bleeds a dona trump is far ahead of the rest of field in every single primary at this point that if he shows weakness in this early primary it could be a problem at for him now an order for him to show weakness in the early primary one of two things has to happen either ronde cantus has to wildly out perform or nickel hale has to wildly out perform one of those two things has to happen new samphire of course is much closer and everybody is army pointing forward toward the future primaries those con me new samphire and south caroling in new samphire right now the latest polling tutor from w h d h ever can has donate trump up forty four twenty eight over nickel hailed chis crispy just dropped out to presumably a lot of that supports an go two nickel half ronasantis is running in single tigers in new samphires nickel halers the only person whisky has a shot at dona trump in new hampshre and the you mew board two south caroling and the really is not a lot i god poling in south caroling at this point nickel halcyon course of the former governor of south caroling here the various paths if donate trump winds i walking away he'll have a lot of momentum going into new samphire a probably i we samphire that ha en south caroling hell sweep it is over if donate trump wildly under performs and a nickel hale either winds or comes in i strong seconds in the i caucuses n then goes ahead and wins in new samphire then we had down to south caroling and things get a little interesting because she of course has a fairly solid bases of support in south caroling given the fact that she was governor there and then you move on to future primaries and it is not clear that for example new york republicans are on a for example love donate trump over someone nickel hale is trump still the favorite under that scenario where trump winds i loses new samphire and it is pretty close an south down trump is certainly still the favorite under that sin are but you see a path front mantis to cantus has to probably win the i carcass to day if to mantis comes in second unless it is a very close second unless he finishes then ten percentage points one donate trump in this primary his path narrows tremendously he has no shot in new vampire according tote pulling data in south caroling in n ow at good pulling data in south caroling but he would have to outlay trump and presumably nickel hailed as well and want nickel hale has strong ground game in south caroling and a sand s been sending an awful lot of time in i to mantis has done all of the ground work in i more ground work than pity much any other candidate he only other candidatewhas been the ground more is probably the a romasuamy who is been travelling across the state back and forth and all the rest will get to ham in a minute because donate trump really shaved him the gut over the weaken again the big problem for trump the only proem for trump is that the level of expectation for him is high the if he comes in low you could not genetically have a bit of a disappointment for his team is that likely to materialize i think not the reason i think not is because donate trump supporters are very very enthusiastic about donate trump now enthusiasms can make a huge difference to night in the i carcass why because it is creaking cold over there mean right now into join it is expected to be as if to night negative nine degrees negative nine degrees the these are there is a win chill warning that has gone out for safety reasons it is it zero degrees all day long and then it dips to negative nide it to night when people finished work in actually origan a go and caucus that is if you are a marginal candidate or somebody who does not have high levels of enthusiasm what is here nick hailed right now nickel hale has been serving in the pulling in i how many people there are demo the of nick hale as supposed you desancis cop which is really really strong in i and trumscore with is really really strung an i again if have to ball park this and weather is going to play a factor i would suggest that hale under performs the pulsing a it an i and ta mantis over performs performs the poles fairly substantially in i i thing trump is probably going to continue to dominate in i that is if i had to ball market right now o dona trump is in fact on the ground in i doing summer alleys and it is obvious that he is having a god time right trump thinks that he has momentum because let us be real about this by pulling data he does i have to say that one of the reasons why trump is going to do well in states even with bad weather conditions is because his people are real dinars we all know this my people who love trump lav trump get to for on this in just one second first imagine that you are the king a king of an empire and you are going to educate your son in the

of his rallies it the washington post picked up on called god made trump from an internet creator and it is a pretty wild about it does show you t level of tear felt that many trump supporters have for now trump on a personal level then on your important i for in on o o on an anilin a m i r an o on anal on nan y i on monk i et o for opinion o i for on any a moan ion er a on o oil a an i i ana media an a a o on iron an on on an on a i i an anal an in on in oi i on an o u gan an albania begin but listen i thing down of trumpet tat a lot of wonderful things as president but the real importance of something this is obviously that if your trump support in surdagrees are you silvan go vote for trump the answer is kind of yes this is the big three by the way to jobiton the big threats o jobidon is not that trumpsngan atoll him by ten points the big threats to jobidon is trump supporters will crawl over broken glass to vote personal trump and jobidon supporters will not that is the real threats to jobidon in the general a lection base enthusiasm dos at meanly trump again who is having a good time on the stump he shut up in the middle the night n o is wearing a come look tole bat rumble and some people are making fun of that the not cars a mean a literally knowing cars and then he shows up at ta in indianoa in h soup and a and he says guys if you show up and you vote another you die if hypothermia it is worth it he is joking the major try to treat the serious lay he is joking obviously an its very funny he an pass era the yes the re of i gate by the way his voters well i pee belong to show up for him hackers showed up at this event by the way and he started taunting them see that the magic power the trump has always had that he is is stand of comedian every treats him a normal political retortion and that of course is silly he constantly here democresily he does not talk a regular president and it is really bad everyone knows that it is all baked into the cake and honestly his charm is the fact that he is basically triumph the insult comic dog but a politician an no emery the ruins and i ben iris re gahamnmane the trump then is putting is putting out statements attacking jobidon which is cracks has let me get this strait were dropping bombs all over them at least again write if he demise us your secretary of defense just when missing for five days is runningthe war from his laptop in a hospital room remember this the same going that surrender nafcantistand where known is he to countable a fired thorns most embarrassing moment in the history of the united states now have worsen you crane is real and man but no war on our southern border oh that mac e lot of sent crooked jobidon is the worst present in the history of the united states and this is white donate trumpwright now in the pulling data is beating jobidon is not because people love trump he has base the loves him is just people think that jordan stinks he is currently pulling in theapprovalratings at thirty three you so cant win reelection if those numbers there is no way to whin reelections with those numbers even if you think the donate trump on the ballot is going to drive democratic turn out on gate all of this these i will caulis they're coming up all this led to a strange confrontation between donate trump and a candidate who has been absolutely praise worthy of donate trump which has raised the question the entire campaign is t why he is running for president the be the take romasuommy now there few reasons that you run for president obviously one of those reasons is because one o raise ideas and i think that the take in some cases has raised really important ideas i think the take for example has club the media about the ears and that is been absolutely delightful to watch but it is also true that we are now at the point of the primaries for people are doing the voting and over the week end a big mistake was made by awake and trump absolute clobber i awake was making the case people should vote for him the oil caucuses the problem of course that trump is actually in the will caucuses and you can vote for trump and the question is why are you in the race you thing the trump is unbelievably great and if you are entire roll in the races to defend trump why are you here you s you drop out now right you have served your purpose you've been a stalking horse for the trump campaign you have made your points politically speaking you have gotten done whet need get but but naval as still the racoon this to point the trump is gin to make momentarily the take wits telling people that in order to save trump you have vote for him which is weird because that makes no sens because dona from definitely definitely does not the need lava gromasammy in the race me by polling data again but a romasuamy's pulling eight per cent n i by polling data teak romasuammy is currently pulling at four per cent in new samphire no donas from does not need take bromasuammy in the race in any way shape per form and again wasn't it it is if you must staying the race you totally gan it is free country but he is over you not going be the nominee this time for shore and again it is o very weird campaign the your running where you are literally saying that the guide who is on the other side of the stage is the best president of your lifetime you have no critiques for him but your stole the race here is wake making a weird case in than trump just clobbering him it's what safe what a save trump couple ism telling o that you oryeu'r sending hin flew but you are sending him to his own the sons y you are falling into the trump that i la country's falling in that hes fall won safe trumpet for me i been you support t i i to that is a good argument that is the argusthat bigshot argument it is the truth do the right thing forty for this country that as workthank you no a ism ism sorry that makes that the reason he is saying this is he saying the trump is on to get con evicted of a crime and then he is going to lose better that you so nominate me and then i will save trump by pardoning him that is such an unbelievable banks be cause trump is again in the driver seat in this race get's more on this in just one second first are you struggling with back taxes or have unfired returns at this year the tires is now escalating collections by adding twenty thousand new agents or no in the challenging times you are best offense is to use tax network you s a e over fourteen years of experienced tax network you u say has save their clients over a billion dollars in back taxes they specialized negotiating with the press they are introduce your that significantly tax not work you us does not just negotiate they protect your assets from era seizures and manager hourly returns for on going compliance importantly here license to help with all state tissues regardless of where you live in the united states seize control of your financial future right now do not let tax issues over power you contact tax network you u say for immediate relief and expert guidance cold one eight hundred two four five at six thousand or visit t and u s a dot come slash paper turn to tax it work you a say find you are pass to financial piece of mind that t and u s a dot come slash chipper do not let the tires ruining your life if behind on those back taxes you got o get that iron ow turn to tax network you us right now hat never to t and u s a dot come slash aero this lad donate true to go on true social in put out thecae started his campaign as a great supporter the best president in generations et camera unfortunately now all he does is disguise is support in the form of deceitful campaign tricks very sly but vote for a van is s vote for the other side do not get dupe by this vote for trump do not wast your not back is not ago the biding indictments against his political opponent will never be allowed in this country the are already beginning to fall mama and then trump campaign advisor crisis over up unleashed on romasuammy on a an hour before that there is a photo that showed naval standing with a bunch of young men wearing shirtsthats tat save trump vote awake unless veto wrote here is a great picture of this campaigns number one fraud trump does not need saving if you support d dona trumpet sure is held do not do not vote for this fake this obviously was very very bad for awake who is spent his entire campaign basically maisoshing trump men yet you literally could not get into criticize true on on virtually any topic and again there many reasons to run for president but it is very her to make the argument the what your actually doing his running for president when you spend the entire campaign smashing one of the other guise and awake can do that mean that there is a there is an actual plan by have when is being laid out by the wallstry journal that his actual strategy was wait for trump to drop out that trump show gets hit by incitements trump gets defeated something happens to trump and then all trump support floats over to naval and savages basely the catch all for trump support we u spend the entire campaign trogon wonderful trump is in case god forbid something happens to trump and then arak is standing right there this with the wallstry journal is saying romastwammy's plan is essentially treated out to take over the form president's voter base should the former present be come ineligibles runs do is many due to his many legal challenges this is the case that awake was making and meanwhile trump is no not interested at all why are you here if you love me much get out yet very bad moment for awake in the campaign and then naval continues to try to he tries to explain his way out of it said i respect that hell out of trump he she best president of the twenty for century have tofenden him and every step against the in just persecutions tut open your eyes to the hard trout the systemwall stop in nothing to keep this man away true the white house which is in fact the same argument weirdly that nickel hailed is making i which that trump campaign it is also he same argument the the mantis making but they are making it openly and have was making it more covertly which is while trump his basely talking him out for all of that is a very weird moment with trump and awake is that can to have any like serious impact on the race no because take was palling at eight percent the first place i be very shocked if he gets at eight present in the arocoxis particularly after trump smackedhim down over the weaken meanwhile there are other candles who actually would theoretically may o be as we discussed at the top of you can kind to see you through a glasthirically make have some sort of shot at true those who be presumably dianthus and hail gay sot what does the mantis need the stands basely new to wind to night he needs a win or he needs a very trunk second within single digests of donate trump in order to re vivify his campaign now the only way that happens if the polls art wildly wrong or the sand i support is diamond hard in i a that it with stands the weather in a way that say nickel valley's support does n on to want as spent the weekend talking about surpassing atkxpectations and again it is true that in america politics you can be a front will come back kid without actually winning this exactly what happened to build canton he was the come back kid not because he ends it up actually winning in the nineteen ninety two new samphire democratic primaries is one by pull tongue but big canton managed a second place finish is in nineteen ninety two then he start calling himself the come back kid right which again though those very weird because on canary nineteenth of that year canton was actually ahead of the field at twenty nine per cent in song is had seventeen per cent and then there re allegations about bill canton and see for flowers and their affair another he fell really far behind and then he ends it up in the en losing by lice nine per cent than he said callinghimself to come back hidden of course he and up winning the nomination you could have the same dynamic the critically here is that people have such low expectations of the cantos having slid down and many of the polls always to there ileofchis the state where spent the most money and most time that maybe if he out performs those poles patties dramatically somehow you get to come back kid narrative here is to mantis trying make that clam simple cluster get win lie but what i since that have have learn that it is good to be an under dog went folks want ta couch it out when they want u say o these when they want a it cite these polls i may thin that that art's e porter here i think i when generally i think they they roll the uses at some of these polls because how you can poll a cakes a let's let's ane in beget i twenty two a voters are already there get a turn out wee built this great organization we have got great in these es e on the grab get i this ted all ninety nine counties that is that that is what you need to be open to do well work it i do well but have rather have people a count us out i rather have tell a lower expectations for us i tend to perform better that bate that is his plan his plan is out perform and he is making the aggressive case against trump that for sample the take was not which is we again trump attacking the sander for staying in the race does not make he sent bet him attacking the take in the race the make some sente gets her on this in just once second first if you are looking to treat yourself this year you deserve nothing but the bust i am talking about mommy

mommy johns dot come slash man that is mommy john dot come slashpensy side for details here is tosantis pointing out like dona trumps i pact on the down ballet races in twenty twenty two was pretty bad armorers understandably see biting is a very feeble week and and for president and i think some of it is they think anyone can begum yet by argument on that is is a that that would have been a case in twenty twenty two in the mid terms we probably never had a circumstances more favorable for the party biding was unpopular in plain was hot the border was a disaster crime all these issues we should have been able t any republican with a pulse should have been able to want when and yet the democrats made it a referendum a tromp in his a gave in candidate and there is just certain swing voters that the just market to go there at that point the basis again making in aggressive cancan true now the problem for the artist just in arms the pulling data is get right down the pulling data trump does pretty well against join this has been he single biggest obstacle to de mantis campaign since basically canary of twenty twenty three in canary went twenty the there is widespread republican sentiment that donate trump was he drag on republican tickets he pick to bunch of bad sent at candidate in the twenty twenty two race that hade led to the republican lost of the senate in twenty twenty two twenty twenty obviously he lost the presidency and then he proceeded to help lose two seats in the georgia seats in in the senate which led to trilling to dollars in additional spending there is a feeling late and twenty twenty two tried remember all thewy back learn twenty twenty to after those battelection o republicans there is a feeling that trump was going to drag down the ticket and he need somebody else but the mantis did not jumping in canary twenty twenty three instead he waited all the wait until may of twenty twenty three and by doing that he basically a loud trump to define him before the race even began that is if you can write the retrospective of the campaign before the campaign is is even over and wright now because the pulling data for trump recovered and the pulling data for widen went down it now looks trump its cam competitive campaigner against thobidn and in fact has the upper hand in many of these poles that is the systemic problem for to sense now again what is h have to get done to night in order for him to be considered a viable candidate going ford he needs a strong second if he finish is third two nickel hailed i think that de basis race is probably over at that point because again he is then going to it tar to see him performing well an new hamster or south caroling if he loses in i and there is no sense of serious momentum meanwhile mickey hailed is non spending any time in i at this point for he's very minimal time in i at this point she has her eye on new samphire she is already putting enormous support into new samphire be cause what she is figuring is if i out perform in i will it say that i finish second in i i was expected to finish third two tdesantis strum and ism finishing second in i nip mew forth ne samphire and i win in new samphire well maybe then we go down to south caroling i say and we out perform in south caroling and the a sort of a battle to the finish potty nick hailed and dona true now the problem for nickel daily is that as the field consolidates further than it does right now let say to santistrops out late toy that de mantis loses i comes in third drops out because he has no shot new samphire and out caroling logwood let say that is what happens the basis support is not in a lot hailed the basis support is mainly on a floated trump get trump has the upper hand in this campaign and basically shooed have to somehow hit a seven ten split an bowling in order for her to win the nomination of this point this is why all the systemic factors line up in favor of dona trump it is also why the democrats are starting to panic overtly about the possibility of a dona trump presidency hen some of that panic is manifesting in just absolutely insane ways is an article from end sinews that would amount to a coo o case that if this were effectuated according to end sinews quote fears grow that trumpwill use the military in did pretrial ways if he returns to the white house the people the are mentioning for it possible defend secretary christopher miller who serve temporarily during his administration michael fly and mike pompeoso first of all an michael fly there at fair number of of serious chromites of michael flip as somebody the secretary defense but mike popped was the national secretary of state under dona trump the idea and also the ad of the we the idea that mike popped would somehow be a threat to national security a sendoff is totally insane absolutely wild and the same thing by the way holds three of christopher miller a christopher miller was the former acting united states secretary of defends head served as the director of national countereterorism enter as well this bazar idea the chronopher miller would be a threat to the good working or of the united states or that mine popped would be thought those are those are bizarre accusations and yet you have democrat to are already discussing the possibility already of using the deep state against donate trump should he become preset which of course helps grumpy comprecideveis the part he democrats no understand the more you talk about the dictatorial means you're going to use if he comes president or to stop him from becoming president the more that rocks oledonal trumpaye is going to be motivated to get out to the poles and vote and the thing the democrats really need understand is the back in twenty twenty all the rules were different it is nock in a shake down the same way they change they did in fact change all of the voting rules which is li sixty percent of democrats voted by mail in the last election cycle compare to thirty two percent of republicans voting by mail in the last election cycle that are not on me the umber this ton it is con go back to typical it con be more purity it is more party r publicans win themocrater not can get the levels of turn out that they did in twenty twenty against dona trump and ever republican is going to go and vote as early in his often as humanly possible that is what is going to happen in this electors and that's particularly true the more at there is a perception that you are caponizing the government preemptively against trump this more on this in just one second first have been talking about my heels sleep mattress for years give hound my jealously mattress for in almost a debate at this point it is possum it is the gift that keeps on giving every night when i climb into that after my children have warn me completely out i am reminded of how great relics is relic is now introducing their newest most high and collection the helicsyleet he la to lead harness is years of extensive mattress expertise to offer that truly elevated sleep experience the helixtly collection includes six different mattress models each tailor for specific sleep positions and from his preferences hen over to heck sleep got come slashed check out the new collection to day if your nerves art buyingamattress on line you do not have to be because relics has that sleep puts in match es your body type and sleep preferences to the perfect mattress why would you by mattress made for somebody else i took the helices quit i was matched with a farm but breathable mattress honestly great matters you are on a of it and right now he six offering a special deal they are offering twenty five present off all matrosors plus two free pillows for our listeners start the are affright up greater sleep at helix sleep got am slashed it is their best offered it is nocking a last long that heck sleep got come slashed with hell's better sleep starts right now secure is what envy seen he sets quote dona trump sparking fears among those who understand the inner workings of the pentagon that he would convert the non parts in us military into the muscular arm of his politicalitenda as he makes comment about dictatorship and devalues the checks and balances the underpin the nations two century old democracy so and everybody is now afraid the he is going to come indicator first of all that is not how any of this works the notion that dona trump has the unilateral power to convert the guess military as president of the united states into a caponized force against the america people or against his political opposition when you are in the us military you have an obligation of an oath uphold the constitution of the united states which means you are held responsible for violating the constitution of the united states if you think that the military men and women whore serving the country are simply him obey any president who tells them to do any crazy thing that is not how any of this or andagain we have evidence of this because they did not now there is one of the funniest things about the canary six it was an insurrection nonsense and what it was was a bad riot got out a control my say bad right i mean it was bad and it was riot i only there was a particularly damaging right because the truth is that in terms of riots commerce to twenty twenty was nothing in terms the actual damage done physical in terms of death and injury he was bad in that i was terrible for the country and it shouldn't have happened and also who cleave within three hours in the good working order of the macros he went forts the idea this was in organized the insurrection by trump is insane and by the way if you are worried that dona trump is can be able to caponize the military why did not he do it on canary sixth doyouthink dona trump could have given in or to the secteff i want you to activate the national hard to invade congress hold them at gun point then stop the electoral workings of legislator branch do you think that would have happened if you do your delusional but there plotted i fusional people in the talking about it openly quote a circle of a pointers independent of trumps of political operation steered him away from ideas he would have pushed the limits of presidential power in his last term according to boys they have written in testimony given toe congress most were on by the end in a new term at many former officials worried trumpet instead surround himself with loyalists unwilling to say no now bracing for trump's potential return a loosing network of public interest groups and lawmakers is quietly dividing plans to try to foil any efforts to expand presidential power which could include pressuring the military to cater is political needs those taking part in the effort told them be e news they are studying from past actions and twenty twenty four policy positions they will be ready if he wins nonmember then calls for parings take legal action and send letters who trumpet points spelling out consequences if they would face if they under mine constitutional forms now again writing letters to members the administration is not a cool them but if there is an attempt yo weapon eyes for example members of the executive branch against the president of the united states that is a real problem that is the deep state the people are talking about that the democrats are increasingly worked and they should be increasing the word because jobidin is a total and complete failure on every level he is no not he is based everything he is that it master policy he is batt o form policing his better retired those are usually the acres along which we grate a president of the united states here he was over the we and trying to claim bizarrely that america are being prevented from reading books which is weird since scan glonamas on literally by any book i want at any time for any reason think about this m soever becensilarble you a rest is visas maforgsecisrfradcu ispecmabo emmacis r spoccetoamasemms a fredomiistae m liafrmisisa weetolthcs absolutely bazar by present magepomece far right to when he talked sounds me if you waken up at two o'clock in the morning o had eight gallium and ism your death and aft a my stomach pumps its unbelievable according to new poles be we news it is of pole thirty three per cent approve abide thirty three per went that is the lost approval rating since gorge shall be bush from two thousand sixth to that ate as he recall the two thousand election nock well for republicans and bush was not even on the ballet at this point jobidon is on the ballet and the democratic defenses of jobidon are getting more and more strained here for example his democratic governor them walls of minnisota defending hoiden as he is asked is not he too old means eighty one listen to him wall's answer this ait this it man you at who here we go i guess the question is that the campaign taking the tissue seriously enough tin gain to to i think they are they got us to your talking but an have seen the it of time with the pressed in has great we i were talking were chatting in all this and i think in all we we all get a little older a that is what happens bit you also gain that since i i think when it comes to these issues working across the aisle to get thinkstime you we the president just doing this with eight eat young with classgetting up every day doing the work i think he is just down what he does and i think it is the come of in comment upon all bus look my moms eighty eight still living on the farm grasps ourself am folks are able to do this i think the little bit of age yes when that goes to this if if it is not that would be something else first of all his mam at eighty eight poison bantherog just come put that out there i live in float a it is not the safest play s toe drive gat lot old people in florid who problishan be on the road being on the rod that is aside from normal floorman driving meanwhile you have democratic governor baby pritzcor of illinois who is having a very rough time defending joins approval rating must again it is awful thirty three percent over all approve on the economy thirty one percent apruvarating the are just not reflect numbers ore not and on the economy it even actually worseonly thirty one per cents i say that they prove of bins handling the economy how does it turn that around why well say i think your to is a bit of an outlier but but here is what all to you this battle has not even been join yet you have got up butcher re publicans dagger republicans a is bousing things that er not good for the america public that are on the stage now and not an told they trust anomaly will we true be in this battle our pol in facts an twenty eight per cent just twenty eight per cent think that present biding has the mental sharpness to effectively serve for another term how does he address those concerns those very real concerns the voters have maybe we hare a start by just acknowledging that jo biding to has years of experiments that when you talk about some snag yore also talking about the wisdom that they have gained over many years and how they have demonstrated there empathy that they have learned from many experiences boy wo boy theory reading is eulogies you snowman experiences that man had it is happen a good eulogy it is i goes you go to a funeral and the person who died was not an amazing person but you have to use words that still work it is that person with the long time that person had a lot of experiences a person saw a lot of things an that that is other talking about you abiding yet it is it is getting

fantastic birthday gift i would get this for myself for my birthday am part owner the company haven't over t enemy's racers shot come to day to came meanwhile democrats again struggling two muster the enthusiasm for goblin burning sanders who cannot law what he is seeing in the pols mean burned he still has that hunger you could we a world a burned is what cannot do it he jumps back in at the age of one hundred and seven with that said he says in the end progressives will come home to bite and that surely group many progressives will come home two jobidon the question is how many argon to show up how many are really on to show up here is burned trying to talk his way through this one to you think that young prographsives in the united states for ultimately rally behind abiding nonmember or has e seriously damage to standing look i i think in see will thee what happens n the going sorts ten pretty clear running against though top let the recall be the republican canes one of the most thintrous political figures ton modern hebercat i three within people wend up rolling a proud but i mean they are hoping they are hoping the re hoping the promise again the pol starts forgo bi n our terrible notches in terms of him personally ben from the mood this feels a change elections is not feel a stay the course election according to the latest poll from axis from arris seventy four per cent of america say they do not think there leaders care about them not a single group reached forty per cent race party gender age income geographic region zero groups reached forty per cent forty three per cent said their lives are worst under bison very is twenty nine percent who said they are better twenty eight per cent said unchanged only fifty three per cent of democrats say they are better off under president bison these are awful numbers for jobidon by the way acts has another piece saying the bison is reluctant to accepts his old age according to a ja you notice that is what he still on the ballet and again he is facing systemic problems to his presidency including his own terrible policy according to the wallstry journal there saying what i been saying for month which that even if we avoid a recession the economy is can be in slow growth stagnation mode four the for stable future according to the wallstrey journal the good news is the probability of recession is down sharply according to the wall sure journals latest survey of economic the bad news that for lot people it silvan a feu recession business an academic economist surveyed by the journal lower the probability of recession within the last ye within the next year to third nine per cent from forty eight per cent in their october survey but economist on average expect the economy to go just one per cent in twenty twenty four that is half its normal long run rate a significant slowing from the estimated two point six per cent in twenty twenty three shove dawn and economist georgia state university says this is e less recession and mora growth stop ye growthstop is not good america employers should keep but in jobs and twenty twenty for bet at a much slower plate pace than in recent years economist expect barely gain average only sixty four thousand month this year less than a third of the two hundred twenty five thousand average and twenty twenty three and far below three hundred ninety nine thousand in twenty twenty two and again one of the reasons that many of the aspects of the growing economy are not con n feeling there growing is because they are cyclical cyclical sectors the ones that are most impacted by the economy going up and out are likely to struggle in twenty twenty four which are the areas that have grown and from of america employment is ben health cabaret social distant government employment the sectors that are least likely to see strong em payment growth in twenty twenty four according to these economic professional scientific ten services by the way those are the areas where you actually get innovation those ore the areaswere you get the things that make in economy actually good manufacturing slow growth in formations slow growth health care and social assistance number on ay the these are not good numbers for mobile and not only that now i think the possibility of another serious major crisis on the foreign policy front is very very high right now anis gin to get higher if jobidon is trailing in the pulse come the summer if your china and your looking at a reproduction rate of point eight and you are looking at literally blowing up empty hotel buildings that is what they are doing now they sunk all their might thy bard billions hundreds of billions of dollars and the plaudit into building empty sky scrapers go cities in the middle of nowhere and then they convinced people in china convinced i which always has the under under scoring of force convince people to take their lifesaving and put them in these empty apartments and the empty apartment are with zero dollars and china built all of those now is blowing them up to create artificial scarcity china economy is really not in fantastic shape china has a bunch of serious he steric problems one those bike atomic problems is that the less access they have to the modern military technology available in diwan for example the less competitive they are with the united states since they are falling further and further behind the one thing they have going for them is a perception of jobidon's weakness if we get to tune jury august and jobiton is seriously trailing the puls you could see china make the decision that their window is now closing and that if they do not do this right now grafter titan right now and dona trump is president it is on an go the same way as it would as if jobidon is preside in hoiden has beet extremely conciliatory toward vision ping and they may thing to themselves oh kin we better do this now before joins out of office which of course would turn the election into a blow out if we are into middle of a war with china or at least a a stand off with china over a blockade of titan things to get really even more dick for jobidons reelect efforts the voters of titan for them now honestly good for them the voters of titan have made at clear to china that they have no intention of appeasing them according to be we news over the week end voters in tisane elected vice president licking as their next president on sturdy to find warnings from bashing not to support a cansedat an has called a separatist and y trouble maker the election which china describes my choice between war and peace could tests an efforts by bashing and washington proparelations than an recent years have fallen t their lowest point in decades lives victory extends the eight year rule of democratic progressive party which is considered the least friendly party two basing relations between titans china have deteriorated under president ti in wen whose first selected in twenty sixteen and his limited to two terms voters and titan were concern focus with china both economic issues in employment housing cuts an income in a quality lie one with forty per cent of the vote compared with thirty three per cent for who ye e of the main opposition party the quartan tang ism s am scribing up these names an i apologize if both the other parties favored clos to relations with basing the d to the d p p is significantly more confrontational if you are china your looking a more confrontational i want and for china and you are looking at a conciliatory bide administration that may be losing to dona true that may be a time these starts thinking very seriously about accelerating whatever military plans you have four ti wan meanwhile nonlegal immigration democrats are completely falling apart on the one hand they will not lam there is no problem on the other hand the n clem there is a mass of problem clause by republicans for example you have represent am gasman cracker democrats of tectashing there is no issue on our southern border he we go i think part of this is just the fact that the republicans have no the rhetoric but the border obviously they are continually talking about the fact that they have not pat bills they do not have anything to run on and it is easy enough to run on this trip of people i will tell you it someone who is the sextan i who does have communications with bordtof patrol they are doing their jobs i mean that big is so is why do we have many people that are coming over here to insinuate that there is the security issue i in the calm of there is much crime that is going on the were not able to cat i aught i actually have to tip my hat off to border patrol and border patrol has at us to make sure that we can improve the technology that they can have better the sextan of those tat is that are trying to get over and trying to bring things over o hat this is while i was just down at the boarder talking word patrol agents what she is saying is not true it is not a matter of technology it is matter of staffing and not we new more staff we need to stop using staff is a bussing informing service for elegalimigrans coming into the country democrats of a real border problem and if they keep pretending that is not a border problem and they keep trying when publicans is not can and well for them and meanwhile the situation over in israel is also not fantastic join does not have any control on the foreign policyside just has no control whatsoever which is why he is been hitting empty shacks in the middle of nowhere apparently with regard to yeomen and the soothes now he needs to be hiding n w these who these are our stopping local treating the had a major impact on the price of shipping for example and join is not in fact going it alone he has an enormous coalition of people include ranging from baherane to germany and france in you cat but jobidon has a problem which is that he created this problem by being soft on on in the first place is why over the weekend joining was claiming that it is a relevant whether the who these are designated is terrors were because they did not seem to think it is relevant they seem to take his d designation of the who these is terrorist which was the very first move his administration made they seem to take that as weakness as one wood in the at a least because weakness is in fact weakness he her her what ho you ate mister ofothetese the creation e saint erect very s the the respond nomacginnus why he is his his not with it any more meanwhile apparently jobitdin his running out of patient with being its who now that this is i got this i a ridiculous thing the reasoning's ridiculous because any time you see these headlines they are being leaked by the administration about how bison is run man a baby been is not the sole power in the israel governments say is just ignorant of the facts there is a war cabinet in israel it includes the opposition deny goes it includesyou of glans who the doffenceminister that a one point be be tried to fire it is your talking about a coalition government that widely varies by it is politics and yet there is unity inside the government that the war against commons has to continue instill compass is no longer a functional power inside the got a strip and yet apparently according to axis jobidon and other senior you us officials are becoming increasingly frustrated with t e primaninster nntonow who an his rejection of the ad ministrations most recent request related to the war in gaze the situation sucks we are stuck the president's patients is running outs ad won you us official at every junction n in know who has given biting the fingers senator christian dollar a marlin which by the why is a lie that is totally untrue if sitting ow who had given bit the finger yardyguone up north and hitcusbellap if the would even widen the finger hey would not have stopped the aerial campaign is early as he did and moved into ground operations or withdrawn military reserves from the front lines than none that would happen theywould move faster the would broken more things presumably if they would simply wanted to to do what they wanted to do supposedly by let that is going to bid himself apparently baton has not spoken i to now who since remember twenty third before bison hung up on that call sitting ow who has rejected his request that israel release palstinian tax revenues that it is currently with holding which of course they should not why why would you release tax revenues two terrorist groups which is what the palisinian authority is the attempt to rehabilitate the palcinian authority in the face o palsonand authority literally paying terrors who murders just is totally insane in facts in violation of america law the tailor force act it is id's total but this is jobidon in a nutshell by he way that the the tender treatment of people who are absolutely common supporters and many of them violent common supporters is totally insane inside the united states for example over the weaken protestors were outside the white house and they were literally trying to break down white house fences look ten of insurrection but apparently no one no one is on be seriously arrested or charged with anything you imagine i thought this is laden insurrection and whit such canary six out there break it down there screaming break it down that delightful people is it that that is the white house hover there i then threatening the white house do not work these are just the people that jobidon considers very very passionate it is amazing to me that we are having a conversation about how terrible israel is being against you to the people who support actual genocide of dues who support the who the whose support he suppression of women and the rape of women and the murder of children i justremains a source of unending insanity to me it is it is just it is absolving credible by the way there is an up date on the most it did this stories while you remember that a few weeks ago a me join literally spoke about this there is a case were three arab muscle students for shot and wounded in burlington formant and the media talked about it as the homophobic crime of the century in which jobinactually issued a statement declaring there as absolve noplace for violence or heat in america this going to from page man the three muslin men identified as palistinian two of them were in capes and a cool was implying t t the shutter was con at antipalistinian burned standers did the same thing and in fact burniytenders blasted israel o gate there is only one problem with this particular story apparently the america arab into discrimination committed falsely claim the demand shouted in harassed the victims than proceeded to shoot them if reason to believe the shotincured because of the victim our arab in reality they ben shot by local resident outside his house who did not say a word the three muscle men were returning from o of home from a party on natural night when names j ton a local resident with a history of mental in stability stumbled out of a white rapport house on the residential street and without a word fired foreshows at the three men even had been described as quote that hippyguy and progressive an organic farmer would posed a me with a definition of america with the cay tat called that the worst sense of the united states i e imperialism corruption and the global exportation of america culture not only that he supported a commas on remember sixth a local mezautlet known for breaking stories about local porch revealed even had tower to quote the notion that homages evil for defending their state for occupation is absurd they are odd state pay up responding to an article about a proposed seas fire he wrote what if some one occupied your country when you fight them again this was the story that be made national news because in an effort to equate antisemitism with his homophobia it had to be projected that somehow being pro israel means that igninglis shoot palistinians in the same way that being propalistinian right now means being procomas that separation in does not exist right now because if your supporting a sense fire against comas a terror croup that continues to fire rockets into israel that is continuing to hijack an steel humanitarian at again this is all over tomorrow if comas releases the hostages and surrenders there doing none of those things and yet jobidon still continues to put his thumb on the scale even's local antisemitism gets worse out of turkey a story that in is really solar star he a scored atoll and then he held out his hand and on his hand was written a message of solidarity with the hostages he was promptly arrested by the government of turkey the club ut prom promptly suspended him and now's gan to be shipped back to israel for the great crime of noticing that comas is currently holding hostages you the world situation got worsens from his antisemitism in meanwhile bite is running to o nations not with the terrorist apparently but with ti know amazing amazing stuff same things happening car s the west by the way ow there is a a person who was given a title as one of the one hundred most influential people of twenty twenty one by time magazine his name is hammed el hurry and he is a radical muscle who lives in east jerusalem he and his family have been occupying a an apartment building in seek jar you remember that this was a bit of up a bi of a far up in east jerusalem sheekjara this apartment building was owned by news and then when jordan took that area of jerusalem in nineteen forty eight the news were all expelled all of them from that area the building was not actually conveyed to any geordanian owner and in nineteen sixty seven when israel liberated east jerusalem that apartment was then return to its proper owners because the title had never been changed all the apartment tells the dick that were change by the way were left in the hands of the arabowners no one own this department but people continued to occupy the apartment without paying rent for literally dozens of years and this one alltheway up to these rally supreme courtiers all sorts of legal contention around it and then it was treated as though it was some sort of abuse of human rights violation when people who do not pay trend on a property they do not own were staying there in any case this i was made into a face of resistance to supposed is daily settlement or what ever but who is this guy really woes a guides and at a protest in onion talks about normalizing massacres in the necessity for it oo ore we must normalized massacres is the statism wo we excellent stuff there from this this supposed moderate but do not worry jobidon is running out of patients in the medalist yo again this perspective is notion whin him re election he thinks is can get the progressives on his side wrong he is it is not the america people hate more than pretty much anything else anything else the hate america being pursued his week correctly legajobin's apprivlarating what you will see is hit he was in the fifties until the pilot from afghanistan which twenty drop down into the high thirties lofwardies and he is been there ever since jorbidon displaying more world weakness is not going to be his friend already coming up we are going to get into internecine republican struggles plus apparently the case against donate trump this recon case in georgia is beginning to collapse not be of anything legal but because the prosecutor in that case was ha stopping one the the prosecutors in that case if you are not a member become member housecoat chipiro a check out for two months frankly angel plans clicked hat lion the description and join us

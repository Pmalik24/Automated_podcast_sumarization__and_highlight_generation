new daily wire plus annual memberships now is the tame go to daily wired of come slash subscribe to join right now the story of the current israel commas conflict happens to be extremely simple commas is a genital new hating organization that openly seeks the extermination of israel is makes it only the latest and most radical iteration of a radical muslin movement that has sought israel destruction since long before israel was even born tvambission has not waned in the seventy six years of modern israel existence unfortunately vambission also happens to be the passion belief of a vast majority of museums living in the goes strip and the west bank israel by contrast is a democracy the world's only jewfish state and has repeatedly sought to make land for piece deals with arab countries and organizations those concessions have brought israel no friends in h wetback or gosh trip far from it concessions have generally emboldened israel enemies that is exactly what happened in the goa strip in two thousand five israel pulled out of goa in an attempt to stop the coss in blood and treasure associated with policing the area all jewfish assets in the gosh ship were promptly destroyed by palicinian grabs elections were then held in the goa strip and comas was elected to lead the gozastrp they promptly consolidated their control by killing members of the palicinian authority the then stole as much international aid as they could to build rockets and terror in for structure ignoring the needs of their population entirely and then they launched repeated rock attacks on his rely civilians for eldest two and half years or as compass itself says the organization attempted to deserve israel into believing it had been detoured from large skills terrorist action then on october seventh some color the happy estate in the jewfish calender at least one thousand five hundred commas terrace and many civilian fellow travellers crossed the israel border by breaching the borderwall around goal and killed some twelve hundred is rallies in their beds at a music festival and elsewhere they raped women than murdered them or drag them in captivity back to goa they kidnapped or slaughtered babies here is video from the gozastrip as members of commas survived back in the strip with their captives he cans the this the enormous crowds people cheering and celebrating excited at the slaughter of civilians in the kidnapping of other civilians does this slolecagate does this look a peaceful population a population seeking peace and coexistence look at the excitement look at the celebration people screaming aluaqar as hostages are driven away including the bodies of people being beaten in the streets gaze and wetback are not filled with moderate museums far from it azan wetback are filled with people who despised the state of israel and agree wholeheartedly with compasses genocidal aims this is in nascence the entire problem worthy's areas filled with moderate museums israel might find a piece partner that piece partner does not exist as a new pole from the arab world for research and development shows seventy five per cent of those pulled in the gosestrip an wetback supported the october seventh massacre seventy six per cent support compass ninety eight per cent have a negative view of america seventy eight per cent believe in the total extermination of israel altogether as the old saw goes if the palicinians were t put down their arms tomorrow they would have a state if israel her t put down it is arms tomorrow all the news would be dead if the conflict is that clear cut why does it seem complex the answer is a strategy undertaken by the radical muslin world it is far left allies some far right allies and the international media the strategy is called baffling with bulla here is how works first you construct institutions that our you perspective as to create in echochamber for example you take over or create judo human rights organizations dedicated to promoting the anti israel point of view then you trot them out routinely in order to claim that despite all evidence israel is the real threat to human rights how can you tell which human rights organizations are biased and illegitimate is not that hard if you are human rights organization presumably you should have had some pretty strong condemnation of commands assault on news the worst assault since the polices or compasses handling of the god's trip which is terroristic and fascistic here is a partials of those we have been extraordinarily weak in their condemnations of compass or who have engaged in full scaled moral equivalents with israel defensive actions in fossa yunicefchief gathering mussels armistices are national a who chief tears cabriessis the international committee of the red cross you an commissioner on human rights vulgar turn you an relief works agency save the children doctors without borders you in special reporter franshesca abbacies human rights watch ox found the open society foundations the list of such organizations goes on and on and on and of course this sort of attitude is extraordinarily common in the legacy medias we have been detailing for weeks on is program now once you have your mouthpieces the true magic begins you begin the baffling here is how you do it you obscure the main story entirely instead you focus in on the details as to avoid discussing the main story altogether you try to discredit a single detail from israel and then you use it to suggest that everything emerging from israel is false despite the fact that israel has a robes free press and retinal admits to mistakes and despite the even more obvious fact that israel enemies routinely lie that is lying in fact is high keep part of their strategy take for example mas an buses men cassava consistently propaganda to stick opponent of israel all the way back to his days at all genera here he was last week suggesting that because the israel governments public relationsteam may have is bald a calender in their expose on compasses terror tunnels beneath shiva hospital this means that israel is a totally unreliable source on everything there he is i agree with e vision blindly believe anything hoses but why should not we been what mum government was inter your military spoon month pointed to an arab document and the basement of a galallan claimed it with a saurian li on which eve retarroris rights his name but that was whole shut it the kalends when the dangs of the week on your calling in the priministe of i else gendallman pop tan behind the tin for from a bani short milkman claimed it with potethingin angola shaking their own injury about went i skit a wee clerk that a endless fishenformation from your government is it'll endless to information and misinformation according to madyhason endless the goal there of course is to create equivalents between israel sources of information and damages and tomenamas what alshefa was remember the thing he is talking about there is a calender found in a terror tunnel below alshefa hospital and this has been a bugaboo for the media for long tine they have been claiming that alshefa is not a military sit that it is in fact a civilian sight and israel has no actual military interest in alshefa other than human rights violation why they believe that because they just listened whatever commas and then repeated and then when israel claims differently they legion know we get la hers the thing of course alsheva was a military sight it was used as such here is survelan's footage from the day of the attacks these you'll see are hostages being ushered into the hospital by the terrorist into this amazing hospital that is a pure medical sight a civilian sight these are hostages or being ushered into this hospital one these hostages by the way was in his daily soldier a femalisraily soldier whose slightly wounded they found her body the other day should been murdered by mamas here you can see the medical personnel helping to usher these people in these people were in scrubs ushering in members of mamas with hostages by the way they drove past a bunch of hospitals to get to alshefa this is was a bunch of medical personnel where deeply concerned about helping the medical situation the hostages who by the way would been much better off they ben left in israel which is why when yoga sinowar the head of amass had brain cancer israel treated him and then released him in any case you can see these are members of the medical personnel at alshefa who are helping amass and then were lying to the media about it pretending that it was a pure medical sight they were all complicit the international red cross knows about this human rites watch knows about this they all my they all know that comas is operating from alshefa they worked with them and then they told the media lies about it another the media ran with that story there are witnesses from alshefa who names cannot be reveal because thy will be killed talking about how the base was used as a base by hams is in tundra anabas manshefa hospital would be a slaughter of global proportions but they do not do such things oases madam fighters enter among us civilians the news cannot get to them and nobody can tell on them when i went to she found madam fighters all around this camps next to us in front of us behind us over and under us is not that forbidden in slam is not that oppression of civilians every palistinian knows she a hospital is full of them but nobody can taw death by the news is better than death by iris the night i spent the china i thought would be the last night of my life judging from the terrible carnage that happened and the shelling around us i thought it was our day of judgment only were being judge on account of people who had never protected us they only protected their families and children whom they brought to save the outside of goo or underneath us gods were while everything always fell on us let me tell you for certain our people will bear poverty hunger and thirst as long as comas gets out of here from the day they arrived given turn catastrophe was what people and gaze some of them at least actually think about comas but the will never say it and the truth is that when a comes down to it this is a minority viewpoint this a minority viewpoint but the big story obviously for made hassle is what there israel is a geminating endless misinformation about a calender on the wall of a terror tunnel and whether are kept track of terrace hostage gamblers or not that is many lesson playing the baffling with botgame it is the usual sospectsitsien end too sand hen reported over the weaken that the if in showing the media the weapon refound at all chief quote might have rearranged weapon my prior to exposing that weapon real to the media the implication from liana and is that israel was falsifying something which is absurd any time the d e a makes abs and then shows the drugs on the table they have rearranged the drugs were israel to leave all weapon mean place that would be dangerous given that booby traps of already killed or wounded a high number of israel soldiers we seen the sort of game wandered into false accusations by pool comas forces that real photos o burned babies are in fact a i generated images the insistence by process propagandist that if babies were mostly burned alive rather than beheaded this somehow means israel is dishonest and commons is its moral equivalent and now most amazingly people are claiming the comas did not even conduct the massacre at all that is a contention making its way around the internet and the orbit world thanks to a report from hearts a far left disgrace of an israel publication that story from habit states that according to is rely officials commas terrorist initially did not know about the music festival they ended up devastating that instead they quote found out about the nova festival through drones or from those flying in parachutes and directed terrorist to the location using their cams system the report also included a single source police ligation that an idea haricot or targeting terrorist at the my quote apparently harmed a few partygoers who are in the area the police have by the way denied the report san quote the police in investigation does not refer to the activity of idea forces and therefore no indication was given of harm to civilians was a result of aerial activity at the sight none the less that ho arts report has now metastasize into the pro comas lie that israel slaughtered its own citizens on mass the most viral twitter account on twitter tweeted yesterday quote will you condemn israel now given they have admitted to hearts that is rely helicopters murdered is rally civilians on october seventh yesterday the pain an authority this is the supposedly moderate piece partner the bi administration is cushion announce that israel hallacopters had killed all three hundred sixty four people at the music festival siting theropod an hares no surprise there the leader of the palsinian authority again a supposed moderate mahutabas is a full scale polices denim the baffling with to is not relegated to focussing on details an then blowing them up into entire false narratives it also extends even credent to total liars that is precisely why the legacy media claims that israel had boy the hospital early in the conflict when was palistinian is comic shot why the legasymedia have claimed each and every day the electricity was out at alshefok when clearly by contemporaneous footage it was not that israel is targeting civilians when it is not in fact is journalist dived collierpoints out the media routinely use accounts from open terror supporters for their comic covert doctor called abusamra who claim that israel was shooting at those waving white flags posted that duo history is being made on october seven hammed abusalmea had of sheila hospital who routinely praises terra on his social media is also routinely quoted by the press menu labors director general of the aliening helthministry who claimed dogs were eating bodies of civilians thatgay is literally part of the camps government and there is one other elements to baffling with both pretending head just tone now enough to make a judgment between israel and its enemies who knows what is true and what is not it is all just too complicated to say this laws journalist ware supposed to be focus on truth to give equal credence to propagandist and truthtellers both sides they cry as they hostpeople who openly call for the destruction of the state of israel and valoraskmas it does not take much to turn a clear narrative into a muddy on just sum wife some later focus on a relevant detail and echochamber some shoulder shrugging ignorance when question and a lot of radical and fell travellers to promote all of

sorvenzwhala your changing policies obviously love it love it and by the way it is can be trusted by administration as to what they do with this guys because if they do not immediately bring me lay and argentine ins tenfold is proof positive misadministration does not get the damn about pro america sentiments in satin in south america this my is begging for argentina to make great friends with he united states if biding some how rejects that on behalf ne international leftism it demonstrates full scale the impact of a foreign policy rooted in left is nonsense meanwhile hears me lay on polarization that of course be the transfer away from the absolutely worthless argentina past and toward the america dollar owe judo we i think there is a previous discussion about polarization actually strictly speaking it is to get rid of the central bank the polarization is an instrumental issue at the end of the day therefore argumentative actonsly one has to do with a moral issue which is that stealing is wrong and generic is nothing more or less than a swindle by politicians against good people therefore lets say if we consider that stealing is wrong one of the greatest thieves in the history of mankind is the central bank the second point has to do with a technical mission because in the argentine case it is more evidence when a product has no demand its price is zero if the local currency has no demand and this price should be zero the equilibrium real balances our zero whatever amount of money e central vanquishes to impose the counter part is that the ice level is infinite s the man then that price should be zero equilibrium real balances a zero whatever amount of money is central bangwhat wants to impose the lipide is that the price level has in finite this is correct what he is saying is who cannot just pump money into the economy and then pretend that the money is worth anything it is not he is staunchly antiabortion he favors looser outlaws he is criticized pope francs in he most colorful of terms makes moke a piker in that particular department he used to carry around a chain saw and he symbol of his plan is the super its suggest the best is just the best and again here here is made my favorite melanite their bunch an their just spectacular and a if you never seen a picture of meal he looks dorky wolverine it is is amazing he is got bike the big hair and he is got mutton shows and he is famously suggested that he is not cut his hair since high school he is that he is a very can grumpy character in in his own personal life he is is to talk pretty openly about being a tantric sex good an all the rest of thiscannis of it its hysterical stuff this is the the video that probably of him has gone the most viral and for those who cannot see he is standing next to a white board with taped up on the white board are the names of various ministries in argentina and he just going thought in ripping them down and saying that he is going to throw them out here we go be we o wat his ministry of port into his an out whit minister of culturwhat ministry of environment and sustainable vow out ministry of women gender's indiversityout whaministry of public words he is this it in i fou is i us lusted the word ministry of science t acknowledge an innovation ministry of laver employment and social security minister o vegetation in indoctrination out ministry o transport out he minister of heart out whaministry of social development o out in the theory of politics is over long live can liberty ah each he is great now the reality is that he can do the people in america concerns why cannot we do this here and the answer is cause we do not have a hundred and forty throe percent inflation the reason that he is able to say the truth about government spending is because it has reached such an exorbitant and insane proportion that they have bankrupted the country no less than three times they have defaulted on their debts repeatedly which means it is i possible to raise new debt when he keep defaulting on your debt nobody wants to lend you money in the future right now the the question is hathergan to pay back the am a the am has i a forty three billion dollar lone outtargentina right now in ore for argentina to get back on some sort of decent track they arcana have to take some new debt the guarantee of that that is going to be relay's ability and willingness to out future government spending and this means dumping the garbage philosophy of paganism now the reason that paganism his important for people to understand is because paganism is almost identical what the kind of economic policy tat has been pursued by the left wing in the united states parish is not communism paganism is not quite socialism it is really more economic corporatism it is the sort of thinner sing china pursue right now or that yous saw for example nutty germany per so it is state led enterprise to the basic ideas sure there all be private business but we will give them subsidies we will tell him how to do their business we will we will protect a few corps businesses and business sectors and we will fund them all of our friends well get super duper rich and if this sounds a lot the democratic party policy on economics and part the re publican party policy on economic frankly that is because it is it turns out that whether you are right or whether you are left subsidies to political friends in or to protect particular industries not for national security industries but its industries the you think are special to protect certain segments of the population it turns out their bankrupt the country if you go back to the origins is the original parodist philosophy of yuan person who was the left leaning argentina who ran argentina until his wife took over in then they wrote a musical about her with modonon all the vestment parents philosophy is dominated argentina for literally decades and if you go back in push work at the principles of paganism they sound very much the modern democratic party quote a trudemocracy is that in which the government does what the people wants and defends only one interest the peoples paganism is essentially of the common people any political elite is anti people end thus not baroness rites the populous letting movement a parodist works for the movement whoever in the name of peteronism serves in a let or leader is a parodist in name only for paganism there is only one class of person those who work working is a right that creates the dignity of men it is a duty because it is fair that everyone should produce as much as they costume at the very least and then paganism tons about how essentially you need to balance the right of theindividual and society as an economic doctrine a social market putting capital to the service of the economy in the well being of the people anybody who feared by the way right or left talk about the idea that capitalism is really a tool there the ta the for the markets ought to work for the people not the other way around that philosophy is in essence a parodist philosophy is not the job of quick markets to work that markets are not in instrument of the government markets a description of relations between human beings markets our description of how people traded with one another and under what conditions suggesting that the markets sou were for the people is a rusonian way of describing a vague general will and then directing government power at achieving that supposed general will and what an ends up with is massive amounts of that in in reality it amounts to tremendous economic in efficiency redistribution of resources tremendous economic controls on industry and as always huge at back an october writers reported on the be problems for argentina they point it out that the six hundred billion dollar economy has been engulf by deep crisis that involves runaway inflation a dirty of roseola reserves and an electric with little trust in its currency the country could be in danger of defaulting on that forty three billion dollar program with the international monetary for that should be argentina resulting on its that not for the third time in the last coplodeca s but for the tenth time over all the government keeps on spending and spending and spending they keep on just blowing out the debt the the ballooning debt pile is enormous you right now the total outstanding government debt as he twenty twenty three is about four hundred billion dollars and is rising rapidly meal is gin to have his work cut out for him since nineteen eighty the ben spending drunken sailors they have been monetizing that debt by simply issuing more pesos and then the have been defaulting on that debt and now meal is gin to combat have to come in with that chant he is really not can have a choice but to do that and watch as the left kicks screams in the united states also because they so its coming they so its coming the reality is that once you hit the situation that archintina has now hit you rent of a choice but to go for the channel best of luck to hover meal and again the west ought to be embracing this my it is it is an incredible judgement on the media an o on the west than many of them are more comfortable with glad silva in brazil than they are with with hogan medley an open ally of the united states who is desperately being h better relationship wit reunited states the fact the media find it easier to sympathized with hula tells y everything you need know about the media and our modern left wing political leadership mean is precisely the kind of leader the roads rigged was begging for during his presidency a democratically elected classical liberal who is seeking economic openness in freedom and to pay back the country's debts and he met a i do notion is casing's henna crazy she's him's too root to what your hearing him describe as ananarical capitalist is a far right character om i notice that archinsena has one hundred and forty three per cent in elation because of the program you guys now is time to try something different good on archensinians for realizing

most is now at war with a huge swath of the life that includes of course the anted afimationtly that is been true for a long time but now with media matters media matters for thosewho do not know was a group that was founded by killer canton's close adviser avid broch it was specifically designed at the time to be an anti right wing messaging machine designed to grab any sort of righting outlet of advertisers and profits that is what it was designed to do it been very effective in that goal and and they've been going out for plan mosque hammer and tonguing then particularly rationing things up over the course of the last few sons because plan is active on twittering as we talked about a little bit last week plan em broiled himself in controversy because again he is very active onswitter and he for retreated and restated another tweed from somebody then many people then accuse t being antistatic and the he obviously clarified to listen am talk bat the eight yell ism tongue about left wing news who have been very big on open borders and then suddenly are very big on not open boarders the minute that it turns out a lot of people got imported ha news and leaves who is not talking bout the untired hers community or all news are anything remotely that that is not who melon is man know upon just a little bit but the implication that plan most is antistatic the implication down trump is antistatic i find it very weird that many of the people who are jumping on that bad wagon people media matters are very safe on actual commons fans if you are fan of comes if you are if you are a person who is from the never to the sea received to keep place media matters will defend you it if you are a person who actively promote terrorist entities who actively sides with those terrors veranda say sore or something then media matters your your the bast and you are rate but your plan most and all son the what the at says to me is ulterior motive the hadialon us bis melon ms just does not mirror the wok priorities of the left what we saw last week was yet another attempt to unperson melon us which is not going to work because he is incredibly rich news incredibly famous and he is incredibly valuable to a a wide variety of human beings ranging from vestal owners to the federal government with regard to spacact and now they been tempting to under caught him with advertisers on twitter now known as acts and melon is now pushing back on all of that he is pushing back o all that in a few different ways first of all again there the implication that la musket an antisemite is to me quite absurd based on the reck a based on the record that is currently available an he he literally tweeted out just three days ago quote as i said earlier the week d colonization from the river to the sea and similar euphemisms necessarily imply genniside clear calls for extreme violence are against our terms of service and will result in suspension that seems a lot more pro jewfish then a huge majority of the people on the left share ripping on on plan musk will now he has said that he is going to go nuclear on media matters according to portico musk set on sturdy he will filly thermonuclear lawsuit against non proper watch struck media matters another as companies including dishy apple and bum reportedly have pause to advertisran an x main anti feminism storm around the social media platform again dinner apple i am they ill continue to advertises on mas and be see which does cover sarcomas on a daily basis presumably media matters a uascroup the describes itself as a progressive research and information center published earlier this week research showing that x had posted ads appearing next tutenieo lazy posts sexy yolinda accent previously said banister nowt protected from the risk of being next so potentially toxic content on the platform not musk said the split second court opens on money x cop will be filling a thermos nuclear lost against mean media matters and all those who colluded in this range once attack on our company he posted a statement the headline stand with acts to protect free speech and here is what he said quote this week media matters for america posted history that completely miser presented the real user experienconacts in another attempt to under mine freedom of speech and mislead advertisers above everything including profit ex works to protect the public's right to free speech but for speech to be truly free we must also have the freedom to see or here things that some people may consider objectionable we believe that everyone has the right to make up their own mines about what to read watch or listen to because that is the power o freedom of speech despite our clear and consistent position e as seen a number of starts from activist groups media matters and legs media outlets who seem to undermine freedom of expression on our platform because they receive it as a threat to their idea logical narrative and those of their financial supporters this of course is one hundred presenter his wish cars wisher spending every waking moment of her life going after plan must going after of mark zuckerburg before any social media platform that does not burro of the priorities of cars wiser becomes a bad social media hour that must be hit with t advertiser boycott cure the facts on media matters research is what plan says to manipulate the publican advertisers media matters great and a turnip count and curated posts and advertising appearing on the accounts time line to missing form advertises about the placement of their posts these contrived experiences could be ply to any platforms another words media matters credit a false account then they proceeded to alga rhythmically figure out which tweets would be the most likely to appears in their twitter feed if they kept the accessing pro nosy tweets and then when adds deserts then they then screen cap that once they curated their feed he says they repeatedly refresh their time lines to find a rare instance of adds serving next to the content they chose to follow our logs indicate they force he scenario resulting in thirteen times the number of ad serves compares the median ad served to an accuser of the five point five billion ad i pressing on access less than fifty total alum pressing were served against t all of the organic content featured in the media matters article which is an insane rate of success if your hoping to pro habit advertising content from appearing next to really discussing post for one brand show case in the article one of theta adds ran adjacent to a post two times that add was seen in that setting by only two users one of which was the author of the mediumatters article for another bran show case in the article two of the ads served adjacent to two posts three times that add was only seen in that setting by one user the author of the media matters article and other words they totally created an accounts just to manufacture a story that this is a thing that is happening all over twitter when in fact its happening because medium matters basically gamed the system to achieve an end where they can then say to advertisers that if your fondu your risk of appearing next to a no nosy post medium matter's article pilots nine post they believe would not be old on at upon a valuation only one of the nine organic post feature in the article violated our content policies we take an action on it under our freedom of speech not reach enforcement or posh here is the summery ax will protect the public strikes for expression will not allow agenda driven actives or even our own profits to detour our vision every one has a choice on as user and bran control an as is superior to a year ago and data winds over allegations medium matters is not reflect the user experience on as he is now filing this lawsuit against media matters presumably for what he is going to accusamof is is som from form of fraud me legal form of fraud in attempt to artificially interfere of business contract e tortious interference with with contract would probably be the basis the lawsuit here in this parton parcel a broader attempt to d platform musk from his own platform this why they were angry when twitter got taken away from jack dorky when musk bought twitter at the expensive twenty billion dollars that is just down the toilet mean that the twitter is now worth may behalf of what it was when musk bought it at the men going price there now tempting to essentially destroy musk over all of this by claiming falsely that he is in antisemite and again yo you have to consider the source you have to consider the source when you see people on amassed b c who are hot and bothered over melon masks supposed antisemitism and the very next segment there having on some wold anti israel prognosticator accusing israel of genocide and war crimes and making excuses for commons you have to wonder what is the real tender there it does not feel the real age has anything to do with due hatred perse cane just one second we will get to the actual latest news in t israel the whooshes are camping up there attacks from yamen because get a on is being all sorts of trouble in the region first what thanks giving just a few days way i wan the show some gratitude for some of the people on my team just who

biggest hemline of the day that israel was about to strikes some for of cease fire deal with commons in the gosistrip than they to walk that back es was denied by both israel and the united states it turned out not to be true this giant pass now the bide administration is trying to push the idea that there getting closer to a deal but the relishon't be talking about anything if it deal about to happen wags out they we talk about any of that publicly john finer who is the deputy national security adviser he was saying a national to i the getting closer to a deal what is that even look wise he talking about that lake this is not how negotiations typically work what is the state of negotiations as of this morning is the do imminent a thanks jam i think you heard a probably the priminister bruter speak to this earlier to day a they have been extremely close a obviously at to these negotiations have wee as we have a united states has been a following this minute by minute our by our up to a the level of the president for whom this is a a major a over riding priory a obviously impart because there are number of america to in this terrific situation what i can say about this at this times we think of that we are closer than we have been a perhaps in any point a since these negotiations began weeks ago a that there ere is of difference ain disagreement that have been narrowed a if not a closed out entirely a ism is dung mat that publicly nobody really really knows meanwhile these really ambassadors to the united states mantel hero zip were not images fire why would wo do a sense fire when we are literally attempting to tract down our hostages in real time and again tape was released yesterday of the hostages being dragged into all shift hospital the tape is t absolve signing we showed at earlier on the show when the fact that there still people in the international media who believed that israel has some sort of responsibility to commons under thy circumstances is insane absurd in disgusting primesternetna who set point combat is exactly what mamas wants they can si want to e into thin ay pop to o says in or e to get us is o is and sis i fie til is o si ti sis i we get sis fir because that would the all hams to e thin you troop toe you an trike again but it would be a sis fire for a few days this is there is that that differiously about the posing tefillin to to was to we can get the hostage us but all ti tot i sis fa because we thin to push ages mas to dislatto the main most to and the therein to taco were not on to that meanwhile uranium a back who these in madman have now seized a ship in the red sea this stuff is really dangerous beausewhen you start in angering the the worlds choke points in terms of trade that is a major problem tit led to the to us cannot crime of nineteen fifty six for example the trait of hormones or another example of the place where oil ships out and if the agrarians were o make serious trouble over there that be a real probe for the world economy folks who our isolationist on foreign policy seem to forget that there there is in fact a globe and on that globe there are certain choke points in terms of trade and when those choke points ghat owned by various powers their prices at the grocery store go up their jobs may go away in elation its we have a very inter connected world economy and the simple fact is that it does make a very large difference to you exactly who owns those choke points in how this checkpoints get run yesterday a cargoship ut partially owned by an is really business person was highjack by remain those rebels in the red sea on sundae the cargoship the mohomats flags galaxy leader was leases from a brush company partially owned by an is really name de romp under to a japan's at company the ship left a port in turkey was headed for india who selling under the mohamanian flag the apparently twenty five remembers of different nationalities including cretins vulgarian philopinos and pelicans there are no is rallies on board no true members were fingered but it did receive minor damage the prime minister's office condemned the seizure highlating reship was not is daily or owned by is rallies the hobbies have been attempting obviously to attack the water is surrounding surrounding the person gulf they've been attempting to create naval problems in these areas that is iron that is obviously iron now all of this is contributing to a larger sense of democratic panic why will because the media are pushing this idea the unless jo began swivels and becomes wildly anti israel that he is going to lose the next election i love to see the data that support the idea that if he swivels on behalf of commas that suddenly his going to win the election robin's on popular because jobidon is deeply in popular banned pulling out yesterday shows that jobidons approval writing is down to forty per cent strong majorities of all voters disapprove of his handling of foreign policy now it does say that they also disapprove his handling of the israel comas war but what is weird about that particular question is that that means up bunch of people who are on the writ mean peoplwho love israel very often a lot of those people disapprove of his handling of the israel comes war but but they do from the right son on the words to suggest that everybody is mad at bison because he is to pro israel is to ignore the reality which is that by the same pole of all entities in the pole ranging from israel to compass to tonal tromp to jobidon s the republicans in congress the singlemost popular entity in the pole was actually the state of israel be very weird for for example jobidon two sort of a bandit israel in the face of all of that again by this same pole that showing jobidon on popular it shows that israel has a plus twenty three writing crane still has a plus twenty one writing and then he gets to the politicians nice halers at minis four mi johnsons at in is nine town triumphant mind is sixteen jobidnsant mines seventeen palestine is a mine is fighting russia is at mine is seventy four and compass as at minis eighty if the implication there is that jobidin is supposed to swivel on behalf of compass ism not sure exactly how you make vacates predictalisisi something i neat silver the see poster has pointed out none the less jobidon is seeking to start mill take be tween two positions this for example is why president bid his now said that he is going to issue via bands on quitting that is really extremest attacking palistinians in the west bank unclear exactly who he is talking about obviously no criminal should enter the united states if somebody is committing a criminal act u or not u they should not be entering the united states period end of story by the idea that there is this vast criminal under class in the west bank that is pursuing extraordinary acts of violence is not actually told out by the data there are some people who r doing that and they should be arrested then the notion this is anywhere on par with a a massive problem the hundreds of that ten thousand eight thousand eh hundred people or testing the democrats from israel to the united states after conducting criminal activities against areas in less bank win those numbers do not exist it is a very weird taken is mostly directed toward public consumption at this point meanwhile you can tell it that the the democrats are deeply fearful biding he celebrating his eighty first birthday he clearly is not with it any more you can tell this because essence is finally turning on jobidon which is shocking when when essence turns on jobidon he is got a real problem because essential they have been mistaking bison the e missoshing the democrats literally for theta basely since two thousand ate since brakobom became president they have made it their permanent futile job to missoch democrats now they are finally starting to knock bison that is it that is bad news for him obviously say arbor due started u to keep things on the rails on ta reed from the teleprompter a o great meaning with a president roman numeral eleven ears me pirate she ash meaning was a total wind sure at agreements about communication fitinall climate change but mosh importantly we got the thing america really geese right now wo pandas i to open up to

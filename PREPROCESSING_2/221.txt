remember years ago guy ran the military secretary defense down brumsfelled said infamously there's the things we know the things we do not know and therefor the thingstat we do not even know we do not know the last minor spooky category he called the unknown unknowns and a get may be talking about known unknowns and unknown unknowns might have ben appropriate for the thing he was talking about which was a rock and weapons of mas destruction but who knew that some day was on to be a good way to describe the cars swirling this year around to which should be the most pedestrian predictable things the government does counting lots an election and starting the school year o goglet us save election for another day can we talk write ow about the demolition sure monte car pilot of known unknowns and unknown unknown it is the opening of the school year mat teachers an ta big high school in the suburbs of south caroling and all summer he is been doing what parents and teachers everywhere h been doing this year wondering if there can to be unperson instructions fall watching stake local officials we at information that seem incomplete and contradictory and confusing and it was sort of hot potato of responsibility to is everybody's con up passing lie when you hear from your district when you hear from the states roomed when we hear from our govern other els saying somebody else wan to set the course and then your know yet it felt very the elective my i get when they got to the first day the teachers reported back to school no kids are yet just teachers that is as things still seemed very unclear thinking surely when we get in the building working to get the answers the the answer is in the building where my bosses are te'rgano know and over the course of the week sort of having the vail lifted and realize a my bosses do not know anything more than i do about the stare of school my principal and i know the exact same about of information at that point teachers had received to memo with a tent if plan but the abuses was very much on tentative his principal noted quote things change daily the plan was got the a b plan and was the hybrid plan that lasts of schools are doing students will be divided into two groups a b half come to school for two days while the other half what stay home and going on line using some then this switch but if gongs y a high school spending through the maelstrom of known unknowns and unknown unknowns o get here is what happened that first day the teachers came back the first meeting that i got to is at ten and it is a department meeting we how just fifteen people spread out and you all are sitting there socially distance from each other weeing masks yet there is a good atmosphere in the room were all things consider were were happy to be there and tapping to each other a very glass halffull whatever may come sort of vibe in in the room and our department had who a teacher has written up these two plans on the board the right a be a sort of hybrid plan and tin an all virtual start virtuous tor o no students in the building you teaching everybody on line got it yet we get a little into this meeting and there we have an administrator one of our our assistant principles is in the room a d he is been mostly quiet but when we get to a conversation about how we get back in to teaching he sort of pipe sad and he says hang on is the egg a it a plan is out apparently they had received word from the district that our school needed e chance of that plan are i everybody first change gumball come in at eleven and change of plans less plan on all virtual summer is ten o'clock its they be eleven o'clock it is all virtual or anyway that's how mat took it sister parpencho told us he had know idea what would happen the an tin meeting ins then around two in the afternoon word sort of spreads that there is this there is this boy drop of an announcement and that administrator who had been in our meeting caught my colleague in the hall and he was kind of fluster he said plans are changing again we just got word from the district is just wait for the staff meeting let us see wat happens i staff meeting is the big welcome to the new school year staff meeting for the whole faculty in strake to three o'clock bout two hundred and fifty teachers are on the resume call where all in our own rooms you are on the building but your in your own rooms yeses t isn't nothing happens at this meeting the whole meeting is trivial information they introduce new faculty members they share positive news from teachers summers new babies or engagements they talk about our essay tea schools sand last year all things that we hear annually when the fondly you talk about the restart plan he says is a lot of we can do it positivity but no concrete details bout wether toy be going on virtual or what the plans con to be them meeting and and we are all sort of sitting there thinking what what was it and my colleague and i are determined to figure the out it is for now we are we are onto go down to the administrators offices and just see what we and see and we we go to one of the administrators offices and there are two other assistant principles and there it's pretty s pretty named and it is sort of the situation room and an y white house action dramaouno there is papers all over the table and everybody's on the computer and even for as few people are in the room there is sort of talking past each other in their multiple conversations going on and my friend and i con i got thrive of where does been a stand at the door are not oven on to come and wait into the water but what we find out is that in the afternoon the district apparently came back to the schools and was o k new plan you need students in the building on the first day of school five days a week at twenty five per cent capacity that is all we are giving you figure it out and well why at table are all theses rosters of students and and scheduling and there is some logistical nightmare the logistic to night marriage to south caroling a mandates that every parent should have the option to send the good to school for person instruction if they want we will keep them at home for virtual learning if that is what they want which is the kind of trying to please everybody solution that in practice it is just enormously difficult to execute it means that there have to be some students in school five days a week but of course it's only much space in the school for students with proper sees o distance sing how do you figure out who gets to attend and who does not get to attend and what happens when you cannot give every family what it wants meanwhile in the class rooms he south caroling heads words first day of classes september eighth de yous have to figure out how to do something that they did not do last spring when schools went on quarantine that i we get how do you teach a class ire's partly at home partly in the room with you which is a particularly it is particularly funny to thing for chair it is a very difficult subject to teach virtually a man he is a quire teacher trying to sing in azure with other people is it's just a nightmare because you cannot evens if you say what is clap at the same time they will tat you will here a bunch of different class because every beats course i is a little delay and that to lay makes i impossible to sing together yet not to mention that usually the soft were built to to identify ho is speaking and amplify their voice and silence other people the only it to sing together is with everybody on you and you know what con a rehearsal s that and the one forth of the class is can be in the room with them they causing together in the room because singing in a chorus can be a superspreador event for the virus remember that acquire in your seat at the beginning of the pandemic where fifty two people got sic even with mass its not save which means singing together is the one thing you cannot do in chorus mat's glasses are ninety minutes long and write now figures the teach the kids consume in the kids classroom together for half an hour at the beginning of it lecture style we about singing simony to do at home and then at the thirty minute mark or something i would probably dismiss those fume students say o you got your silents it'll see son take the students that are in the room somewhere outside where we can be spaced out and actually practice singing with that whether permitting yet whether et we just work an have to just ma giver the whole mass her basic lay you know you re engineering every part of your job every single soft exactly the teachers is aid this to me too the virtual teachings making them rethink and re engineer the most was i things they do in their jobs to get through to kids the second great teaching ciao told me that she was still struggling to figure out how she was on to hold the attention of a bunch of seven year old over video for the man dated three hours a day a live real time instruction us in one enough developmental we that is even possible for them the focus on the scream for that long not to mention what activities with so going to give these little kids to do on the come on supervises by her for the hours they would not be on video with her she spend weeks before school started every day on our own time on paid to for you the o pen a few days since i have pot to that conversation with mad and since then he sischoal surveyed the teachers and realized that many of them wanted t stay home and teach from home the was no way they could actually have twenty five per cent of the students come back for in person instruction right now it seems the going on t had enough instructors for fewer than ten per cent of the students but administrators is still figuring it out of course who knows how everything going unfold in september when kids actually arrive when my a t get coven will things be fine man knows some teachers and states were school is already started what it feels right now is going cliff jumping with your friends and our friends and excess georgia and albata and were one too three e were all thing and for weeks as their jumping off cause they want a we want to see what happens too to the other district ism starting to see i have friends and louis another teaching entirely virtually our friends and georgia and albata the are posting their integrand stories of prexy glass in front of their desk and your we go w you tow wear situation were you actually do not know what is going a happen in your kind of worried but you have to deal with parents and students and with them do you let them know your apprehensions or do you just keep a a big smile face and it is on to be great you just do fly your line ye it sort of feels it feels a little contorted am bi have teachers that are posting first day of school pictures as always and they sound bright and cheery and it is cannot wait to see my students tonight the challenges really excited to show them a great new year but underneath the surface these teachers are my friends and i know these teachers are terrified and it feels it feels twisted this here because we really do don't know what our safety looks lie and what r studied safety looks but you still have to be the boss forget of the class and we like what is up ya excited r here let us go am i am going to put my best but for because i cannot wait to teach kids and i love doing that but ism scared cop us about what the year looks of envy be easy chico it is is america life to day in a programmed teachers students parents launch themselves into a school year that is beginning none that any of us have ever experienced since the spring everybody has been anticipating the school opening this an of this asteroid that we have all been watching ad towards earth floating towards us humbling towards us in space in school motion and now it is finally hitting and we are finding out if it is just as bad as we thought it was going to be away better than we hope we have stories from around the country of a going badly and ism going to tell you in some places going surprisingly well we renew anyway stay with us a on mass crusaders i prefers school started in you to this moth our producer me me cut up with two high school teachers clerk is thirty three bales twenty six the married and we greed not use he last name s they joke that their pillatoc is reviewing each others lessons for the next day clerk teach starting photography this hears his six year as a teacher bail's a newly about have run class room for the very first time teaching sophomore english the to r em teach a different public high schools in you tall county south sot city and they found themselves thrown into this really redid and ugly fight in the county right before schools open back of here is my clerk and badly or silly's fresh faced enthusiastic teachers but they spent the summer stressing about their schools reopening because cobia cases had started surging in out both of them would have classes with is many as forty students in them the classrooms are too small to space took six see apart and the windows they do not open governor marry sherbert issued a mask mandate for all kathror twelve schools which made them feel a little batter unwell a county commissioner a guiding billy he started lobbing against it he thought it should be up to parents whether their kids were a mask he called it a quit compassionate exemption to try to drum up support he invited parents to the commissions next meeting suddenly you were either promise or anti mask clerk and badly decided to go in support of masks but i going into it i was as any one really in it be there hits they ma go to confess masks i just that other can be ten people there in no id yet there were actually around a hundred people there the meeting was held at the county building in provoke and when clerk and badly got there they sawmostly monscattered outside some with kids hardly any one was wearing a mask but one family who was wearing mask stop badly there you should go in because lures no one really i saparenoug masks and i was o can going a a i just can grad in the built it was pat there were stairs set up with tape across them for social distance but that did not work well people were just peeling off the have and sitting down and people were just rid out the you sail as energy that was really intense at just wearing bask in that face but it is hard at out to that an yet the room was hot and crowded and a bunch of people without masks for fanning their faces e were goon to go all right that is a county commissioner i mean tanker age he was not happy about this peeled hello every one this is going to be this is going to be brief i think om the is is the exact opposite of what we to be doing we are supposed to be basically just inset serin masks all of all o or mot o exports or the parted of delivery one is encouraging us to do that this room is not complying with resolve glad lines is trees o health discern for this meeting in a little over a minute the whole meeting was over o a the meaning is a jerk have stands up and walks out of the building people in the crowd call mac her and then age later to hated this is not a parks and rack episode it is you talk county government to him this whole thing was just a political stop the county commission has no jurisdiction over school districts they do not make decision for them et be the sheriffs department holding a meeting to the one school loge it did not make my sense but billy the guy who wanted the governor to give the county a compassionate exemption from wearing masks and another commissioner they agree to stay behind to listen to any parent who wanted to make a comment again here's baby at that paint when i realize that people are get even making comments ti can affected by way and to the rim because i oughtn't to make the cost she got in lying for the podium there around twelve people ahead of her even more behind her costly moms one of them had a baby carrier rafter her task i watch this meeting on a casebook live street most of the speakers accepted that bovid is real they did not think it a hoax they supported handfasting staying at home in her see but did not trust the we e see and in general all the precautions seems over own some sounded libertarians there were tons of conspiracy theories like that mam with the baby she said the thing i heard a lot of parents their say that seal too and germs can get trap in yer mask and make you sick which is totally false you want akin the re go stein or and er a hours she saying do you really think it is good to breathing her own germs for hours this smith is taken off in parent worth all over the country the america academy of pity actress the don't put out a statement to try and dispelled and another conspiracy theory at this meeting port that mask mandates will lead to more kids getting abducted and sex tracts also not true the fear is that kids or waring masks they will be harder to identifying rescue tho servers will continues e rests because of the world home a i l tain i masts is i i dreams i the homes jofferson also get coming up this pretty i ironic way i o in is a ma tons jerkin said i is her dangerous bring them over peaceful slavery i will never i the matter wat titis give me liberty or give at i mean tat i will do what never in says to hot words thank you listening all these parents badly and clerk were alarmed worry that they might have to face classes of forty kids who were in a fight with them about wearing masks badly she got up to the mike she was sweaty and nervous but fired up wan ai i er a o a she tells the crowd she is a first to er teacher who orgy juggling a lot of anxiety and she scared that shall get covet in her classroom the crowd turns on her a as i mi er in be inti i in o who that is clerk doing some very teacher lessons soma i where i r rest a moony you or t it is this for five minutes and then bailey finally and er speech and takes a little bow on their way out of the meeting clerk feeling sheepish apologizes to the people that he told to shut o i have never been to e riot was it was it was just wile to be surrounded by many grown adult who were shouting at me calling me names i well also rematching the vino i i realize the kind of did a little bow after mi after my comes which is that of embarrassing now bat it was just it tough such a outrageous experience that it was almost comical but bailey was also sympathetic to the parents in that room she thought a lot of their hostility was coming from a place of fear not wanting kids to off to been schools where things feel very destroy ani the spare that having to be mask is going to scare their children there something that or in pocked the negatively i the tels our reasonable points in some ways but a also o at the same time i grew up a you cop county i still have a lot of friends in family there si feel pretty safe bedding that most of the people in that meeting were foremen the majority of the county belongs to the church but watching that meeting i saw something i did not recognize organs yelling at o their morons with total vitriol bail and clerk that they felt the same the from the area to by the way i know were not supposed to say foreman any more or to say latterly same but i mustn't actually knew that many morons who use that with each other anyway right after you was republican governor marry sherbert issued his mask mandate church leadership in the state backed him up they asked foreman to hear face coverings in public blinded a sign of good citizen ship immediately there was push back i saw a common son line about corruption and false profits in the church that was mine blowing it is not members number speak out against the church it just that i have not seen at down casually mask people were called maskers and rascals governor sherbert called the parents who went to that county meeting foolish and he refused to back down from his mask mandate which just enraged the anti mask movement and you ta county even more they held another valley and told parents to tell their kids to fight back against their teachers bailey and clerk wondered how wide spread the feeling was and worried that some of the parents or fellow teachers at her new school would recognized bailey from the county meeting and thinks she was a crazy radical radio had hit local news and it was a big deal have you thought about what your to say at your classes on the first day anticipating you might have kids who come from families that shares from the same beliefs to the people who were at the county meeting i really don't know what i good say ore how good a pest that cover such ya really do not know what discover as got a look when the scooliarash was church and sell you happens the would you get what if you get good i will bow and walk out on the first day of school bail and clerk got in their cars and handed an opposite directions their schools are about a half hour apart they both reported voice memos for me while they were driving ora an her thing to school e far a fries stay of teaching a very my who life as an actual teacher there can remakes an yelling excited and her mess an fully i can remember students as the theremasss an the time is now six thirty six and a id in sleep very well last night i cant a tass in turned worst case tonario to day o my gash i think to an i her by that last night everybody came in interest was touching each other and hugging each other and not wearing masts and i think there is a couple those making out the sort of my classroom just much touching an ism hoping since will wear masks to day ism hoping i will not have any major conflicts with students as a they come and and touching on the and i mask hearing than there i went to an i mean all that is her at as students walk into his class room and clerk stands at the door to great them i squeezes handsantitizer into their hands ages handsandtizer coming in ha a y i did handsatitizer clerk describes his teaching persona as door he dad omer once every one is seated he gives his warm up a fellow every one welcome are get feeling to day are you feeling excited to be here result if you are excited this is awkward for and a class of thirty six heads you're only a few of them raise their hands he never taught a class that was quiet and somber was at if you are just find of mistress and sisal you an is anybody feeling anxious about boring masts or feeling my on mooring masts o that tell me more your on not working masks its says some more or why does its at the student was i do not know i us do not feel it sometimes and then my dad talks about it all the time it just to make people feel better is clerk responds taffy by first trying to valid it the student yet i mean from e magical said point masks are defile not perfect there is no luck if we really want to prevent every single get we that woeful has not at suits we have to been an i confound varment masks are not one hundred sot affected however they are effective in stopping the spread or slowing the set of leas than and i know a lot f people are really really rest get by wring mast as there uncomfortable an there make breathing hard and bodega know there not perfect i think it is worse doing as a as a gesture at a kindness for people ho might have more sense of than you insistence or more like more rest an have just bear talking with a student who lives with her grandma and also words out of nursing her and she is tried to take ever precaution make that she does not gets sit here are lot of citations that little by little his classnars to open to clerk keeps lobbing questions at them anybody here plays for its w yo the foot ball player tells the room that is whole team wears masks for games in practice a girls says she heats it that they make a glasses log that about fifteen minutes into this conversation clerk heels the tactic that did not work with the parents with the county meeting he tells them about his own anxiety but that is when one of my anxieties caving back to scold i i don't wat how to tell somebody to wear mass but that that feels trustful me and the kids they seem to get it soon clerk has a few other periods that day

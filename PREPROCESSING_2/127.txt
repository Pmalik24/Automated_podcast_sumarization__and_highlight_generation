donate trump says he will not attend that goose pe to bate as other candidates prepare to get personal rondotans to campaign hits the turning point and hunter bison's lawyers target jobidon ism benchpure of this is the bench hero show bencher show ponder back pressie my in protector all mind privacy today express plans i come flesh men well we finally reached it it is debate weak on wednesday this week there will be a republican to bate will the fruit under be part of that republican debate absolutely touch dona trampling not not interested ism leading by eighty thousand points i do not need be part of the bate and and frankly i totally get i get i he did the same thing in two thousand sixteen after the main cell debate where he did not the question to his ask simply left the next to bate yous subscondet used ism not king t to be part of this i did not hurt him in anyway shape or form oral logical level makes perfect sens from not to take part in the re publican debate you or principal level he certainly should because there is serious questions to be asked bout whether he should be the nominee or not is true for anybody who is running for the nomination jobidon should be debating robot off kenned junior for short and people who are voting for trumpet the primaries should remember f this tactic because i promise you promise you promise you one year from now when jobidon is the nominate if donate trump is the nominate jobidon will not bate dona trump get ready for it it isn't con a happen join will make any excuse he is not can o get on a stage with him and dona trumps people will say well he is afraid and at that point every democrat and every member the media will come back and say will donate trump down debate any of the republicans we exactly should jobidon debate dona trump bid's excuse will be something about trumping an insurrectionary or trump being a criminal in ta the or whatever it is and the media will side with jobidon and there will be no lobate if you're nominating donate trump because you think he is going to debatrobiden just get ready jobidon is not going to bate dona trump but put that aside there is a perfectly logical reason for donate trump not to debate the rest of the re publican field namely he is leading them by leaps and bound there's a bran new see is poll and what it shows is trump way out in trump at sixty two per cent of the vote sixty two per cent of the not for dona trump that is a massive number for tonal trump now one of the theories not trump had been that he ingoing a hover round in the thirties maybe in the forties if who is lucky who would break fifty hetman sixty two per cent is not unchallengeable because with that means at sixty two per cent obviously is it no consolidation of the field is likely to matter now it is obviously super early a lot can happen between now in canary including possible actual court time for the former president of the united states however a huge per centare of trumps base is very locked in on dona trump which man you by the ticket you take the ride yet whatever it can to be it is can o bee ism justgoin to say every topology i know right now because the reality is that everyone knows dona trump's flaws to candidate everythng'll person the united states has an opinion on dona trump dona trump is bated into the cake your you you are taking in awful big bat water this had better work mean if if donate trump is the nominate you are running directly against four separate incitements tat are cut coming down in the first half of next year you are running directly against the generalized america perception that dona trump was not a good actor between nonmember fourth of two the son and twenty and canary sixth of two thousand and twenty one beg that is just what it is can if you look the pulling on the generalelection dato right now general lection data says that donate trump is competitive with jobidon but donate trump is not breaking forty five forty six per cent in any pole this the upper end polls for him in the general election cycle now you may think that is going to change because the economy is going to collapse you may think that is going to change because jobidon has health probing you may think that is going to change because of all f the hunter widen of it all that may well happen right whoever is the hominy of a major america party has a shot at becoming president of the united states as we learned in twenty sixteen when the you times hat donate trump is a one percent possibility of becoming present and then by the end of the night onelectionnight he is the president of the united states if he is the nominal sure there is a good shot he could become presided by good i mean if you are trying to ball part whistling out a one in three shot of him being president of the united states because he lost all the states you would need to win next time you need to win georgia you need o win arizona though not even be sufficient hold then have to win one of the following three wits godson michigan or pennsylvania right and right now in the state pulling his loosing in all of those places right the only place where he may be competitive among those states right now is georgia that is largely because the presents of bran camp in the state of georgia who remains a popular figure but therein be a lot of states that are up for play in twenty twenty four if donate trump is the nominate hand's not just ones i mention north caroling is in up for play i know lot people are sleeping on texts i onto be alarmist years but ted cruise is gin to run a rough race in in the senate in texts especially because great abbot who is a popular governor of texts is not going to be top of the ballet last time cruise ran left remember that great abbot was also running great abbot was a popular governor that s in two thousand eighteen and ted cruise ended up winning over bade a roar by a couple of hundred thousand votes out about eight million votes cast well that race could be really really tight this time cause great abbot is not at the top the ticket and that could be a real problem for dona trump yes believe it or not in texts that is not necessarily going to happen but do democrat see that is the state that is in play if donate trump is on the you they do again donate trump right now leading in the re publican field by leaps and bounds also in terms of general election if you are that is at best of fifty fifty bat that is it now is at possible that that is better than any of the other republicans now i tend to doubt but certainly it is possible why anything is possible at this point but do i think in my heart of hearts the donate trump is as likely to win the presidency if he is the nominee as pretty much any of the the re publican candidates who do not have the same baked in negatives his donate trump i think t at the trump has a very very big problems that face him you can hope that jobidon is just really really bad and that any one could sneak in but that is to really an argument for trump that is an argument that pretty much anybody can sneak in if jobidon is the candidate which requiresyou to ask the questions whether then trump should be the nominee anyway none of this matters in terms of the actual data to day the actual day to to day whatever i say donate trump is winning the nomination by leaps and bounds again the see best pole has him up over the nearest competitor by forty six points by fort y six points and again that's not because of a split in the field that is because he is at sixty two percent of vote the get the s ps pole going into the bate week it is pretty fascinating because it shows how the republican electorate is thinking about town trouble get to

indictments whether it is politically motivated whether trump tried to overturn the presidential election or both seventy seven per cent say the indictment is politically motivated which of worse is true as far as top reasons for considering true ninety nine per cent among those who are or might be concerning going for trump ninety nine per cents aye tings were better under trump which is true ninety five per cent fights for people me seventy six per cent know him better than other candidates and seventy four per cent always been a supporter can remember that is seventy four per cent of people who say they have always been a supporter of trump quart in that sixty two per cent which is still above fifty per cent or just below fifty per cent by the calculation wire as far as weather you are supporting trump because of his legal indictments seventy three per cent of trumsvoters seventy three per cent say that you are voting for him because you are showing support for him during the legal indictments that is what the c ps point has now have a pretty serious sort of intellectual problem with this which is you don't nominate a candidate because you wish to show support for them on an ancillary issue you nominated candidate because you wish for them to win over the week end i ask people let us a some per second the these two things are in conflict supporting donate trump in terms of giving your money to him and your nomination to him and winning the general lection which one is more importantbut supporting him in the trials by giving him the nomination or winning the election if those two things are an opposition and virtually everybody said that they were very much interested winning the election but what is can have to happen for people to actually realize that is for people earthly star thinking of those two the nags in opposition it may be too early for that is gain the pulling numbers for jobidon are low at this point the trumplics competitive even with the indictments an meanwhile it is pretty amazing among those who say that honesty is very important in the grope nomination sixty one per cent say that the most honest candidate the candidate who they choose if honesty is a top party for them sixty one per cents a trump seventeen per centare mantis now i understand that when people answer this question they are not using truth to mean truth there using truth as a proxy for says that things he feels saying at any given they are using truth as a proxy for authenticity which again i have an intellectual problem with truth is not authenticity i know an awful lot of authentic people who lie on the regular i know an awful lot of authentic people where really quite terrible because authenticity is not an a moral quality authenticity is you having no actual brain to mouth filter it turns out that many of the most con siderite best people are in authentic in the cents that if you consider authenticity to be whatever your instinct is that day then you actually have to sit there and be o a ism not going to be authentic when i tell my wife she looks fat in that dress and have you a stupid thing to do or when i tell my neighbor that he is a jerk or won't would make you more authentic to say the sure you be him carryon liar liar and tatwould make you authentic would to make you particularly a good person would are you somebody who speaks the truth very often the thing that you say that is that is authentic is not true and because you aredefending yourself my seven year old son constantly when he gets in trouble he very authentically we will tell me that it is not his fault and it is one hundred per cent his f hurt the is not castoff happens all the time of gains however again my opinion on this does not matter the gulp pe voters opinion matters sixty one per cent of all grope voters in the primary say that donate trump is their candidate if honesty is very important to them not only that among trump voters seventy one per cent of true voters say they they we they're given options as to what they feel they they are give much of sources an they ware asked o a of these sources who do you trust most to tell you what is true and this is pretty amazing stay true voters were asses of those trump voters forty two per cents said they trust their religious leaders to tell them true things which is astonishing that is an astonishingly in a low low number forty two per cent trust there religious leaders to to them true things fifty six per cents a can tor remedial figure sixty three per cents a friends and family and seventy one per cents a trump which means that of trump voters that should trust donate trump to say true things to them more than they trust their friends and family can serve to me yo figures or their own religious leaders who i mean bottom line is that ism on in ha utilitarian level you cannot break that strangle hold howxiclly you beak that stranglehold howdy you say that donate trump is not telling you the truth when he is not telling you the truth when you trust true more than yo trust the person who saying the trump is not telling you the truth there is no way to break that strangle hold per say which is why really the only attack line that that ever was going to get any traction with regard to a huge per content or primary voters was the donate trump is not the most likely candidate to win the selection that which again i think that is true but dona trump is any of posit and loves people trust oral trump to say the true thing in dona trump says ism going to win and ism winning big ad all the poles and there are no poles showing him winning big against hoiden the matter they trust him more than the trust the poles they trust him more than trust friends and family dona trump has forge to connection with the people who support him stronger than any political figure of my life time that is just a fact whether i it or not whether you it or not and that connection means that it does not matter what the facts are what the data are or any o the rest of this it means that if he says that he is going to win people trust him that he is going to win if he said that he did win people trust him that he did win if he says the poles show that he is winning by leaps and bounds people trust and e didn't shift his position on the dime and people still trust him because he has become a source of all of enormous truth again more than religious leaders and friends of family for lot of re publican voters now with all of that said there are few downsides in this pole for dona trump fifty per cent of people in this in this pole likely copy primary voters say that the campaign has been too much bout trump thirty one per cent say about cherish amount nineteen per cent say not enoughabout trumps but split about fifty fifty too much about trump not enough about trump as far as who people thing would be widen that gain these are the starts that that start to border on yet what what i thing is the factual sixty one per cent of republican voters say that dona trump is de candidate most likely to be jobidon sixty one per cent thirty five per cents a is wants is twenty percents got eighteen per cent vague fourteen per cent valley fourteen per cent pants as far as the wants is would he be bid right now only thirty five per cent of republican voters say that the mantis would definitely be bison as pot to fifty per cent tune forty seven per cent say that he might an eighteen per cent say that he be a long shot one of the things that is happening here is also that the again that generalized per caption that the best candidate to be bison would be trump is being bolstered by too separate per captions one is in to wants is control an one is not one is that yobidon is weak in the polling the there is a perception that any one including trump can beat i and the other is that the mantis himself has not running good campaign to this point will get to that in one second while abortion activist offer attacks on the proline community and tried to insure the right to end a baby's life reborn network of clinic's offer love and life to insure a baby safety and well being reborn is a ministry of compassion when woman has an upon to pregnancy she wants to make the right trice the pressure of life people around her very often telling her the babies just a clump of sells no big deal just get rid of it freeborn answers that question in the right way reborn shines a light into the starts offering hope love and free alter sounds with up to two years of assistance for both mom and baby all for free a mom will never regret choosing life this you are alone over twenty eight thousand babes gets live in feel loved because of you the pro life community when you support reborn you support love and life for both moms and babies for just twenty right bucks you can rescue a baby any gift will help all gifts our tax deductible were the answer to saving these live yo simple fact to the matter is that these alter sounds a incredible you get to know your baby well before he baby is born very hard to make the arguments clump of souls when you can see the face to do not nah did pound two fifty and say keeper baby that is pound two fifty baby or go to reborn dot come slashed that is reborn dot come slash ben once more dill pound to fifty and sake cuter baby or go to preborndot come slash ben o cay all of us brings this to the debate itself as he say doll trump right now he is got a lock on two thirds of the republican base or at least half of the e publican basin you up again any consolidation of the feel right now does not look sufficient to overcome it this is why he is not then a participate in the debate and is going to undermine the debate itselffred he is doing it prepared interview with tucker carbon which makes perfect ten tat allows him to slap tdherectly against fox new is the way that going on tucker does and foxes fire tucker and do and meanwhile he will get big numbers on twitter now those numbers are not comparable to actual cable news numbers not numbers on twitter if if you hover over a tweet for more than a seconds or two accounts of you but those will be people who engage at a very high level with that and does mat his not to out compete et he just has to degrade the debate it is we he is go and by way e'llbe the subject of the debate anyway n matter what happens the g who is leading by forty points not being on the stage lot o questions can be about trump in that debate and ronoromne my angel understanding that very likely trump is the nominate she is basically acquiescing to all of his request about the lobate even while he is under cutting the debate she is she is on a bagging him be pared the of course he is not onto do that but she is then allowing all if his surrogates into the spin room to spin for him shelving's carry lake and mat gates and and barondonall and all these people who a trump surrogates in the room their man is ditching the debate and she who is been i got to say chemist in competent a en sees director of my life time the only one is a challengers michael steel she is the i mean it is insane that this lady's retainer job i said this when shoos up for the reelect for a inches an full disclosure ism friendly with army ton so represented us with regard to our case against the federal government to stop the och of humans had under jobidon i said at the time i do not t understand how you get your aspect in two thousand eighteen two thousand twenty two thousand twenty one and two thousand twenty then you keep your job which speaks to in general these state of the republican party which is basely come and non profit for losers it is munch of people who cannot win an election and then there we wouldn't win the election because of this extraneous factor give us more money and feel bad for us how this lady his remainder job is beyond me she is running a party that has lost several elections running has under perform in all the elections were it should be over performing is running up into a twenty twenty four election ticket we republicans should retake the senate and now our very easily on the verge off continuing to lose the senate and maybe the presidency again and she is holding a debate among the publican candidates sponsor by the republican party and basically declaring her own party of relevant because her roll is a relevant wheel would exactly is the rain see stand for if the go says screw you and your debate ism going on tucker and she is what one e you ring all your streets in here to in the spinous they can rip all the landed t on stage that your cadet did not have the balls to come and actually speak to here is roneromney mcdanel a thick like at the line up there i think that president trump well not be there on then debt nit water your thoughts on ti and who didn't make the debate stage with still all thou o the presided trump pal oi thin get selling porn that the america people here from all the candidate but there is a lot of annates the a qualified where at seven in ow that if officially qualified with the small dollar don actions wit the palling threshold an the pledge and then we have got some that are on the of sell wore can a be looking at palls the next few days there are three or for the are waiting fore one worse and one one national pall to make that debate stage i a sum that is some exciting stuffs she is it she is obvisnatn n get trump tho participate you imagine the punishment a of ka well your streets campy in the room ripping on the other candidates no no an i do not in even ought to say about roger money mactaniel who by the way remember the reason she originally us up in this position is because she was related to it money donate trump did not mat rounds she literally drop round from her name pretty while pretty whiled i can meanwhile the decants campaign obviously has been running really rough i the launch with melon musk had problems and then ever since has been bad new cycle after bad new cycle for the discants campaign i think that discants thought when he trumped into the race he was going to be seen as trump without all of the baggage and instead he is sort of scene as trump without the charm because the baggage on trump does not were been the realities the republican base the more baggage you pile on trump the more the republican base seize trump as some heroic ox who can actually hold all the baggage right the more stuffy pile on him the run man that gigs got broad shoulders look d all the baggageing carry and the cantus has been struggling for a line of attack and his original line of tack was electability the tadpole members for bison combined with the fact that he is not run away in those pulls against bison basically've taken away the electability argument from him and he has to recapitulate his pesto recast in he is relaunching is campaign again that started really last week the the original relaunch is now being essentially under pot by both the media and teem trump get to that in one second first math knows i need have my black rifle coffee every single morning i i need it my my kids keep me up all the time actually sleep tracked myself recently and i

dianthus campaign i think they made several cart assumptions when they jumped in to the race and none of those of comer consumption number one governments matters nope not one iota not in the publican primaries o do not his simple fact of the matter is that rondisantis passing a bill to stop critical race theory in the state of flora has been treated by re publican primary voters the same as the value promise wame saying things about critical race theory saying things and doing things in republican primary there is no actual distinction and is hard for a lot of people who are in politic understand but it is the reality because positions ma i get it positions make promises all the time and you ten to believe those promises in a primary if you have no reason not to believe the promises in a primary which is li donna trump could make promises in two thousand sixteen on all sides of a particular issue and before goal ether trust the girl do not trust the guy decants you should trust me because i did these things in florid and the r publican voters alike well i mean but i could trust vague maybe he maybe's do those things when he is sure i mean there have no reasonable he will not do those thing doing things and saying things in republican primary turn out to be almost the exacting thing dosantis is focastaloon governments in flora but the governments that he is focused on in the campaign has been all the same stuff that the vague just says and hasn't assume won and ye advantage over somebody the value by passing a law banding critical race theory in the classroom over vice saying he would do that if your president of the united states a to thattdistinction which i think to cantus that was going to be very telling for him has not had any impact on the race second as i mention the electability argument for dosantis was rooted in the idea that trample nobly polls and t sans would pull better against bison and that has not happen largely because everyone pulls wellagans bison or least hafdecently pagans bison to binds a really crappy president as we will get to unjust a little while that is hurt him and then on top of that i think that decants truly believe that because he had some capital in the bank not just money but actual political capital on the bank that he could then not go into unfriendly areas and reiterates the america public why he was copy on the first place rondisantus is not just popular beat of his cover policy ronisantubs power on the stand of lord because the media made him any number one and then he went into their into their spaces and he reckon them decants that said over and over needs to be doing this i do not understand for life of me why he has not thus far he is easily she led himself from opposing media i get in on a personal of let us not fun to do that sort of stuff but yet who does opposing media fairly frequently is flag you know who does supposing media fairly frequently or at least did during the twenty silent he does not do it now but during twenty sixteen dona trump dit posing media fairly frequently if you want to show the republican base that you are a fighter the senses thinks you do that by actually doing things as governor as i mention nope the only way people think that your fighter in therepublican base right now is you go on media and you go to a member of the media and you reck them to their face that is the way that you show them that you are fighter de sans has not done this in the campaign sofar he is not really drops and polls hes stuck still in that fifteen to eighteen percent range but he is not bust out in any serious way gays over the week he he he basically was lid a he he made a comment ah while he was being interview by wilt that seems to me in arguable in context in contexts i do not think this dis can this this statement is in any way arguable it was then immediately taken out of context by pretty much all of his political opponents which is the way that it works in a campaign and used as a club to hit him heroes to cantus with will wither the weaken these gods have records of principle fighting the swam that are second to non and yet they will be attacked by some of these people and an called rhinos ah it is just been totally detached from any type of substance and ultimately a movement cannot be about the personality of one individual the movement has got o be about what e you trying to achieve on behalf of the america people and that is got to be based an principal ah because it you are not rooted and principle ah if all we are is listless vessels that just spoke to follow whatever happens the comedown the pipe on truth social every morning the that is nothing to be endurable movement gays the beginning of this statement in which he literally calls out people the let stophana right he is talking about left wing or or people who are left leaning republicans who have allied with trump and then suddenly become not rhinos and then shipway of texts whose very very conservative and something becomes a rhino when he supports to cantus what do basis saying is that congressional supporters who suddenly become not rhinos because they support t trump eventhoug they're left wing on policy or people who simply will do whatever trump once on any given day as suppose to i trump for principled reasons their look people who do or i i what trump did is president to people do that is old yes talking but he is sung out people who shift their position on any given day based on what donor trumps preference is are he saying that if any movement that roots itself in follow the leader is not going to be a successful movement that does not seem particularly arguable to me in that context immediately get's taken out of context and now the idea is that what he to basket of deplorable moment when killer canton suggested that trump supporters were a basket of deal while to premises terrible people et camera the suggestion is that what de cantus was saying there is that every on who supports trump is e listless vessel which is clearly not what he is bathing there right in contact he clearly is not the the matter you have got the trump campaign which gain there is great iron to the fact that ton trump can attack anybody from an angle at any time using any tool at his disposal in everybody discuss shrugs the mantis says something that really is not an insult and trump's campaign immediately takes of fence mama put out a in mama ink put out a statement sang instead of issuing an immediate apology teem to cantus seen the last twenty four hours doubling down on his insult to true supporters rondo cantus should stop hiding behind spokespeople an address this himself every hour that passes further underscores the contempt to cantos has for the voters who made him governor perhaps he is waiting for another member from never back down to tell him what to do again the idea is that he is insulting you if you support trumpets insulting that is not what he is saying that is clearly not what he said we played the clip the a cromaswammy in very cynical fashion to the same thing he seated out the real danger trot movement is the rise of listless vessel robe out politicians who blindly follow the commands of their superpacks which is i i got a save theater that is pretty disgusting i get onto cantus has been the best governor in the country over last four years suggesting that rondo want is the listless vessel following a super pack is patently absurd it is patently absurd the idea that candidates will say anything or do anything or switch any position to get ahead with no consequence in that that sounds more up listless vessel kind of talk i but it is but it is som it is g enol it is campaign campaigner ugly the basis camp fired back at all of this i they they put out a statement the a pressecretary brangriffin sand that the dishonest media refuses to report the facts doll trump and some congressional in dormers are listless vessels why because trump and deny insiders feel he isn'ntidled your vote ronde cantus belesiyor trust should be earned and has the vision plan an refer to beth bi an reverse the decline of our country anna an the he said that is we round hansel be showing up one tonight to debate and tunnel true will not her what again we will see if anybody else including to cantus is able to gain any point strip the debate seems to me the dynamic is debate with trump absent is going to be all about trump it seems everybody's onto train the in coming fire onto cantus particularly chrism crispy who is just a suicide bomber in these debates he was not twenty sixteen when he committed one of the world's most obvious acts of murder suicide against march radio killed him in new samphire debate anna and then proceeded to implode himself not a lot of people are looking for something sort of diapositive from this lobate i do not think that that is a i do not thing that is probably right i think that this debate is probably can be everybody holding their ground because what ground is there to whole the mean there fighting over thirty five person other publican base of this point trumps got the other tho thuds lock up man's can be hard to see how anybody breaks loose from that packs i suggested last week i think this debate looks more a lobster pot than anything else our crab pot every pulling each other down as they tried to escape the pot meanwhile trump is sitting over there with tucker carbon i enjoying himself no the the other candidates for what it is worth a a our having their own struggles every folkstonto santustis struggles cause he is widely assume tin my pulling is the second most prominent candidate in the field even if he is trailing by forty points but the other candidates are having the own troubles the take romiswomy for all the talk is still six seven percent that is out performing for shore take is very aggressive he out on the campaign trail all the time he goes into opposing made spaces he is very clever and all of those things turn to via favor is he actually going to be denominate almost undoubtedly not it does not matter he is make my name for himself which again is part of what republican politics has become for a while i is hat is very often people running for office for ancillary reasons meanwhile nickel valley is still running she is earning three for percent of he vote she is she is at least to her credit trying to make a case as to why people should move beyond trump which i assume that somebody has to make if they do not want from to be the nominate here is nickel hailed the other day trying to explain my trumpshoul noble the nominate i think that president trump was the right president the right time i agree with many of his polities but at the end of the day we have to win and nonmember and it is time to put that negativity and dram up behind us we can keep talking about the pass we had do to talk about how we are going to take america to a new future that is full of teeth and lawn order and opportunities for our children that is a case is it going to have an wait i have some doubts meanwhile the person who actually has the strongest case to make against trump on the merits is my pence is vice president we donate trump like about for three months suggesting that he had the unilateral power to overturn these twenty twenty election by denying state certified result pence was was a specifically about whether trump actually declassified materials that he then had on his property of mar ago over the week an a pence law i mean i don't we an evidence he do classified them we are learning that matters has told investigators that he knew of no such boat classification order of from donate trump what about you had you heard anything ought to suggests that the present and an issue a you do not order even a standing order reclassifying documents that what what first off the handling of classified a materials is enormously serious in the life in the nation but but but i care really comment on you reporting but a in my case i was never made aware of any broad bast effort to declassified commence a there is a process a that a the white house goes through to declassify materials ism aware of that occurring on on several occasions over the

unbelievably we can an a chuck tot an jonathan martin even they over the week end were recognizing that there massive issues clouding the biding campaign here they were discussing on met the press i think by has basis real got three issues fore he is not four to what the a o i wants overly the lessons about hunter by his son the other is what the say about the investigation ti the doll from and the thirds about his age those are three hassle issues that are sort of clavi his re election camp and he is not forget all the save of and the o that of course is true and even other members the idiot or noticing that hunter biting and jobiton are liars for example jam tavern canna an hots you remember that time wen jobiton said that hundred not receive chines money that was not true hustler rote hunter bide report nearly two point four million in income in twenty seventeen ans wo point two million in i coming tweeting fighting most of which came from chines three grain interest but the and this directly goes against whit jo by in sad in the debate and twenty twenty with do dona from pickles my son has not me one in terms o this for mount awarded career a china want you not ta return he made a fortune in new gran in can in mass sepeliaryot of the players sons from two different good blades guy i mean trump was right i mean he good ma a fortune from tana and jo bison was wrong now normally you would call that jobidon being a vicious liar he is a penny anti criminal he has been a penny anti criminal his entire political career w his not hirer is just litter with him obtaining goods for members of his family were talking about everybody ranging from in sister to his brother frank and him to his sons to and hunter every one around cordon has to come richer because jobidon was in the united state senate there is no question about this well now it seems that things may get ugly for jo not because of the stuff that he did for hunter but because o the one time he could not pull it off for hunter according to politico hunter bison's lawyer is now threatening to put jo bison on the stand it was holloweene of twenty twenty two and hunter bison's lawyer cross clerk did not sound happy just threes earlier news had lead that federal agent believe they had enough evidence to charge his client with the legally buying had gun as a drug user the legals illegal the lawyer wrote to the usiterny over being the probe the prosecution he argued would be seen as purely politicly might even violate the second moment then he issued warning if the justice department charged the president son his lawyers would put the president on the witness stand president bide now in questionably would be a fact witness forced the offense in any criminal trial clerk wrote in a thirty to page letter of viewed by politico that letter along with more than three hundred pages of previously unreported emails documents exchange between enter bisons legality an prosecutors shuts new light on the frougtonegotiations that nearly produced a broad pledge that dead would of resolved bisons most pressing legalissios the gun purchase and his failure o pay taxes for several years and also could have helped insolate bison from fuse future prosecution by re publican led to jay the documents show how the do collapsed a sudden turn about that card after publican's fashion and a judge raised questions about it the claps renewed the prospect bidonall had to trial as to father rams up his twenty twenty four election bid what exactly happened here where apparently the documents provide a detailed behind the scene's look at how the topsides came to the brink of a pleaded it was a sweethardeo to question blew up when the judge saw the sweetheart deal and said have never seen anything remotely this it was very obvious that avid wite and the do j were cramming down a sweetharteo hunter bison was going to take that sweethardeal and they're doing all of this in order read jobidon from having to take the stand or be involved but it was jobidons dona who was overseeing all this obviously according to the documents by aril twenty six twenty twenty to as the hunter bison's lawyers can ben with prosecutors then one bit concerns taxes specifically by the prosecutors were going to charge him with failing to lawfully pay those taxes from twenty fourteen to twenty nineteen charges related to anything else down seem remotely imminent speaking to lawyers from the dona bison's attorneys open their argument with trump in letter from ceaseless demands for an investigation of hunter charging the younger bid with tax crimes soul be devastating to the reputation of the dona according to hunter's lawyers it would look that apartment had acquiesced to trumps political pressure campaign the argument that hunter's lawyers made to the done which the done then took up remember this is also under dona true was if you intervene wright now and yueftually rescue hunter i might hurt jo and that would look bad for trump which is an insane reason not to bring charges bison's lawyers to argue the political pressure was itself a compelling reason not to bring any charges later in twenty twenty two the of confirmed to bison's lawyers their clank could also face federal charges for a gun crime clerk argued the same political pressure men bringing gun charges would be scandalous on october twenty twenty thirty first point point to he wrote directly to avid wises the us turning for delftware overseeing the probe wise had been appointed by trump he been allowed to stay on during bids administration to continue the investigation medick garland the g a place to give wises full independent but he was not given full independence he had work with other was across the country to charge in various our sections cause he would have special council status clerk argued in his letter to weirs the charging hunter bide with ta gun crime would torpedo public trust in the do jay the document included color photos of two former heads of trumps at do matwouod her and bulbar talking bout bid business deals on cable news then clerk can woke another controversial federal investigation he said was seen by the public is a political hatchet job the failed prosecution of prominent democratic lawyer michael dustman dustman of course was involved in the steel docile and all the rest of it clerk played out what couldhave ben seen as appromiiss a warning or some very zealous lawyer in he said jo widen would undoubtedly be a witness at trial beaus of leeks about the probe he wrote the just a few weeks before sending letter the had been two back to blackly s related to hunter bison and the gun issue clerks had the leeks prompted the president to address his son's legal woes the next day on signed and he then described in and nearly on thinkablesonario actually calling jo bison as a witness and that point the do basically said finally solved that let let us let us do as sweetheart pleaded which is incredible basically hunter bison's lawyers pressure the bison do into giving him a sweethartde with the threat that join might have to testify for the defense totally insane then the whistle blowers came forward they said a by the way this sweethartdeo and they prevented us from investigating fully and that is en only then after that and after the collapse of the pleaded that is when the dona decided to make avid weirs a special council to investigate presumably partially himself by the way worth noting here who exactly is avid wise well turns out that due avid wise worked for years with to widen because he is from delftware delayer's very small state everybody knows each other wees worked with to to hash out prosecution strategies although demo cat's point to wife's appointment by donate trump is evidence of his independence the full story of his career is more newtons he spent two years acting you o turning under barochamama and jobidon and then remained as top deputy for the remainder of their term that the notion that it was trumps decision to a point deice and he out a fired em presumably but very often what happens let you think the president knew who avid wise was of course not he out recommendation for people an delayer avid wises good guy he just reappointed him the wide has to lined to moment noting that wise's conducting in independent investigation presumably into himself considering the fact that were is the person who negotiated the sweet her ideal in the first place this is going to get very very ugly very quickly for hunter for job for everybody else in solve meanwhile jobidon continues to be the world's most terrible president over a thousand people are still missing two weeks after the wild fires in mall that includes presume we hundreds of children we we have no idea exactly how many people have died the good news is that tat jobidon went west for his second vacation of the month which is really important they arrived in a vitta late fridge for warp rest and relaxation there renting a private home on lake taco he flew there from campdavid where he hosted a summit fridge with the leaders of southward trapan that home belongs to tom stir and cattail youremember sir as the very very ultra wealthy democratic owner who ran for president in when he then he got zerovotes the bids will than halt the vacation for one day on money to his anally though me with survivor's first responders an local officials while surveying the damage this is shortly after i he said the was no comment on the umber of dead in mall he vacation earlier this month in republic beef tellaware her he went on bird's visited beeches went for a daylight with the first lady to ut to see openhimer ah it is the good news is the old man is having himself really i summer the bad news is of course that if this were dona trump doing all this in themiddle of the malywile fire then not everybody would have lost their damming everybody but obviously he is jordan he gets away with it according to the washington post ahead of make visit bison's governmental and personal response scrutinized well ye you think by whom maybe you should just instead of reporting it as a third party well it is being maybe you should be doing the scrutiny more than a hundred and twenty hours passed between wen jobidon for spoke publicly about the devastating madly fires on auguster and his next substance have remarks about the tragedy the following week during that fivedays stretch of presidential resist reticence the full scope of the wrist in how came to clear o views the washington post behind the scenes ad say bison was leading a robust by the book federal response oh yes behind the scenes aids say heard because he was saying no comment the entire time very very weird meanwhile feta there spokes firs rems other sand what we are not in charge the status which by the way is true but that did not cut t when re publican was president owe we as acanthus section say to an shown say is across the street hem is working close my win state emergency management and more coy emergency mana e mat our that this

would be a national scandal of your republicans the you have these horrible fires an how and a your my wife an i ex we we did our honeymoon and mat we way back in the day and way it it is a great great area just utter devastation and bi in what is he doing has up on the beach and that he is asked about ane says to no commit now look if we republican had tried to do that what do you think the media would do they would go crazy i fact they would blame the republicans for the fires happening in the first place we all know that that is the true i get with that obviously is true who is to blame by the way according to the bedpost access to hate so be predicated on conversations about equity according to the why official under fire for the laying access to water during the mall wildfires am clue manual former deputy director of the a commission on waters or management waited for more than five hours to release waters during the wildfires the devastated malty according to the reports manual in a lives from to made host by the universe of i last year described water as sacred god he said let water connect us an to movie us we can share it but it requires true conversations

overtime it rain in southern calicle of the thirty five years overtime it rain in then californium people had no idea what to do wit o ma mild rain heavy rain in southern californium is a full scale disaster areas or obvious my will see how gave news hands that on sort of the political level meanwhile nationally an joined were been talking about doing a a really crappy job while the fact is that where about to watches can get a outwore china it is economy's mention last week is going to drag down the rest of the world economy according to the water journal for decades china power into coin by investing in factory skyscrapers in roads model sparks an extraordinary period of growth that lifted china out of poverty and turn it into a global drink whose export prowess washed across the globe now the model is broken what worked when chine was plan catch up makes less sense now the the country is drowning and get and running out of things to build part of chime our sale with underused bridges carports millions of apartments aren'noccupied returns on investment have sharply declined with private investment we can exports flagging official to the one little choice but to keep borrowing and building to stimulate their economies keensianism working beautifully over in china the reality is the china subsidization of pa titular industries is not what made china a world economic power what made china world economic powers opening their population to capitalism to even the smallest extent the the sort of fanciest economy c model of china which is that you did you you basically subsided particular industriesandyou make those the industries you borrow money to make those the industries that actually ends up failing i say this because there lot f people in america who believe that it will not fail in america it has failed in america before it was called the nineteen sixties and seventies in the united states economic now believe china entering near of much slower growth made worse by in favorable demographics and widening divide with the united states an italics that is jeopardizing foreign investment and trade as well it should you should check out our episode facts episode too over it out for more on this i talk about the inevitable decline of china theygot a serious problem on their hands demographically economically speaking the iameff puts china guy pe growth below for per cent in the coming years less than half of its tally for most the poured for decades capital economics a onion pastry search from figures china then growth is slowed to three per cent and will fall two round two per cent in twenty thirty and they closing themselves off more from the world economy stagnation is about set in at can have some real dramatic if facts on the world economy as well meanwhile the war in u crane has completely stalled out marks walker writing for the waste journals is russia war on u crane is in danger of becoming a protracted struggle the last several more years the reason isn't just that front line commit is o slow going slog but that none of the main actors of political gulls theatre both clear and attainable wight who said this who said this a year ago who said that after a couple months of war that either there need to be a negotiation where everybody was looking for an offeramp or all the goes were miss line the russia was not going to give up crime an the nonbasic the u crane had been told by the west that thy could win back every inch of that and that zelensky as going to leave the negotiations and these two rolls were incompatible in the extreme and this was likely to just continue forever for very very very very very long time and the only way there's on to end is for the west actually place the roll of badge go to stand say you are on to gat part o the don basking to retain crime go as elenskin malison that is the deal and you don't it tough selensky gets to go back to his people and say higher i wanted the whole thing the west wound let me have it he get to retain his stay us with the agrarian people the ruffians get to save some face and the war ends otherwise they'd just in n continue e crane's central war aim restoring its territorial integrity is the clearest but appears a distant prospect given the limits of western support again territorial integrity post twothousin end twenty to is not territorial integrity post two thousand fourteen is under back mama the crime was seized by the ruffians and nobody did a damn thing about it russia presa ladies pounds declarenames have he most elastic ranging from ambitious imperial schemes more limited land grabs and shifting with russia military fortunes well that means that there is actual play in the joints there but the the fact that there has been no actual strategy here from the bide administration is part of the problem have been saying this for a year again there's no shock your they literally said we want you crane to wait an than they definitely did not to find winning and they said we will do endless support and they did not to find endless was not true and then there ya and by the way we will let to lens leave the negotiate and you literally crated a formula for endless warn than your shop surprised when it arrives it is totally amazing to me again jobidon a terrible terrible present of gat time for some things i and than some things that i hate thin gs that i a i spend some time over the weekend reading a great book by a on him dance booster borstein was a a rather famous historian a leader in his life he made a a pretty famous turned toward political conservatism he started off as somebody who was a sort of on the communist party side and be by the end of his career he is more on the conserveside of the political isle he actually ends it up i believe being given i in a he he serves us the twelfth brain of congress under ford carter and present pagan is a great book called the discoverers a history of man search to know his world than himself it really sort of fascinating take on history it sort of a synthesis history in which he tries to covers much ground as home the possible i enjoy these i suppose sort granular level histories the book starts for example with a history of how man perceives time ut we do not think very much about the fact that a days are dictated by the clock they are dictated by our watch but until about thirteen hundred nobody even thought of twenty four hours in a day you measured hours by hours of daylight not nobody actually had a a working wristwatch be wristwatch's only became popular in in the west and and all over the world early twentieth century there are pocket watches those really were only made available popular in the seventeenth eighteenth centuries i the your talking about most of human history basically it was either light or it was dark but now that you human beings created time that that means that our days are governed by hours minutes in seconds is that sort of stuff it covers all that covers exploration at covers religious history really a good book again all about how human beings have transformed their perception of the world around them and than their world around them he is write a lotograte bookshelsero to three part series on no the on america history that that is really worth reading his stuff is he is a terrific historian stuff is really wort the reed i this book is called the discoverers by dance worsting of a time for some things that i hate naturally a alesanero cosocrasas she is going

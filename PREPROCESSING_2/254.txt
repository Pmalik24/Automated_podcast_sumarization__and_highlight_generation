a quick warning there are curse words that are beeped in today's episode of the show if you prefer a beat version you can find that at our website this america life dot o work i think probe every two years give read an article about some scientist who things there might be away building off chicken wanna or whatever to figure at the wanna of dynasours and bring one to live i feel i run into these stories all the time the were the scientist couple years ago who were talking about how you could take neanderthal data and use it to create nonneanderthalls or this is i think that the realest one going i thin this is an actual thing there is a team led by hazard scientists trying to bring back the woolly mammoth it's right the woolly mammoth and have herds of them tromping through the liberia tundra that is the actual plan and cannot you say i know you scientist you have your reasons but whenever i read the stuff i think did you get not see drastic park have we learned nothing from the movies your scientist to showery with were o the cute shut tankechief boom doctor frankest nine sleds the body parts a dead peoples sows them together on a lab table jolts em with som electricity very showy electricity there i say the creature comes to life and then does things the scientist did not anticipate at all unintended consequences my friends is not just in the movies by the way of course as we all know discoveries in subatomic physics left the lab decades later we got newcomer bombs scientists constructed ways who computers and network with each other in the sixties now half century later e ended with ruffians trolling our elections through social media salons return to caprice kill all the humans who invented them i get to was not real but my point is the same unintended consequences they happen when the experiment weaves the lab om to day an our show we have three examples three telling examples from three very different kinds of labs one of them cave one of these labsectually just a laboratory of human feelings but still from d you be easy chico it is this america life on our glass is there were us at one break out star i us o we begin with this experiment goring legal said this is not a traditional experiment not a traditional laboratory but a laboratory of human emotion one very familiar to lots of people ism talking about the reality levy show the bachelor been round for twenty three seasons every season of course is romance made in a petty dish they throw on one guy dozens of women each week the guyejects a few women from the petty dish until there is just one laugh and that is how it went until last season when for the first time one of the lab subjects a very important one escaped the lab with yes an intended consequences one of our producers the manual berry tells what happen have been watching the bachelor for years and have never seen anything what happened on episode nine of season twenty three there is this one moment that felt real that i have not shut up about it goat it is almost the last episode of the season it is the bachelor of course the filming in a romantic location a beautiful property in portugal the bachelor this time around is culling underwood his twenty six tall sandy hair handsome a former football player and as the show has mentioned a million times he is a virgin i could careless online i saw fans of the show describe in the spent and sincere my roommate once called him a medical chicken nugget reals allele by man of the i down chef e the show is a money nit tradition in my apartment my room and i open a bottle of red wine and for two hours we enjoy some choreographed dram out cantestons who are not there for the rite reason bachelors who did not know wit would be hard tearful eliminations he entire thing it is kind is silly it is actually a total mess but ism into it so back to that dramatic moment it is nighttime in portugal and clean has been dumped by the girl of his dreams he has shut himself into his room oeomhe says ism done ism done with this cut the most dramatic music he throws open the door and his hand is suddenly covering the entire yeti screen then this strange thing happens suddenly the invisible to crew becomes very visible cameramen find their way into the frame clean is running down the stairs he is taking off his might and the producers start calling for chis teeming in ran chis garrison is the host of the show whose forever popping into scenes unannounced and i always feel weight why are you here clan's waking away from chis ignoring every one and then he reaches his big white fence an industrial security gate it is made me eight feet tall and without hesitation in one powerful graceful movement he leaps up and pulls himself over is on the other side in a heart mat it is the type of move captain america with you and then chis garrison utters what is perhaps my favorite line in the history of the bachelor t chum er but list the crew takes what feels a while to actually get the gate open and when they finally do clean is gone he is gone the bachelor has escaped for three minutes i watch as they search for him calling his name some one starts whistling the looking for a dog all olive honoree tight into cars and they're driving around and finally they spot him on the side of the road clan keeps walking away chis tries to get him to talk manages to get him to walk toward a car but clan in says it is over he says i cannot do this ism done then commercial an when we come back it is the next day in its bright and sunny and chis garrison is nocking on clan's bored o talk and at all feel sort of normal well and ism watching at home and ism confused did not he just say he was done with the show yet here he is talking with chis planning his next move on the show it is never explained how cotton went from running away and quitting to being back in front of the cameras where did he go how long was he gone and most important what made him decide to come back what actually happened the levy show gave no satisfying answer to any of that hey colon hay are you good have you don i call in clan says when he signed up to be the bachelor he would already ben on the bachelorette he believed he understood how the show worked i thought that i did i thought that i had a lot of it figured out and i was wrong he explained that the whole fence jump goes back to a confusion of his own making on each episode there dates with the bachelor summer one an on some are big through dates and sometimes contestants do not get selected for a date at all which sucks because it is really the only tying you get to spend with the bachlare and cold told me something i did not know watching the show that to figure out who goes on these days producers are constantly checking in with the bachelor the figure out who he s one of women he initially hit off with was wanna they always cast her rank the girls and very early on wanna was up there a and she to left off to date in other words in the beginning when they were over twenty contestants this woman wanna was his number one pick but they did not kettle a date with her and i short of recall remember feeling a little burnt when they did that i was limit this straight annas number one on my lister known she is not getting at date this week from there on now i was are high if you are going to do that to my top girls ism not really going to tell you who my top girls are because i do not want you messing with them in a weird way i tried to defend myself and defend the girls by not being truthful to them whom my top was even after wanna stopped being his favorite i just kept the top the same wanna was always at the top of list when i always made the list for them to see and i never changed it it interesting cause it feels you are learning their game and then coming up with ways to sort of either toilet a protect yourself or put yourself in a better position did you find yourself doing that throughout the entire process well yes that duchess me wanting to set myself up for success while clan kept putting wanna as his number one pick each week the girl he fell for hardest was actually classy i o to look a main are it we ti feel one his cousin a of i you likeleti half e latest and i can fey us that mat she is got a serfrfive on hair an shy waves they had chemistry but as if you were she did not seem a front runner i kind of kept for getting who classy was i think with cast beltway to describe our relationship as it was such a lowborn a and it was in a in a weird way in the dynamic of the bachelor franchises wordsposed to be quick and fast an intense it was short of a relief to find a normal relationship in which it was a slower burn and which it was it was a more realistic approach to a relationship and am i do not i think like just it was almost when i was as cases a breath of fresh air toward the end of the season they are down to just three women classy his favorite wanna who the producers think is his favorite antacid the token black girl they're all in portugal and they each have an overnight date scetgeld of clan but some one has to be eliminated by the end of the episode i do not know exactly what the producers intended they declined my request for an interview but watching the show it seemed they were trying to get classy to quite they threw a wrench and her in cotton's relationship a wrench shaped pussy's dad clan had met pussy's dad in an earlier episode when he asked for permission to propose mind you he did this for nearly all the remaining contestants ma pussy's dad said no si shell as far as the hand in marriage that would be a parament for blessing she we but not exactly what i want here a week later in portugal clan certain about classy pussy's confused again i have no idea what the producers were thinking but when i was watching it it seemed they were forcing pussy's hand the show allows a special guess to visit later in that episode her dad actually shows up which nobody just accidentally shows up in portugal t producers the producers pay and a pretty healthy price to fly that man on out to portugal to come visits spend time with his daughter to give her clarity pussy's dad talks to her and she decides to leave the shell there should not be any hesitation in your mind when you me somebody that you once ben rest your lifewithnone life long decision it is not something you make if you creature classy decides to helical an at dinner normally during the dinners and during that the producers or our sort hovering or there around to help the conversation flow or the there just til bounce ideas off of when you gas her talking when we had that dinner there was not a producer in sight there was just a cameras and there was just the audios everybody else ran and they did not want to be near it because i think they knew that i knew knew that they set a out he means at dinner classy tells him she is leaving and she mentions that her dad is here in portugal and that they have been talking collar clearly has no idea that this was happening and he turns as though looking for some one oh have thing i just got screwed i was thinking that that was not her doing i know what the foremen of the show is and for me hearing hay by the way my dad came back really spark something in mean i cold ski i do not have the control i thought i had if i feel my relationships canto be mess with or told with at all ism going to be done especially at this point have completely fling love have completely gave myself all to her i mean i had nothing to lose at that point besides the girl and the woman hat i wanted to seen the rest i my life with coin's about to lose the girl that he loves and in a perverse way it is kind of his fault when collins are lying about who he most on his list shows i really built for that is as if an inanimate test subject suddenly became sentient basically compromised the entire experiment hes sort of played himself i think that back fire because then they were wo we thought it was wanna because you kept telling us even on your list when you random cannas one and and in the end cabstands a basely sot of breaking up with you and lead it yet we walk and i just get up and we walked our walk into the car and it was in the dark there i remember thine there was a sidewalk we s as stay on if was that completely lit and of throw stay on the sidekick i started ut right then in there s ism not ism not doing showy things any more him not doing things just to god through the motion to be in the vaster you now have started to run through snares in my head ass i put her in the van said good by to rows like nap upstairs on n a ground my wallet first off i got to get away from these people i have to lose my mi give to lose ha cameras i have to just be by myself and my plan was to get out of there and go grab a new passport because they did have my passports only i won't i you ism going to o gat a new t ism gone i wanted to be done i do not want to talk to the peoples show i was about to pay for my own flight to get home i was i literally was done talking to everybody went up i got my wallet and i remember opening the door in the firing i see as a camera there and if i had any regrets from the night the only regret would be is actually hitting and putting a hand on the camera courses not my property but i was heated i hit the camera just to get out of my way and goat went down the stairs and a that is when i i undid my mike and once i did that i think they had an idea what was coming next and i i remember walking up to the fence and i had no clue how to open it i did not want a weight for people to open it without hes station without even thinking eyes as start ism over the saying must to it and i justgathered myself and jumped over the fence fully ex speccing the other side to have people producers handlers the food tent i mean this scale of this show is big that there is people everywhere am you can never get by yourself and there is many hands on deck at all of these things but i jumped the fence and there was nothing am it was darkness it was fields and it for me i was this is blossom sis ism here was i soft want them to catch up i start a running am you ran you took off i ran i took off in if if ism ism the worst with directions ism very direction challenged and i had no clue where i was going am i remember being having a ton a bright lights over till left as in son a run towards the light and balefully i get there ism grant at these lights are forty miles away thirty miles away is list must do it i was running in boots in tight lines which is the worst combination ever to run in am and i remember hearing in the distance the producer start yelling my names sonkyew they really chasing after me where where did you hide your big day where you hiding behind ta dree where you of it was dangerous too cause i had no clue what what the laws were in portugal i was hopping personal fences i was hiding behind people's cars am i was laying down in ditches am and finally a hopped through a back yard in this a changing fence on all of a unlike i hear i heard these animals and a sort of sounded dogs and i id love dogs on a big dog person but this this was an aggressive growling howling thing and it'd i was are this is brolly little dangerous i brolyin a little in over my head here trying to get back an find a passports it'll just turn myself him i was gone for about a good two hours you are gone for two hours it was ye am one is all sudden done he turns himself in not to believe of course but to reality t v he does this by walking to the main road till some one finds him when they do he syrup set and overwhelmed and not ready to talk he plays this twisted he says there is a rule that you can not be filmed are recorded while talking to the show therapist he asked for that he says they talked for an hour while he vented and figured out his next move and then finally he was ready to talk to producers what what was that gamelan or of that conversation did they have to convince you to come back cause at that point you were saying that you were you were done i if classy was going to be there you were you see a very done also ye is the ya what was what was the conversation to get you to to come back to the shew as the conversation was while obviously they just wont to hear me out they wanted to hear what i had to say and then the gamelan was to talk to case again but i only wanted do that after i talk to the other two women the labret is suddenly running the lab cone wants to break up with the other two contestants he can make it clear classy that cheese the one that he wants and they do not have to get me ad this goes totally a against the shes for a mat it means no final to no big to ceremony no proposal seen all of these sacred touchstones are just gone from the show it is watching the olympics without the metal ceremony at the end he felt these sort of had more power may be a little more leverage to have control when you went back what if i think i mean have i thinkers just me they knew i was serious when i said is one thing when lead camp done it look i but you turn around in your in an interview the next minute like you you are not done you are right you are sitting right in front of them you're doing exactly what they want you to do they knew not to realize really cross that line in the end he gets what he wants he talks to classy they decide to gate and not get engaged calling is still friends with the producers and he says he and cashier still together and very happy the proves for calling season of the bachelor were all about the fence jump the keas viewers with e footage of the jump my room and i watched every week asking is this the wee see does it there is at chatter account dedicated to the question articles guessing when and why it would happen the wee keep finally jumped we threw a party in my apartment there was a cake with o fence i y would ain't one of the things that i think is sort of interesting about the situation is lake the you know the very big independent act that you did which was deciding to basely run away from the show which a has not happened before am and then that sort of active independence got taken and then that was the promo for the season from i a said one it was when is collard get a jump fence one is collard get a jump the fence i over and over again watching those promos how did it feel seeing this moment and at being used lake as a piece of plot that was sort of hard for me to deal with because in a way their teasing it america making jokes about it making makes about it in it that is there number one marketing in selling piece meanwhile i know the seriousness behind it i did not really real i did not even know if they were on to put that in the show until obviously i saw the traitor me jumping the fence and the i realize that they probably had to in the end the most disruptive thing that could have happened driving yourlead to jump over a fence and run away was probably the best thing that could have happened for the try show ratings for colon's final were up compared to the previous season which make sense because popping offense it felt real those are the moments i the most in reality shows the rare moments of sincere emotion inside this artificial human experiment hammers everywhere and saying locations over the top close the producers can control all that stuff scientist can control the lab that they cannot control the results the manuelberry is one o the prestigious of our show o ye me la otalanunder as gas aba meet me a throw the w an con the ago ameacto two times a lady a a a product is developed in a lab and after months and months is allowed out in the world for the first time it does something that it is creators

running through the office yelling at all of our engineers and pretty sure some people cried and it was it was just absolutely astounding and felt validating the o say is a robot a robotic sex toy there is no way to talk about this without acknowledging the existence of sex and the body parts typically involved if you are listening with kids are you do natant a hereabout it this might not be the story for you of a according to its inventors what makes the ow a different from other sex toys is that it conforms to eh users particular dimensions stimulating both the g spot and the clitoris resulting in a blended orgasm which is an internal and external orgasm together in the same person at the same time and then you go holy ship that was also anthem do you do you do it again i of course you do it again you then you do it again just just for good measure car the biomimicgrig cart what is being imitated by the robotics is what aura calls the come hither motions made by a sexual

is an adult product that is go towards a females and people of the minas and we wrote a letter back to the cities stating that this is the sickly that this is absolute crap this is wrong and it and a they stood by their decision they said were very sorry there was a misunderstanding we did not realize what the nature of your product was and that i did not buy for a second because we looked at our

questioning what kind of product this was it r has had a pretty tumultuous on again off again relationship with the see india street for teaches for a long time sex was actually part of the treat show remember the h s tapes some of the first people to make the leap from film to the h s were porn people and porn viewers were excited to watchword from home instead of a dunt move theatres and booths in the backs of stores and s s want to connect content craters with test manufacturers it was lucrative they let porn companies display at their show but there were strings attached all adult content was relegated to an entirely different building from the rest of ten porn wat still a part of c s but to get to it you would have to leave the loss raga's convention enter and go to the camera which was a casino more than a mile away one of the main porn people back then was pall fish pin he founded a v n adult fitionies the queen to central trade magazine of porn ye got a little a little stare well into this ballroom and the booths were any other booth at you would see in the other trade show and people would have posters of movies and they would have t use that would play soft for clips

mistake aura and her to were being given their work back at the end of the press release came a promise of new and updated policies they would make c s a more quit welcoming an inclusive event for all the first new policy was that they would include sex products in the c s show on a one year trial basis it was not clear why they called this in new police since sex products were actually in the show the previous year they said these products would now b in the category health and wellness and they rolled out one other new policy to address something else the would gotten a lot of criticism for in the past they instituted a does cod quote booth personnel may not wear clothing that his sexually revealing or clothing that reveals an excess of bear skin or body conforming clothing that hugston ataxia what c s was trying to address was booth babes booth babes and c s have always gone together since the nineteen sixties these are models in revealing clothing or body conforming clothing that hugston ataxia his to stand next to the ten on the show floor in a nineteen eighty six story for the pronto star jonathan grow wrote quote the quality of the products was in aversely proportional to the chess size of the booth babes handing out the literature fallfish bine sold a b an years ago to pursue a career in mainstream t b but when i told him about c s is new policies he was not surprise at all it's a sang ting it is its i two thousand twenty version of never e just talked about nothing his shed sex scars them i reached out to c s for comment they put me on with their executive vice president can chick but there were conditions c s would not speak with me about the history of their show the history of sex ten at their show aura's product the away i got the award being t akin away worthy a word being given back all i could ask about was the future of s is it was a short interview but there was one thing she said that help shut a little bit of light on their decision making i ask what would it take for sex to not come back in twenty twenty one after the on your trial and karat told me that c s as priority is to make everyone who attends the street show feel welcome as long as her one hundred and seventy five thousand attendees are not offended by seeing sex products at the show sex products can stay that is the gull satin lying every one aura the inventor she told me that c sexually consulted with her about what category to put sex products into for this wen your trial s s as instinct do it they used to sexton its own category in its own room and i push back on that really hard a because i did not one o be sequestered off in the corner she argued for sex toys to fall under the health in wellness category but me i do not in if i agree when i think of the sex tries that i have used in my lifetime i prevecannot sailoradia when i think of the sex toys that i have lake then aware of in my lifetime the point as i understand it is pleasure and i think it is o k for products to be marketed to women simply for the fact that they create pleasure and i i actually just i wonder why health in wellness i wonder why it could not just be in a category call pleasure why is not pleasure just good enough it is pleasure but om as far as i read it pleasure is also a part of heart and wellness in this one aria aura's a junta is a lot c see they both one us ell see and s s as old solution to the problem was the segregate see in a separate room in a separate building but aura does not want a risk losing anyone she wants to sell to everybody on the main floor with the mainstream protect and if calling her sex for about a health in wellness product gets it out of the lab and into the world she is fine with that it is still hidden just in a different way denim a we

myself i mean the situation was not good it was a shit show but as military clusterfuxin hostile busboys go it was not unusual really it was just cross signals you as special forces had surrounded the guy's house not knowing i was inside i mean i could they i want to tell ja not to worry about me any more but then she will want to know what that means instead i say what have been planning to say since i put on my auntalo bouse this morning i was not there it sucks that that happened but i was not there jean's quiet my hand in voluntarily reaches from my shirt calla hoping to find the neck of the suit popping out then i remember ism not wearing it is in the trunk of my car they are lifted him from comic to wall to read for observation she says what i snap the civilian from molly he is at water read hospital i thought he was dead i thought you said you were not there i say nothing he is in a coma she says my mind races back to that day there was a lot of blood i thought he was dead kelly barkjena as if saying my name will last me into this moment we have received reports that for days the man had been telling friends and neighbors that he thought he was being haunted what you talking about i asked a man or woman that he could only see out of the corner of his eye when he was not really looking watching him following him that is what he said a ghost i was not there i repeat i see jean's can about to move toward me but ism already backing away as i had for the elevator i take small solace in the knowledge that when they come after me they will not send her i don't shoot the guan molly i was in the house with him shore but by then i was wrapping up the investigation he was knoinsurgent not even a threat just a cagy do waxing too political on snatched besides i was anxious is hell to get out of there honestly have been feeling off since i first touched down in africa when i was wearing the suit i was jumpy i was hearing things i felt over stimulated and viper aware and i was starting a feel things a the people's feelings when they passed too close to me in the street the guy whose house have been snooping around i con sens his fear than how i felt been inside of the people this even if it was helpful when the special forces glad creeper on the house nervous is hell i felt them coming it is they were vibrating outside of their bodies through the walls and i wasn't antenna that is why i went outside to talk them down the suit is camouflages in perfect wearing it ism nearly impossible to spot in dark or busy areas but if you stare right at it it is some one smudged reality with a photoshop brush i moving de station in space time i wall comply out the back door but before i could pull the hood down and put my hands in the air one of the special forces guy saw the mud and let one go it the moment i heard the pop from his rifle i felt ta surge of i guess resistance that started in my chest and force is way out through my cops and when that wave reach the suit it is the suit radiated that force outward fifty time stronger the bullet rica shade off my shoulder through the door and into the house i heard the civilian noncombatant scream and fall to the floor i do not know what he said but i know what he felt it was as clear to me as if he would whispered at right into my ear ghost since africa have been doing some research on the origins of the suit that is far back as the nineties the military had been pouring money into researching melon it was known that certain birds used the comical to change color it was a no trainer that defense would be looking at it as a way to canola troops some scientists also hypothesized that it was melon that gave bloodworm their incredible jaw strength but i do not know shit about blood worms what i do know is that the suit was not design to stop or repel bullets it is not armor something is happening the suit is changing evolving and i think it might have something to do with whose wearing it i know the is going to sound crazy but when i was a sophomore toward the senior with an on around his neck used to follow me through the quid gallon me queen and preaching to me about the principles of commit spirituality i bet he would a had a feel day with this suit he would say the concentrated melonand must be amplifying ancient african mysticism or whatever he would say the suit was helping me channel my ancestors hell he would probably paint san copper in the chest and teach himself ow to fly he was full et i countabullship me i'mthing in the suit never should a been made at all that is the result of cocky science assholes and soldiers hacking into natural power they do not under stand and cannot control from the few very guarded conversations that i was able to have about this without setting off alarmbells over at the pentagon there is only one other person successfully deployed with the suit whoever reported side effects mine that brother a tough ex marine from south filly it is currently detailing on the wall at a psychiatric hospital somewhere in new mexico the hospital staff will not go near em they say he can tell you what you have for breakfast or were you are fucking just by looking at you that is not going to be me stuck in some sychword somewhere avid blame to a bunch of orderlies that is why ism running a the molly i knew i needed some time alone with the suit to figure out exactly what was going on what it was doing to me i figured it'd do some bay to testing of my own it'd go off the grid head west maybe even make my way to new mexico or sandbag where a lot of the original melon in research was done no one suppose s to know about the suits not foreign governments folks in the white house do not even know i knew that if i took off with it some one would come looking to take it back an this morning i was pretty confident i could stay gone but now i have another died em o mi to duelist and i have to take care of it before i can leave i meant what i said to gene about this sort of i witness who was currently convalescing in profess it is suck that he caught wind of me it is suck that he caught a bullet that was met for me hell it is suck that he got and caught up in all this at all but combat come he was proof literally living proof than it'd been at the enter of that mean mom and everything it'd learned over the years about how to do dart and get away clean told me that this was simply not something i could let go he was a loose end that needed to be tied off slipping into a secure military hospital sounds difficult but not when you have a top secret cloaking the vice but when every one inside already thinks you are a nurse ism on the right floor in the correct ward before i even have to put the suit on i stare at it for a minute it is an impenetrable impossible mat black but at the same time if you gaze into the fabric it is every color in the spectrum feels good to put it back on i realize as it binds to my skin that have been missing it i feel stronger twice myself i shake out of this bilbeau basin's moment and ex at the bath from stall i sneak easily around the two slubs who got stuck guarding a coma patient and enter the molliguy's room he is alone in his bed breathing slowly through a to ma shine's chirp all around him i approached the bed and check the name on the chart johndough of course luckily ism wearing psychic pajamas i lean in and put my hand over his and well this his her his memory's come rushing at me it is his mine pours up through the sleeves of the suit and into mine it takes me a second to slow it down his name is mar well i really on to estimated the sky i flip through his recent pass a caramel slide so the entire time it'd been watching mar an mall he would been watching me or trying he would actually caught a few glimpses of me at my sloppiest circling around behind in to see who he was testing sliding into his room as he drifted off to sleep he been looking right at me as the bullet bound stuff me and struck his skull he is gone a recover from that by the way his vitals a good i find myself thinking maybe i do not have to do what i came here to do after all it is not he actually saw my face what if he wakes up and tells a few more people he saw a ghost what is the harm in that the thought surprises me ism used to cleaning up after myself it ism also relieved i back away from the hospital bed thinking if i leave now it'll still have a pretty good head start on whatever spooks a chasing me down that is when it accuse to me i cannot just leave him here the people who are coming after me have way more to lose than i do if there ready to kill me for stealing the suit they will take mar out just for none about it ism still holding his hand i squeeze his fingers scan his dark features and then i realize i cannot let that happen i have to protect him the thou at really freaks me out it seems to come from somewhere deeper inside me than me cold up to the surface by by o ship is the ship i know it first it has me read in mines announciples to care about this guy not convenience not cool i could die right here to day fighting for some african do i do not even know all because of a double extra string dose of melody t to get at tacks from gene that read simply as you are i know she means that coming in a should run i do not i move to stand between man's bed in the door have got no weapon and my hands to hand combat training is rusty as all hell pray the ancestors can help me with that i take off my earrings

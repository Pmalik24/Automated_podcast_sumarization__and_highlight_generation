special council blacksmith finally hitsdonal trump with variety of targe as related to the twenty twenty election an canary six we examined the bomchal indictment from all available angles ism venture of this is the bench bar so say shosponserback pressie plan you your web his try being seen in sol to advertisers now may neither ghat express plan right out expressive plans a comslashmen finally the other shoe dropped yesterday blacksmith the special council who is appointed to investigate dona trumps activities surrounding the election of twenty twenty and canary six an also appoint did to book in to his handling of class documents e is now filed a second case against a dona trump the classified document's case is going to be held down in florid now he is filed the federal indictment electing multiple crimes with regard to canary six and election twenty twenty according to the wallstraturnal trump was indicted tuesday an an unpresedent in criminal case accusing the form president of trying o subvert the will of america voters through his attempts to cling to power after he lost the twenty twenty election here was at blacksmith yesterday announcing the indictment and make mug it all about tioanuary six and as we will see this is sort of fascinating because it is political mean what when i state's political i do not just mean that he is saying things that are political in nature i mean that this indictment itself is political see an order for an indictment to actually have any teeth the crimes art that a stathritory nature the elements of the crimes must be fulfill alerting that somebody did a bad thing to you does not make it a rime if i say something mean to you you may not it i may being a her but that does not mean that i just committed a crime a crime is a statue totally defying thing and left tho hit the elements of that crime in order forced to go to jail over that crime the problem in this particular case is that they are lot of things that clod people alike abaladonal trump did between the election of twenty twenty and canary sex i think for example he was not telling the truth when he is suggested that the election had actually been one by him that formal voter fraud not just media rigging the election through in formal means or changing of voters but actual formal voter fraud change the outcome of the twenty twenty election i think he knew that was not true and i thing that he was lying about that but i cannot prove it not only can i not prove it the evidence again is somewhat speculative because maybe he truly believed is in be his defense that voter fraud did to side the twenty twenty election i think that dona trump did something that was frankly false and thing that he was lying to people when he suggested between the election and canary six the might pence had the unilateral ability to overturn election results that is not the way the constitution is written however could there be a legal theory to that extent that dona trump actually believed sure there could be me thinking the dona trump did a bad thing does not make the bad thing a crime and when you start making bad things of crime things you do not a crime free speech a crime specious legal theory's a crime now you are encroaching on actual america freedoms just to get dona trump and that is what blacksmith is doing here because as we will see en go through the indictment in great to tail today as we will see the things that blacksmith is legions are mainly things that are just not good not good things that are not provable crimes and he is stretching the definition of crimes to fit those not good things because he had a man date is all special councils do which is indict and as the old san got once you get a case in front of granary those a a handstand a hamstandwich and for jacksmth who is bringing this case in washington you see it is almost being treated i think legally as a back up to the classified documents case in floored classified documents case in florid is most significant legal threats atonal trump because he appears to fulfilled the elements of the crime lev aside the double standard with killer canton if you are just a jury looking at whether donate from did the things alleged in the indictment and do those fulfil the elements of the crime with regard to classified documents the answer is likely yes in the state of flooridto the problem for jacksmelt is it is in the state of florid you may get a our who is going to basely say i do nothing it is far the or trying him at all and son one to vote to a quiet the back up is file a bunch of real stretch charges in washington you see where everybody hates dona trumps got and hope that they are going to send him to jail on those babies same think that manhattan d a is doing over in manhattan with regard to these ridiculous stormy angels charges you's figuring to man hatband jury they hate dona true the put i in jail and this is where it starts to seem incredibly political again not just political because everything is political a political incense that there is an overt attempt at this point to stretch the law to gets donate trump there is blacksmith yesterday announcing e charges to day an indictment was in seeled charging donate we trunk with conspiring to describe the united states conspiring to divan franchise voters and conspiring an attempting to obstruct an official proceeding the ninon was issued by a grander of citizens here in the district of colombia in sets forth the crams charged in detail i encourage every one to read it in full the attack on our nation's capital on canary sixth twenty twenty one was an unprecedented assault on the seat of america democracy it's described in the indictment it was fueled by lies lies by the dependent targeted at obstructing a bedrock function of the us government the nations process of collecting counting in certified the results of the presidencialege it'll get what he just e generate there is not a crime a canary six i agree was really bad i think ganof six was terrible for america ism not somebody who actually white washes canary sex or pretends that riots in general or one as long as there coming from my side i do not riots i do not violent against police officers i do not think that the riots in the capital word going to achieve anything that was remotely approached by constitutional law i do think that the attempt to label everybody who is at the protest a rioter and everybody who is at the riot a reciter because a lot people just come wandering through the hllsof congress there do i think that that overblown yes do i am i somebody we is white washstor or down place the egregious site of people assaulting people on canary six at the capitablding no do i think that it matches up against the twenty twenty riot mist damaging riots in america history the bedlamites cross america now i do not actually but put all of that aside what blacksmith ha saying which is canary six is bad and donate trump lied and that is the thing that is bad and therefore into crime that is not a crime even if you believe that donate trumps words fueled people in to believing that they could overthrow the election and that therefore they went n they did the thing that he's not a crime they are not charging him with incitement right if that you one to charge that crime you after charge incitement that is natural crime if i incite arrive that means that i go to a crowd i say let us go storm that building right there overt wut'sright now let us do it that is incitement there ware some people who have been charge with incitement on gang six dona trump is not one of those people that is not innocintitement and yet it is very clear that that is what blacksmith is trying to charge him with which means that it is political he is charging him for a crime that he is not a legging if the is a serious serious legal problem now the procedure in this case and the we will get to the actual contents of the invent bench was hes highly highly political this thing's on to move fast blacksmith says the re in to seek a speedy troubling in trying to before the election doll trump is presumably going to clam that this need to happen after the election because he is already facing too legal legal cares he is likely to face a fourth right e he is going to be before the elastin facing down charges in georgia in washington d c in florid and in new york and she is on to argue is letters on to argue s and my farther is pointed out that that makes him kind of a busy man as he is rung a presidentialelections o maybe they out to delay the trial beyond the election we will we if a judge by that argot the judge in this particular case it ought to be noted is a a us district sort judge name tom yet chucking he's noma appoint she also happens to be the only federal judge in washington you see who is sentence canary six the finance to sentence is longer than the government request she is also the same person who as a lawyer represented therefore at boys chiller and presided is a judge in the us house washing against futon g pass a very left wing judge there's ben a point in this case and wit is fare for the left to point out that a trumpet point t is presiding over the marlogo classvidockumans came it is certainly far to point out that blacksmith is filing in a court in washington d c with probablythe most trump hating judge in washington d c in washington you see with a trumpeting jury presumably which is why he feels that he can get away with us here he says they are going to seek a speedy troll and see if they can get trump in the dock before the election since the attack in our capital the detrumpen of justice is remain committed t injuring accountability for those criminally responsible for happen that day this case is brought consistent with that commitment and our in investigation of other individuals continues in this case my office will seek a speedy trial there are evidence to be tested i court and judge bifarious citizens o get here is am here is the problem with with all of this the trumps on to come to court in washington you see on thursday to morrow he is gin a stupid sort wing to get the whole o j siphon style media coverage of the car's leaving marlagod of the plan or riving in washington you see in from going to the sort house and when you aggregate all these charges attempting to obstruct and official proceeding for sample cars am actin sens to twenty years in prison main these are really really serious charges will he be send to that even if he is convicted of those things who the hell not but the big robin here is the disks a political prosecution and you can tell by the charges in to pictures again this is coming from somebody who has a legal analyst right as a as a lawyer i thing that the charges against trump in florid are actually pretty strong the charges here are beyond week which means this is highly political for merit plans dog get's that in just one at moment first company is looking out free when the actually upgrade your service and do not charge you

actual indictment there are essentially three criminal conspiracies the jack smith accuses donate trump of participation in en's page two of the indictment quote shortly after electionday the defendant pursuit unlawful means o discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results in doing the defendant perpetrated three criminal conspiracies one a conspiracy to defraud the united states by using dishonesty fraud and seat to i pair obstruct and defeats the lawful federal government function by which the results of the presidential election are collected counted and verified by the federal government violation of eighteen u s cod section three seventy and k that is not what the statute is for the statute is for this statute historically speaking has been about stealing money from the federal government to the is a real stretch charge ha if you're going to it accuse dona trump afraid this is not criminal fraud as national view points out quote as the supreme court reform just a few weeks ago fraud and federal criminal law is a scheme to swindle victimstout of money or annual property mendacious metric in seeking toratain political office is damnable but it is not criminal fraud oh that is what smith is charge indeed a suing a prosecutor could prove bender reasonable doubt trump hadn't actually con minced himself the election was stolen from him hi aurally and even worse are protected political speech again the notion that it is defrauding the united states not you stole money from the post office or em puzzled from the e p but him actively challenging the el ton beyond the time when be constitution says the state certify that that amounts to fraud and no it does not fulfil that criminal statue o gay that is conspiracy number one their legging conspiracy number to it conspiracy to corruptly obstruct and impede the janurisix congressional proceeding at which the collected results of the presidential election are counted and certified in violation of eighteen u s code fifteen twelve cay case o here the idea is that he was attempting to obstruct and impede a process of justice going for obstruction of justice when when they see obstruction just as i thud tat the charges you are before they release them i thought maybe what the charge wen to be is the donate trump called up witnesses and threatened them to lie he said i want you to lie to the generous ex committee or i want you to lie to the blacksmiths office in this proceeding they rent allege any of that when they say obstruction of justice here what they mean is that he was attempting to obstruct the legal counting of the votes but they do not have evidence for that what they say is that he had a specious legal theory and he articulated a lot that does not amount to obstruction a obstruction would be i will threaten you with a thing ism n o threaten you with death ism n a threaten your family ism a threatened things in order to stop you from doing the thing what is the threat where is it cave that the elements are not fulfilled here t will go through the night me yet they are not even alleged and this is my biggest problem yet you can tell when a cases bullyrag by what exactly is being alleged an for example if you go back to the drink shove criminal case i kept pointing out that the entire media the entire country kept saying this the case about race and i kept saying it is not even a legend in quart that this the case about rase she there is a gap between the public perception of a case ion what is actually being alleged well then you can tell at the case of specious the same thing is true with regard to donate trumps case about election fraud i kept pointing of that donate trump did not even legally allege the fraud that he kept saying to the america public over and over and court which means there is a gap which means somebody is nothing honest oka well they are alleging here that donate trump obstructed justice and then they provide no evidence of the actual obstruction's no allegation that matches the crime that they are actually attempting to indicate him on that cap means somebody is being dishonest in this case its jack smith and finally a conspiracy against the right to vote and to have one's vote counted in violation of eighteen us cod to forty one again this does not this is not the right interpretation of law at it even remotely this all was written the civil rights laws written the aftrmouth of the civil war to stop a sensually white rachis from preventing black people from voting or throwing the votes in the river or something as how what happened here if you have a specious legal case and i ens opt not being verified by a quart that does not mean u violated the law if the basic idea is that every time i advance a legal theory and the legal theory ends up not being justified by a court somehow i have conspired against the right to vote but that that means i cannot overfill a voter case mean but by this particular case every time democrat's file a jerry manuring case on some legal theory and they get overruled then presumably they have now conspired to my to prevent somebody is right to vote because the very manuring was legal and they said the germannering was illegal but then that was turned down obvious why retrying to deprive somebody of the right to vote in accordance with the waw that is not how any of that works advancing specious we gal theories is fully protected by the first amendment to the united states constitution will get to more of the indictment in just one

conspiracies legend are not fulfilled again they were a conspiracy to defraud the united states the fraud stature does not apply at conspiracy to obstruct justice that does not apply because specious legal theories that you attempt to advance that is that is not obstructing justice and a conspiracy against the right to vote and stopping people from having the votes counted again a specious legal theory does not mean that you have now violated somebody is right to vote that is not what any of that means if then we get to some the actual allegations in the indictment they say the defendant conspiracy to impart obstruction defeat the federal government function through dishonesty fraud in seat included the following manner and means first the defendant and to conspirators used knowingly false claims o election fraud to get state legislators and election officials to subvert the legitimate election results and change elect total votes for of the defendant's opponent jo don to electoral votes for the defendant that is on the pretext of baseless fraud claims that defended pushed officials an certain states to ignore the popular vote divan french has millions voters dismiss legitimate electors and ultimately cause the ascertainment of and voting by illegent mat electors in favor of defended case you there is a keyword in that particular paragraph knowingly knowingly false claims of election fraud there never reals have time with this one that to prove beyond a reasonable out the dona trump absolutely knew that the election fraud clams were false not tad he should have known note the people told him but that he actively knew that the election fraud claims were false and he promoted them anyway for his own personal benefit now there are people around true to basically set as motorist build stepping former campaign manager that bunch people a run trump have said yet we knew that this tennis stuff was not true and we are still promoting it to the public but by w do theymean that donate trump personally told them that delegations on a closing the investment if it were if there are some allegation here a witness said dona true told me ye i lost the election do it anyway that would be a problem for donate trump if they said i if there are tape like there is non class documents case rays i know lot the election the election drugs of this grab that is do it at anyway join gabble that would be a prom for him knowingly is a very high standard it requires intent and as have sad for a very long time about the president of the united states it is very difficult to establish in tent for donate trump on intent crimes very tough because again his intent shifts moment to moment like almost every day he shifts his intent and he fully believes the ting that he is saying today and he fully believe the thing tat he was saying yesterday the b the defending and to conspirators organized fraugulanc series electors and seven targeted states at tempting to mimic the procedure that the legitimate electors were supposed to follow under the constitution and other federal and state laws this included causing the fraugulnts electors to meet on the day appointed by federal law on which legitimate electors were to gather and cast their votes cast frauguland votes for the defendant hen sin her difvicats falsely representing they were thelegion in electors som fraugulans electors we trick into participating based on the understanding the votes would b used only if the defended succeeded and outcome determinative lose within their state which the defendant never did the defendinand to conspirators then crabs these fraudguland electors to transmit their false certificates to the v p gey again that is a specious legal claim and what it means nothing nothing if don trump convinces me to write a letter to my congress person threatening the if my congress person does not do x why or z it'd become the legal congress person from that district that is a fraudulent legal claim that has no merit is that a crime hard to say that that is a crime it is a specious legal theory specious legal theories are fully protected here in the united states america where they were until five minutes ago see the defending and to conspirators attempted to use the power and authority of the do j to con duct sham election crime investigations andtasend a letter to the targeted states that falsely claim that the do had identified significant concerns that may have impacted the election out come that sought to advance the deffendencs fraudulent elector plan by using the dome's authority to falsely present fraugulante electors as a valid alternative and urged on behalf of the do j the targeted states legislators to convene to create the opportunity to choose the fraudulent electors over he legitimate electors now get all this is really bad stuff right it is n it is such a specious legal theory it is pretty obvious specious legal theory in absence of evidence also do any of this constitute crime if don trump sans to a lower level member of the does the is what is actually elegy i want you to send a letter to the state much again and tell them that there is fraud an then that lower an member of the do went to attorney general billion said let us do it and pillar says no there is no evidence of that and then the letter never gets sent is that crime is it very difficult to say that that is crime that that fulfils the element of forget obstruction of justice d the defending and to conspirators attempted to enlist the v p to use the ceremonial roll at the canary six fortification proceeding to frag tonally alter of the election results and this is my apart it says that they used a knowingly false claims of election fraudicaso again they keep going to knowingly as very hard to establish when that failed on the morning of canary six the defendant and to conspirators repeated knowing why false clams of election brought to gathered supporters falsely told them the v p had the authority to and might alter the election results and directed then to the capital to obstruct the certification proceeding and exert pressure on the vice president they do not have evidence of this they do not have evidence that he directed them to obstruct the certification proceeding i can never told them to go into the capital building he obviously did not tell him to go in to the capital we salt we are all there right and finally after became public on the afternoon of manual sixth of pe would not fraudulently actor the election results a large and angry crowd including many individuals defending had saved into believing the v p could and might change the election results violently attack the capital and halt in the proceedings as violence ensued the defendant and to conspirators exploited the destruction by re doubling efforts to levee false claims of election fraud and commence members of congress to further delay the certification based on those planes again not a crime not a crime bad ugly in presidential not a crime it willet to more of this in just one second first i had a late night last night we had

putting pressure on the d o ja to send ceria letters and he threaten to fire his a g honestly one f the one o the things that the trump did repeatedly throughout his administration is threaten to fire people and then when it turned out that e couldn't legally fire the person or create significant blowback who just not fire them for example ism page thirty one of the indictment it says quote at a meeting in the all the office on the night of canary third to conspirator force suggested the justice department should o pine the v p could exceed his lawful authority during the certification proceeding and changed the election out come when theassistant g for the office of legal council began to explain why the d o g should not do that ifeninsaid no one here should be talking to the vice press en ism talking to the vice president and ended the conversation o hate and and and all right an due at a certain point here on remember on gentry third the defendant met with the brief find on an oversees national secure the issue it the chairman of the joint check of staff and other national security advisers the chairman brief the defendants on that par titular issue when the chairman another adviser recommended the defended take no action because the inauguration was seventeen days away the defendant said quote radar write its too late for us were con give that to the next sky that is a crime wet wet where is the crime ism just at some point you have to describe the crimping not the bad stuff i agree with t that a lot of the tuff was bad the crimping i knees i knew an explanation of the crime and again over and over this is just here is a list of bad things the dona from did i agree tall tings really bad i do not think they are worthy of a president of the united states also not a crime the the the most specious part of this particular indictment is when you get to the actual events of canary six listen to the description in the indictment of canary six and see if you can tell me where the crime occurs hake is remember this is an indictment it is not description the bad stuff about he bad stuff in fact the bad stuff is probably the reason that republicans hat a real tough time the last mid fromalection there are political consequences to all this it is also the reason why he was nearly impeached and convicted in the senate hake here we go shortly before one him the vice president issue o public statement explaining that his role as president of the senate at the certification proceeding was about to begin and did not include unilateral authority to deturman which electoral votes should be counted which should not before the defendant hadfinishe speaking crowd began to gather the capital thereafter a mass of people including individuals who had travelled too washington and to the capital at the dependence direction broke through barriers cordoning off the capital grounds an advanced on the building including by violently a packing lawn foremen officers trying to secure it the defendant watch defense o the capital in fold on the eve in the dining room next to the oval office hay now there is been no allegation anywhere in this indictment the dona trump told people to break into the capital and violently assault police officers that is why he is not being charged with incitement if he had that is an actual crime he is not being charge with at two thirteen after more than an hour of steady violence advancement the crowd of the capital broke into the building upon receiving news that individuals had breached the capital the defendant's adviser's told them there was a riot there and riders had reached the building when eviserers urged the defendant toe issue a calming message aimed at the rioters the defending refuse instead repeatedly remarking that the people at the capital were angry because the election have been stolen now have a question bad is that a crime is that a crime that he did not say a thing on twitter ism ism wondering how i mean their descriptions of activities here about things donate trumpet reads meeting things retreating things is not a crime as you may know if retreating this for a crime i i be in jail for life i retiree things all the time again it is a description of lotabad stuff and its not description of crime and that is the nature of this particular indictment which is honestly jack's wishful be ashamed of himself it is it is it is egregious and i s in fact it salt on particular rights because when you over charge and those charges violate things the first amendment were the right to purvey legal theories even if they are specious what you are doing s you a saying to everybody else that their first men in activities may not be protected this is going to be the defense by the way n that done that the trump campaign is on roll out the gan roll out essentially yo defense is one when it comes to did true et knowingly knowingly attempt to purvey election fraud the gigot say knowingly is a real stronghold an in fact what they onto do is there going to litigate the twenty twenty election and the into say there a lot of reasons for dons from to believe that there was election fright out it may be that there was no election frauds the exsentedontrom was talking about but to pretend that no credible person could give ever believe that there was any election fraud that is a scratch the exactly john laurel his lawyer is saying here he was yesterday what about the stories that to these campaign finds are now paying for legal fees seniti and he runt add o cash and that front well ism not involved in that but the bottom line is the way that they are trying to take out tonal trumps through the legal process he is being forced to spend money on legal defense which should be spent on the discussion of critical ideas and critical issues people want to here the issues they do not want a relitica twenty twenty and that is exactly what the special council i should say merigorland merigorland and the big administration had to sign off ones inditebet and what they have really done is invited now a realidication of twenty twenty but this time in a criminal court which is unprecedented it nay what a the going o do thing to bring up a bunch of charges the trump are in twenty twenty and thetdefence is on to be well i mean did it would de have to be crazy actually you consider the possibility of those charges what the indictment was is a munch people told donate trump that the election brought thing wasn't true does that mean the tonal true had to believe them how many times if you ben told that a thing is not true many times i d mansion across the course of your life did you believe it everytimesome we told you a thing was not true presume a believe some times you bell did not sometimes you did not they to prove in tats that is point number one what never do is he is gong to say at the lot of the activity is just protected for speech which is clearly true here is laurel explaining you in is on tape wit the former but the secretary state from the state of tore to asking him to find him one more vote that he would need to win the state that is not asking for a pope's asking for votes that he did not get in that we asking for the secretary state to identify votes that were not counted properly and factor that in and by the way that that dis cushion took place with dozens of people on a one call with lawyers involved and no one was suggesting doing anything i legal and no one during that cauls at mister president that is beyond the bounds this is politics this indictment is about pure politics we engage in vigorous lobate in this country about politics but we do not do his criminalize political speech this indictment is a game changer it is the first time that we have taken political speech and said we are going to criminalize it why the party that is in control against the party that is contesting the next selection we are the two individuals an far after onto be running for office tat is an incredible get of circumstances mean it is infant incredible and the do j being caponized against the chief political opponent of the cure president of the united states well that same delta was trying to cut a back door sweetheart deal with the presidents son is a wild spectacle and it is going t be the center piece of the twenty twenty for election if dona true ends up being the hominy a gets a sort of the effects of this on both the primary and the general lection in a little bit but the facts remains that this indictment is really specious it is really really specious again national of which is not exactly a publication known for being trump friendly naturally is full editorial to day talking bout this indictment should be tossed and and by the way even of trumpet convicted on some of these charges there is a good shop that sprincourt overturns the charges themselves because they are not properly formulated blacksmith's entire inditing strategy here is januarysix is superb there is much a crap om o a throw against the wall that is not in indictment strategy and here is the thing blacksmith knows better up until this point have said with regard to jacksmelt blacksmith is a special prosecutor it is his job identify crimes in charge them if he sees overwhelming evidence of a crime happening it is not his job to in do at gems come did wrongly in allowing killer clentenough the hook and twenty sixteenoral class documents it is his job to determine whether the element or crime are fulfilled and then to charge them when it comes to for example the class my documents cases in florid i cannot blame jack smith for the in document that is literally his job but this is not his job this is now political and this is pretty obviously coming from a biding do j that again is politically bus it is impossible to read this current trump indictment without at the same time reading the fact that the do did not set up a special council for the hunter bid an prosecution that the do j appears to have attempt a sweethartuo hunter that the do j pretty obviously is attempting to avoid any further investigation into hunter badman's finances specifically with regard to his own dad when you read those to inject supposition one another it looks the current president of the united states is prosecuting you former president of the united states that is what it looks it isn't it smells and by the way this would ow make it the second time because remember it was under barakoboma that the f bi and the do j we are tarting donaltrup in twenty sixteen to be the second time that democrats in charge of the government and the species of legal power we are essentially targeting dona trump that is drums entire case it is why he is can be promoted in the primaries by the way its like overtime gets indicted every republican rushes to his defense and they should on this particular indictment because the feeling quite properly is this is a weaponization of lawn forcemeat against the former president of the united states for political reasons that is that is what this is and it is it is pretty incredible will get to the actual consequence of this in just one second politically speaking first when you are running a business your employes can create all sorts of

available at dailyware plus dot come right now of him meanwhile the media response to these indictment is obviously member the meteoric static about all this calling coins of s anal she tried to deny that the first amendment protect to any of tonal drum's activity here and it is a very very went case that she is making but what is that matter she is s anal the president was told given ad lies that under these circumstances the state legislatures have the ultimatability to qualify electors he followed that advice now you may disagree as to whether or not those things actually a cursed or not that is why we have political dead we do not have criminal try also for that we have the discussion i natter thing catalpa card a not ti not under the first to after that the thing o in critics not not at all be us under the frena mas actually fried no now the first to man man alow let e so yo tat a if he sang that there was rid the first men it does not allow that present the united states to go and claim there as fraud when he was told there is not rid and then tried to simper the election by over turning lantern at a electors and he or is tat an right layer ain actual indictment o a in other words if she does not what you say the first amendment does not protected that is a hell of a standard for the first amendment obviously untrue again this is a very significant first amendment development if it turns out you cannodvance a spurious legal theory or advance an opinion which turns out to be wrong or even if you believe a thing that is false now now yore not allowed to our stimulate a thing that others have told you is false b you believe to be true that that is now the the standard no carrell who is a legal analyst as well he says this one most significant cases in america history it is been not for the reasons that is have left believes it is why do you think it was son your and to do that for many pages in an dit yes it is a shouting an to anime to it is not just one of the most significandandimens it is he the most significancadimen against tonal trump it is the most significs legal case of our life times it is one if not the most significant case an you knot the states history it is not fare with the shot it is not there with iron for support of education because this cops to the esenchal question of who are as the people do we wat some one the president at in this way that is insane it is up the dread shot a case that led to the civil war and declared that black people were not america citizens and could not be america citizens it is up the brown for sis board which ended segregation in the united states it is up there with that really because and note notices language it is are we going to let the a man get away with this as president get away with with what exactly he is no longer the presidents of the united states i notice and he was impaled twice and also what is the crime ounoave to describe at the crime in refer to be legal one must significantcant man these people are way out over their sees here is the biggest problem you knot in terms of kind of long term interest of the united states there is the short turn problem which is do not bring spurious indictments that may land o person in jail for not commenting the crime because the fact is that if he does any jail time at all the presidents of the unit former president is a seventy seven years old right now presumably by the time this trial and will be seventy eight years old which means that if he ens up in jail for ten years then that is life sentence is es an elderly gentlemen lest we forget but put that aside one of the things that is going to happen here and you can see it happening is it let us say that this investment goes forward but say the judge that to go forward whet say the jury convicts it will not go to supreme court the suprimecort will look at these charges and the sprimecourt is very likely to say by a five for vote that these charges our spurious and t is likely to overturn them that is exactly what i happened to blacksmith's case against for example the former virgin governor boric dona turn out that's a spurious case got thrown out it is quite possible his case get tort now imagine the political fall out from a supreme court on which reunited states justices were appointed by president trump throwing out a case in which tons trump was convicted of conspiring to overturn election can you amain what the political fall out's going to be you worry about the credibility of american's institutions and you pretend that you you care about that if you are jobidon the only reason to see the sup this to undermine the credibility of america institutions either way it is a catch twenty to if they convict on spurious charges had the country believes that it is bull crap and indicates the entire justice system that is already on the table and now if tiger's overturned the other half also believes that well done this is why you should not charge things that do n to exist as crimes and while the political follow out has been immediate president trump immediately a went to a level eleven with you can understand on an emotional level although i do not think the comparison is crap a president from pit out a statement why did they wait to and half years to bring here fate charges right in the middle of president trumps winning campaign for twenty twenty four why wasn't announce the day after big crooked jo biding scandal broke out from the halls of congress a all that is far the answer is election interference the lawlessness of these persecutions of president trump and his supporters is reminiscent of noisy germany in the nineteen thirties the former soviet union and other authoritarian dictatorial regimes president trump has always followed the law in the constitution with advice from many highly accomplished attorneys a sup an not not a huge fan of cozy germany comparisons because the truth is the notes did not actually just trump up legal charges at they literelligious killed you or put yogin a concentration cap and do the former soviet union if the did true publican target it was a full on show trial in which you were forced to contest because they beat in the background is the united states not germanium soli no but its a began a re public type crap absolutely am mention this indictment is began a re publictype garbage forsook foreshore cinema earthy the hose speaker he put out it s we what we have recently learned under receive money from china contradicting president biding claim present began spoke with hunters business associates over twenty times contradicting what biding previously claimed biding goa tried to seecquertly give hunter broad i unity and admitted the sweethartealas in president and just yesterday a new poached president trump is without ads out bins leading political opponent every one in america could see what was going come next yoga's attempt to distract from the news an attack the front runner for the re publican nomination president trump house re publicans will continue to uncover the truth about biding ink and the twoteere system of justice other re publican law makers came out in defense of president trump that included people onto mantis who put out a statement pointing out that this is a double standard of justice that did not stop trumps sopor from attacking round tosantis insufficiently submissive to the former president of the united states representing him jordan the chare of the use judiciary nominees had when you drain the swamp president four the swamp fights back president trump did nothing wrong there is some staunch trump to fenders to called for cutting off money for these smith investigation old be a little but late for that at this point him scout suggested he was concerned about the weaponisation of biding t o j and romance power used against political opponents democrats of corse for celebratory sentiment majority leader trucsumers that no one is above the law including dona trump unless your name is hunter bison or killer client in which case you are totally above the wall we love you you are the best even if your a jeffrey hupstin main minus g avarice this incitements this indictment must now play out through the legal process without any outside political or idea logical interference we encourage mister trumps supports and critics likes let dis case proceed peacefully in sort o now the for peaceful quart proceedings a is that is not cue mean mum forget all of twenty twenty get the railroading of people at drink shoran nothenot now they now the legal process is totallyaffair and above board mean a resume to lead a terrible human she posted a similar account to x which just witter san cot trumpmuse be herdic countable for conspiring to overturn election and in citing a violent fashestinstrection i giving away the quiet part right there that i he was not charged with incitement he have noticed which i natural cry again i point that out the entironsipemens founcitement they did not charge him with incitement there is that eh what is the actual impact don the election well there is a petty obvious impact which is that if trump is the hominy the entire election is going to be about his legal troubles the entire election because listen to this clan he here's the calender from here on out tomorrow he has a canary sixth d c quart appearance the first grope abate happens august twenty third twenty twenty three october second the trump organization civil suit begins angry fifteenth the aging carol civil defamation suit begins canary twenty ninth the pyramid scheme class action suit begins march twenty fifth the hush money suit brought by the manhattan d eh begins that is marsh twenty fifth may twentieth the class find documents trial begins and now we do not know when this particular trialiscan to begin i would assume that is can be somewhere in that time one the entire next year is going to be taken up by donaltrum's trials he is going to be focus on it a lazerbim and that is going to be the strategy the strategy for jobidon is going to be just crowd out all other media cover all of it that is on be the strategy and trumps can musing allows money on his legal offense he already has real yes army tapped into all of the election funds in or to pay his legal bills tat has two particularly strong ramifications for general election radiation umber one if the entire electionsabout trumps legal province very digital from to win very very difficult because again everybody's can be focus in on the province of true the'renot can be fast in on the probing withe current president of the united states who is both corrupt and terrible at his job rob number two is if to trump uses every dollar that is coming in to fight all of these spurious legal actions against him i know that money is not going it is not going to ballot harvesting it is not going toward the knock nothing on doors campaign is not going to the on the ground things you need to win a tight election that is all part of the strategy here the the fact is the all the stuff does hamstring dona trumpet in general election in pretty incredible and dramatic ways obviously i and tom those are challenges thar to be hard for true forget about all the other candid forget about the e publican primary bandits just on a practical level he is our serious obstacles from now i understand the emotional appeal for republicans of give him the chance he hes hes only chances we have to give it to him we have to meet we have to let him run for the presidency because that way he can pardon himself in the federal cases or if he wins than he has powers that he would not normally have also we we need to see the conclusion of this move where trump takes revenge or leas has the opportunity take revenge i against the gone that has been playing him i get i get the emotional peel i feel it myself i totally understand it also who is the most likely to win because the only way you actually win and defeat the jo bison political machine and the geode run by trobidon is to make him not the president any more and the anyway to make him not the president any more is to replace him withe republican and the the wet e r place withe republican is to run somebody who presumably is not going to be hampered for the next year by massive legal issues spending every dollar on his legal defends and spending no time actually campaigning because he is too busy doing depot depositions these are real on the ground concerns n that is not excusing any of the attacks on tonal trump it is not its to practical real life of phrasal of the political situation on the ground now despite all those on the ground concerns the real concerns about the general in the primary there is no questions fanatic colostrum there just no question about it good evidence of this is a might dance his response to might sense the formevice president who actually was the guy who had the certify the election which he had to legally do or cave there is no actuallegel argument that could overturn the election that vice president cansenly throw about states certified electorovotes if you think that is the case lentil cornball herristus it if trampling the election and then tea feel about it that is not the way the constitution works but might pence put out a statement sang a today's incitement serves lenient as an important reminder anyone who puts himself over the constitution should never e presidents of the united states howhave more to say about the government's case after a viewing the incitement the former president is entitle to the presumption of innocence but with this s indictment his candidate he means more talk aby canary sixth and more distractions is americants his candidate he means lessitention pay to jobidons disastrous economic policies afflicting millions a cross the united states and to the pattern of corruption with hunter our country's more i portal than one man our constitution is more important than any one man's career on canary six form president trump demandant i choose between him an the constitution i chose the constitution ana always well o faso the blow back to pence a statement has been extraordinary and i think for some good reason and som batteries he is saying two things and they are distinct things thing number one is he is saying that donate trumps activities leading up to canary sixth greens and hat he should not be the nominee because somebody who displays that sort of judgment should not be the hominy i have a lot of remote that sentiment i think that trump's behavior between the election and canary sit was in fact greens i think that the pressure he put on my parents pence to take in constitutional action was a egregious and serious i thing all of those things also that is not the issue to day ecus the second thing that he should have said is the the he shouldhave sad i did which is still this indictment is obviously put up job as always two things come met at once it are no how often i can say this donate trump's behavior between the election in canary states was unpalatable it was wrong he was saying things that were not true he was lying two people about those things whether he believe that he was lying or other he did not believe it if that he was not he was use mind allegations that were not even legend by is o foyers and sort he was he was advancing a legal theory absolute it is an insane legal theory the vice president of the united states is the singular power to overturn electoral results thar are certified by the states tat'sugjust it is a nutty theory say all of that can be true and also not a crime also not a crime and right now the issue is whether things tat are not crimes should be charged as crimes not whether dona trumps behavior during the election was good down trump's behavior during yoeulection was good has ben litigated and litigated one million times in the for o public opinion is ligated in impeachment was litigated in elections that it took place in canary of twenty twenty one t was litigated in the miternallections of twenty twenty two it will be litigated again presemblyan twenty twenty four of tonal trump is the nominate but that is not the question the question of today because that is when indictment come down is does the do j have the power to charge people with non crimes and that is a much broader issue than dona trumps activities on canary six was the thing that mig pence is missing and that is why people are shellacking him to day i can meanwhile the double standard of justice that had become quite apparent to everybody continues the the media continued to studiously avoid any implication that hunter bidding jobidon had some sort of a corrupt bargain going on which they pretty obviously did heroes an ens damn abash trying to defend hunter and jobidon's activities despite the fact t we now have open testimony from demon archer to congress suggesting that jobidon was on twenty phone calls with hunter bisons business partners that that hunter and job obvious and job obviously knew bout the businesses when we know all these things but heroes an en stay abash trying to ye wave her hand away at it does that mean that the the president was in palled and hunter widens fishes dealing now but we all understand washington and we all understand a that a lot of thees a relationships operate in the gray areas intentionally especially when you have a somebody who's either related to a a famous person or powerful person or use to work for a powerful person you want your clients to know that you can get the on them yet he is obeying the gray a was the gray nosegay it is the gray areas meanwhile you have morning job one of their hosts johnathan lawyer basically trotting out what whats can be the final form of the argument which is all this is just because join i such anyway is herein he final form of the argument its can to go from he knew nothing about the hunter's business dealings and hunter did nothing long and never to thing's money to sure hunter did something wrong took thing's money but he he was not involved in the business to well he was involved in the business and know what was going on on a general level but he is an amazing father and that is where johnathan layers is going o right for it here on theirs an beak as far as hunter biding goes there is no doubt having know it is pretty clear even those close dividing family suggest the sone of his behavior is pretty unseemly but does not make it illegal and it also means we do not know the role at all then vice president bison may have played and it seems no hi have not proved that he had ant my i that the haventprove that he profited from this at all yet maybe he is guilty of turning a blind eye to some of his sons a behavior we should put this in contact this is a time when bob in the presence other son was ill of then dying and then and than passed away a perhaps he was who not is attentive to what he should have been here the carter's es that a this of o the ta a sort of very trot n get time for the bi daily an we know o important family yes a to the presenter e of job ben in to on o on tin beans time be truly a on my tea probably answers moll he loves his family which is why he is a corrupt elderly gens taking cash from his crack son his crack snorting son who ships prostitutes on the regular has he loves his family guys that is come be to i i do love jonathan amir's argument right there whishes unseemly does not mean legal meanwhile over here dona trump does non seem that is certainly illegal can you in thekri'm know but it is very unseemly which means it is he legal the double standard here is perfectly obvious to every one perfectly clear at this point this is why i gain i think a lot of republicans are are wish casting here because we feel i think correctly that the double standard of justice must be vitiated that i must be stopped most america will feel the we we get ti a general and independence will say this fact this cannot happen this in justice will not stand i do not know the town indepenninctrgnary act i the independence majjosreeact by saying o ka well ism hearing lot allegations about tromp and i remember that my and i do not that git that much the first time and nobody's tong mot widen s iron folks and on tromp on ow trump that much a nu no order for dona trump to win the election turn out for jobidon has to be low it cannot be even remotely hot that is just the reality and again i i recommend that republicans tried to get out of o their own heads a little bet and think about what independence might interested in h general election and and again it would be very satisfy i will admit that the deny anal of of trump season ate here would be utterly fascinating if he gets the nomination i have serious doubts is to whether the man can when a general election well he is under four simultaneous indictments just on a practical level even if i think those indictments our politically motivated and spurious in many of those cases already time for a couple of things gemstone things i hate here couple of things that i hate it'll get thing that i hate number one ism limo great heroine of the r public because she is a fat lady she she is every one is very high on limo in the mainstream media because a she is proudly very very very large and

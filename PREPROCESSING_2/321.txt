welcome to the superman latponcans s to since science pas to for if recently the hubermalabhosted a live event at the chico theater in chico illinois the event consisted of lecture entitle the brainbody contract followed by question in answer session we wanted to make sure that the question and answer session was available to everybody regardless of who could attend in person i also want to make sure to thank the sponsors of that event which were g one and eight sleep eight sleep make smartmattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity one of the key things to getting a great night sleep is to make sure that the temperature of your sleeping environment is correct and that is because in order to fall in stay deeply asleep your body temperature actually has to drop by about one to three degrees and in order to wake up feeling refreshed and energized your body temperature actually has to increase by about one to three degrees with eight sleep you can programmed the temperature of your sleeping environment in the beginning middle and end of your night it has a number of other features tracking the amount of rapid i movement an slowwave sleep that you get things are essential to really dining in the perfect night sleep for you have been sleeping on an eightsleep mattress cover for well over two years now and it has greatly improved my sleep by fall asleep far more quickly i wake up far less often in themiddle of the night and i wake up feeling far more refresh than i ever did prior to using in eight sleep mattress cover if you to try eight sleep you can go to eight sleep doc calm slash superman to save one hundred fifty dollars off their pod three cover eight sleep vernally ships to the u sea candida you k select countries in the u and australia again that is eight sleep dock calm slash supermen g one is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking a g one since two thousand an twelve some delighted that they sponsor the live event the reason i started taking a g one and the reason i still drink g one once or twice a day is that it provides all of my foundational nutritional needs that is it provides insurance that i get the proper amounts of those bitumen's minerals robotics and fiver to insure optimal mental health physical health and performance if you to try a g one you can go to drink g one dock calm slash superman to claim a special offer there giving away five are travel packs plus a your supply of vitamin d three k two again that is drink g one dot am slash superman to claim that special offer and now without further ado the question in answer session from our live event at the chico theater in chico illinois i turn seventy senoras youngest advice to keep my brain healthy in and a terrific question the advice i would give to you as somebody about to reach seventy is the same advice i give to anybody which is that essentially all of the things that improve party of vascular health and profusion of our bodily tissues are going to improve functionality of the brain a because of course the brain as a a a rich consumer of fuel requires very good portals to deliver those fuels and that caller's microcapalaries and arteries and forth need to be cleaning clear that is the big one this is why i think the prescription now is that is generally accepted and here on borrowing from my friend peter aria but about a hundred fifty you may be as much as two hundred minutes of called on to cardie per week movement that you can just early carry out a conversation am it is going to be very useful one thing that is often not disgusted that load bearing exercise of some sort is going o be better provided your body can tolerate it but you should do something that am you can do consistently over those long durations a without injuring yourself but there is a very interesting literature about how load bearing movements actually generate the release of hormones yes hormones from bone that actually cross the blood brain barrier and may influence health of anurans in brainareas such as the hippocampus and there ism of extending from preclinical data in animals to humans but there is some humandata starting to emerge at that is true it is also true and there is a wonderful paper out ism just today or yesterday from doctorandy gallons lab and collaborators talking about how a if you look at cognitive health it is highly correlated with things that relate to strength and that is not o say that you should just do strength training exercise but we know that all people truly all people should be doing some sort of resistance training to or three times per week and we know that grip strength and increasing a symmetry in grip strength between the the two hands is one of the indicators of deficits in control from the brain out to the beriberi and it is correlated with cognac decline it all a some interesting data about how when or the feet become floppy and kind of flaccid or the lack of ability to extend one's toes ism still work been wearing this toastspreader thing as i don't try those those hurt hurt i broke this foot a bunch of times but it'll tell you when you get better spreading your toes it is really exciting and it is really exciting for several reasons it is really exciting cause here is more stability in your feet you can run and move and do things better without pain but in addition to that believe it ore not just as one of the first things thatheregoin to do when you come into this world as scraped the bottom of your foot and look for the bobinski reflects which is a nerd transmission a reflects all reflects are am but it is testing that the secure the health of the nervous system that over time you no again the many coronets of dementia many many corsets of dementia but it an inability to finely control the extremities is certainly one of them a strength training cart ofaskar training these are kind of am stereotyped answers for for your question and yet those are really the prime movers against cardiovascular an thrive vascular disease and then of course am there is you know id be remiss if i did throw in something that was a lit more edgy cause that is what i do that they're our interesting data about the use of drugs to increase a seat of coming transmission right i mean i was visiting a noble prize winter at colombia to learn about his incredible work ah some years ago and saw that he could no fewer than five pieces of nikorett gum something i do not recommend during this short meeting and i said what is this all about he said well i do not smoke any more vice i do not want lung cancer but he said nicotine is i a protective against parkansas and alsehimers how can that be and he said well it decreases in neurmodulation dopamine a sit o coin correlated with cognac decline keep your brain sharp and on and forth ism not encouraging people to take nicotine it increases blood pressure they a constriction u but it is an interesting consideration some of the emerging colonergic and dopaminergic drugs e ways to increase a see coming and dope in our certainly intriguing and i will not tell you who that person is but his name is richer axe next question ya how can i optic my sleep while working twenty four hour shifts as a fire fighter twenty four hours on forty eight hours off o k and this probably also pertains to new parents and it probably also pertains to any one that is going through a particular particularly stressful time where your micro waking throughout the night said noxious fire fighters what do we know we know based on really good data that shift work is bad for us is just bad were we are a diurnal species we are not nocturnal but thank you thank you thank you shift workers because you essentially keep us all safe and make the world go round and and we need you and we want you healthy one of the main things is that you can make sure tat you stay on the same sleep wakescatcha will schedulscuse me for at least two weeks it is the swing shift that is really the worst ah you can tell your boss i said that and if they will not agree and you are doing this twenty four hour on twenty four hour off their couple of things that are really important first of all the main way to wake up your nervous system even though it might not feel a tripleosspresso is going to be that light exposure to the eyes and if you cannot get it from sunlight is going to be from any bright artificial light ism not a huge proponent of the daylight simulators the very expensive you can simply buy nine under lucks el d far more inexpensively i not have any relationship to any company that that sells these but you can find them on amazon o wherever you you happen to prefer to purchase things or you can just get really close to a bright light any time you are trying to wake up even if you do not feel that it helps you wake up very much mostly for the melatonin suppression cause bright light will very acutely suppress melatonin and then the real question from shift workers always seems to be should i catch up on sleep or is that going to be problematicshi just stay up in the next cycle and the answer there is a little bit nuance but the best answer i can give across the board is if this is a pattern that you are going to be in regularly over say months or years then get whatever sleep you can get whatever sleep you can if it is something that your doing somewhat acutely your traveling to rope and your scan a force yourself to stay up a day and a half then u in in that case i would say no need to to get the maximum sleep just try and stay with the local schadual we have an entire episode about shift work that somehow maybe did not get as much recognition as it should have for shift workers and will try and get it out in better form we do not always succeed and you no a top carting things in a way that gets them out to the most people a one thing i will say is an opportunity to announce that our website human lowest comas completely revamp it is highly reachable will take you to exact times stamps and is and now you can segregate you time stamps from news letters from all the stuffs to thanks to a lot of effort by my amazing team you can now navigate that site with with real precision s if you wants a eighty eh to add role kids yes no for instance it will take you to precise time stamps that will address those issues next question please how does hypnosis there a pe work well thesis a a very interesting topic to me because my colleague associate chair of psychiatry at stamford avid speak is he world expert in hypnosis and its nerd underpinnings and its use for clinical applications am his father was a hyphypnotists also a psychiatric and when people here hypnotism they think of stageihypnotism and being up on stage doing things you do not want to in front of other people but really it is when which i got clinical applications or well miss applications of hypnosis were time it self directed hypnosis i really wish there's a better name because i do not think hypnosis is going to advance very far as a field frankly because everyone thinks hypnosis and it is it would be if psychedelics were just called drugs rig we were tat and the eighties that drugs are bad and that your brain on drugs looks an omelet and that is bad and if you omelets there still bad and drugs drugs of abuse are bad and nasally i hope we can talk briefly about psychedelics at some point because i do think there is a little bit of a run away train around the topic of psychedelics now i think we need to be very careful how a we approach that entire landscape but hypnosis i potentially works by allowing some one to place their own brain into this very unique state earlier we are time about hero plasticity and we talked about the fact that neural plasticity involve intense focus followed by deep rest in the form of deep sleep or non sleep deep rest may be en recgrubening it and colic laying there hypnosis is different because hypnosis is in a state in which you are focus is very narrow the context is very narrow but you are very very relaxed maybe the rube example of being brain active an body very still is a bit more hypnosis to be fair why would it be the case that davidspeagle and his dad have literally a tool that is approved by the psychiatric associate my major medical psychiatric association where they can thinner out how hypnotizable you are by having you look up and try and close your eyelids while continuing to look up the called special iron test sounds pretty wacky right this is tiptoe level wacky well the reason is you have cranial nerves sit for less near your neck that allow you to direct your focus your eyes upward and then you have cranial nerves that have your eyes go down and the ones that the cranial nerves that drive your eyes up are associate with alertness and eyes open no surprise and the cranial nerves there associated with pointing your eyes down and closing your eyelids are associated with what with drowsing is sleep and lack of alertness there is of a pushball in the autonomic nervous system and speak eagles day and him figured out cause their geniuses that if somebody can maintain upward gaze while closing their eyelids two things happen one you will see the whites of their eyes as free creepy too that means their highly hypnotizable because that is a reflection of the probability that they can enter a brain state in which they are both very awake and very relaxed precool now if that sounds con a wacky cause you are just looking at the periphery keep in mind that one of the primary entry points for diagnosing concussion is to shine a light in one eye and have that pupil construct and then see whether not the other pupil constricts the can consensual pupil lady reflex although technically n have been bothered by this from day one it should be called the nonconsentual pupil reflex cause the other eye does not have a choice if everything's working in any case if you have a hard hit to the head you will see that you shine light in one eye pupil constricts in the other one stays really dilate in the go can get this person the emergency from because there is been a severing of the connections between the two sides of the brains looking in the eyes and trying to deduce what might be happening more essentially within the caverns of the skull and the brain is not a new thing it is a primary diagnostic tool in neurology it is also a your parents an know tat you were taken drugs when you came in the door case your pupils were that big and that reflects a difference autonomic arousal in basically stimulants is feel dilate their pupils is also why the story about belladonna people intentionally dilating their pupils to trick people into thinking that they were attracted to them thought about this one a lot too spoke not a precursor a good relationship sake some ones using their physiology to pretend that there attract is the other person thinks that they're attracts that they might become attracted anyway it is a recipe for failure almost as bad as most of the dating as hi would know ism not on but from what i hear o k where were we hypnosis when you are in a state of elevated attention but very relaxed guess what nerd plasticity a curs much faster because your centrally marrying the two states that are normally divorced which are lighten levels of attention first and then deep rased your essentially putting the nervous system into a more i wouldn't call it hyper plastic take but a more plastic state and for people the are highly hypnotizable the successorates at for instance smoking cessation pain relief are pretty impressive a speak lab has published a number of these i think self hypnosis is is a very interesting tool i just hope that they rename it that it a stands a chance of getting off the ground me one of the things that you learn as a public facing educator is that what things are called has a great impact on whether or not they achieve any kind of u use in the world anise why i decided to a swallow the the difficult pill of a partially renaming yoganedra as non sleep deep breast i do not to do that yoganedra has more than a thousand your history but it is when people hear yoganedra unless they are very open minded they hear magic carpet they hear levitation and it is unfortunate d that is not how i feel but for years i talked about yoganedrits cool it is sleep status is a ye yoganedra o k and ut if you come from a culture where that is disgust they're all about it and nonslip deep rest i felt aright leave my name out of it it'll be dead eventually man i in this line of advisors rectum approaching fifty lieyomo ism winning in my my lineage but should i be fortunate enough to live past bullet cancer or carcass far enough then and nasty are hopefully will persist in i do not need a piece of it is just the hope is that people will learn to put themselves in to reinstates that can be adapted for them be nice if something some one could come with something other than hypnoses ass i think eagle would agree suprincist in psychedelics as medicine to be done with somebody with experience worried about unlocking mental health conditions ye you should be ah what does the research say and what are your thoughts o k barbed wire question we that psychedelics whale us just back up a little bit and acknowledge one thing that is more important than psychedelics or any thing else when it comes to rewiring the brain which is that ultimately rewiring of the brain is about shifts in neromodulators de coming serotonin epinefronoripaneferonaseto calling and it is no coincidence that y o escessorise selective ceratonand retaken visitors have been one of the major entry points for attempts to treat things depression over the last twenty thirty years or more a when i was in college there was that is when the book listening to rosette came out put prior to that there is a long history of drugs prescription drugs in that case to change levels of nauromadulators ceratonan or cidocolin or dopamine in an attempt to cure or treat a disease but keep in mind despite the varied success of essessorise a topical to itself that there is a strong belief and there has been for a long time that if essessorize worked it was not because the depressed brain is deficient in ceratonan but rather because increasing ceratonan offer the opportunity to increase nauru plasticity ran is a different way of thinking about it and that is a seaway for saying that when you say psychedelics that a broad category of drugs nowadays people even lump examine into that although technical its not a psychedelic but that is a classic if you will psychedelics are plenty lecirgacasidiath my and sylisiban it a mushrooms although comes another source s as well a the major effect of cylisibon is to stimulate a particular craton receptor which has elevated density in particular brain areas and indeed there are many recent clinical trials many let us to say a a say twelve to twenty good size clinical trials done it in diverse locations on the planet many at john's hoping and you seems some in switzerland showing that enhancing and hear your no amusing the mechanistic language enhancing the transmission of the release of serotonin an activating particularceratonan receptors leads to an opportunity for more what nauru plasticity now i say it that way not to adabunch of words to but because the real question is whether not the experience that one has while under the influence of psychedelics is critical to the clinical outcome er a growing idea just as a hypothesis i think is equally interesting is that it is the serotonin itself and that the things you see the things you hear the things you experience are not relevant now a i have some experience with psychedelics i ad a bad time on psychedelics as a teen draws also pretty wayward youth but i have had a bad trip on elite i for years i was scared the people r an a dose me with celeste after that it was bad am i think across the word we can say kids doing psychedelics u seems a bad idea there it brains are already hyperoplastic if you have a predisposition to by poler type issues or skisaphrenia it can exacerbate those issues and certainly certainly certainly if you do not have adequate support in the form of somebody that can guide you through the sessions as well as the precessions which are not done with psychedelics as well as the called integration afterwards it can be at really slip very slope i know examples of people really suffering in the aftermath of psychedelic journeys now there few interesting points as well and it would not be fair i did not say that several if not many individuals who have had called treatment resistant depression at least in these clinical trials have reported feeling far better after silseiben therapy but that scylisibontherapy was done with several precessions then the psychedelic sessions than after sessions and it is not always the case that things turn out well i think it is early days what is interesting and i think important is to recognize that sylisibon the and the structure of sylisibon is very similar to serotonin itself very similar but it activates particular receptors lot of people do not realize how similar to serotonin it is and that microdosing syliseiban i should say the date on microdosing syliseiban something that is in bracingly popular is not particularly a compelling it is not clear what it does it is not clear if it is of at anon any use and i think the danger here is that we end up in a situation as we did with frankly with anabas and by the way ism not somebody who demonizes anabas i think it has its uses for certain people but very high c concentration anabas can be a problem e specially with people to have a predisposition of psychosis and any one that tells you that anabas is intaddictive just say great do not smokeueed for a week but see how you do ye and let us go on a plane trip together t and how are you sleeping and y i think the chronic anabasis users are starting to take note of some of the issues it causes but again there are some some clinical applications now when it comes to the sort of the the u high speed train psychedelics d m t an that that is far fewer far less data available there and then media may assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of p t it there the date i think are more robust i think we are likely to see legalization oratlystcrem d criminalization in the next few years but keep in mind that media ma is methylene doxy met an edema for people that dopominergic states it is a particularly compelling a state to be in much that they could over indulge in m i a ma and then there is the issues of purity and i could do a five hour podcast on the write now i think the important point is approach with caution kids absolutely not and i think it is an exciting landscape very exciting and whereas a discussion the one we just had would would have got me fired a few years ago i mean stamphrodas big programs now lot of philanthropy federal grants and many laboratories a focus on the study of psychedelics now i would say stay tuned am but keep in mind that neuroma increasing nuromagulator levels very acutely whether not it is with a prescription drug or whether not it is with psychedelics is really what lies at the heart of the recovery the potential recovery would say or the negative effects that happen to occur in ah anyone that that embarks on the sycadelic journey do people who meditate me less sleep than people who do not oh that is interesting well we know that from a study by wendysazuki who i believe if and why you made the right choice and i think they did is now the deanovarts and sciences at and we you you ran a memory lab for a long time she is she has date showing am that even ten i think it is thirteen but as little as ten minutes of meditation to be sitting still breathing focussing on your breathing directing one's attention to third e center et camera we do not have a third my the panels out to be the third eye but am i don't know why you say it is a light sensitive tissue deep in the brain but may that's what they call the third i but in any case that type of practice has been shown to increase memory focus are learning ah but there is some interesting footnotes in those papers ah which point to the fact that when people meditate too close to bedtime oftentimes they have trouble sleeping because basely meditation is a focussing exercise it is it is a perceptual exercise i only a meditation as anything mystical it is a it is a self directed shift in your perception to what to your interception to your internal state as appose anything beyond the confines to your skin there is nothing mystical about that and then in that state your brain starts to generate patterns of activity that are distinct from when your sharing your attention between what is going on in eternally and what is going out what is happening out in the world right i think we need to de mystify what people have cloaked as mystical and hen i say cloaked i do not think that the people at the meditate for thousands of years e thought that there was anything ah mystical about it but sometimes what we experience there can feel mystical if you have trouble sleeping i recommend doing some sort of deep some sort of nonslip deep reuse practice nest are yo are yoganedra although those are different enemy are generally lacks the ah the intention peace a an the once that i put in the world we have stripped away the intentions and we have stripped away any kind of language that would make you think that am there was a some sort of am it's to say cultural aspect to it which again is is unis admittedly a bit unfair to the origin practice of yoganedra but the prom again is that in yo gander your con be doing intentions an hearing language that for some people not all might divorce you from the the the the wish to to do it in any case am nonslip see best on any time of day but a spushiyo falls sleep in the middle of the night is going to be useful for helping you fall back asleep ore as meditation again as going i enhance your level of focus i do not think it is am a good practice if your if you have trouble sleeping now to finally answer question if you meditate in you afford to sleep less a my friend jaywalker would say now however many of us cannot sleep as much as we want to and many of us are not mat where we can wake up without an alarm clock it'll just keep sleeping in sleeping unless i went to bed t eight o'clock this is actually interesting an there is an a symmetry to your sleep needs if you go to bed member that old adage your every hour before midnight is worth too after well turns out that for people that are meant to be early risers going to bed at eight you will wake up at three or four feeling great you go to bed at eleven you feel grog and their good reasons to explain that but mat would say that you need your sleep period ism more of the camp based on my read of the data and yes we are allowed to disagree and still be friends it is a loud the in fact mat's going to do a series on sleep with our podcast eventhough he has a trifid outcasts of his own o where we maybe debatealobi to this that there are ways that you can at least replace the feeling of wakefulness that you would have lost if you do not sleep enough and for me really that is why nasty are became such a an attractive tool to do for ten or thirty minutes each morning if i did not sleep enough the night before a mi first learn about yoganedra actually at a diction recovery center drama a recovery center and florid in twenty seventeen have a friend a supertalented drama therapist who is also treats a diction that am have sent many many people to and he has this kind of seeming we do not wizard ability to am get people we are been attics to nopyattics and am one of the tools he uses is ayoganedra every morning for thirty minutes in eventually an hour which seems a lot but then yo also has the people wake up very early maybe an hour before they would normally wake up and going to that liminal state between sleep in wakefulness now my experiences that ten to twenty minutes of nasty a yoganedra is sufficient to offset a some sleep lost and allow my speed a function o many people report the same we have a study going with the sleep laboratory at stamper to explore this in more depth an a what i can tell you because ism involved in some of this work is that the are several military units because they have no opportunity to get sleep because their working that have to rely on tools this in order to be able to function at their highest level and ism sure they will tell you as i will that they prefer to get eight to ten hours of sleep but guess what they cannot and i think that is an important take away is that we do not get to pick how much we sleep unless you can be completely erratic about your sleep hyphen which makes you kind of the less interesting person in life is what ism told a o going to bed at eight is great somber most of the time be got a stay up every once in a while i mean after they release chimp fire on nauplius i discovered that enemy are is a very valuable tool because and by the way him vampire and and succession have a lot of parallels and if you watch one up if i served i interleave him empire succession jimpempire succaiong you search to realize woe work pretty similar and then you look at the world differently i promise your podcast has positively changed the lives of many people including me how has it changed your life bouquet was not expecting that one thank you seventh well first of all i mean as this little eleven year old told me i mean this is is is essentially i would have done my whole life ism a fairly private person believe a not on pretty interested gamelan time alone and i think that is required for me to i be say of hormones hormones one ism either readying myself through sleep and amnesty are to you one of the other three modes it it is a fifth mode ism ore cumin one of these other three modes which are is ism either forging for information organizing that information are dispersing that information or getting ready to do it all over again a and then there this relaxation vacation thing that they keep telling me about but then i went to italy and then my rick and i i hung out there and and it it did not feel work i also discovered some really great podcast don't i think one of the coolest podcast out there if you rocking role which i love is a history of five hundred songs by under hicks podcast on rock roll i the nerdy pockets like a graduate or an education an rock role it is cool and you'll earn a lot about music an history in the mobs involved and all that stuff in from what i was told alcoponies to sit there write his egg it was there weird right glia and the ache diasypholis and i do not ki feel about all that but they told me that i think the podcast has been wonderful as an opportunity to share things that i love if i had my way would be more this although more of a dialogue frankly ah it is changed my understanding of and what what the world is i i i i certainly get critique and that is good but again i was raised by iconoclasm in particular my nostoc advise or beenbarrass who unfortunately vive when i mention is dead cause i worked for him and ah but he was really encouraged all of us in his lab and and a and often we were very close friends i spent the last year of his life recording interview with him there isichelly documentary coming out about ben and then ism going to release the audio a interviews with ben which he approved by the way and you will get to realize that the history of what you see is often not what the dead person really did or said it is going to be fun i cannot wait to the release best documentary and then ben gets to have his voice ah infuse it and doll be cool document entry but as a some of t what appears to be in what was in the historical merits is not necessarily what it what really happen but that is just life i i suppose the short answer is that i feel very honored withe opportunity very very honored and it is a challenge at times i suppose that the major challenges are when things are taken out of context little clips and things that sort being misunderstood does not feel good but luck at the end of the day i feel the luckiest person in the world a because i get to spend my time learning it is either you know forging am organizing rim dispersing information that i also want and that i find it incredibly useful if or if not that and a certainly informative and at times enchanting as well i trying focus on the positive and i have a number practices that help me a do that u and i am somebody who engages on social media ism not a posting ghost con offers and i i i want o understand i think that the cuttlefish a superinteresting but human beings are superinteresting to and i have a i a strong drive for for mastery but also i i do have a strong sense of of justice and that can be problematic at times i find justice as feeling there is something for us to do about something li being something upsets us or the excites us is great but then if you have a strong sense of justice you e lie there somethingyou need to do about it and not everybody feels that and then of course a desire to understand and i think ah for reasons very personal to me that relate mostliageis having a kind of incredible array of experiences in life many of which were u shocking disturbing exciting enchanting that i wont understand and no it is changed things but you notes i know i got one truck when watch i you knowitso not to say that i do not care about having things i there few things i really love but mostly ism just thinking about the outcasts we got a record on money which is about will power and tenacity and if i do not stop myself it'll give at right now what do you feel is the next big thing to come to the forefront in the healthspace thanks for this question one ah is non proven to me acids i i love these debates on line because i know that there is something there it is cool cause i grew up and seen these debates and there is something interesting there because people are debating about it but the debate is not what is interesting it is almost always the thing that people are not talking about that sure to surface at some point and you will right now there is a obsession seed oils i seed oil seed oils and i i cannot deemed i see toils all the day to say that if you separate out their colonic load there is not thing andaherently bad about seedily and it said i do not know it is still in emerging literature but there was a scientist it stamford at rubenstein who a passedaway of at a right old age a brilliant scientists who am talked about and i had all discussions with when i was a post about non protinominoacids turns out his son is anear scientist at you we as other sons a physician you see as said another on these low performing families and all wonderful people and end had data that unlike a lot of animals birds there are certain to monoacid which are non proving monoacid that exist in fairly identity an seeds and not which is not to say that seeds and nuts are bad i ad omens this evening gelid please but non proving monoacid are similar enough to mammalian proline aminoacids that if they are consumed in abundance and perhaps especially in liquid form that they may again may cause it is about the future this is about what we know this is about where i think there is an interest in growing interest they may be able to incorporate into certain prolines of our tissues of our body that potentially thought could lead to infolding of those prolines and may explain certain forms of narrodegeneration another hero cognitive a challenges ism i think nonprotein minoacds are going to be an important discussion now their lots of non proving monoacid that are not that do not come from foods but i think the discussion around nonprotinominoacids from foods is going to be very interesting ah that is one area the other area d perhaps you picked up on the slut to night is that i the nuts an bolts stuff around stars nor a plasticity but the high level stuff i think the relationship between ah structure thought abstract thought ism not interested in the free will discussion i feel that is a career under ism friends with robots of policy and he is got great book coming out about this ism called determined ye nosy does nonbeliever in free will but he is far smarter than i ever could be and it just feels he i do not know that there's an end point with that one am but if anyone could find it wodge be robot am he is so smart a but i think that the hirer level stuff a creativity abstract reasoning in thought defining and and better understanding the different states that we can go into in waking and and i confess without a hint of of sheepishness about it that i also think the the notion of of spirituality and the belief in things that are beyond are current in conscious on understanding is superinteresting i think that as as a species we are a we have been challenging conflicted from go at least that is with the historical scripture tells us m and that it sort of inherent to our experience that life is challenging and perplexing and and also wonderful and i think a better understanding of of how to navigate all that i mean the the stuff in our skulls except for the eyes which by the way to pieces of brandtat are not in your skull the retinas have to pointed out it is it is tricky and we are trying to use that very tissue to understand it and ism intrigued by the possibility that there are certain aspects of self that i maybe are not intended to be explored because they are not really of us right brains interacting with one another is an interesting area certainly for scientific exploration but ism ism fascinated by n and an excited about the possibility that it some point our species will both understand the mechanics of or emotions mechanics of our thought process creativity and on but that we will also allow room for the for the stuff that we cannot explain with science and to allow room for that in our in our life experience because i also believe that can be powerful and well understanding things in great detail and putting mechanism and utility around that and applying that is wonderful it is the it is the stuff of my life which is obvious ah i also think that there is great value in i not trying to control and understand everything and enjoying the the the mystery of things that are that are clearly a greater than us how do you balance having fun with having such a rich knowledge and passion in negro science and optimization fun people ask me what you do for fun i think people think i do all the protocols sure i get my sunlight i drink my water i do them but a fun i learning hi learning i i do enjoy physical movement i learning for me that o case for me it is the little things i do not know maybe ism weird certainly been told that the other day there is a frog in my swimming pool e just seeing there and and i just spend some time look in atom back and forth and and then i had all sorts of ideas about what is he doing and what is he thinking and then i thinking how liver sacks used to spend time imagining e experience experiencing life has a bat through only echo location he talked about this and i thought and why would he do that rat is that and that is con acute is delightful old man i yet at six hundred pound freewaight squat when the stake californium squatting chamber a ben also pretend he was a bat its a weird do id mayhem pet means raised motor cycles hung out with move stars but then also was a recluse and rocks oh get that is a weird scientist been around a lot of those but in discussions with people that knew him i mean that that exercise of and seeing something he thought was cool a bat allowed him to also use theory of mind kin think what would it be to have locked in indium and only be able to blink your eyes to communicate and and gave him an incredible compassion and sensitivity for other people that then he transmuted into the form of these wonderful books for me fun is really about doing the things that i do systematically each day but then when something excites me i know that feeling i know it physically in my body and to just follow that trail a weirdo right a weirdo just arrest was a weird and barber chapman was weir and i think everybody's a little weird if you allow yourself to see the things that you think are really cool and the bunch of things that i think are really cool that enchant me that a bunch of other people love too and i know that cause it i see we are all watching that video or something that but i think for me fun is is in the the practice of trying to stay open to the the little things the littlethings that kids say are always delightful cause there not filtering throughall the bolshie that we filter course our life experience through but also just the i reading and learning exercising i mean i to think ism not a very would in person but at the same time i mean i did not see the barb must now no disrespect to barb i i innit i go to mavis i do that kind of thing on what what else is do at some point you know what else is there to do anyway i mean i delight in in certain things a as that you now know far too much about but fun is a relative term that is a hard question thanks for the pass do you believe time changes due to daylight saving's time is worth a potential loss of productivity daylight saving times anti health get this is where it'll get it is just s just dumb it is just due it it is just dumb it is it makes no sense i mean the the director of the chronobiology unit at the national institutes of mental health milk good friend long time friend and brilliant scientist camera hater we will tell you it is a stupid idea it is anti biology and it increased carcasses inure he's hard attacks increase depression it is just it kids do not to wake up early anyway parents to wake up early special a kids as don't wake up early it makes no sent and then there is all these arguments about is it really about trying to truncate the the the late you now you want more light in the evening there is less crime that is wholly unsubstantiated lit is completely in substantiate the daylight saving thing is just stupid basically trying get as much light in your eyes i deal from sunlight sunlight early in the day and by the way if you are worried about cataract that is a serious concern after all i have an appointment out theology cataract macula degeneration be guess what the chair of opthemology it from stamped wink him on the podcast verify this when the sun is low in the sky you are not really at risk of that rights when the sun is overhead insight you beaming our eyes any yet yet it is a problem but where time out viewing low solar angle sunlight in the morning and in the evening and if there is clouds do it anyway in fact do it longer and if you cannot do that look at some artificial light inside daylight savings is is just it is just cupid youknow what happens here is as the night goes on the amount a gabon my brain starts a diminish and i just can go to short for m we have thought about podcasting in the mill the night that is why when o on on leas podcast recently the more recent one he did it at eight o'clock at night and he cry he made me cry he did not cry he made me cry o tired and i cannot think and they ask me on my dog and ism time at the dog his goal was to get me to cry we have this friendship y he is delightful what should i as a nineteen year old college student be doing to maximize the years of hero plasticity i have left i get this question on o man such a question rest i do not ism assuming ye no you are refer what you are do but you are nineteen the cool thing as your brain is hyper plastic life as a psychedelic experience without psychrodalics gosh be land say if you could go back to your nineteen year old self what would you do and that is a tricky one there movies about that right i would deafly the worry last ye i would worry less i would have more fun i would i would certainly lust i start latching on to practice is and the understanding of science as a way for me was kindling my world felt very unstable and for me brought stability but you want o avoid rigidity do you want to be the one nineteen year old his o a got to get to sleep you now go to go back to at at it thirty at night night i enjoy life but i would a when your nineteen learn how you learn learn how to focus learn how to rest basic u can stress and focus as much as you want as longs you can still fall asleep at night and sleep well and fall back to sleep if you wake up you know we hear stresses bad stresses goods tresses addresses us just as bad unless you regretting enough sleep in which case stress is called learning in life now i we we do not to anything dangerous avoid psychological and physical danger but i thing is a nineteen year old i mean might direct advice would be have some captive vascular activity you have some resistance training activity you develop some sort of self awareness practice journalling could be meditation surround yourself with people that you of did people you do not u i mean it sound straight forward but then we can all look into our personal historic what i spent all this time trying resolve this thing that likely you did not them it is simple a you did not em they weren't into cuttlefish or ferrets you did not em was your kind f person right and that is not a box you can check on the dating as they tell me right the ferret thing i the be very very small sup set of people i think the know thyself thing is huge learnt learn to tap in to that early feeling of this feels right this does not feel right learn to be a bit of a of a rudder for yourself and an journal i still have stacks of things that i wrote cross the years most of it is terrible but you will find if you go back that you kind an knew better all along even if you did not do better all long that voice in your head do not do that do that his persons everyone else is crazy about this person but not me but this is i i dontwant a sound sentimental but yet to yet to yet to find your heart right or at least not lose it you have to make sure that you are in touch with that piece of yourself that wasn't judging and just felt good and as lose is not something it self destructive i think that is the most important thing and then yet have tools and practices and place because they work and whenyou are nineteen and your curl nor plasticity is through the roof you you can do a lot less and get a lot more but do not worry about hitting twenty five and it all being over ism certainly that is not the case but you can cram in a lot early on is i still regret not learning an instrument the date on people that learn an instrument even later in life but certainly at nineteen is that it greatly increases your ability o learn all sorts of things learn an instrument how can we transform the america education system to be more effective oh in ten seconds when in charge just tho a lit shall back i did in interview with at with a major media outlet and they were very gracious and and then they said what is next and was iron a run for was living the i was sort of ai look it is not out of the question but but frankly i think that u ism poorly suited for that it is obvious ism poorly suited for that it was not a joke but it was you n i think as a i spend some time afterwards a if you really go talk to people who do that for living and and but i am very interested in i potentially informing policy if i were ever be asked it'd certainly u respond and and my stance on this is much in the same even as the podcastpis keep in mind the podcast slap suggested i start one but it was really during the the those days of the the deep twenty twenty twenty twenty one pandemic where a but by the way i i was not allowed to talk about valine i did not and also i do not have any expertise in it i was not a well suited to do it but i also decided it is a topic enough people are talking about my response in life and in general when people say what about something as i what a lot of opinions about that but this is in the venrrok but during the pandemic i realize it was a lot of circadian disruption anxiety stress much of thing's happening with visual systems and biological systems that i felt there were tools that that people could a perhaps benefit from u i just tart to putting that information into the world and i was really surprise really surprise that people that i knew from the nerroscin's community for instance at and i am h or a in government positions were not talking about this stuff i just kept doing it and i think that it made clear to me that the education system is not one thing it is it is tough special en talking about kids what to do is a tricky thing but that the education system in my mind should at least involve some sort of discussion early on about this thing call the brain this thing call the body how they work how you can do certain things to a modulate your stress level your sleep the importance of not just importance of sleep and nutrition and avoiding social isolation and in all these import things but giving people some levers and nobs to to maneuver within themselves and zero cost tools as a way to do that that u transcend soda o economic boundaries i really entrance and language as well because you were not to tried out the united states and of course within the united states there many different a culture speaking different languages but a and maybe a i will soon allow us to put out the podcast into much yo different languages i think it will i think that the education system should start in my opinion with it with teaching kids how to understand themselves what to do in difficult scenarios that is really anchored in in the real pillars of biology and an psychology and trying to take some of the mystery out of try to navigate that the tough business of growing up a i mean if you think it is tough being an adult which it can be certainly it is really tough growing up as we all know and i think that more tools more tools more protocols more tools more tools more protocols retools but that is obviously a bus a bast opinion and no one's ever asked me ha u watch we be teaching kids but if they ask you can tell i ism not gong to shut up i think that was our last question thank you all for coming to night i want to forgive me for going long i do want to say i thank you sincere thank you for i make your way out here especially on a week day night thanks forgoer hospitality my incredible team i want to thank them and certainly lapse no at least thank you for your interest in science

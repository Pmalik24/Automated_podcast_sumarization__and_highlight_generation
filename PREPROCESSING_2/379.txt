welcome to the supermen lad guest series where i and an expert gest i us science an science at to ruin i and your supermen and om our professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day's episode is the fifth in a six episode series on fitness exercise and performance and today's episode is all about recovery that is how to maximize your recovery to achieve your fitness and exercise and performance schools and how to avoid overstraining doctor into yapping great to be back to day we are discussing recovery and ism very side to have this discussion because as we know despite the fact that different types of exercise can be used to trigger different types of adaptation such as increased long distance endurance anerobic capacity strength hypertrophy et camera the workouts themselves are not actually when the progress occurs when the adaptation occurs and this to me is extremely interesting because it parallels what we see with circled hero plasticity which is nervous systems ability is change in response to experience we sit down to learn something we experience something and that is the trigger for requiring of the nervous system but the actual requiring occurs away from the experience ore the learning to in fitness and in exercise recovery is where the real results actually emerge where we get better i love for you to explain what recovery really is and the different types of recovery certainly differ ways to enhance recovery and it'd also love for you to explain whether or not their ways that people can become better at recovering because if indeed recovery is when progress emerges when we get better will then anything that supports our recovery and gets us better at recovering ought to increase our rate in our degree of progress absolutely you nailed it in the description what people really want is some sort of change whether you are talking all leaves or general population this change is some sort of improvement and muscle function reduction body fat higher functioning the cabalism whatever the cases and the only way that happens is we talk about the equation of stress causes adaptation but as you alluded to the piece in the middle is only if you can recover from it and the game ore playing here is we all agree want more adaptation that means we need to bring more stress in the system but we then halve to insure that our recovery out paces the stress and put or else will no adaptational for in office what happens as you will actually be a negative spot in start going backwards and what i would love to do is is talk about how we have handled this and have had a decent about of experience here i was fortunate enough to do my masters degree and the laboratory of a gentleman in and fry whose an easy lifetime achievement word winter and he studied in large part recovery overstraining over use overflowed in a lot of areas in addition have been fortune enough to work with individuals from high functioning sea of and executives who have little time for recovery high jobstras to into athletes in it think of the example of pictures and madly basest who have to recover in a matter of forays that they can pitch again at maxim velocity i would love to outline some of the tools and tactics strategies we use for all these individuals give you some foundational stuff and i would love to may be actually cover some things that most people have never heard of some stuffy may not have access to some technologies that we use some bile markers and then even a whole munch of things that are keeping with a thing of your show here comfrey or extremely low cost all those strategies but ought also to do is cover nutrition supplementation and fueling and hydration in things but that is probably going a halve to be saved for an additional conversation that will do in the next episode yes for we will absolutely hold a conversation about nutrition and supplementation where you can educate us about all the top contour stuff all the way down to the fine details i do have a question about recovery and it is one that i think most people are familiar with themselves which is soreness we think of it as muscle soreness but i was trained early on in my scientific career to always question the seemingly obvious couple of questions about soreness first of all what does soreness really reflect is it really muscle soreness it feels its in the muscles a but what other organ systems and tissues in retypes does it involve and then ism particularly interested in this unseat or this experience that many of us including myself had which is delayed onset muscle soreness why would it be that when we are less in shape or when we perform a movement that is extremely novel to us the soreness seems to arrive after a reasonable delay of maybe even a day would find the next day be than fortnight hours later we are exceedingly sore and as we get more fit or more familiar with a movement the soreness seems to arrive earlier i realize the just ask you about three questions or more forget what is muscle soreness at a seller level which sells which organ systems and forth what is it mean if we are sore something i know will get into a ait later another why the delayed onset muscle soreness it is actually one question it is totally find you answered of ye asked all three because i am not actually answer in a er three which lansternom or two which will actually onswernoer one it'd love to tell you that i set it up that way intentionally bui've just happy to hear that where i was unable to be concise you are able to be concise than yet we are still learning a lot about this area it is actually really difficult to perform these studies any time you ask at question about something pain or soreness your immediately talking about perception and there is obis of physical component to that and there is all perception and teasing those things out is extraordinarily challenging that said there has been a lot of work in this area in fact probably ism you may have a show already out on pain or may be once coming down the road we did an episode on pain a a while ago but it is defiling time to revisit that literature i else o have some amazing colleagues at stamford who work on pain both from the a seller molecular side but also from the psychological side about how a a understanding with pain an what we believe about pain shapes the experience of pain and pain relief amazing that is that stuff's incrediling be important and ism a ism glad we flag that in may be will is call that good for nowticand come back later for anyone of enershows the being said what does it happen a twenty eight to forty right hours after you exercise will that actually should give you some clues into what is happening the traditional dogma of delayed on set muscle soreness is what this is called is that it is a result of coin micro stairs in the muscle and you con sort of thing i challenge the muscle there ware some small tars in there and ism feeling the results that well in fact that certainly does happen and it can happen that is not what is explaining your muscle soreness and in fact you can be quite sore from exercise and have no measurable amount of muscle damage and much anything else are in this idea of pain it is not a one to one explanation there are multiple factors that are probably causing your perception of pain muscle damage can be one of them it is not the only one it is probably in my opinion thou the is yet to be shown definitively probably not even the leading cause of it and what is actually happening well the reason is taking you twenty for to forty eight hours is is you canactually i find various papers a literature views stating back in a number of years now go over decade that show these wonderful curves of an infalamitory an immune response and and we do not need to necessarily go through the entire physiology right now but effectively what is happening is those things have a littlabit f a time delay and some of those steps happen immediately li right when the exercises there and the some of them are delayed six to twenty for to fortnight hours if little bit about this a physiology its you have a combination of neutral pills and macrophages in a munch of things happening an this as a time sequin what happens is but a time we get to this twenty eight to forty eight hour window now the musclesoreness kicks which wait a minute if i if this was ha result to my muscles being torn and that happen immediately would not that pain start immediately will answer as it would and that that that is your first clue that that is not responsible for it when we look at the t a man response and we see that that is actually pa twenty forth fortnight hours later and then that is the same time the pancaked and that is calling you i the problem we have this immune response happening and inflammation then all the sudden we start getting fluid accumulation and now there are what are called nosyceptors and your probably very voice your very orbit these are these your pain receptors what is actually interesting as we do not necessarily no a lot of information about how many pain receptors are in muscle they are not really in the belly in fact this is why i can perform my muscle by posies and they do not really hurt you mean in the belly of the muscle correct we do have pressure sensor and if you change the volume of the tissue you will respond to that very very quickly by enhancing swelling in the actual muscle that is immediately putting pressure on those pressure receptors if you will that is the signal what is probably happen here and i just i just hate to give you another bone but a lot of delayed on the muscle soreness is probably just a curl feedbacclup rather than it isn't far muscle damage a miss a lot sense there is a lot of interactions between the a types of neurons that control touch sensation and pain sensation an it sensation invite a lot of people a kind of collapse itch an pain together bingo that something it is painful edit itch is is is a familiar thing for people mosquito bites in such am and of course there is the a classic gat theory of pain a ye which a people will be familiar with and then all explain why ism explaining this am which is if you you something hurts you a you bonk your near stub your toe we tend to grab that body part and trying to rub it and that rubbing is not a coincidental thing it activates a set of a touch sensors theatre that respond to cold of broad dull touch am and that actively inhibits through the release of an his try nor transmitter the fibers that control the painsignal any time we we rub it a charge horse our leg or we or we stub our to and we we wince in then we grab the tone we got squeezing ego bit that is actually deactivating were partially inactivating the the pain mechanism the idea that a a swelling response would then trigger a curl response that the then would recruit the peen receptor response your amusing broad broadbrush am strokes here to explain this makes very good sense to me a now and only now that you have explained how this process works i can actually even add more to that if you remember how muscles work we have to have some sort of signal from the nervous system that has to actually go in and tell the muscle to contract well remember there a few episodes togo we covered the physiology here of what is called a motor unit ay we what i did not explain to are called muscle spindles and we have talked about properaception in an episode o before i s well but we never tie this picturetogether we me walking though that really quickly and it is can ate this slupitan none spoke what happens is a this motor unit is is coming in from what is called an ala motor unit and that is going be enervating your muscle fires and that is gong to tell the muscle fibers to contract those are typically spread out throughout the a all sides of the muscle in interior exterioliver on the outside though there is another type of muscle called a muscle spindle now these are non contractile they do not have that act in an main and they do not produce force they are responsive they are proprouseptive w at that means is they sense stretch and this is why for example if you were to ism stretch a handspring and checking muscle grip it doesn't really matter or muscle it is innate response is to fire back to close that distance and this is what keeps you from save your leaning to the right a you can imagine that the example give is if your our outstanding on one foot and you start swaying to the right i lest say your standing on your right foot an this make this easier for folks you start swaying to the right you going fall on your right ear will hit the ground the inside of your right calf muscle will start being stretched the outside will start being compressed right the stretch on the inside of the right calf muscle will sense that stretch and it will respond by contracting that pulls you back to the middle and stops you from falling that is proprioception and musclespindle send stretch and tell you to contract the way if they work is is through game motor neurons and these are sensory thing wit is happening is unlike when you tell your muscle to contract it goes ala to the muscle contract these muscle spindles work such that it is oh have been stretched send signal back to some central point typically in the spinal cord and we do not actually one able all thus the brain we have got a time delight this is why these are sub conscious autonomic righter resislomatic the gammas can go back to the central location and then come back through the ala motor nor on since till it to contract you have with wonderful mechanism of sensing stretch going back well one theory that been put forward regarding muscle damage is that the pressure's action being applied to the nerve endings of the muscle spindles and that is actually responsible for the pain signal that is going back in coming up to your braining your registering that spain rather than it is actually in the the contractile units the muscle fires the that is a very intriguing idea a because it would suggest that stretching muscles in order to alleviate soreness might be the exact incorrect thing to do ye now not saying that is for for certain ism just building off the mechanistic logic that we have lady out here ye really that you lay d out here there's the more effective principle based on exactly that which is is as we dare not generally wide low level movement is effective at reducing cute shortness because that is no level contraction of the muscle and you are get anti attach and get tissue out and you get fruit out well you are fly moping it out of the the cell yes and in our previous episode where we re talking about programming or using the we but let us be fairer where you were education us including me am in the audience about different structures for programming exercise fir specific adaptations et camera them month weak years get scales et camera we had a brief a discussion about the fact that if one trains legs very hard with resistance training some heavy squatting or dead lifting it we than there is some soreness that oftentimes doing some quote what lighter cardie or am some a low impact work the next day or er any number of different things that involve a not high intensity a contractions the muscles but that do require contractions of the muscles that it can alleviate soreness more quickly than if one were simply lie round and you know watch an affect or something yet that is exactly right the a to go back to cubit as well the if that is really the case the question is where is this inflammatory signal coming from and while there is much to be learned there there is a little bit of information rat out suggest it is potentially coming from free radicals release from the mitcndre again that may or may not hold up as more research come ism not short but if you remember back to our a conversation on endurance we talked about the electron transport chain and a robin metabolism regardless of whether your not your getting energy from glycolysis or care hydrates remember they have to be finished through robin metabolism even if you are lifting weights and you are using cars for your fuel you have got to finish that metabolism by running in into the monochondre and performing orated metabolism as a result of that tatelectorn transport chain runs theoretically if free radicals which is on which our viper react of oxygen species spicily there of oxygen molecules tat are missing electron that they react to a lot of things they are the opposite antioxidants by the ways the oxen on goes with extra proton he can balance the charge if those leak out that end of itself is going to be a mass of inflammatory signal and that is probably what signals the cause of these neutral pills and macrophages and gets off this entire cascade again i i believe we need research there i need to look into a maybe's more definitive than i that i know but that's probably what is happening potentially what is happening rather that cause is that cascade in signal also what you have is his combination of will if that is the case why i i not getting the vendors amount o muscle damage when i do more aerobic based exercise well because you do not have the mechanical mention pulling on the fires that is actually causing damage to the cell wall that allows these free radicals to escape the mite cornea and the cell also that is the best we can postulate at this moment as to why those tings are happening and then why again low level exercise tends to an hands not even things percussion a using either instrument said but a low level of vibration in your leg or pneumatic boots sausage all these things are generally probably helping because their moving that stuff out i deem most specifically pressure comes off of those nerve endings in the muscle spindles an allows you to stop perceiving that signal of pain despite the fact that you did not actually regenerate tissue at all yet fascinating and i think that beautifully frames where were headed next which is to talk about all the different modes of recovery and how to accelerate them and perhaps even how to combine different forms of recovery in order to become better at recovering and in doing make faster progress of fitness before we begin id to emphasis that this podcast is separate for my teaching in researchrolls at starwort it is also separate for doctor and gasping teaching an receartrols at castrate fullerton it is however part of our desire and efforts to bring zero cost to consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme we tho thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is moments momentous make supplements of the absolute highest quality the superman lab podcast is proud to be partnering with torments for several important reasons first of all as i mention their supplements are of extremely high quality second of all their supplements are generally in single ingredient formulations if you are going to develop a supplementation protocol you are going to want to focus mainly using single ingredient formulations with single ingredient formulations you can devise the most logical and effective and cost effective supplementation regiment for your goals in addition momentous supplement ship international and this is of course important because we realize that many of the superman podcast listeners reside outside the united states if you to try the various supplements mention on the hubermanlab podcast in particular supplements for forgot health for sleep optimization for focus as well as a number of other things including exercise recovery you can go to livemomentous spelled guest that livmomentous doctor slash supermen to day's episode is also brought to us by element element is an electrolyte drink that contains the exact rations of the electrolyte sodium magnesium in potassium the optimize seller functioning for mental and physical performance most people realize that hydration is key we need to ingest enough fluids in order to feel our best an perform our best but what most people do not realize is that the proper functioning of our selves and nerve cells neurons in particular requires that sodium magnesium and potassium be present in the correct ratios now of course people with press prevention and high prevention need to be careful about their sodium take but what a lot of people do not realize is that if you drink machine if you exercise and in particular if your falling a very clean diet that is not a lot of process foods which of course is a good thing chances are you are not getting enough sodium potassium and magnesium to optimize mental and physical performance element contains a sciencepacked ratio of one thousand milligrams that is one

make smart mattress covers with cooling heating and sleep tracking capacity have ben using an eight sleep mattress cover for about the last eight months and it has completely transformed my sleep ism sleeping about the same amount but ism sleeping far deeper and ism now getting the proper ratios of called rapid i moment or red sleep and slow wave sleep and waking up feeling far more recovered mentally and physically the underlying mechanism for all that is very straightforward have talked many times before on this podcast and elsewhere about the critical relationship between sleep and body temperature that is in order to fall asleep at night your body needs o drop by about one to three degrees in terms of cur body temperature and waking up involves a one to three degree increase in car body temperature with eight sleep mattress covers you can adjust the temperature of your sleeping environment to be one temperature at the start of the night a different temperature the middle the night and a different temperature as you approach morning each of which can place you into the optimal stages of sleep and have you waking up feeling more refreshed than ever if you to try eight sleep

recovery's when the specific adaptations o exercise actually occur i love for you to share with us what happens or needs to happen during recovery in order for us to get better at anything endurance strength et camera but also how specific types of exercise stimuli and specific types of adaptations that we trigger running a bit further lifting a bit more weight slowing the cadence of a given movement et camera how those specific types of triggers for adaptation relate to specific or may be similar types of recovery that are required for us to make progress in one of our previous episodes we are talking about how the hazard fatigue lap really identify this idea of home stasis our least sort of champion it for it that is important because and all levels physiology wants to return to hoo stars what happens an terms of adaptation is you have challenged it to a level that it realizes if it does not make a change it will not be able to get back to a same level of home stasis that is fundamentally what is happening that is recovery that process of of taking an insult being temper rarely reduced in functionality causing a change that now we come back and get wit we often call in for performance supercompensation all that really is doing no is bringing you to a new level of homeostasis affectively it is understanding if that same insult comes again i need to be able to make sure that that does not cause the same level of destruction and we raise the bar whether this is enhancing our ability to take the same level of mechanical tension on the muscle and not result in mycrodamage whether this is being able to take the same reduction and energy and not have that compromise sleep or anything tit is really fundamentally changing we can have a new level of homeostasis because it is presuming to predicting that that same insult is going to come again down the road i wont to clarified for people that when doctor join says insult while he may actually insult me a insult is the nurgespeak terminology for some sort of damage inflicted to a tissue system am ye speaking about the insult to the muscle or insult to the nauru muscular connection created by adding more weight to the bar a running a further distance a running a bit fast or or peddling faster that creates a micro insult or an insult and now because everyone is familiar with a psychological and verbal insults far a you will never forget that biological concept it is important we tag another thing here which is called hormesis it is one of my favorite phenomenon and it effectively means this that there is a dosage or toxicity response to almost everything and if you think about this in the connects of a drugs what this means is if i gave you ten telegrams of something that it would be of but if i gave you twenty it be a problem an eventually if i go up and give you enough this thing turns toxic this is the case of everything from since a were it can actually be in small dosages an natron fact its in many of the fruits that you eat but itsthat a dosage tat it does not matter if that dosage gets higher though that actually cause problems and if it is high enough you can act to kill you in saitanosi the back end o that though is because you introduce this micro insult as you framed it for me perfectly your body will hen adapt to it and that is really what is happening with exercised adaptation is is it is a hermetic stressor and why that is important is if you look at the immediate responses to exercise you see an extremely large increase in inflammation you see oxidative rest you see a whole cascade of a topology all these problems quotenco happen it that was actually quite funny here is a as a part of my page the the academic portion i had to go through the medical side of the school and i was my physiology class was in medical om the only non medical doctor in that class i m a party some it'll leave my lab i walker s campus in i take physiology class of these folks and i die the whole time internally because every time we would cover a new area it was basely the the exact same valor or number an a medical setting is all my gosh they are going to die and in perform of setting is this persons in fantastic shape is that never still amuses me to the stay obviouslycause it just simple things total blood volume within you cover oaf you have a patient command their good volume six leaders merely get him on a diabetic of some sort cause here can have a hart attack if bout perch gets upper a ism merely think six leaders that tat of persons superfix cause that is actually a positive adaptation to training is one of the most important if not the most important adaptation to nurse training is enhance total blood volume you you will tore more blood in your body when you are more fit than you are less fit i make a go on all all these thing sodium concentrations but assign consctertations i you look at these things on paper and you do not know if that persons about to die cause there sixty five years old out of shape or if that persons can t break good reck or the marathon this brings up a very important tension which is a for instance tit be grand take a blood test and you are somebody who exercise is very intensely a with resistancetraining your blood creatinine levels can be a way out of range and if your physician does not know that your doing certain forms of exercise might say while there is a lot of muscle tissue damage or cursing in your body ye a as you mention before your total blood volume is as dangerously high when in fact you are far healthier in and d you much fitter than the person who as numbers would be enraged that said obviously there a limits to these to these statements whereby you would want to be cautious and take action to ameliorate a very elevated a blood granting leveler or something of that sort this is is one your your a bringing up is is also one about the feel of medicine which is that many not all but many physicians do not take into consideration a the outside activities that people are doing and becomes a kind of a plugin play type in type way of looking at blood charts yo we have done many thousand athletes blood chemistry and a we we do not use forfirst while we never look at disease stuff as totally do we take people at our healthy and try to hoptomises performance and blood chemistry is one of the best tools if you really understand what you are doing there you can get some incredibly powerful information out of blood chemistry with that factory relates to in a talk to to day in terms of measuring you everything from acute chronic decoration to sleep deprivation can be identified in in blood chemistry to optimization a improvements in nutrition supplementation there is is the lot you get there imevif people interest not feel that would point them to a gentlemannamed can garner is just an absolute jargonotn wizard and blood chemistry for high performance but w you can get a ton of information from that if you understand the difference between exactly when you talked about looking for signals of in c creased risk of party of asker events twenty five years down the road verses is this the optimal value for high performance in an they which is what our outdate a base in all of ourself torn sun thesis is only looking for those things it's going to talk about some of bile markers to look for a little bit later am salivary off some foodstuff i ball maybe save that sure the conversation for down the road tell me about different time scales are recovery sure this is actually where it was trying to answer y a question for an than i got myself way off track but the reason i brought up the hermetic thing is if you understand that some things in the acute say twenty four to forty our period look terrible it is actually fine right this is the stimuli that is causing adaptation the reason i brought up the medical exchange there is because you if you looked at to lavatory markers can n you mention some of them you would see that they are highest acute within seconds to minutes to hours after exercise however that is exactly the stimuli needed to bring them down chronically oka and ironically meaning may be in that moment they are elevated and they maybe they're coming down twenty for hours later and fort eight hours however if you were to compare your resting level say that money before you work down to your resting level that money the we following we following that what you would probably see is your baseline inflammation goes down and we got to be really careful or we talking immediately post exercise man these markers a terrible maybe my recovery scores awful is such that is not necessarily a bad thing because were are luck looking to do is to not only change was happening today but we are trying to cause adaptation that may take us weeks or months to actually access i love that your highlighting this principal because one of them more obvious ones to me now that you have said this is heartwrahte absolutely my hart rate goes very very high during exercise and i do that fairly consistently or even see consistently and my resting tartrate will actually be quite a bit lower that is a fantastic example really what you are getting at here is this concept where i think it is important to differentiate between adaptation and optimization now we hear that word and i use it and most scientist hate but it is a good communication to a optimization if you are optimizing for the current moment you are almost surely compromising the late adaptation right if if i are to say do the thing right now that makes you feel the absolute best in the world and you right you took a nap and yet a do the gossip you feel amazing but you know it is causing long permissions the same can be said in the back and if you are never choosing things that make you better wright now you are never actually going to see an station wat what we are really doing what this recovery conversation is playing this game of balancing immediate gratification with the late gratification and how do we identify how much to do now very is not how do i use s a value or a marker whether this is how tired i feel to day how sore i am to day wish is a score on an a or a a tracking matrix whether is a blood marker anything and understand if that is what i need to cause the adaptation i want a week a month three months from now in the case of some of our other athletes it is even up to four years right we are trying to cause adaptations that will get us where we want to get in t e olympics or we champichips or workup or server going to be that is the frame work we have to think about recovery we we may be falsely think about it is i need to maximize my recovery to day and you could do something taken anting lavatory whethris is a supplementation or a drug or maybe this is ice oh cool that is great that will enhance your recovery in this moment that will make you feel better to day probably to morrow but what we know is that blocks o signal for adaptation you are not get to get the same results in for or six eight weeks from now when we talk about recovery we have to understand what tool m i using and why and in order to do that we have to understand what am my training for and what am i trying to maximize if i am in the middle of a season with an athlete and we are competing to morrow i am going to hedge towards acute recovery i as i have to tent actuate that performance right now if i am starting the off season ism not hedging towards recovery ism actually hedging towards adaptation r not going to deploy any of these especially things there is evidence that a combination of vitamin see invite him an e well blunt i protrophicadaptations because our antineflamate with anti occidents i other and other studies have shown maybe they do not have in editor fact they may i may not point is conceptual you want to be careful of what your trying to optimize for and you have to have that forethought and that alone is going to dictate your decision making with whether not again you get in the eye you do that now why we will cover some tools ism message that are pretty fine to use you do not have to worry about those blocking long fromadaptation but others you gang on to be very careful about this principle that you have laid out for us which is that there is a set of events a ocurduring exercise the trigger the adaptation and that sets in motion a number of adaptations that occur during recovery that then give us the exact opposite response to what the trigger was ex all go back to the tartrate example am heart rate is close to maxim or maxim all you do that enough times within a show a week or or two weeks and your resting tartrate goes down as i recall a few episodes ago you said that your maxim om tartrate does not really change that much is that correct yes but your resting heart rate can go down quite a bit yet is that a general theme meaning do we have a e for less et upper limit or sealing for things inflammatory markers for tartrate maybe even things stress and what we do when we deliberately trigger stress or age dramatic increase in tartrate or dramatic increase in inflammatory markers is that we are lowering the floor but that the sealing remains the same it is very dependent upon the marker in the case of maxima hartraht it will not change with the exception of one thing which is age age brings it down training will not change it up in most circumstances if you look at something an inflammatory response i suppose theoretically there is the ceiling though ism not aware of it a i can tell you right now looking at blood markers the things i crease in kines remember the conversation about metabolism and would that o we use a phosphor creating as one of our primary feel sources for explosive exercise well if were using phossphel creatine a this creating kind swim me kinds are insides at that function to break things down for the most part creating knees is the enzyme you used to break down creating when you do that a lot then that creating lines gets out of muscle and seeps into the good a mile globin is actually another fantastic marker by the way a mile global is i to think but hemoglobin being in blood is of the mil rule that carries option around when it is in the muscle tissue than it is mile glob and mile meaning muscle and the same globular thing there is a much of markers you can look at muscle break down and one of things t you can see is a creating kinds level that is elevated after say a one bout of exercise an and you might t might be up in five or six fold a have actually seen this number in a offense of leman in the inkwell be something five hundred plus full even within just one category to the next that that number can get extraordinarily high and if this is actually one iris important point here if your paying attention to any mechanistic repertory use you are using that to inform your decision making you have to be extraordinarily careful of magnitude and what i mean by that is if if i were to to be running o a western blot looking at a signaling proline a inamuscleas does it ti this activation of this proline turn on my contra bile genesis and i saw that whatever intervention we gave it whether was a nutrition thing or a drop or an exercise and i saw that that signaling preaching increased by twenty per cent i would basely soon that to be totally physiologically irrelevant because in order for that to be importantly totally depends the mark your looking at but some markers i might need to see four or five six hundredfold increase before i know that that will actually be enough to be what we call physiologic relevant others if they are up one or two per cent that is relevant and you really want to be careful when you are either reading papers or looking at social media stuff a people are just talking about this marker increased this much it may not matter it may be totally irrelevant physiologically and you have to that does also if you under how the hell of the o these people well that is how they can trick you a little bit in what intensively ore not could be just there trying wot their best but they do not really understand that are enough and ism that is an i portent point to by attention of to answer your question again fully it would be hard to determine if there is truly a maximum level ism somethings do not want a move blood peace it does not really want move the range that you can move from is you six point eight o seven point for if you get up the seven point nine your probing in big big big trouble alter things again can go up five hundred five thousandfold and the markers will really determine that answer well that is some point in the future i love to continue this discussion around the topic of stress specifically him and maybe we will get into that lie bit later to day when we ism get into the use of deliberate cold exposure because that certainly has effects related directly to temperature on tissue but its certainly has mental facts and terms of raising one level a perceived pain it is fun i it were as some people love it and people love it for the feeling they get during it ism deliberate call exposure some people only it for the feeling that they get after it not unlike exercise to i i love to train i love exercise but i know many people w ism they lode exercise but they love the feeling afterward this will be a thing that we come back to thank you for indulging my interest in that a semi target i think it is irrelevant tangent if there is such a thing i count now return us to the different time scales yean modes of recovery is think where we are headed is how to get better at recovery yet let us talk about the tools less talk about what the measure and identify for all four of these distinct levels level one is what we call overload and just very quickly what that means is i did work out to day the sign and symptom of overload is your fatigue acute performance is down i worked out hard right now if i were to go try to do a maximum effort i would be reduced in my ability the recovery period for a cute overload is minutes to days right that is generally we call it cute overlook and that is what werelooking for right we system should theoretically see that aromatic stressed come back in responds come back bigger better more efficient et camera if you were to continue training in that state most of us to and say i did work out today i have we legit of a cute overload can i work out again to morrow battle more acute overload can work out the next day little more acute overload even if you took a day in between it that does not matter i you just continue these acute bouts of insult then you can n be pushing in to the absolute golden target which is what we call functional overreaching you have overreached what you can currently do and it results in a functional outcome and w t we mean functioning here is performance is enhanced and again performance being whatever you deem it to be your stronger you have an hanmusclesize your matocondry is improved you whatever the thing is it is not just a physical performance thing right amazing recovery time for functional overreaching is typically a few days to may be even a week or and typically what we see happen is prior to a competition individuals will do what we call a taper which is a reduce training volume for some short peter time and the the reason they do that is to again a actualize is the phrase we here is here the adaptations and you worked hard for six weeks and in you theoretically the work out you did three four or five six weeks ago once you allow the system to recover will be actualized which mean your performance will be in hands here functional overreaching is the golden target if you were to be at the point of functional overreaching and you continue to train it intensified whether this is through intensity this through volume ore really as you said earlier you had something holding back your recovery it does not really matter right it is s sort of two sides in the same point then you and move into what we call non functional overreaching you have over reached again but now it is non functional as in you did not see a positive benefit once recovery aloud this typically means you have weeks it takes weeks to come back from and you basely tisgept back the baseline and this is where a lot of folks are who end up in this vicious cycle and you are man ism not getting the results i want ism going to train harder ism not getting results o on ism n to train hard and harder but because you have to of recovery is not improved you just end up in the same spots than you train more and you nave the sane spin you end up then just either blowing upper quitting you not getting what you want if you were to continue past that point you may actually be into what we actually call over training and that typically is a consider to be overstrained if it takes months to recover from most people think they are overstrained are really not your just probably non functionally overreached and again t e classic distinction is if you took three or four days often you felt better you were not probably quotinquote overstrained you are probably just in this area of non function of reaching y unetelimit of a kickoff if you in this has breathe case have had this happen with gymnasts at a cheater and some other things ware they take a month off and were barely seeing the start to come back to their baseline numbers in any number of areas mood desire to train tostostrong courtesan ratios a you markers in a number of areas physical performance vertical jumping all these things they just start to get back the baseline over true overstraining is actually quite rare non functional over reaching is much more common and ait is a shorter time for himself when we talk about recovery those are the four pieces that were really thinking about and if you are concerned about oh ism superstore how to i get less or how do i either not be a sore next time i do that same work out or ism superior now how to i recover those are playing in that first category of overflowed and we can certainly talk about how to figure that out but the quick answer is you got o go back to our previous episodes and just pay attention o the volume intensity recommendations if you are getting significantly a more damage or fatigue in a work out you probably have increased your volume too quickly or something else is dragging your stress buckedown but generally this is a problem of training you either did not warm up sufficiently you are fueling strategy is off whichwill talk about in the next episode or you violated one of our principles of increasing intensity in volume sir to quickly i if it is past that and you are getting to a stage where you just ism feeling beat up all the time i energies going down have just not feeling om recovered now we are in this overreaching staged the the story i in i tell here always is a a few years ago i was working and my wife tamasha was in the grog training and ism doing something an she come stumbling and she has this look on her eyes an their want her balls or giant she seguobbling and she sight i aft up i what he mean you at up and she is tusks i read the program wrong and she is tropic what you do she was'post to be doing ten sets of three every minute on the minute and she did three but a ten every minute on the minute and e it was absolutely wreck she could not move for a few hours afterwards and then for days she just you have to handle the kids i cannot get out of bat a canto that was are mastic example of i right we do not need to fix recovery here you are just a dummy and you did the training way too hard to long this is not we don't have a problem here if it is locate a situation that is generally you just the programmers way off if it is constantly happening whet you just man for whatever reason every one while ism getting really sore or having a really bad performance in these wore accounts then we need to go to our other stress bucket take a look at our aliphatic older aliases and get fight out what is happening there ism those ware the the easy ways to flag a cute overflowed problems i to see a brief break and acknowledge our sponsor athletic greens it lentic greens is a vitamin mineral robotic and adaptigeand drink design to help you meet all your foundation or nutritional needs have been taking athletic greens daily since two thousand in twelve ism delighted that the responser of this podcast treason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletic greens once or twice to day is that it helps me meet all my foundation or nutritional needs that is it covers my fitments my minerals and the politics are especially important to me athletic greens also contains adaptions which are critical for recovering from stress from exercise from work or just general life if you to try it let it greens you can go to let it green stock calm slash supermen to claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs and they will give you year supply of vote him in see three cat to again if you to try it let it greens go to let it green stock calm slash supermen to claim the special offer ism happy that you pointed out the distinction between functional overreaching over training and being over trained think one common mistake that people make him thing about biology generally is that they think in terms of nouns and adjectives and not verb summoning i love that much n biology is a a collection of processes or processes depending on who you are in where you live in who you trained with being overstrained is a state that in many ways is an adoptive your overstrained ism overstrained i saying a ism an america o a checklist of akin whatever it happens to be right and in many ways people do start to associate wit an identity at least a transient identity and they start making all sorts of decisions it sounds about what sorts of verbs they will and will not engage in whereas i think you we look at things as processes and we a sign verbs to them then we can say oka ism functionally overreaching or ism truly over training which just as matter of degrees it or undertraining for that matter ism not ism reaching but ism not functionally reaching it is just at just performance and just as with the nervous system will not change unless you give it a reason to this the reason we if you can perform something perfectly or speak a language perfectly there is there is no rewiring of the nervous system this with that we have all been told that every experience requires your nervous system once different now than it was too seconds to that is that is a ridiculous illogical statement we know that is not true if your nervous system can perform something it has no reason to change and it will not muscles the same way this is why you have to progressively overlooked you've to learn something new or challenge or muscle to to something it is e something in the example that you gave a with your wife doing this work out that turned out to be far more strenuous she had functionally overreach in some sense she might have been over training or heading in the direction of overstraining but the mistake would be to assume it she was overturned right as a kind o it is almost becomes a bit of a state or a character a assignment am as oppose to a verb and in any case there is no perfect way tostryther to writing about owns and adjectives and and were also on a talking about verbs but i think the verbs are really anchored down in processes and things that we do actions that we can take and om if i may it'd to just high this this idea of shifting one thinking towards verb actions rather than labels on the state that we happen to be in or the person that we happen to be id sometimes it even does become kind of charactalogical the way that people describe it and a i have to believe that there is something called overstraining that overstraining is real another words but that we do not ever really know if we are over trained you nail es there is there is no you notes not a red flag ta shoots up out o your shoulder and i am overstrained its am in doing i hope that we can start thinking about some of the verbs the actions that we can all take in order to in sure that we stimulate progressive overload one way or another and at the same time that we do not fall into these bins of character assignment where suddenly we decide that we need to do acts take a month off or something that because i ism beginning to realize am from our discussion that that is exactly the wrong way to go those are fantastic points i will not want to make sure it is clear that there is no clinical diagnoses for overtrain they're no standards there is no test or a blood panel you can pull that would actually identify you in that state your your distinction here drew of these reverts and rather announce is is wonderful that is exactly the case the only way we could really come retroactively diagnose one with overstraining as if again we had you did weeks of recovery and you only got back to base line we cannot do it in the moment i cannot take a single test there is a subjective marker anythings as you are over trained it is simply you are probably overstraining and we need to reverse that quickly or in the case of the step before you are probably functionnon functionally overreaching and if you continue to do this you will probably enter into stage i where this is you are overstraining and we need to come back that is an important thing to let people know as there is no one thing we can actually point to that says you are here you are not known this is a herb what are some tools that we can use to enhance our recovery yet lest start up with that acute overload face in other words i distil a work out and ism feeling awful or i misdid one two days on om supersede how do i get red that right now what is a couple of things you can do immediately after your work out and then others that a may be more actionable a day later or two days later and we will discover handful them will do some nutrition and i ration in supplementation in the next episode ism man everything else not in a category right now a couple of things number one you can actually sharp kick start that recovery process at the end of your current training session and i guess i should say this way i strongly suggest you start this recovery process immediately after the work out you mentioned earlier about this idea of you got o get a really high peace of stress to cause adaptation but i actually did not explain that correctly cause what has to happen is you need that extremely high peak but you then you have to be met with an extremely sharp recovery back dow and you know you have talked about this before in some of your a curl plasticity stuff and in terms of what has to happen the cause the insult and then you immediately need to be able recover to make sure that that causes changes n re same thing happens here we need a really sharp and high inflammatory response and then if you do not meet it with an immediate recovery period the signal will not be there to man mas your result what is that mean you can lactated you a couple of things number one is actually listening to slow pace music there is evidence to suggest fast pace music me a slow down your recovery and slow pace would actually manhandle it if you just strange from your maximum get you up and get going music during the work out to a slower lower cadence that will help you kick star at the idea of a similar note you can also use wat we call down regulation breathing you can do them in conjunction or one or the other whichever is up to you my personal favorite method here is somewhat between three to ten minutes a finishing your training session laying down i to be in opposition you can certainly do t in locust position but i think lying in your back as generally more effective personal preference there no science i the eyes being covered getting into this dark quiet sort of area and then just breathing through your nose in a structured cabana there is a lot of different things you can try an easy example is just box breathing and you can imagine box having four squares what you are going to do is in hale for somewhere between three to eight seconds and whatever now will you choose you keep that same temple and let us say you chose to do a five second in hale that is gong to take you up vertically and then horizontally for your box is a five second hold and then a five second next hale and then a five second hold and you busting to repeat that for the time domain i typically honesty soft use a timer you will actually notice a lot of people will fallseleep or get really close to falling asleep in is period and you can do a triangle version of that were you you an inhale hold exhale on the grit back an your inhale or up but there is a bunch to different tricks you can there you need to play around and see what actually works best for you ten minutes is probably better but if you can just at least give me three a that a work if you are really really resistant you can actually do that just in the shower and if your can offish your work out get the shower again disclose your eyes in the shower give me three minutes of focus relaxation breathing and that will accelerate the recovery process i love it and i particularly love it because my laboratory works on stress and respiration it you breathing and the indirections between the two and let us mention a result that was just accepted for publication should be out by ten ten stay sir is a thank you a this is the beautiful work of a not me directly although it took place in my habit as we know it is the nostoc really you the heavy left going of a doctor malice a boon a in my lab a phenomenal researcher that showed that a short period of five minutes of box breathing of exactly the tightly you described or a picnic sighing two inhales followed by an extended exhale to lungs empty ideal the inhales or done through the nose the exhales are done a through the mouth although it could all be done through the nose a or the mouth for that matter but probably not not for inhale inhale mouth for exhale or a a in inhales through the nose and and expel throughthe nose picnic sighing as we for to done for five minutes both of those produce very significant a decrease is in resting heart wright the over time will increase things heart bravery ability and on and forth a provided that there are extended exhales it seems the calming response and the reduction and over all stress of course the only thing that really sens things in the other direction would be something cyclic i preventilation insure you have observed that am and interestingly a when we had people just do five minutes of a meditation which during which of course they are breathing but there just allowing their breathing to progress however it happens to be in that moment am or moments cross the five minutes a there were reductions in the same sorts of markers of stress that i describe but not as significant as breathing i love the box breathing tool post work out am and there some other alternatives there too on i just mention but i think people greatly under estimate the potency of breathing for shifting ones nervous system function away from stress or if one wants toward more alertness entstress act have a cup of questions for you on not for i think the din soul appreciate this a how long were those boxes does it disuse respected great question we use the carbonado i tolerance test may a in order for people to determine how long the different sides of the box should be and you cover carbonado at tolerance test in a previous episode and we can pride a link to that clip main the show note captions but as you point out involves a long extended exile to lungs empty am and of course people could sit with lungs empty but a they have to accurately faith vary as i say report how long it took them to empty their lungs we use that as a as e gage typically if it takes if people go to lungs empty in twenty seconds or lass i believe have to go back to the paper and look but i believe that the a duration reach of the sides of the boxes as it were was somewhere between am two in three seconds if they had a a steal two discarded time of anywhere from a twenty seconds up to about forty forty five seconds used it a besides of the box fer i believe a between for and six seconds and then for people longer than a who could discard their air over a period of a minute a or more we used a a box duration that is inhale hold exile hold duration of somewhere between i believe it was a seven or maybe it was eight and it's long as eleven or twelve second ye those ought you that a free diver types you can really do this i we are really well trained out for this sort of thing the be do not cut me exactly on those numbers but that the that was a proximal those line up exactly with what what we have done i believe it is it is con to be close within seconds of non important distinction is it is cone t be close enough that is great and that was a it took them what six weeks a is this study was done over the period of a month and the when they were swapped into a new pattern of breathing condition or meditation condition and this was all tun rusted in the natural world as we say an they were wearing foot bands that we were getting harry harry very billy sleep data subjective data about mood at camera pitta lot of measures but this was more than a hundred subjects out in the wild of life and we try this best we could to tract life stress of ends and exercise and things that at that was harder to control outside the laboratory really all those results speak to exactly what you are describing here which is that deliberate respiration that involves controlled holds an exhales really has a dramatic and very immediate impact on reducing our levels of stress that that is wonderful ism not surprised at all a with your findings and what is really interesting about that is you mentioned how the exhalation portion is primarily responsible for the down regulation and that is actually goes back to our previous in durance conversation which is that in general at rest at non altitude increases in seal too or the primary driver for ventilation and wit that generally means is inhales or associated with an up tic and sympathetic state and exhales are associated with ha optic of parisonthet estate this is generally why folks will do things exhale and finish that exhale right before they perform a very high precision neurological last if you are going to say aim at a targets you are going to exhale fully and then almost always execute that movement at the end of the exhale because that is when you in your highest peri sympathetic state and lowest drive for ventilation i have to say ism not surprised at all at you guess found to there is actually other dated that point to individuals us particular after endurance training that can get back down to base line partite is going to be correlated with who gets the most actual result of their training said that if you take a bunch of individuals and put them through an en durance training program if you measure how quickly they can get back down to base line after each work out in general those folks that are better at that are going to see greater improvements in performance at the end of your say four or six or eight week training block and there is a little bit of causation and correlation there that we have to untie but i think it is enough to say hey if you invest these three in your case your your study was five minutes it is o only going to an hand's recovery you have a likelihood of increasing you results from your training and now we also have additional benefits being able to transition more appropriately into our next task going to work going to see family whatever the thing is and it is it is a nice clothes to i asked you to be in a high sympathetic state body i asked you to perform and be interstress i gave you recovery and now are ready to transition n our next thing that we do not take that exercise energy if you will into our next a task which may are my not want me in a sympathetic drive state somebody is sore following your work out either locally sore in a muscle group a group of muscles be in the legs or caster torso maybe their whole body in is sore as it sometimes is the case what a some tools that they can implement in order to accelerate the i wont to call moving out of that soreness by dis try a as we know the alleviation of the soreness through a bunch of different processes what are the most effective tools to push back on that soreness and dissipate it yet absolutely first of all it is not lackey that is is the truly importanthing that we still here people talk about is your sore twenty four hours later you got do this thing to get the lactate out there as we talked about in the metabolism a conversation and episode that that is not the cause a fatigue and it certainly not the cause of soreness not an actionable tip there but just a pet peep of mind when i hear people say that that i get irritated we can maybe in that conversation i tradition tools here what you can do you can act wear compression gear that will help a little bit there's a decent am i have evidence suggesting if you just were to you on put some tight or fitting clothes on leisure wear or compression gear if you have it a thank an actually prevent a little bit of soreness from occurring if you are the case of poor tamasha and you realize you just on way a wait too much or you went hung out with yer but hunting friend an you trained wait too hard and you realize all my goodness imam going to be very sore here you can immediately put on compression garden way that really for as long is possible what would a some examples of compression your have seen people on a plain with those high high socks em i mean anything the you wear compression gear for but you do for exercise whether these are just a you compression hands and leggings the tight fitting leggings a whether this is a long sleeve shirt that i a rash guard you would wear in git to or a surfing or something that as long as its tight fitting it does not have to be much more than that you can wear y i suppose you could get the socks would be grate but on we general just tell our athletes a they put on o long sleeve compression shirts that they would wear for the training in an long compression a leggings and that be fine can people apply these compression in garb after training and still get some of the plosive effects yet i have not seen any evidence to suggest that that would block adaptation that may be the case am not aware of those studies if that happens but i certainly know that the information suggests it can hance a little bit of muscle recovery but i really one knows if they are about to do a work out that could trigger a lot of soreness yet and then wears compression gear of some sort to off set that and if does it have to be local to the muscle groups that your working on the reason i ask about the socks is my interstaying the socks a the the compression look be bore on the plan is that it is going to shift that patterns of blood flow not just in the lower legs but all over the body ye you are probably going on a folks it on the actual exercising tissue though actualytat through the good question i do not know the answer of whether not you would n per body work out only or lower body compression gear if that would actually help that is a great question it may have been done i do not know but i do not know the answer that in general we just tell people wear were the whole thing as much as youcannot i i actually not concern thatyou'r wearing it during your work out it is something you could put on afterwards or even wear is little bit of compression the other day i we have actually did a really fun study i collaborated with a bill crater whose a sport scientist of the year word is the bill crater lord if that gives you an indication at of a university connecticut as well as with lee brown two lifetime achievement word winners and we we put people on a plane in stores connectcut and flew them to clay flyers on a cross country flight and some of em got to wear compression gear during the flight and others did not then they landed in californium did a training bout put him back on the plane went back the stores and think they d another trying about when they got back there ere was a lot of at that came out of that paper but one of things that was clear is the compression group was effective a at handling some of the blood related coagulation and other issues associated with a long flights and particularly out performance that is actually sneaky little inside er trick that it'll use a lot with people a predict withouthins hat are traveling is just where that compression gear on the plane you talked about that and that sort of wrung that study to mind that it is another effect of strategy compression gear in general as well as particularly on a plan battle the tinder you can get the better without it'll measly making your hands purple and being in comfortable and things that does not have tore overly tight a anything will work an in probably holp ism also doing that personally any time on taking a plight that as much as i can it just to feel a little better when i get there what a some other methods that we can use to alleviate acute soreness well if we continue down the same theme which is saying kit we use some sort of pressure manipulation to unhands recovery if compression is one strategy you can also use things am compression boots or garments in these re pneumatic devices that will o pump a air outside you in compress i backsword there is any number of devices that will do this ism toucan also use the physical hand this would be massage and body for am the r really working as best we could tell on the same mechanisms which you are effectively moving fluid in and out of the tissue as well as potentially enhancing blood flow i increase in capitalization and which is going to only get new trains in and waste products out you can kind of piconchuse passed upon your budget a preference is of inability timing things that those are all a effect of strategies outside of that really is the next largest category which is now thermal and a far in this discussion we have mention cold water immersion and i talked about in the hypertry section how you would not want to do that immediately post exercise which would be getting into cold water or an ice path if you are trying to grow muscle mass having said that there is good evidence showing that cold water immersion specifically is effective at reducing muscle soreness it is a fair consideration and it is a classic example of how there are no free passes and physiology nothing is always good or always bat it always about what he willing to give up whenfirses what you are willing to get and the case cold water immersion you may be thinking yet i might blunt some hypertrophic adaptations but if you are in that face of training whereof are actually trying to push more towards optimization in that moment rather than long from adaptation then a an ice path might be a great choice in addiction if you fall into a maria fantasia did and you realize ism just unbelievably sore this might cost me three or four or five or six days of training it might be worth it for you to accelerate that recovery process by a couple of days that you do not miss much training is it is just a it is an you rhythm it is an equation what am i looking for i get if ism in season or trying to compete or if i have just done way a way to much exercise and ism really insignificant pain you would probably be willing to give up some small percentage of eventual muscle growth after a single session to get out of pain ism of the cold strategies cold water immersion is clearly the best approach rather than cold air or some other tactic a cold shower is probably not enough here you really do a want to be either in moderately cold this is may be forty to fifty degree water a for probably north of fifteen minutes or you can be in subforty for as little as may be five minutes to get some the felt her and there is been a number of studies ism some sort of summarizing much t that kind of into one rather than going through them point my point the numbers you just throughout a which ism assuming er a a fairenheight a seem seem really cold to me m uncomfortably cold a absolutely o i always recommend that people eaten to it as a pro to call over all that they not immediately go to thirty five degree a cold water they have never done it before a that said once people are comfortable being uncomfortable because i always answered the question how cold should it be exactly would you agree that it would be very very cold much that you really really want to get out but that you are able to stay and safely whatever that value happens to be you absolutely need to be save having said that we have actually in our exit retreats but dozens if not hundreds of people of this point a ideally in the sub thirty five deary water their first time ever and done in a three minutes multiple rounds i an a session they can handle it but you do not need to go that crazy if you do not want you cannot have to play game right you want be really really cold for a short among of time or yuan to be kind of cold for a longer am out a time really the only mistake you can make as doing something sixty five dry water which for to most people is not very comfortable and doing your five or ten minutes not can be its robin not can be effective if your man thirty five is is absolutely crazy and you want to do fifty five degree water and there is literature in that area but it is going to say you need to probably be there some were almost surely north of ten minutes and some of it will actually show you need to be there well north of twenty to thirty minute for my money i would rather go really realize cold and et t done in five minutes but a personal preference on this one you can also make it little be easier on yourself there is not nearly as much evidence but there is som on contrast stuff this is when you go cold hot sort of back and forth there are no really good rules and terms of how much should you go how many rounds how long and cold how long and hot again there have been a couple of studies but in obviously those studies use numbers but that does not mean those that been tested to see with what are optimal which is a very big different you can really just cold of play that by feel hot is good for recovery you just have to be careful because your are going to put more blood float in the area and youyou may walk out of there with some additional acute swelling which is in going to put greater pressure on there you have to conto play with i personally really hot for recovery i will feel may be not great in that moment but the next day i tend to feel really really good in addition if i wake up the next morning and really really hurting and and ism superstiff a hot bath will will help that i quite a bit you can play with some of those protocols can you not have to do ice there is obey no requirement to do it is just an option if you are interested the studies of doctorsisan a sober'sure years not directly aimed at alleviating shortness or recovery there more about increasing formal capacity i a storage of a brown out pose tissue not the bloomery fat but the stuff around the clavicle and around the heart that help you generate body heat at last an metabolism and soon and the numbers there that am she is come up with again have not been tested against all the possible derivations just would breathing we did five minute sessions but who knows may be a minute would have been equally affective just there constraints only sorts of studies but the values that shes come up with which seem to be good thresholds for making sure that an adaptation response is triggered by heat and cold is it ends of being fifty seven minutes per weak total of uncomfortable but safe heat an that case son and that can be all in one session or breaking it up into couple of sessions on the same day or or different days and then eleven minutes per week of cold either in one single session or multiple scions again one could do more am one could break that up over we in a multiple days or do it all in one day or do it all in one you an hour in the sawn and than eleven minutes in the colder vice first although that seems a little bit extreme especially for the uninitiated but those of the numbers that have been studied but as you point out there are not a lot of really thorough studies examining different cold protocols according to temperature by time requirement there is a bit of subjective feel require to establish a routine endow would to say this is another time to re emphasize something we talked about at the beginning of our conversation which is that pain itself is not a defined outcome i it is heavily influence by your perception and if you do not feel they work for you they will not work if you feel they work fantastic they do it is a challenging field to get really objective data on there is always going to be a little bit of subjective nature to somebody things i can tell you anecdotally we have used hot in cold contrasts for long time at leas ism some of it som do not care for and everything in between it is one of those things wore i never mandated i course i cannot maidan anything for i m i work with but ism never y my re interested great you struggling this trade you don't try this you did and you it great you struggling in this area and you try at you did not love it look at fine ism not well we will find other routes a as we we will get into there is a lot of ways to an hand's recovery this is only one and it has not even really come down to stopping the problem in the first place wore net we are just treating symptoms which is first line of defense but you really need to go back and fuck out why it is happening to begin with us a solution these are just different i an acute symptom management tactics one final point about a deliberate cold exposure i think worth mentioning is one of the reasons the shower is effective but not nearly as effective as cold water immersion or immersion and ice up to the neck is simply because of the reason you stayed before which is that most showers are not going to get that cold and i can get down into the subforties a also cold showers have not really been study that much they have but not nearly as much as immersion and always ass we i just think about the challenges of studying cold water a exposure in the shower where you cannot really control for thing of how much of the body is covered with not the head stays under different size bodies et camera whereas when people come into laboratory they can get into cold watch and we know where the neck is we know where the chin is and we can make sure the people's arms and legs are underneath but with cold sh over sure you can make everyone face away or toward the shower but it is really tricky and for all the variations that that were described that set would you agree that if one wants to use deliberate cold exposure that cold shower is better than nothing and cold immersion in circulating cold water or ice bath is better than than cold shower ye what out act you say if you are looking for recovery from muscle soreness i would say cold shower is probably doing very little because you are not going to bald to get enough cold water on to any muscle besides based your head maybe you could try cold bath and you least get some surface area coverage be if you want to use cold shower for all the other awesome reasons the cold shower that is totally great but if you are trying to use that to recover your low back in clues from being sore from training in a good way probing i can to do much o the the person would be the you actually also have sneaky other point which is if you cannot get your water super cold just make the water move soil you have jets and stuff you could turn on any one is try this four alky a i can do a forty degree bath blossom i try sixty when the water's moving i because you break up the thermal lay or normally of a little thin layer ya water the your heating up you break that it is a whole new world yet absolutely being very still in the cold water is actually the weaker way to go that you can make your face stoic but make your body circulate a some water round you as long as we are on this a may be just one more point about heat a have certainly using persona dhyana esteemsana sands excuse me fucuses can work pretty well yet a male if you are looking to conceive in the sixty days following a sop falling sand or hot tub do do realize that it that both those approaches do severely limit the number of motile sperm ism substantially for real that are not trying to conceive i do not think that this works a delivery enough that you could use as a form of contraception yet but but for a people that are trying to conceive it really is detrimental the to sperm health right and for that reason some you will bring an ice pack and put it on the growing or near the growing el when they go in but which is hard to do in a hot tub then sand here we are getting into the fine points or a rude points if you will upon intended but but the ideas that we we wouldn't want any one to approach these techniques and compromise their other life goals i was certainly not allowed anywhere near these things what i we were at that stage of life allowed to say marasca put an anna on me hanging out laird n go yet in the san out for those rate us your not going and your not going not a stuff en i to sent away right heat heat and sperm have have a relationship it is not when that is positive for the sister it'd to take a brief break to acknowledge our sponsor inside tracker inside tracker is a personalized nutrition platform that analyzes data from your blood india e to help you better understand your body and help you reach your health goals have long been a believer in getting regular blood work done for the simple reason that many of the factors that impact your immediate and long turn health and well being can only be analyzed from a quality blood test one issue with a lot of blood testandyanateus out there however is that you get information back about various levels of lipids and hormones an metabolic factors et camera but you do not know what to do with that information inside tractor makes knowing what to do with all that information exceedingly easy they have a personalized platform that lets you see what yoursipmes oil numbers are of course but then also what sorts of behavior old dues and dots what sorts of nutritional changes what sorts of supplementation would allow you to bring those levels into the ranges that are optimal for you if you to try inside tractor you can visit inside tractor dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per scent off any of inside tractors plans again that inside tractor dot calm slash supermen to get twenty per cent off are there ways to combine a the various types of of stimulate that you described for inducing recovery you talked about breathing base tools a which while they could adjust and indeed do adjust oxygen and carmodoxide ratios and et camera ism messing the major effect of those on recovery is going to be curl it is going to be deliberate calming of the nervous system it more sympathetic base a the nabsumention yet most e and then you talked about some movement base and touch based approach is am which will a movement certainly certainly will circulate blood but also will generate contractions of the muscles i which may be if indeed against still speculation if indeed some of the shortness is due to excessive structure swelling at the stretch ends of the of the muscles that would make sense some movement in touch and then thermal are there ways to combine these that are more effective may be even synergistic ye i suppose you could throw on a some compression garment put on a pneumatic compression device and sit neon will you down regulate your breath that what would be fine quite honestly tough you probably do not need tomacimises all of them we were joking you could probably go for a light swim while regulating your breathing and cold water you get the compression from the cold water and and you would be in a good spot you you can certainly do that the reality is i generally look for some physical approach and then some a wholistic approach of the breath work base some not breath and then something else if you knock those two things out you are a good spot that could be breath while you are in thermostress just controlling an doing the on regulation up you have to also remember ice is a stressed roll actually show you some data here in a second about how that actually can in hands a systemic recovery although it will not happen in me in the accoutrements in fact that song to take at least thirty o sixty minutes and then you will vent to see a rebound effect but acutely it is going to make you actual more sympathetic which is going to the direction i he can do the opposite or it can actually drive you up it is a little bit dependent upon how you respond what time a day a and how you are using in general i guess a combining them is if you need it a depending on what you have what is available perhaps you do not have son a but you can ticket a hot bath great maybe you have some precision device some tool and you can use that but you do not have a son amazing do not have ice barely thing i think rather than thinking about an potable combination of them i would say dis use a couple of the tactic space on what you have and what is easily available a in your situation i love for you ti much us about some of the methods for longer form recovery as it relates to over reaching and overstraining short you will not think about those an a couple of faces face one is to try to prevent it from happening the first place in terms of training load you can a just go back to our previous episodes when we talk give you specific instructions for how much to increase your volume and intensity for week et camera the other thing you can do then is do some monitoring and it'll it'll go over some different tools some cost free ones as well as some me higher test e logically demanding ones and to honor to serve its actually happening and then the third approach here is what of this is already occurred i figure it out on how do i get back out of that hole i would like to just sort of tallies one by one in order and then talk about what is happening what tools you can use and why ire going to work or is any time we are talking about a fatigue management here most people are aware of these terms because if you have any sort of technology a you are probably getting some sort of readiness score or recovery score or strain depending on which a or watch or test you have you have a little bit of insular change if you rein the sport performance world you might be looking at things again load or a serious tracking in mongering in really all of it is is doing the same thing it is trying to either one predict a problem is going to happen the future and then placing restrictions upon you that you do not run in that situationthe other thing it is possibly doing is identifying a drop in physiology or performance and then saying we need to get you out of this hole that is really what is happening and when we think of the first one just imagine a scenario a mileage limitation a pitch count and baseball and what was happened there is is individuals misfield have looked and said hay what we notice is people who throw say more than a hundred pitches in a game tendentstart losing effectiveness and increase injury rate therefore we are predicting the next time you go to play if you cross that threshold we start have any increase risk of negative a consequences therefore we are going to cap your in this case pitching volume at that hundred pitches be game or whatever the same thing with running et camera camera you can simply do that and there's actually really cool data coming out now on sport performance stuff looking at things i am use in go piss trackers and trying to identify even position by position specific a recommendations for how much distance you should to cover and a practice in a training session ism that you can say hay these positions do not cross this threshold these physicians on cross this threshold in basket all and tennis and and all kinds of things that that is not probably extremely applicable to many of the listeners right now but it is still conveying the idea that if we understand where we break then we can stop ourselves from getting there the first place the functional example a here is just thinking about basic things where i start my training program then how do i progress it and we have always covered those numbers in either case though you want to have three markers that you are paying intention to if you are concerned you are getting into an over reaching phase or potentially going o lead to overstraining or you ant to get out is three unique things number one we are going to look for some sort of performance after right this could be i you are times are going down ye you are squat numbers you are your power is going down any these thing it is got to be in actual performance number two some sort of physiology and i want to see something happening with resting heart rat some bile marker is moving a hurry variability a some other measure that is not influence by you and the beauty of using biological markers are if we contrast that performance and i said o case here is our performance just every day you come in you going to a vertical jump and if one day you come in it'll see your vertical jump as supercool ism i think up man maybe we are starting to overreach you also could be feeling lazy that day and this not of jump very high on purpose you did not want to work out the beauty of bile markers are you do not get to manipulate them that they do not care there is a downside to it which is maybe they are just in direct markers right and ism not telling you biological markers are better than performance markers when of saying is you want o look at both in fact you want look at o third category as well which is some sort of symptomatology and am i i am m having a symptom of overreaching am i seeing a perform sacrament and h a mi saying a biological markers well if you see all three of these popping up you have reason to believe you have reached some over reaching now what you have not identified yet is if that is functional over reaching non functionalver reaching are true overstraining and remember you should not be feeling great after every training session you are trying to cause adaptation and unwell you back off maybe even weeks for months later to actualize the adaptation and get that super compensation in performance increase you are git to have to investilit a bit you are goal t go on the whole i any sport performance coach is going to look out numbers throughout the year and a yea ya when we first start training in preparation for the season we are going to see a drop in performance that day that week that is part of the plan right the it's the stress you are trying to cumulate you want u see all three of those markers you just want to pay attention to a couple of things how long are they down for a day three days seven days fifteen days et camera if you are seeing a performance drop in a day and i am far away from from performance a the day that i want a pique for ism not going to do anything different if i see too days in r a drop performance ism not word if i see more than probably in in my opinion five days in a row if sacrament then i might star paying attention if you are in season though or close to competition or whatever that thing means to you and you see more than a couple of days in word of a dropping then you might actually want to take some some steps to mitigate that it really is import you understand again what are we trying to do are we trying to cause adaptation are we trying to cause adaptation and i i have a very specific example of all this we can run through i hear in a second and in of course abuntof tools to to pull youths cases but that is that is fundamentally what we are trying to do here i i would encourage you again do not we too reactive response o to any one measure i cover a whole bunch of omen a second but you can get lost in indifferent things cause they all have prose and cons and i know it is simple to just look at one score on your watch and make your decisions because of that or check your a but you really want to be careful of doing that you are gin probably lead yourself in the wrong direction more often than you on o help yourself ism curious as to why when we overreach too much or too often or we are overstraining that performance is diminished because on the face of it it is kind of obvious you are over reaching you are overstraining performance is diminished but that is completely circular you hear about things a dream a fatigue and a dream of burn out well it turns out a dream of burn out does not you really exist absolute now there is it such a thing as a real insufficiency indium by course of these phrases burn out a dream all burn out overstraining a they are thrown around i youyou know as much as words has lighting and obsessive compulsive are without any real clinical definition a or there are clinical definitions but people are not obeying them when they use the language i do want to acknowledge however what is absolutely true which is that overreaching too much too often overstraining these can degrade performance but mechanistically speaking what is going on because i think once we understand what is going on mechanistically than i think a we can all look at tools whether not it is breathing movement compression thermal psychological a motivation or et camera and have a much clear sense as to what is going to work best and what likely will not work i love this question much because as the mention at the beginning i i was fortunate to spend my i some my graduate work an and fries lab at the university of memphis and we we did a lot in this area and week fact this is how i learned how to do assays and run western blots and measure singling brownies an things this the stuff is near dear to my heart who also did a bunch of really wild studies and he had done before i got there ism going to combined kind of and fries entire career and just high li som of the big pictures of what he found there a he was very interested in exercise particularly straight training and trying to figure out this entire question it which is wises actually happening when i work out too much when i lift too much that all the sudden i cannot sleep what is happening why is my energy down why is my mood my motivation reduced if i squat too much it we did a whole series of studies across this career and a jail just sort of high light some the the some of the themes that ran through them the first one the jumps out to mine is earliest career he this really ostenprotocal i or he had people squat one hundred per cent of their back squat man every day for two weeks you come in to the demand and i think this first one was on a machine and ye did one up man and you came back in every single day for two weeks these are what we would generally call cold of tax that short to moderate range over reaching and by definition some of them in up actually being true overstraining because it would take the individuals sometimes two t up to eight weeks to return back to their one up man at thing of these protocols m some of them were non function over teaching or some commination of that well along with that he took a a lot of blood samples as well as muscle byobsees to try to look out what is happening intercologically nor logically muscle physiology lies to to pay attend was pan couple of things that jump out there i one of his initial studies actually i think the very first went did m when they ran that first a squat every day protocol what they found us counticolomy levels change quite significantly i in depending on one of what you wanted to pay attention to there whether it was up an kronor nor up an at ran i or even a some other markers they basically increased by somewhere between two to threefold and a little bit of understanding of sleep physiology if i drantalin is extremely high a an offend you going to have a hard time sleeping that alone was was first indications wait a minute something's actually happening here that is just beyond muscle soreness there is some sort of systemic fatigue happening and as you rightfully pointed out is not the renal glance becoming fatigued that sort of a bit of tongue and cheeked semantics it is course all this regulation and general stress condom i but it is really can be noted in in blood in terms of up an efferent and a nor up in efferent another study he had done of a similar round was over the course of seven half days people came into fifteen training sessions is really cool ties are these really short bouts of just ridiculous training and they said o hate some happening with with apernaferan and organ t from some hap something is happening with tostostron what is it look inside of the selves an o muscle bosses came on board and they started looking at things map finances which are these signaling proteins that are ten to be associated with an anabolic response my up regulate much muscle proving synthesis and they do many other things but that is a big factor of them i they look to various antigens and gook a quarter quart receptors and they wanted to see maybe receptor density or and or sensitivity is changing and in facts arise surprise that is exactly what they found they found both androgen and gook quarter part receptor concentrations were reduced and you can start to see a picture for me which is hum very similar to the insolent type two diabetes story where you you have really put yourself in a very high stressed situation presumably apenaperan et camera testosterone releases are extremely high in response to that to try to reach back to some level of home states you start down regulating the receptors for them and was the signal can only get high if you are going to keep that gas on worsen a pull back the throttle on the receptors that the total signal saves the same if that makes little assent will hat becomes nosy problematic miso then i a a final follow up study here that at it is important notes they did another protocol which was really really cool and they said the first ones were not enough how about this we are going come in every day for two weeks and we are going to do ten sets of one rep man every day they were coming in and they would do ten one rep maxes every day for two weeks and with threallycool about that study if they did not complete any the re petitions they had to repeat it until they had ten successful one relaxes on that given day a absolutely brutal brutal protect i was not there at the time i they had finished that right before i got on campus but i was actually able to be around when the were doing some of the final analyses there are the tissue i what thy want to look at n this particular study was bade t adgernurgic receptors which are those receptors worth that are on to be eternal from e sector to be binding for again similar story here a perhaps are we losing over all sensitivity because of this extreme sympathetic stimulation ow actually thinking back what would've been pretty cools if they had another group that did it ad did some down regulation breathing pose to see if they can ameliorate some of the problems widow courses was twenty plus years ago or something that i couple things that happened is the one rep maxes dropped by think around eight keels by the end of the two weeks if i remember right the group average with something in the neighborhood of a hundred fifty one keels o these were petty well train individuals and it went from rather i think actually it was about a hundred and sixty keeled n they dropped a hundred and fifty two kilos something close to that what's more significant though was their power d dropped by thirty five per cent which is really really interesting because if if you pay attention to declines in physical performance over time and i mean that through aging we you will see as people can hold on the muscle mass pretty well it will go down aby about into one per cent or after the age of forty however strength will go down at two to four per cent and then power by eight to ten per cent and if you look at actually world records across strand sports by age you will see that they will decline by age but not that much however if you look at speed sports by age they fall off the planet it is very challenging to preserve fast through time whether this is fatigue or because of a age that is really important because that will then tell you hay a little bit of a canary in the coal mine is not necessarily your strength but your speed and a lot of different techniques that we use to measure performance remember that is our try alright simptomology physiology in performance ism your generally better looking at speed base performance tests rather than strength bast performance us to get an earlier indication of potential over reaching or overstraining do not an it is back to the the individual study there in that same group it can we hae the same problem where it took some of them two to eight weeks to come back what they had to do is i came to r the exact time frame i probably should have thought through this but they had they had to come back something every week or every couple of days even after the study finished and tell they got back to their baseline one get macks and some of them it took them up to eight weeks before they finally got back they probably were in a classic over training state of that police which is was done and as little as to weeks and this is also another point that people always ask how how long is it take is is something that has to happen over the course of months or it if i were to go to two days or this intense training camp for two or three weeks could i act a cause or training and the answer is if it is actually truly enough holy and enough intensity you probably can do some significant damage in as little as two weeks probably don't happen on often most likely you you are probably going to be reaching a state of none functional over reaching but you may actually be able to put yourself in a position where i might take three or four weeks or more to get back the baseline after a truly intense and again think about this protocol it is like totally unrealistic for the most part ten see of one of a operate mac quit every day for two strait weeks some folks if you are extremely highly trained with liththroughyou might do something that when you are very close to say world champion ships but outside of that really specific filarial it is a totally absurd training protect but that was the point right we were trying to insure in sure that overstraining was met or close it is similar to when we have done at were actin a think three studies an the senior or performance on atoms musclesorness and an all those cases you do just ridiculous mental protocols could you just trying to insure you cause supersornissy if you do not that you have nothing to study absurd training palls protocols but but that is the point none the less i as results sure enough the bath abgernegec receptors were down regulated by something thirty seven percent what is probably even more significant though was he sensitivity in those receptors i was reduce by to an halffold and it is of wat minute we are becoming decent time this time ye in we are all acting of starting to reduce our total concentration similar wash is actually interesting was a very a sneaky smart thing to do is they look that nocturnal yurinaryup an effort and guess what that was also up by fifty percent is looking one or five five zero five zero ye and now your seeing this than where it is ism seeing response at the tissue level ism seeing a response probably although they did not actually look at a petuitarian that ism ism seen a dream and other annichological problems and then ism also seeing this increase in concentration of ban pin felon when ism supposed to be sleeping and surprise surprise ism having a hard time sleeping ism symptomologyn but that is a a very interesting finding about a nocturnal epineferan epinefron of course is a journal and it is release from the adrenals no surprise there but also from this spranarea called locus cerulius on the brain the branch has to be called up aneferon in the body a journal and just to complicate everyone i understanding but that someone cloture did not come from us the do not blame us the point is that rapid i movement sleet called red sleep is more abundant in the second half of the night we know that the dreams associated with rapidity movement sleep are more a emotionally laden and that those dreams and those emotional states are actually importantant for discarding the emotional load of previous days experiences it is acts a sort of a natural aromatherapy if you will because in the normal healthy state those dreams are associated with an inability to release epinefran at night for me what you just described first faults that first of ever heard of it am but it ties together something really a quite clear from the sleep nor science literature which is that when people are stress they tend to get less rapid i movement sleep that rapid i movement sleep normally is associated with low levels of pain efferent whether not its causal or not island clear a but sort if does not matter for sake of this discussion but what ism wondering and i suppose one would tassfor but may be observed is whether or not people who are over in overstraining too much over reaching too much because of this elevated nocturnal epinefran diminish remsleep whether not their emotional state is also ism disrupted because one thing we know for sure as if you want to disrupt somebody is emotional state you deprive the of sleep and rapid eye movement sleep in particular the one city to to that is for those we out there that have heard that rapidly movement sleep deprivation deliberate rape eye movement sleep deprivation is a treatment for depression that is true but it is coupled with a next night enhanced rapid eye movement sleep one of the major take always from all o this a that ism realizing is that no surprise daytime activities impact night time indican function impact quality of sleep impact daytime activities yet actually this i many fun things it on a do here now ism this is actually we measuring i movement is a very fantastic tool for understanding totalstrestload and you can actually differentiate different types of stress o canine use for a'lcall use for sleep deportation by s actually measuring i movements that is action what we do in our absolute rest sleep company is in addition to getting a a full put sleepstudy done in your bedroom you aregettinginton i tracking a sentiment which prig big the fig why you are getting there ionone the less yet if you actually look at the classic sins and symptoms of over training or overstraining indium instead of be everything from performance sacraments we talked about i what resting heart right is going to increase you are going to see things eight are drop by generally twenty or per cent i that would be very large a disruption nature e am decrease body weight and then all the stuff under you just talked about motivation adherents appetite mood i all o this stuff e are our classically known associations with with over trying and that is for the factories since you talk about sleep disturbances and disruptions i wanting to train motivation all of this stuff a goes parton parcel with f non functional over reaching and or over training ism you can actually tight just back hin a little more to some other bile markers an this grate because this is stuff we look for this is the the physiology if we look for i you have probably talked about a es b g before i which is a semiformal dining globules ss propene that he'll float in your body this cannot bind up sex for months and particular tustostron what happens with ism overstraining as you can actually take this eerily like week by week and you call actually see this number rise and if you see this say you are using a a a service can si tracker and your getting your your blood measured every often and you see this number sri ticking up this is actually located with that because wits actually happenings is dining up all your free testostro ants is leading back to the circle were talking about and you c actually we the same thing happen with carry restriction i does not enough calories but in this particular case because it actually happens in bossinarios it is not a issue simply of being under calories it is clearly an issue of of the training load being too high just to given another little tool there is a i can get the link for it but there is a a website that i was created by a you with journal ah slip but it'll get it to yo you can link it up where you can actually go in and plug in a number of values from blood chemistry if you got your blood worked on and you can plug in your free number and you are post number a you got it done and then may be ten weeks later you got it done again andyou are wondering and you notice hay my free testostrums down or my esse beg is up is it actually meaning full number and you it will actually tell you whether or not the change presto post is physiologically meaningful or not or dis within the air margin of the measure when you c actually change like rightheroun the subside you can change your confidence interval to really really coolie if if you now if you just have your own blood you into no ha i had a any level this were and now it is now here over there is just a totally free resource i created contracture of you all that stuff an it'll give the link to that that is a pretty cool a measure in addition to that probably one of the more powerful and easy metrics biologically is to take your crtisall death ratio this is known to be associated with a lot of things you want to be really careful you do not want this number to be too high or too low something zero point zero nine it it is a not scores all to dag dated coral ratio meet cortisol a love to tell you i said it backwards on purpose just to make sure everyone understood but i got it that yet i mean this ratio has been associated with many things you have to do you do have to be careful with association it not being causation but everything from risk of infection some metabolic health and an other disease tats as well as more what we are talking about i which is hey my mi mi getting sort of cortical this regulation which is what a lot of folks would call again i drink not fatigue a though it is not really it is happening but if at real in and a banehrunner off and to stostro cortisols going to be long the right and you can also look at things testastron of cortisone ratios there is a lot of things you can glean here to give you some insights and whereof are going if that if that ratio is too high that is going to be associated with bat a bolecand from an about your other stuff if it is too low that is going to be associated with a lot of cognitive problems a egression and mood and in a bunch of things that an can you want to keep it right around that zero point zero nine ratio and and most the time actually in some blood chemistrystuff you will get a you get report of that or you can calculated pretty quickly ism sure we'll get into this in the episode that comes next ton a nutrition and supplementation only what about compounds that lower cortex all such is shall on do a i can see now base on the logic your spelling out that during phases of a lot of intense over reaching your frequent over reaching given that those compounds and indeed lower cartisall moduli itrodolia croatia roseola roseola croatia am on word to say am two words but the first one fortune to say roseola croatia roseola rose radio rose folks and aschodonda am have been i trying roseola recently and mainly as a offer to output am it does seem to have some good date a attached to it related to lowering a once perceived threshold of how hard their working another as you can work harder a man not feel as if you are working really hard which allows you to do more work a that sort of the subjective description of out works but you told me that it am can blunt cartisall and ashogonda we know blunts cartisall both of these things of course can do other things but are these compounds that you sometimes will incorporate into a a training regimen i wo have been using roseola for probably six or more years pretty consistently not percent but a using it with the individual to work with you do need to be little bit careful i would not say that it blunts martial it is probably more purple described as a cortical modulator which mean sort of it gets too high or too low in ill help in to keep it within normal of range there is also there is important to know there have been a handfuls is it too o i know specifically show that a modiolus on hand strength gains however it may reduce muscular endurance we need more human data on the stuff and it may turn out that is not a concern me also toe not to be concern nothing is nothing is perfect and are there is no supplement that is a fantasia and a i have used again radio in a lot of situations because the the thing i cannot the patentee the ortisall is is you it is supposed to be modulated throughout the day it is not supposed to be this normal now in fact if you look a normitof values i mystipidly a described in a micrograms protest the leader and depending on literally what company use to draw your blood if your getting it through the blood a depending on what which method they used to analyzed that the moment of values are frankly embarrassingly all over the place there mostly going to be five to twenty five as a cornoncort nomen of value but that is outrageous we also know those numbers very massively by age i sex and throughout the day and if you only a taking a single point this assume you doing a fast a blood drop which is what most folks do it is really only going tell you a lot about what is happening in that moment we need to know well may be let us say my cartisall was if ism a say thirty eight year old woman and my seven a m martial was fifteen milligrams t us later that is pretty good but if it is fifteen kilograms for desolator at three p m oh boy ism ism an probably having some issues i there is a chain throughout the day and you need to be able to plot that case you can actually pretty stand of practice that we do as we look at cortical throughout the day we are gong to take multiple markers cause i do not wanted to see your baseline courtesan i want see this curve throughout the day that is going tell me a ton about again as your sleep being caused by this regulation i is it your training is of something else o i would but take a single baseline blood marker of courtesan with a lot of grain all we with typically measure at least three times throughout the days of something six to nine i m twelve to three in an something my closer to the evening often times we do much more i will do seven points are something that throughout the day depending on situation s you want be careful of that i just since were here you can a sweet cortical in a through saliva and now that sort of prison cons to that because the the pro of doing it in your blood is it is it it is much more stable ism saliva is extremely responsive to whatever happened these seconds before you took that us the upside of it though as you can do a bunch for real work life experiments for example we will do this sometimes if we want to see how an individual is responding to a given stressed let us take it rifles take the takin the yo spending t with tubers i tacit and weregngto you do w this work out or the codes posture were going to do take it tan we know that it is responsive to what just happened but that is the point is you can actual my this sort of protein condo you'll use the appropriate measure for the appropriate a question you are trying to answer a couple of points and reflections about qartesal by first a laboratory duty as an undergraduate was in a ashy in a a psychology lab at the time they did not have the field of nauru science as it is now called it was called by o psychology or psycho biology at another a there was using nauru chemistry in neurobiology they would all collapsed into what we it now called narc science i which is only i throw u some years ago but my job was to collect cortesall samples which means i i was collecting am spit which means i was collecting saliva an the an advantage of saliva base cuartisalits free cartel its the active form of you mention it is reflective of what happened in the seconder minutes a just prior the a couple of things about the regular uartsall pattern across the day because i realize that while i be wonderful for everybody to get their qartesall measured in detail multiple times and blood and and saliva and on some people just will not do that a for whatever reason or cannot do that yet a the basic contour of a healthy pattern of cortesall secretion is a to have highest levels of ordeal in the morning am it is actually part of the mechanism that is associate with waking you up viewing bright light ideally from sunlight but other forms of bright light early in the day actually can lead to a fifty percent five zero percent increase in that quarter all spike which is a good thing you will elevated courtesan on really twelve that is in motion a cascade of things relate to unhandsome good and alertness and man system from action et camera what i think it can be useful for people to understand is that many things will spite cortical throughout the day stress cold water exercise but the ideas that it comes down to base line or near base line am rather quickly one of the worst situations as you point it out is when the highest level of cortusall is consistently shifted to the afternoon period in fact that is a i pretty reliable signature of certain forms of depression this is work by i my colly have its people at i staffer cychatry and the the great bobsipolsky robbers ofpolsky of wishers do not get lasers behave et camera in fame lost at loss of popular books there i think that if people are trying to regulate their cortical and they are just under an they just understand that basic contour that the base line should be you don't rise pretty quickly after one rises in the morning seas you remember rise rise i rise out of bed and rise cortical with light a bright light with exercise ism with catheter these things will all increase cortical and then across the day its normal for cortical to spike but then to use some of the down regulation methods that you described and pro the breathing methods and exercise itself is the case may be but then to really pay attention to how much psychological an physical stresses occurring in the six hours or or eight hours prior to sleep ism dish seem a a good to broad contour of how to have a healthy pattern of costs already speed you as you want the cortical to reduce inflammation and initiator participate in the recovery o will not see any progress from exercise training without a large spike and cortisol it is critically important when we think of phrases cortical inflammation stress this is not bad physiology is not personified are there the things do not ate you in the body right it is all is not good and bad they just are i the more you try to suppress cortical the more you suppress adaptation what you want is exactly what you mention large spikes met with large quick recovery and you want to do that throughout the saying get that aromatic stressed this is to going back tor ospaganda and radio is it i think we'll be very short sighted for people that do that as this is a prophylactic could you if you blunt cortical you are going to cause hem suppress especially early in the day total taking o shut on to before going to train as is the counterperoduct yet we do not just this is not a baseline part of our foundational package r if you go look at the mat the foundations are the at the brasilin photo calls a put together you are not going to see these things and there for that specific reason any form of crtesall regulation needs to be done strategically if you are excessively high or bringing you back down the normal devalues at the right time then great if you are normal thou then taking you down lower than that is actually problematic the same thing is actually true since we are here froxite of stress far inflammation antioxidant use we mentioned at think earlier about taking item en see inti e m post exercise will actually blunt adaptations release has a potential to do same thing right if you are modulating this response just because and you have not done because of a actually biological testing that indicated you need to to do such then you actually may be making things worse and a we we see this constantly with people who take a number of soploums and substances for sleep and then they wake up the next morning groggy and your your coatis all suppressed o kat great then they take something for stimulation and then the rest the day they are trying torose and en an in this nasty cycle as to of just getting out of the way and letting cortex all do what it is supposed to do and then making sure again you are teaching it this aptly reachable response you can coach your own body to go down in the later par the day and go up in the earlier part of the day we you wan to make sure that you are driving that train with intent and again to reiterate if you do not need that you should not do it are if you do not need to lower cortisol you should not walk around doing you are just going to suppress the state even far and this is what is need this is needed for anabolic response a you are not going to grow muscle if cortical is not spike it is imports on to compromise rather you want to be intentional with these practices a especially in the form of of supplementation be very very intentional have heard it said that carbohydrates in particular starchy carbohydrate es i can inhibit coatis all day i and a this could be through the a trip to pan a monoacid related pathway that ratchets up to a stone an release probably some other things to mean the idea that carbohydrate's just stimulates serotonin as it is a little bit a overly s now this tegular mechanisms ay in pique going up and immediately turning iron there yet right am you know i think we have all experience this a were stress were stress we a does not a silly even have to be highly processed a fatsos be no fat carbohydrates a petaochipsan an chips in dipper these kinds of things it can also be a polarizable or marble posse am which here ism not trying to demonize a carbhydras i i do unjust carbohydrates a minmalyar non process carbohydrates a most of the time but not all the time and they have a a fairly potent a effect on lowering stress and perceive stress and even quality of sleep which is not say that somebody has to low up on them crazy unless their glycogen is really to pleated i talked a lot about this in the endurance episode i know will touch on it more in the nutrition supplementation episode but am in thinking about the relationship between carbohydrates and cortesall and what we have just been talking about terms of cortex all as been vitally important for the adaptation trigger ere triggering adaptation strongly better way to put it but that it can blind coatis all taken post training or a may be in the evening before sleep what are some of the basic ways that one can think about and maybe used carbohydrates in specific ways in order to bit is a control sort is all rather than a quash cortesall a you actually have alluded to a number of times rate we often times will give people lot of carbohydrates at night a for some of these reasons you're going to feel fantastic a lot of people tat helps you sleep ism both get to sleep and sayasly quality you talked about specifically remember think about this way corpus all at its core is an energy signaling molecule it says we are in the need for energy grit a at preference the same way you feel start seeing for example cortical will liberate a freefadiasits put him n the bloodstream get you prepared to do something the problem is if it is continually elevated throughout the day with no down regulation we start running into issues right again this is the differentiation between all my cortical slightly elevated all day verses i had a really bids big spike after training i had a really big spike after a brethpota calls camera and then went back down that being said if you then in jest carbohydrates you are tell it is quick to see the signal ale we have entrance we have energy again specifically carbohydrates therefore cortical can for to go back down we do not need to be liberating free phadiacids and preparing a then for feel you can help yourself go to sleep for many as you pointed out many mechanisms actually f why carbohydrates will help you sleep at night ism for some not all people but some that would be one of the relationships at has with courtesan great i look forward to hearing more about how the various macronutrians and mice in nutrients and called adapted on this very mysterious cup we compounds e another word adapted en gets thrown around much t is but as long as we ting about adaptation i think o that will be fair play for the a discussion in the next episode about nutrition and supplementation in my laboratory when we study stress we use a number of different markers subjective reports of how stress people feel a tartrates morning tartrates heartrit versatility sort is all free cortex all and on and on what are some of the other markers of stress as it relates to exercise adaptations and recovery because once again i think were seen a lot of parallels between the study of psychological stress and the study of physical stress as it relates to exercise adaptation remember entries of physiology stress is stress this is why we have this cool term of astatic load or aliases such that it really does not matter which system you test for it will reflect over all stress a you met me mentioned several of them we have got done talking about some bile markers atrarvy an warrant are another great example because s what you are trying to do is this when we were talking about the muscle soreness thing we were really getting at was a marker of how to i fix the overuse in that particular muscle now we have really transition into global markers of onerous and why these are problematic or important to pay attention to rather is again these indicators t a you didn't just work a muscle out too hard but you have actually done something were you have compromised all of your physiology to a level where you have influenced a circulating caticolamean or something is going to influence dutiful markers now your sleep in your mood in your behavior that is why these seems are problematic that is said you could look at resting heart rate not a bad thing to do however tat does have multiple downsides one thing we do know is you resting hart rate will elevate with excessive stress slope this actually does not matter if it is physical stress or psychological stress or a combination you will see that number drift up over time here is the downside though it is not tremendous sensitive to smaller stresses another words if you were to do something alcohol's a very good example you will see your resting heart rate elevate with alcholho use am excess of tobacco use and psychological stress however if you do something small or a hard training sessions resting harrigte's not sennit enough to pick that up it will actually probably stay the same for those reasons we do not actually use resting heart rate that much we will take it but it is not our primary indicator that being said h army is a better use just wear the quickly for those are not familiar a your heart rate less say for example you your resting heart rates sixty beats permanent that means every second it is beating does not actually happen on a consistent rhythm such that it would beat on second one beat on second too beat on second three et camera the rate is more variable a might beat beat beat beat beat beat there is a variation in the heart rate and at the end of that sixty seconds in this example you would have still completed sixty beats they is art on exact same patter will one thing that is actually quite interesting is the a mount of variation in your heart rate is actually associated with your over all sympathetic or para sympathetic state such that a large variation an a rhythmic pattern is generally more representative of being more rested and recovered in being more pars sympathetic a you will notice during times of extremely high stress you will be very rhythmic beat beat beat beat be and this is a little bit of a of a confusing idea but a high ah great is there indicated of a lot of variation meaning your pretty recovered a low ah a be meaning there is not lot of variation means your probably pretty stressed and wire its is a related to heart rate but in my opinion is a significantly better marker of that now one thing you want pay attention to if you do this a couple of things there are some accuracy issues with many the devices basely everybody at this point probably has some device a that is telling them their h are what you do not want to do is simply compare your number to somebody else for a lot of reasons not all of these acnowlegies are actually even measuring the same thing i against some of them are actually combining with other metrics and calling at you are over all readiness or your recovery and now w what we have actually done is made a couple of assumptions an the stack them on a whole host of other assumptions and the gain you in number and you do not know what that sort of black blow score actually in represent i would caution one against taking too much a information from that if you are actually measuring are even within that there is a loss of ways to calculate it that are not important here do not necessarily worry about the score when con compare it to yourself but not to others what you will see as if you use similar devices and techniques ye is hard to find day to here but in general people that are a over weight i might have a little bit of a of a lower score as in a worst score a we need more in formation on that to be clear in large part the best way to use something h are is to measure it under the exacting circumstances every day whether you going to use a just a device a on your watch or your phone or your bed or anything else or you can buy a special afar under its fine just take that measure a the same time a mostly this means first thing the morning you wake up you go the bath when you come back down and take your measure some that you do not what sometimes you took it before food than after your look your shown all the other things ti can influence rest d take at not usually take somewhere between seconds some minutes to record you want pay ton know that now one things you will notice is there is a natural change in your h a it just happens and what you cannot really want to pay attention to is i guess answering the question of how much of a change in h are has to happen before i should care bandit is hard to answer right let us to say your ah are was a hundred i dismay that number of what if you wake up to moron its ninety nine what is that mean we i do not know if you wake up to morrow in it is twenty that is probably a bad thing where's that line it is hard one thing i would recommend doing is taking your h a b for at least a month before you start using that value to make any changes and you re commend taking at first thing in the morning yet always roughly the same time basely under the same circumstances it does not have to be ticking in the morning but because your day we will change on most days of i get into a that is the most stable thing in your life i would take it then and i would collect it for least a day at least a month rather maybeven six weeks and then give yourself basely running average what we quite honestly do is a we will actually track it for for ever and then what we always look at is what sit to day relative to the last week on average and what is that look to our historical average and we always compare those things and you also want to make sure you compare to sone other words i generally wen not going to worry about to days h arbyscore relative to to morrows what i want a look at is to days relative to this exactsime day last week ism not for out this but for non out that this is very important imagine do not worry about the difference between h arbyscore n money compare to tuesday pay attention to money compared the last money and the money before that that is because you typically have the same sort of weekly schedule and you do not want to do is you say look at monkeys h are score which is a reflection of what happened sundae and compare that to tuesdays which is actually reflection what happened money you probably did not do the same stressor on sundae is monkeys we are not actually comparing the same thing but if you have a general weekly schedule you likely to compare this monkeys reset to last monkeys because they are both comparing what happen on the previous days i did that sort of distinction makes sense absolutely i do the standing with body weight by the way if your trying to tract body mascon or fat loss or something compare the you can look at the daily changes but you need to pay attention o what that normal distribution is if you conto do that money to money thing that will give you a rough aria of saying o k my normal weekly variation is say five my average is one hundred but i will fluctuate between ninety five to one or five that is my standard deviation is o a science dorks would call that if you start very a changing more than five per cent outside of your normalstantardeviation then ism mut a start paying attention a little bit and ism an actual run a little bit an algorithm on this one and here is my thinking process when i get a the really any metric but at v was is example using first step did i collect good data and by that i mean again did i measure the same way i measured every single day or did i get up and look at my phone first and i realized old crap i forgot to take my start and then i went back neither say i had a fifteen percent derivation from my normal number and the i realized oh ye that is right i was a superlative last night doing whatever o get get ism let at consider that bad data you did not good it it is bad day that ism not doing anything ignore bat at you throw out you soft use it if you decide for the most baronesses some it was good data o era the ism going on to my next question which is is it acute and there was is it just to my right or is it chronic as real this is it is this pattern ben happening for more than five days or at least three had the last fore or something that three minimum is what i honestly i gent look at five or more days that is a very big distinction if it is something that just happened to day and the next question in when i ask myself is an it in that adaptation things an mi trying to be in a phase we found trying to cause an insults to the body that it needs respond within that is the case ism just on ignore it in fact it is almost sometimes a good tine hey we are stressing the body and it is stressed what we are doing is working amazing in fact if yo do not see that a sort of moon ma were not do not to bush the pase i for great if the answer is no where in a piking phase then we are actual gin to use what i call acute state shifters the is ha whole whose of little tricks that i have that can change h r v or any recovery metric within seconds again these are not chronic fixes this is just ism having a bad day to day i feel crap can i make myself feel better right now and i can't call these parlor tricks a lot of the times and there is a the thousand of them we are stealing i con govetham but it'll give you some examples ism you can pull out first shall physical movement will do you b be stunned he'll just down some yoga moving around and some jumping jacks starting your work out you mean you've probably experience this is sort of cricket and or world this point but ism if you ever do any serious lifting over serious om mat time there will be days when which you walk in the jet and you feel awful and somehow that day you sent a lifetime pair ye that is a strange strange phenomena a i experience that more than a few times i it is rare the universe is rare however you feel great you've a horrible work out it happens yeoman it examen for any number of different reasons but y i think the the former when one is not feeling very good and then somehow it a terrific work out does set a kind of a seed of doubt ass to how good our subjective assassin is really are i much i guess is why we are talking about i objective a segments ye a shabby and remember if it is a single day here you can even do hard training a people sort of have this idea well if you get up in your recovery course down do a lighter day that's probing it to can probing never make in that choice to be honest not in the situation remember this is one bad day and we are in a phase of even trying to improve performance right now were probably still training hard you will again often see i felt terrible when i train superhero and it totally change my day around this all can happen to exercises my first love here ism absolutely breathing any sort of regulation breathing we talked a lot about down regulation breathing just do the opposite and this is whole hyper ventilation strategies can work instead of accentuating the exhale you eccatuate the in hale you we strict the exhales this working in the exact opposite situation you can also play little this is wore things music motivational quotes if you are the type that follows people on intrigant that motivates you or can work of these things ism coaching tactics these can be things ism finding out or talking about that persons why i you sort of share something that monte you use when you are training hard to keep you go better ism when i can ask you to share that now but some b pole have that sometimes right or you may have this conversation with your ailing that we we call this finding out your why right final why you really here what all be doing here and a lot of times you will hear things it is because i grow up poor not o her wont o be poor of gaga or this is for my children or la any number of things you can pull that out on these days you need to be really careful this why call these parlor tricks because when you play that card too often it is sort to lose a fact right and you can only dig to a whole often before it is sort ism the same thing as with music right if you every time you go the wait room it is blessing deaf metal at level ten will eventually it is not in this no longer motivating right is no longer helpful i you want o the ploy these things strategic yet the the phrase comes to mind is signal the noise the nervous system an specially the demean system and the eddrernal and system which are part of this larger system call the catacoloming systems that opening pinafore noropan effort the they get up and go for canon external goals a movement associated its anoranon that that system responds best to high signal a relative to noise if your as you point out ism listening music every come tricking a con of caring energy during are work out a neurotics and then you stacking all those things a sometimes refer this is dopamine stacking can formally refer to its opening sacking you are doing all those things then you first all then you are wondering why a later that afternoon or the next day you are feeling your you are under a cloud it was obviousyour your catacolman system crash but it is also that am you do not assuredly become dependent on it it is just that you start to wonder whether not you have the internal mechanisms and motivation to train without those things and one tense use them more or more than they have a diminishing effect over time think a the rule that have been a sort of applying has been i never do to work outs in a row we ism stacking in a stimulate loud music and any kind of a sort of high potency inspiration however every set in the him or when i run i really trying be diligent about form an attention to what ism doing the one exception would be the long deration endurance work part of the reason i do that work is to let my mind go into states of drifting i ism not trying to thinking complete sentences or even close to it just let my my bring kind of idle at at a low hum ah and for that reason generally listen to some thing that is u more of a story or do not listen's anything at all and just let my thoughts kind of school through anyway i do not not take us too far off track but i think this a i dead of signal the noise will resinate with the engineers out there but since most people are likely not engineers it is the way that the nervous system works am evidence by the fact that whatever air of your body wright now is in contact with a chair or ism any other surface that is been in contact with for more than a few seconds you forget that it is in contact with it as there is low signal the noise at that point similar note you actually mention stimulant spacey there whet they are talking caff can or any other stimulant any other cortesall modulators are adapted ins any o these things fall in the category if you are not using them consistently anyone having a rough day and all son you throw down to inter telegrams of coffin it is going to change real fast the to ta strong performance dancing effect ye absolute and for these reasons fit miso we mention a couple of broth work i food more calories just eating some food i sometimes will give people couple recall comporfoods this is just hey your a your from georgia and we know you love grits we're having grits for breakfast oh my gray just something to change or mood acute stateshifters ism to alter it the other couple of tricks here are light if we know that may be see molt wold people struggling that day may be will put on the lights extradite will bring us some actor things an just get it more ligntlyrei not the then account actually going outside and seen the sun but perhaps will do that i and then other little tricks that have learn over the years is a one particular thing i love is little drawing a line a physical line on the ground and you look at that line and you say ism going to train today and ism going to accomplish this effort ism not going to walk past this line and into that training space until i am ready to give that effort and that may take a minute or ten or whatever but it it it is the physical barrier is very important to saying ism not distgonto get through it ism going to actually perform the way i want to perform or ism not going to do it and ism not going across this line unis ism ready to make that happen i i really that tool it also a brings to mine the importance of at least thinking about how your relationship with your phone during training ism can perhaps help but also impede work out motivation in performance in an earlier episode you mention that if people are using their phone to play music during their work out that they establish the complete playlet prior to initiating the work out and the not deviate from that playlet a supposed to changing it in the middle be casuist too much of a a of an impulse to also check shomedia the male chectects messages the way i think about the phone actually is it a bunch of them a brain areas it is got a memory system for you it is got look up tables for at look up table it is got websites to look things up on the inner net it is got photos an it is rich with sensory data and it closely link to our own brain architecture the algorisms are designed comfort those to be that way that i always think about it as bringing in a second person with me but that person is it my twin that ism has severe attention issues and for those that already have attention issues just think about this is a a twin that within compound you by tapping on your shoulder talking t you all the time interrupting you is somebody the you the lot but that frankly is um is a lie be irritating in that their their interrupting your ability to real my show up and also durability to show up for them i you start to thing about the phone as a entire individual and that re presents me and uncertainly a not the better version of me exactly you actually mention something else that will use a occasionally which a will be call brain games or puzzles whether this is a crossword puzzle or something where you actually lose your thought of self for second and your brain is engaged in a task that you ware not regretting or even thinking about these can be stupid little games it could be little challenge s especially for a group or team setting i work a play one round of dogear or were to play one round of o thumb work you do encourage this ye i say you would play a thing as see of warming up sic ai getting a will get going er young get your overall or your dinner whatever things is our everyone line up and were to play thumb rows to see we whens i just whatever right also you have snapped into a new want shift a or literally playing brain games playing taters on your one any these things am can work in this acute setting can ask your question it is not directly relate to recovery a perse say but i think it is worth mentioning am or asking about rather which is the use of mirrors or no mirrors while training m the experience of seen oneself and observing one's form in the mirror i suppose has some utility you can get some sense of progress that you my trigger am is you're almost specially referring to a resistance training suppose it could be card yo if your running on a tread mill or pushing a ladder something but am you can see form am you can get a sense of am what your face looks when you grimace but in all seriousness am you are without question a person not you and but am one is in a less interceptive mode when looking at themselves in the mirror t extrareception perperception of things beyond the confines of our skin even if it is a picture of us interception perception a everything from the skin inward a and if were looking at ourselves we are diverting some location of our attention let say there is a hundred these arbitrary units and you can that fifty percent of your attention on the feeling in your body or the muscles your training am in fifty percent on how it appears in the mirror or it could be a under percent on the mirror under per cent internally which you best accomplish folly by closing your eyes so obviously their constraints here certain movements you would not ant to close your eyes et camera in general what are your thoughts on mirrors or no mirrors for resistance training specifically it depends on the metric that you find most important and what i mean by this is if you are training for say muscle high perched either emerging evidence tat suggests a actually looking at yourself in the mirror and even flexing in between sets am can actually be advantageous or can augments muscle gave oh my there a support for all the the a mirror flexors chubbily not to making fun of you i just this is for interesting to be on the observing side of of that but my listen results or what people are after yet having said that if you are trying unhands movement learning then it may be detrimental if you are doing an exercise that is explosive and fast it is probably not the best thing to be looking in a mirror ism if you were to walk into any elympic way lifting arena and you had any thoughts of using a mirror you would probably run out of the gym very very quickly you cannot see yourself in time to make an adjustment with the movement tats happening that fast and also will do exactly which you mention chichis it will remove your ability to understand and feel the movement and this is a big component to using technology for exercise at all is you have to make sure that the end point is you understanding you and your physiology more not less when you outsource learning to technology in this case even it the technology is the mirror you remove your ability to gain and truly understand that learning process you need t be very very careful whether you using a mirror or whether you using any number of as where you can record say a movement and then watch it afterwards and it will give you a break down if your hand was in the right spot or if it was the my spot these are all great but you need to then take the next step which is to say i need to be able to feel that position is in the case o performance if you can imagine trying to learn a new techniques running technique and you have to be able watch yourself in the mirror to understand your stride in my position if you do not take the next step of saying up cade now i ndn'll have to look in the mir and i can feel when ism getting out of rhythm or whatever the cases then you will never be able to actually than use that in your race and it is very very important people again pay attention to what is the dependent vary while the you actually interested in doing if you are trying to get better at something the ten is o case of starting place it just cannot be the finishing place thank you for those reflections ism curious as to what happens or what one should do if there each a v is reduced for may be three or four or more days in a row absolutely the next question than amen i ask is gain am i in that adaptation face if ism going to still ignore it just i did if it was a single tad day but ism in a start watching it very carefully i may actually now i introduce some other tests i may use a performance us may look at something else may be asked questions may be have some communication either with myself for somebody else i'mmist our paying more attention but ism still really nothing to take much action and tell that cross is more than seven days of consistent problems i if it does do that or were in a piking face then iron to got to a other set of solutions that are truly going to pull me out of the whole rather than just be a those acute state shifters these or more what i call chronic say shifters now some of these are actually very sigil r to the ones we have used before for example thermalstras i can promise you if you are recovery score is in the tanks and you walk outside and you jump in your thirty five degree water and you get back out what is going to happen is your h r sore immediately afterwards and ism talking within seconds is going to be significantly compromise right now always think about that member low h r v means high sympathetic i promise you cold water well pus you in a high sympathetic drive however and we have tested this pretty extensively looking at a car v zero fifteen thirty sixty ninety all thewy up to a hundred eighty minutes post and on average you will see your h r score continue to rise after that and well you have this immediate sympathetic response you will immediately then respond y about thirty minutes on most people depends on the personal and that score will be improved for several hours afterwards ahead can kin have a similar effect that actually again as at it is sort of an acute fix but over time as we have described earlier that can also have a litlabit of a chronic effect we can also then get into areas sleep and now we to start playing and exploring we a are you sleeping for as well or was your sleep score fine but your h r v was low that is a little bit of a different answer if your sleep is getting compromise that retest our going in to in making sure we are improving our sleep a in terms of brainstuff instead of may be playing a game or having music or something s other trick those are not on a really have a chronic effect but you can do things work on social connection that is actually been shown to improve a recovery over time you can do things journalling or meditation and those have an acute effect as well as a chronic a facts again if you go journal right now you probably feel better but also we know that over time that will gradually improve things adaptions and things that also can have a chronic effect can things electrolights or food or hydration if those things were were off we are gong to go to a whole number of areas but those of the primary ones outstanding of all that of curse it may be simply a time to go back and reassess a training program that is truly the case that is what were at if we are probably going to either completely remove training or drop at the fifty per cent or until we start rebounding back to base line that is generally the numbers we use for many people who are not training for a compete sport it maybe are not pushing themselves really hard maybe a there they consider themselves somehow you exercises in order maintain health ism anestheticsand a lunchevity et camera a and they never really finish any work out completely exhausted there sleeping of their appetites of can we assume that they are recovering well am or may be there not creating enough of a adaptation response that there is no progressive over reaching and there is really know stimulus for recovery what ism sing here is on the the face of it i think is obvious right if you do not train hard there is nothing to recover from what am really saying is is the ability to recover itself something that we need to train in other words can we get better at recovering and the a analogy here would be something focus in order to a perform work of any kind but certainly mental work and physical worth we need be able to focus the ability of focus is the reflection of a bunch of curl circuits and chemicals and hormones et camera but we know roughly what those are and we know that if you are poor at focusing for every small bit of time that you can focus a little bit longer even its a matter of seconds those circuits themselves get better at focusing and on in forth in other words is the recovery system however broad no transmit hormones curl muscular immune base et camera can that system are set of systems become better can we get better at recovering unmeaning can i become faster and a a more effective am can we think of the recovery system as kind of a blade that get sharper by engaging recovery because if then there is strong reason for people who are not pushing really hard to push at least a little bit harder than is comfortable for them every once in a while to make sure that that system does not start a slide back remember physiology is listening to everything you do and it is always responding the analogy that i will meet your apology with that i use here is the bowling ally you have probably been bowling before and you have used the bumper lanes right bumperlanes i have gone bowling before and i spend time in the gutter and have spend time on n the pins i a been a while we s t have a bowlingalling the town who went to m this fun we to slide around on their shoes an it all the kids would hang out there and i feel it last till have bowling allies i do not even know if feels a halomthing that may have gone the the way of the the mid two thousands i do not care no one bills any more you not can a in my good anal o we what but what it intend was not to ruin your analogy a one ts hunt bowling all the bowlers singing to come after me with with a bowling balls i here a get at lasted with all the starts in elevations a done o if what one were to go bowling and they did not want to put their bawl on the outer you could put these little bumpers in those land and these little film pads that go on the gutter that if your bowl is going towards the gutter hits those and bounces off and goes back in the lane right o can in n this entire conversation an this is actually true of a lot of the way people approach the fitness and health people are very concerned often times with optimizing meaning i want to make sure i do not go in the gutter i do not want to hit the walls therefore cumin a try to improve the accuracy in which i throw the ball on to make sure that ism throwing it down the scent of the lane more often and i want to get my dis my stantideviation tighter an tighter that i do not get anywhere close to hitting the wall however what they are not realizing is if you do that the body will start shrinking the size of the lane cause what a back says is h we have not haw ta ball touch us in years we do not need to be this wide let us get smaller and smaller and smaller it is not the you actually are having a reduced ability to recover but you start becoming incredibly sensitive to that you are two strategies for n hance young recovery are to practice getting closer of throwing that ball down the middle lane or to widen to widen the alley that is exactly what you are referring to and you absolutely should do that and what happens is you do not have to be precise with what you are doing because you are ability to handle many things is widen if you are off now by four or five inches to the right no problem because you have just tripled the size of your alley that is exactly what you want to do paying attention to two things number one is getting better at accuracy maybe staying really tight with your progressions i using nutrition and see to optimize your recovery and push your rasilians is what we call this in fact there is actually a biological we to measure resilient we we do that in all of our folks am this is scientific valuation of and it is make it up you can action measure recilliencs on there is more and more coming out on this but that is exactly what that vermin how well can you handle and bang things off this vessel when you see a reduction in say ten per cent of your each a be today for you that make make you feel terrible for me i might not feel anything because ism well adapted to large fluctuations and therefore ism mocha the less unless you do that the more and more responsive you will be to those slight deviations that is exactly the target that is kindle what i dude to when i say you got understand what we optimizing for we optimizing for making sure i do not feel any different to day or we optimize and make sure when i do feel different i still am able to perform i this is why you want to do things maybe you some can today and feel great but if i have to use it every day all ism doing is shrinking my sensitivity there now if i have to go a day without it i cannot train it all right canine is the easy example cops people understand how that holds smirk but this is really true of everything else yet you need to practice this and the way to do that is to give yourself more star s to continue to bring in the stress from nutrition from training from breath work m you mention earlier about focus the exact same thing wright is not just about getting better right now it is about training a system and you can clearly train that right we will often say breath work is a practice that is exactly we were talking about right you are practising getting better at these things ore practising returning your focus you are practising recovering and quite literally physiologically you can regulate we they were talking ensiles wit they we are talking about regulators these will be unregulated the the time next time that that insult comes in it is not as because sits damaging yet absolutely you can and you should strike for that throughout all the episodes where we have been talking about exercise that the core of that is the word adaptations and i love that you mention that breath work can also create adaptations the way ism visualizing all of this now is that resistance training with waits machine's bodily otherwise carry of vascular training running jogging sprinting jumping and on thermal training exposure to heat exposure to cold in a dedicated way and deliberate respiration act breathing or breath work as a practice all of those can be viewed as ways to trigger adaptations and in the contacts of recovery the specific adaptations you are trying to engage are opposite distress in fact with the exception of perhaps deliberate cold exposure maybe deliberate heat exposure cause if the saints really hot you can get the dinorphan release which is kind of uncomfortable but still in both those cases the rebound from that in others when you get out you shower go to bed the next morning you do have this kind of bliss out feeling we know why that is that is the rebound to that uncomfortable situation it seems it does not really matter whether not you are re using resistance you are been carnigascular training using thermal approach is ere you are using respiration based approaches all of these are really ways of both triggering adaptations and if applied properly to actually help you recover from the stress and create the the literal result that your that you are trying to achieve for some people that might have been obvious but i think for many people including myself this set of conversations that we have been having of the series these episodes usually the first time the have ever thought about exercise in these ways in any event it is just a reflection but it is one that at least for me it is tremendously useful because it has a lot of a organizational logic to it ah which at least appeals to to my brain because the more the things have a logic the more for me that they become simplified in the more that the vast array of tools a becomes a becomes visible to me as you said earlier what is it let me ma shrike at this rite it is a concepts are few methods are many pretticlos o how would you put behind is how you state it methods are many confess or few a go either the directionality probably it does not no let us keep it right the the methods are many a concepts are few am a japan's law i inside you're not low to name things after yourself am but you can i a think after other people i it is a japan's law because ism deafly the one who created that idea a absolutely that was extreme and tremendous sarcasm to sowers alter i regardless here we go a gallons law the i go one thing that is in my head right now is we have thrown out a lot of options for folks and maybe what we can do is try to simplify a little bit what i can kind of walk you through is how we measure recovery if you will and how often and some tools and what i would recommend people do is not use everything i said you want a pick one or two things or category that are most important to you that are at your cost better at your availability that or interesting and important relevant to you and do that the reason i kind ofwonte to cover a a large number of things was to give folks options but again i want emphasize the point is to not measure all of them in fact you do not need to we a have ran this before with professional this wear we have taken blood you are every single day we have done performance measures a vertical jumps on a force plate hold not to things every day for years on end and what i can tell you is there is tremendous for constancy in physiology right everything as everything you do not need to do them and do not feel your missing out if you are not doing them one or two metrics is probably find i generally recommend one subjective measure this could be as simple as what is your mood how d you feel to day great and one objective measure each are a resting heart ray anything ours right if you even literally just did that you probably have pretty good insight as to what you dong maybe in fact on all legal more detail here maybe give you couple of examples of things to measure every day some things that you should measure maybe a orderly monthly and then maybe even in some mi annually and then you can maybe just pick a couple for mess categories and have yourself a pretty good monitoring system for what to do and all include some that a a little b a technology basin an others that are totally costryane require nothing of cate start off i would recommend taking something ah are v every day or or most days if you do not have a device that you could also use honesty a the seal to tolerance just and we have talked about that a number of times and we probe up pony resources girl find that but that does not require anything at typically takes about a minute or and you can do that under the same so circumstances in which each aver in other words do at the same time every day have the same scentetizations of and that is actually been in our coaching experience a while admittedly there is no paper offered research on this yet just in our experience is tends to tract extremely closely with a h are and other metrics of recovery in fact we actually did do a a pilot trial in my lab and it ta attract decently well with both state and trade anxiety a it is a nice metric not perfect but u you could take that if you wanted you could do both abut again remember you are trying to capture system express and you are really just showing your measuring one thing to ways you do not necessarily have to have them both i will do both because i consuperinteted in small differences but globally they are going to tell you basely the same thing those or two things will be use again basely daily you are out or or close to it if you want go pass out a little bid you can look at you can use an actual a a a pretty old a commonly used survey called a dada d a l d a i forget the exact acronym but it is a fairly lengthy question air and it accounts for things how field to day how to you see a stresses going on i life how you been eating and its is is fairly comprehensive lengthy sure a that came out i mean jerseys probably been round for thirty years or something sis it is nothing new and been used extensively a i you would not want do that every day if you wanted to take some subject to measures every day we typically stick with have said mood a motivation something that you you could perform this all detest to something more monthly or at the end of each training phase in every couple of months and probably worth looking at it is not in i tell you if you'ein a bad spot to day or to morrow but you would pick that up with the after of year suit tototenisus it would though tell you information especially your working with another individual about major life changes and if anything it just facilitates that conversation i i noticed you reported acts happening let us let us talk about that can i help camera another cot us spiky helpful one is is simply body i have said a nonfunctional over reaching and overstraining are associate with the number of things energy appetite suppression changes in an and body weight or body composition you can measure that a monthly or even really quarterly a depending on what kind of athletic individual your working after if you are trying to special you are not trying to lose waiter if your trying to be at maintenance n the semen ides as well moving pass that now actually were going to move into the realm of things that we call hidden stresses as wit those are all visible stressor ism hidnstressers the most common ones wee sort to mention a and would probably do this you well you no have to these ones through serum this is blood work sort is all we talked about a intestostrone an the o then of course test sovran odors a ratio hen the other ones i mentioned i you can do those quarterly it is not bad there are some blood markers that there is really no sense to do them that soon and there are other markers and being in our system a individuals are getting pretty sense of blood work saliva work yearn and an stool and the the is plenty of those think you just do not need to measure never ten weeks or in this case you course all as sort of changes rapidly testosterone can change pretty quickly but if your really trying to notice a large grand to certainly it cartel or is isn't appropriate time for him doing every four or five weeks probably in necessary sou can she yourself so money and do that mother sun you can look at actually more see i annually in am plasma gludomin and glutting to glutamate ratio and a it can may be save that why you want t of at those for other conversation but those are important we always look at something from the oxide distress things this could be something t enough altar in a human six something that again were loin at that in seem we look at that n see mi annually and then another sneaky actually one am that i love to look at is a the neutral field the lymphasite ratio which you give u some pretty god inside and can you can look at that fairly cartel if a that number stars to get really high certainly more than nine to one you got a pretty could inside that something norias going on at your man system i we will actually take action much lower than that number but that is a nice cut off you will see is that is very very high number i those a some things you can use a most folks have the ability hopefully to get some basic blood work done get a basic what miscall a c b c and c m p i if you have a great physician and yuan get insurance to cover that and you just going and ask for a c b c and c m p they willow what that means yo go glad and they order it you will get all the information typically that i is described or close enough and you will get some insights another you gain you can to use that free service i mention earlier to check to see what are not the changes are i just a matter of testing quality or actually physiological relevant what you just described is an amazingly powerful array of tools ism hoping that you can also mention a feu tools that are either lower cost truly low cost or is zero cost that while they may not have the accuracy or i give the complete picture that some of the bile markers and other tools that you mentioned do that they can still provide reasonably reliable metrics that people can use in order to assess their level of recovery absolutely the seel to colon us best would be the first one i and you can just take that metric time you the other ones we talk about far or things your mood we have not mentioned libido but that is another a testament that people also tend to have a pretty good grip on and they know what feels normal when things go out a wack it tends to be a pretty good signal that people will recognize end one note about that a something it came up in an episode on a on hormones not for male and female health a that at some point it will air am which is that know there is no objective measure for people in terms of libido across the board meaning people very tremendously am age life circumstance is am and on and on and a this is one of those subjective measures that i think people need to a have some sense of what their quitiga base line really is and ism guessing that the time to assess that might best be a when initiating or midway through a relatively low intensity training face am maybe during the time of year in which all the other factors am that can influence libido are not a at their maximum if you thing about yon light and dopamine in the relationship between those and the testosterone estrogen systems we know that libido a testostro an estrogen men and women a tends to pick in the summer months if that is your base line that your comparing to i do not know that that is as reliable as a being something the the fall or the spring a and anyway this again is very subjective but the discouraged people to a recognize that there is no standard numbers for this no look up table d there is no equivalent of the libidobiami the elemi a no dice respective that the carney that probably is elemi a i think that is there something to keep in mine as people a the do comparisons were subjective comparisons is do not pick a comparison to an extreme trying pick a comparison to at average as it to be that actually sort of reminded me one issue that we have seen a lot lately is people if their having libido issues or just even slightly noticing a drop they just assume that then their for means or testosterone his crafting and those things are certainly connected but that is not necessarily the case and where that becomes a problem is an people then go a on things tart et camera with no true o for sight and then all kinds other problem make sure that if you on to take that step that you actually get the stops on measure it in your working with a qualified person to guide you though that process do not just assume because your having o energy or your libido is list up it down it could be simply training with it it could belly related could be any number of things a that thine a little bit of or a caution the too quick points along the lines what you just said one interesting thing that i learn when researching our episode on testosterone and estrogen optimization this was an episode that we done some time ago but is still available in er urban laugh to to wall form at et camera is that many people actually increase their libido and even their levels of testosterone at estrogen as they progress from their twenties into their forties if they take excellent care of themselves including the crack exercise adaptations correct body fat to lean a muscle a ratios but of course they can go the other way to a lot of people can be training to achieve such low body fat stores that libido can super it no the age depend a age related declines in libido a are not necessarily am written into the scripture life in fact there are some dato points from really interesting paper a talk about in that episode of a individuals this was o study focuston mails in their eddies and nineties who maintained total in free testosterone as his as a individuals in their twenties but then when you look at the lifestyle factors of those people their ties and nineties they were doing a lot to create that that scenario the second point is one relate to what you just said a which is very true which is people generally tend to assume that a drop in libido is related to a drop in testosterone am and then assume that they need to increase their testostro and in some cases that is true about it is also often the case that people who take estrogen or a romataste blockers that's and ism a inhibitors that prevent the conversion of testosterone to estrogen experience severe dephesists in libido because of estrogen bpollylo old estrogen blockers are as much in issue here as am low testosterone than the final point is also one that a many people now men and women are a a n i think need to be aware of which is that i hydrotestostron do t is among the more powerful androgen for a power output physical power output but also for libido and dak is strongly inhibited by certain things numeric some lot of people taking a doses of numeric a can experience drops in libido t there and a whore taking a a various compounds to prevent hairless yet things finastri o there is a whole catalogue of things that can reduce libido that are not directly in the testosterone pathway that can be dc relater estrogen late and this i think points to the importance of yes take a subjective measure of your libido pay attention a mental be aware do not young do not up wasabi but be aware in trying to rigor out what factors am are involved for you but do not immediately assume that it what is needed is more testosterone and often times a the opposite is the case yet yet try to put on a lot a mascle with no estrade good luck wright in and indeed a lot of a aglets in particular a competed boybillers that have that sedan rap thin skin if you get to know some of those people you talk to them they they can a look the sort of comic book archetype of what a some one might might want to be in that is not with this discussion or these episodes have been about but oftentimes they can have a serious libido issues i mention earlier and i will emphasize it once more you need to be very cachous when you are taking antioxidants ant lavatories cortersall producers for all those reasons or i did not really throw to get an examples but you just nailed another fantastic reason of it we do not give those things prophylactically i a strongly discourage people from just walking around taking supplementation of antioxidants ism specially powerful ones for no reason if you have done some testing and you have a good reason to do a fine or after an a very specific take training fays or something that to but if you just walking around doing that you are often times not always but you're oftentimes causing problems that then you then try to solve by taking more of those antinflamatories i feel terrible lo energy libido bababbabla ism too inflamed et camera ye antioccidents in the form of food are fantastic almost no issue there is a good evidence actually there don't worry about men i should not eat high anti occident rich foods you are goby fine wet were talking about here is form of suitable an supplementation where you can take orders of magnitude hire dosages very quickly can you could in the presence of food that in distinction is also very important i antigen rich foods are generally fine and thus consumed in totally absurd concentrations supplementation powders cream sprogs et cameras where you coat in ta problem yet you want to be very careful of doing that unless you have a reason we do not do that unless a we we see reason to do in some ones markers yet in able compounds despite the fact that the real can be quite potent modulators of of hormones a ashaganda being a an example a two able compounds that we talked a lot about on our parcastbefore an and repeatedly including in that a tesastron astern an optimization a episode a tongaali a an fidogiaggretus am tongaalis now taken by a large number of mend and women am tongaali and fidogia typically a men ism not sure that there any good studies about the effects of fidogia in women those are real compounds that can have potent effects in increasing testosterone and utilizing hormone a do they work yet they work to varying degrees in in most everybody not certainly not in everybody a but they do work but they they work because there potent they have a facts the idea that verbal compounds are not powerful am is a wrong and it is important o remember that that can cut both ways hence might mention of this o observation relate to numeric which is not to say that some people cannot take numeric and feel perfectly fine maintain or even increased their libido that i sure that can happens just that for people that are very deadly sensitive this tends to be an issue the unfortunately for many of these compounds the only way to find out is really to try them or to just completely avoid them in this you do not want to try them is find too but there really are not ways to or did who will respond who will not and who will be hyper responders and in that was it is a bit of a it till bit of wild west ism also o remembering what the point of this conversation was supposed to be and may be all uperturnd back to that at which were some cost are your low cost metrics a that was the very funtangen but nonet less a another couple of ones you can do are a grip strength testing if you can buy a you fairly cheap hand grip dynamometer on any number of places here a typically able to be purchased for twenty to forty dollars or something that ring ism you can actually dis just at everyday have done that ain a number of bathes for a decent by the time admittedly i do not do any more that is not because i disagree that but because we just we are getting the information already and to assist to redundant but if that is the only option it is a great one to do i mention also earlier how i actually speed test over strength test as an earlier indication of overreaching and because of that i a vertical jump test if you have access to a force plate that is great you then you can get to a more induct the characteristics of the force velocity curve and acceleration in things that ism use the lot in high performance situations if not simply looking at your performance and you can cant to go back to one of our earlier episodes when i described coloring my finger tips with high lighters earlier of my life you can do the same thing and got your garage and every day jump up in touch a that marker an see the you are at ism a system that could be done you in also use tools a force transducer and do a standard movement i can say a vertical job or a high poll or something that and measure the velocity and just compare that day to day of a standard load rand you do it every single time with the same load same similar thing can be done u a a mesibalthrop ism you have the same ball you throw the same thing an in this sorter we are at to day you want to do a little bit o warm up but not excessive here you want a con to get an idea of where your base line is andyou do not influence it by the veracity of the warm up every single take as that alone can change it same thing wit stretching acute static stretching directly influence this power production you do not want to go out there and one day do twenty minutestretched before in the other day you and stretch it all that alone will will cause a deviations in your performance try to keep everything you can think of standardizes and that's give you little bit better tail remembering all of these values the bile markers a performs o they have normal variations you just want a figure out first and foremost what those normal variations are for you you have your normal number you have your standard deviation when you strike getting outside o that standardeviation you start paying attention and that is conelik will we we typically call that the graysown and if it isn't theory's own we fine er not busting wit if its outside of that whatever that is for you recognizing that the dragon is smaller for some folks and larger for others but what is normal for you and your situation and then you can make your decisions outside of that when you see numbers that are consistently or more than three to five days in grow or close for the last five days for the last six something that then you may have some cause for action will that was an incredible description of the various tools and modes for recovery and i realize i jump the gun a bit during our discussion about food and supplements but i to think the serves as a nice a precursor to the next episode which is going to be all about nutrition and supplementation if you are learning from and ore enjoying

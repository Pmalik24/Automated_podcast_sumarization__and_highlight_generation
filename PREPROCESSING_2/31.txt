wellfolks there's a big lie that we in the united states keep telling ourselves is particularly true on the rabid true across the board and that lie is that we want our government to be fiscally responsible in some way sheep or form tat is clearly a lie because we keep electing politicians do not be fiscally responsible in any way shape or form regardless of who runs the government the spending it keeps going in one direction and that direction is of there's a reason we are running a thirty for trivial dollar national debt at this point in time and it is likely that that get is going to continue to accrue because nobody takes this problem particularly seriously and the not going to take that promisseriously until we run smack into a wall that is how typically fiscal crises work country spend too much money they are unable to rain it back in beau there are oo many people who become dependents on that spending of the money and then instead of creating some sort of plan to get out of debt people just keep running up those debts running up those duffs its until the time comes the have to take extremely harsh mediating action that is the highlikelihood here why do i say this will because yesterday the house republicans as well as the house democrats passed overwhelmingly yet another continuing resolution and this is the way we now fun the government because were not able to actually have serious negotiations on department department by department level with regard to spending ere not able to negotiate over how much should be spent on defense or how much should be spent on education instead we sort of rap everything up into a ball and then when we cannot get approval on again a year long budget then we go to continuing resolutions which are the short form budgets that continue the government spending an we just get keep the train running and the train will run until the train runs completely off those tracts according to the palestra journal congress clear legislation extending government funny in a march a step that insures of federal worked will remain on the job but does nothing to alleviate underlying political pressures standing from high used at levels record crossing of the southern border and in enduring or new crane the senate pass that measure seventy seventy eighteen followed by house approval three fourteen to one away because again the easiest thing in congress is to get lost in a crowd the easiest thing in congress is i simply side with an overwhelming majority people who say status quod is just keep doing what it is that we are doing right now the two votes sent the measure to president bison's desk with time to spare ahead of a weak ended at line in a replay of recent votes that underscore the fragility of the copy majority according to the waster journal how speaker might coins on re light heavily on democrats to bring it that continuing resolution across the finish line in fact there was a fraught moment when it seemed as though there would not be a majority of republicans in favor of the continuing resolution as it turns out who is able to get a hundred an seven re publicans to to for as supposed to a hundred and six ageing house internal republican rules prevent any republican from moving forward with the bill that does not have at least the support of a majority of republicans and it came very close to the wire on this particular bill chip boy re publican from taxes who does in partake spending seriously he was blasting everybody right left in center about not only the spending but the fact that nobody in congress seems to want to solve serious problems any more by colleges other side of the isle have no problem we wide open borders in angering the people that i represent none and by constentuments to long lot holding the bag of the people o tats through the on lot spending tall it out billion dollars and we people the word ut six kids do for canal boys ting on the scold is i that i represent that is not on o smirk that is that we we poking about that children tall posing because the wide open borders because of the policies about demo great colleagues who refuse to do anything about it not a thing not a thing do my colleagues do about the wide open borders and y wolf continue to speak to my colleagues becaus'll be an order they do not then law dress this comments to the chair we not am speaker i have address thing my comments to the chair the house will be an order a a died thing the chair all behalf of the people that i represent who are dying it takes because of democrat no right because of democrat policy represent a boy then added it does not matter who sitting in the speaker seat or who has the majority we keep doing the same a stupid stuff which requires us to ask pretty simple question w is it that we keep doing the same stupid stuff is that a matter of not having the wright people in power or is it just that the america people refuse to recognize the reality about themselves which is that we constantly say we want a balance the much it we constantly save one o endless money and then as soon as there are is a pole asking what we'll to cut we will run for the hills we have no idea what it is that we would to cut the reason being it is very easy to say broad things that cutting on pork barrel projects here and there ensuring cut a post a posted office in west virgin and surely get rid of a bridge nowhere in plasma that is not clench touch the structural entitlement programs that millions an millions of america have become dependent upon and who are now unwilling to give that up all the third rails of america politics now form in extraordinary spider web of third rails that no one can touch under any circumstances which is why you have seen candidates of both major parties basely side there no longer going to talk about the single biggest problem facing the united states in future decades and that is the spending problem dond'nl trump its out he is not going to touch that spending prom by the way down trump in facts has campaign from the left against fellow con sedatives in the republican party he said that if you talk about we structuring in inclement programs this makes you a liberal now get that makes no sense on the face of it but it is been effective pitch why because again as it turns out many america actually do not want to talk about these things do not prefer to leave that bogy man in the closet rathe an open it up and simply deal with it this is why it frustrates me when you see all f this talk about speaker might johns polishes to also as to get rid of speaker mike johns over a something the continuing resolution o cay i suppose you can do that and then who will it be you are did this routine with even my earthy very due rev mccarthty over vacates did this suggesting that cevmocarthy head given in too much to the democrats despite the fact that the deal that my earthy was trying to go significantly more conservative than the one that actually ended up being cut and then they put in place my johns who again fine guy good conservative but is facing the same exact structural problems that cave my earthy was facing in the first place here is the reality in order for any serious nature change to get done you are going to have to have a unified party control over congress over the senate over the presidency and a dedication by that party to take the hit to take the hit democrats take the hits by the way the something the democrats a good at democrats took the hit in two thousand tend in two thousand intend pastobomicer and the they got shall lacked at the poles it was a very very bad men term for them and they took the hid because they knew that if they could completely restructure the health care system that in the end these wo become entitlements the people relied upon they would rather take the short term hit for the long term gain when was last time re publicans took a short term hit for the long term gain what is t last time they caps something other than total cut the actually fundamentally restructure how finances work in this country n the answers they do not and the reason they do not is because they are afraid they'll be tossed out of office and maybe that is just a a gain a structural imbalance in the way that you party's work it is very easy to get reelected suggesting you arguing to spend more money that does not exist that is very hard to get reelected suggesting thatyou are long to cut money from the federal budget especially from a bunch of people who say that they need that money in the first place but this is why it is appoint of high irritation when people suggest that it just the johns is a bad guy or something the people who are tellingyou that sort thing the people are telling you that its johnson's fault this continuing resolution got passim we've only he had shut down the government more government shut downs to can we done multiple government shut down to the passion years that that change the trajectory of the spending in any real significant way the answer of courses now the people whore on the air right now telling you that the con tinting resolution should been pushed aside in favor of something harsher in favor of a government shut down in favor of a harder bargaining position with jobidon those people are fitting to about the invent striction the intensive structure is with the intensive structure is and unless you have a unified re publican control of the house the senate and the presidency you are not going to get the kind of spending cuts that make it worth while for you to risk your seats as it'll telly what happened thou do a government shut them you're in a end out passing an continual resolution anyway and a monk more people are going to lose their seats we get to more on this in just one second first let us talk about your health balance of nature fruits in

members of the righting press is it really going to do a many damage in the longing i think now but it just under scores again the central problem in america life politicians make a living by line to you and you have choice your choice is whether you being lie to and you decide to go long with their lives or whether you do not being lied to any politician who says he can save you save your family save your society by spending money hear or by restructuring a program there is lying to you the vast majority of choices in your life are up to you an the people rely on politicians too much than uprooting themselves in the foot and then they being to the next grifter who comes along an suggest that he is going to fix whatever problems are at hand a speaking of drifters the situation on the border continues to be a full scale disaster area in fact fascinating piece of from the outpost has been suggested to me by the way by friends over at border patrol as well the numbers of border en counters are dropping fairly significantly since the beginning of the year this rase the question why is that happening we recently went down to the border at the very very beginning of the year and the end of remember had been a water a high water mark in terms of number of migrant encounters the border were on hundreds of thousands o people in one month alone and then begneganuary you saw kind and not much one of the theories that was floated by border patrol was the basically jo bison had cut a d you with of the it is manual lope orator who is the leader ammo the leader of mexico to basically cut down on the illegal emigration in an election ear and now this is being pretty openly suggested by tod bondsman over the negro post quit just in time for election ear corner crossing to plummeted assign that yo bison has struck a secret deal with the medical president's help is campaign again this would not be the biggest shock in the world remember broklama i this with dementia metedevan two thousand twelve yo literally sat next to him and said twelve ladimeer it'll have more flexibility after the election remember when donate trump tells a for in country he wants them to do something for electoral purposes that is impeachable we baron mama does it in the middle of an election cycle lustrous politics apparently according to the hero post daily for patrol in counters of a legal emigrants crossing the border was twelve thousand to fourteen thousand per day at the end of remember but according to government dato confidentially shared with me it is dropped to a still managouraly catastrophic yet smaller four thousand to five thousand per day why exactly is that happening well there are bongo bide administration diplomatic missions to mexico city over christian medical media in fact has ben reporting what was said here is some of the news quote medical law enforcement officials are rounding up emigrants in the country's north and shipping them by busanair plane to southern cities capitula in shop state and villa endmost in tobacco state there re all expected to go homers that put alongside those continuing to enter from guatemala and then another story to eliminate another obvious draw medical authorities have emptied and then builds at least one longstanding migrant camp the sprawling one in motamoros across the reran from brown'svilt and dug deep ans hopnastrain trenches to further deniaccess to popular crossings there it was done under you as pressure according to one medical newspaper apparently it sounds very much as though mexico is doing jobidon a favor in fact according to medical media this part of a border agreement signed by lexicons in migration service and border patrol to black and north bound emigrants on public roads as well what exactly is mexico getting in return ammo has called for twenty billion dollars to be shared among his country and some others for starters going to meteoroports it is also posbwele the widen is telling ammo that his going to do better with bison than he would with trump that would not be a shock in any way shape or form it has become a priority to jobidon to get the emigration issue off the from pages presumably this is why jobidon is now thinking about caving on emigration as he should hive been saying for months at this point than it is political you practice for job not to cave on emigration it makes no sent for him to effectively push the far left to open borders line in the face of terrible pulling numbers when he is running in an absolute neck and neck dog fight with dona trump it makes zero sent whatsoever by the way t latest pollingdina has mobile with a very very slim lead overdonald trump in an potential presidential contest your member that be in the popular voteless donate trump if he is within one point of job nationally good showman's the electoral college however there are couple of surveys that are out one from dipsos and one from yugov that give biding t lead of between one and to percentage point it is the zig dog fight no matter how you like tat there are zero poles right now zero poles that have hoiden up ondonald trump in any significant

cave on emigration hell the answer is he is now starting to now he is finally staring see political reality which actually by the way for the country is a good thing you want present bison to govern a lot more from the idle than he has thus far according to the waster journal an am ration til being craton i the set it would limit migranstability to claim asylum at the southern border a white house concession some progressive say shows that president binders leftward shifts on immigration as a twenty twenty candidate was a blip in his long political career this of course would bewared for new war aid for train for israel fortiwan housebreaker might johns set after a meeting with jobidon on wednesday the white has said we talk lout the necessary elements to solve this problem he said that would require reform to the broken asylum and parole systems pearl is basically where jobidon simply declaims that much people are in the country illegally have been paroled and can thus wander the country freely the ham been amnestied but it is fine and as far as asylum the current asylum system is you come to the country you claim just favor hand you say i fear to go home to my home country the releasing o the countryman seventy to ours inner gone republicans would remain in mexico bids not giving them remain in mexico far this is what they should push for by the way republicans should push for remain in mexico as national emigration policy however jobidon is in fact moving at this point he is moving again because the plumbers for him are did sixty eight per sent of those survey and he we be us at newspole say they disapprove of his borer policies he is now moving and shifting on this particular issue bison apparently again he does not want remain in mexico because his a far that if he says remain in mexico than tat wild give something for trump to run on which is weird as that it is bad logic if he did remain i mexico he would have to it the trump was right in the first place but also he would say that he got a right now what exactly is the major issue apparently the president was originally influenced by wait frit first late doctor jobidnew is originally doctor jobidon who push him to the left on emigration because she is very upset with family separations and remain in mexico she had visited a tent of migrant living just to cross the southern border in matadors one most dangerous cities in mexico he got rid of remain in mexico and all the rest but now it looks as though he is been to have to bring back some of this stuff he is still uncomfortable if bringing back any form of remain in mexico according to the waltz journal but advisers our bringing him numerous ideas on wees to run that program that give priority to migrants safety maybe he willing back remain in mexico which by the way according to my friends in for para would be the single biggest change he could make though actually shut down mass migration to the border in fact he is being pushed to his right even by democrats according to the daily wire fourteen house democrats voted to denounce the bide administration to open borer's policies on wednesday the group of party defector join with all voting republicans in passing a resolution introduced by representative nathanial more an republican of taxes twelve democrats an nine republicans did not vote in additions who denouncing jobiton's water policies the resolution condemned the national security and public safety crisis along the south west o border it will be interesting to see what exactly happens here dona trump for his part is is doing something somewhat strange trump has been a suggesting that perhaps republicans should not cut any deal with job nine emigration whatsoever these of the connagul then presumably hes can be able to taws that he is more modern and emigrate on emigration than he has hereto forbid but honestly that is not the way the congressional politics typically ought to work if you get a big concession out of democratic present yo do it and trumpkans to run on it in one thing that you're not cons my bid an run on is masked potations that the taco trump is running on here he was yesterday but the re also people the country o countries do not want then that sending the best people over the gas a smart i know the presidents the dictators the primeministers ocobselves primeministers but they were shard people and then that sending there hard workers of the t you get a lot of people coming into our country that pul not get a want we do not want and tiger t have the largest deportation of the history again trump is not can get out flanks by bison on emigration policies congressional republicans ought to very seriously push jobidon as far as they can and then take a wind it s good to take winds from job i understand than we now live in a weird universe in which somehow price giant concessions out of jobidon is considered a loss of some sort but that is not how this works the inflation reduction act was lost is got zero concessions out of jobidon on the inflation production actor could just kill that one outright but on this one republicans actually do by enlarge want israel aid republicans are split fairly down the middle on you craned they do want more ad for titan and they certainly want wire bored security measures and you get what toucan get because frankly there is no guarantee that donate trumpet on t be president come canary twenty twenty five anyway he ought to get what is on the table the fact tho my johns and the republicans have maneuvered joining to a bad immigration position is good for them and if they can get a big concession out of that they absolutely should let more on this in just one second first the kinship piroshki is supported by

to see the lengths to which the media will go in order to generate weird stories about him day before yesterday done trump was spotted coming out of the new york courthouse n us raising his hand and don he is waving to the cameras and he appears to have some sort of strange i do not know wat they how wounds on his hand red markings on his hand and this led you widesprin speculation on left about why dona trump have these things on his hands here was morning ones bemusing the make is because you's actionably a bean making hi table do we have any answer on what butts on dotty trumps a doll trump has ads of is has hands or sing looks he has a ta is music mar her was it looks is a sore on his index finger there i do not know i may is music marker i don o look i that is blood is that a a bat a speculator now but the was that an is a to i had the sort room yesterday is ta the well tell why an that there was a pointing time during the day for trump the very frustrated with a caplin bant his hands dow on the table i out that it i lives a tat was air come from that what could they be exonerated by that perhaps man a sheering by the way that that isn't there s sell the least stupid explanation given my democrats have also heard leprosy in not getting if these to be the beginning signs of leprosy o watching papillon or something and and then names carving comes downs is make it syphilis ow these people if you go to the drudge report nothing it will still be up that that there is a story that talks about to heaven hand cut and you can lake to it they do not look cuts to me they look sort and it'd ask a number of ides what medic condition manifest itself through hand sort and the answer is immediate kinda items secondary siphons i i think i think there is good chances man has to clap and ism not be in particular secret of about it i am taxing the photo you can lake point is an some operation call a day my it some brutish thing is probably o fleet straight rag but tit o maybe o picture was doctor or whatever but i maybe ta stories somewhere make it will not but ism telling it will not o'clock eaten a up in is thing a young all on old furniture speopln't a ridiculous ism sorryingthei're tonally rincomece by the way my most plausible explanation is that dona trump was many smoking asking auburn himself those my burns by the way they do not look actually simplest force just for the record i did ask my eddy wife doctor much he thought it was and you said definitely not simphilist because syphilis is a marking and smaller and generally all over the hand not in a particular aria of the hand this way is my understanding i could be getting that wrong by that is the bottom line is that when we are speculating over the marks on donees frog's hand as pose double biding terrible global policy join is running up ho battle that is why he ought to be giving ground on the immigration issue as far as donate trump donate trumps legal cases again it seems to me at this point you the sidearm out of he box call i just do not think there can no amount touch ta thing after all this hubbub it scan be pretty much everything else with regard to donate trump then that every single time they think they got em than of got every single time they think they have m captured with a butterfly nowt there is a gin hole in the butterfly net that is the latest out of georgia where according to the waster journal full and county district attorney fanny wills is now seeking to avoid being deposed in the divorce proceeding of a college she is accused of having an affair with calling you recent sepia for her testimony a form a herdsmen went is rail her criminal case against forme presedenent dona trump you will recall this bazar case in which apparently fanny wills hired a dude to be the need prosecutor in this case who has barely any prosecatorial experience he is in themiddle of a divorce case and apparently she bade him hundreds of thousands of dollars and state money and dot they were jet setting around the world and going on cruises together with that money in a thirsty curtailing wills did not address whether she had romantic relationship with said instead it said that because the parties agreed the marriage is irretrievably broken and the concept of fault is not at issue there is no information district to turning wills could provide they might prove relevant to granting or denying divorce she is trying to avoid having to testify in that particular case now dis that mean that there will not be any more shoes to drop on this i highly doubt i highly doubt it i would assume there will be a bunch of motions from them trump the ready have been pointing out this particular allegation and that is going a hurt that case pretty badly will get to more on this in just one second first folks as you can see twenty twenty four is going to be nuts hive already seen the economy it is on mentor hooks your as he florin policy its a disaster area let me ask you this with all this uncertainty how are you protecting your savings e if i were you i would consider diversifying with gold from birch gold group i mean i actually did for decades gold has been the choice of in vectors and central bank to hedge against inflation birch gold can help you do the same thing that i did create well fought out and balanced in vestment strategy the hope you convert existing pray or for one cay into an era in gold without paying a penny a pocket and this month only when you open a gold very with birch gold you will get a free sign copy of my book the authoritarian moment ben you detect ben to nine eight ninety eight ninety eight to qualify birch gold has been the exclusive gold company of the daily wire for the past seven years i by my gold there and you can to text bend to ninety eight ninety eight ninety eight to day protect our savings claim your eligibility for a free sign copy of the authoritarian moment again text ben to ninety eight ninety eight ninetyeight to get started with my friends at birch gold meanwhile donate trump is still in court with regard to this e get carol defamation suit the rests was since to damage him is because youardy had one engine carol defamation but it did not damage what exactly is the damage going to be now either believe later you do not i have serious dot about egg carols allegations here she testifies the choose a a burglar anal twenty five years go wannabe the date wannabe the seas and cannot name the month and that those raped in a dressing room with no one hearing hernotsco nothing n i when she wrote about this experience by the way later she suggested shad to be talked into the back that was rate by her friend in any case dona trump is am is out ripping on the judge you just got the feeling as i said earlier this week dona trumps legal foibles at this point are just to night as they're just a ringing in the background in your ear and eventually they become part of the white noise of life you can go to federal or you can go to tout with you can do both i go to is her photo is terrible they would rather have be is the federal or go to the federal mistertral an that is a nasty man hes a nasty judge he's a trumpeting guy and ait is obvious everybody in the court a disgrace fatly what is happening at ah disgrace i do love don drums use of the word nasty he is bring it back in his original sense which it wish that kind of appreciate again is any of this can t have ne marka impact on trumps campaign i thing not there are things that could theoretically have an impact on trumps campaign for example him being in the news everyday but would have to be something that is not already part of the background in formation of our lives and that is very difficult to do with dona trump have said that since twenty fifteen don't trumps giant mud monster and the more mind you throat him the more he just looks a giant mud monster jobidon that you disposed to be good at this and he has not ked end this it is a very very real problem now meanwhile the foreign affaires of the united states are in serious trouble if diva look i the middle east obviously they continue to be in very serious told pakistan is now apparently striking inside iron turns out the when you do not container on or on a lash is out at pretty much everybody according to the walstreturnal or one's military tested and found a limit to its ability to project power this week as pakistan responded to a distil attack with the first publicly acknowledge to air strike on around and territory in decades the pacasania retaliation followed iron's first rest attacks in neighboring countries since israel war with compass in gaze began in october to nag you ha pakistan which is an allies sadarabia firing at iron i on firing at pakistan you have continuing rocket fire from aronbakcamas into israel you have rock ad fire from aronbacks his ball into israel you one rock and fire from from iron back who these at shipping in the red sea and jobidon still has no plan for any of this in fact it seems the only sort of plans that are merging or operatic strikes on opposing positions that do not seem to be achieving anything their purpose and pressure on these rallies to stop doing what they are doing that seems what that that seems the plan but just what these rails are nock on stop because there is widespread support inside israel to take out harass as there should be in fact in braking news twenty one more hostages their bodies were just found comas had murdered them again all of this is just going to all this is just going to continue because the by administration does not actually have any sort of plan for what a realistic middle east looks her's a lot of talk today about prime minister benjaminintinaho talking about the idea that israel ought to maintain territorial sovereignty over the entire area from the mediterranean see to the jordan river in order to maintain security if any one else has any options i am sure people w love to hear them no other options have ben provided and every time joining in his teem suggest that israel ought to hands over land in concessions to terrorist groups all they are doing is fomenting what a on wants the realities that terrorism is not motivated by poverty an despair terrorism is motivated by hope hope that the other side will be weak enough to leave you alone to leave you living after you have committed some the worst atrocities known to man it is totally maintain the did administration continues pressure exactly the wrong side on this sort of thing now i will say the by administration has provided the military aid far necessary for israel to continue its war against comas that is true bat are tonically speaking it does make a rather large different when you keep signalling two terrors tan harass that all they have to do o stay a live long enough and eventually they will get what they want which is namely to be left alone survivals they can continue to plan attacks and murder jaws in the future and also does not how help when you have dolts burning sanders doing this routine burning sanders yesterday suggested that israel is going toward the entire palistonian people which is a weird take considering again that israel has now sacrificed about two hundred of its own men and women in a t e area where thy have complete air superiority and do not need to sacrifice literally any of those men or women in that area in order to protect palistonian civilians here is burning sanders being a a tool because he is my you for they one wrist has been i that israel has the right to respond the compasses be baric a tax on a basemen but they do not have the right toot a war against the entire polisthinian people which is what we have being wight now it as you just mention do you matter carrying such action in coss an now is unbelievably bad and we looking at the possibility of hundreds of thousands of children stopping we cannot allow that thatisrally is currently attempting to ship in more aid and there is know one on the other end o pic up the aid comas picking up the aid and they a stealing the aid in the world is can a continued to be an incredibly figural place because of jobidon weirdly though there is this coders of people who exist at the top of society n our global institutions who believe that they are doing a good job and that the true threat to international security is donate trunk will get to that in just one second first lady callers it is the hilarious story of how group of man losers who cannot win against other men decide to identify as ladies and join woman's bascavoling surest absurdity ridiculous its laughable also it happens to be very close to reality here is a quick luck and what is being called the most triggering move of the decade bet i lucky o ally tesla his e is a string and intastranoiia wat i see the lady callers will be needs to be bar cansepanget wat bis eleven iota eaetpoteatevel tropical ta tataaeoeotriery tomitoialefal streaming exclusively on daily wire plus do not wat each lady callers the move hollywood did not make and would not make we did exclusively at dailyware pass right now meanwhile a cover a very powerful people glibly they are very afraid of donned trumps who of biding has basically set the world on firebecas it turns out that these kudos sophistic call take on foreign policy which is basically you can wish cast piece into existence it is false it is not true and what they are mostly afraid of now is that people will expose their stupidity to the public view which is something the down from tended to do with actually shocking amount of alacrity during his first term in office and you constantly s or fuel way with silly shivalists that had been spoken by the form policy led you would break those idiocies on the wheel of reality and they have been very upset ever since that he did that once they do not want him back this presumably is why they continue to maintain li after lie with regard to international politics over at the continuing world economic form over at divas various dolts large and small continue to maintain the donned trumpet is the truest threats it to the world order a woman in very guava she suggest that the biggest rob that we are aboutsto face is disinformation because this information of course might mean the donned trumpets elected this information is a security dissect and a may be not the many notice about it a spot of the racial marideredoctrin that they we stop information for an we are in into and is information is a were barafottool but how we think about it in d you we ought a focusing on a a improving of the system a the beta we gat the felt right it do not speak about opinions we ought not collecting anions opinions or language ye this is about the facts makes dawn trust you to be able to distinguish between opinion in fact that was the up of the european commission meanwhile the world bank presentment continues to speak tactual falsehoods we cannot eradicate poverty without solving climate change which was weird since we done a pretty damned good job over the course of last forty five years on this planet in eradicating extreme poverty not only without solving clam change but according to you go is by exacerbating climate change cause it turns out the carmonbase fossil fuels are one of the great sources of human wealth ever devised an rally thing a gonlyreal thinking about things or lo tin otepenobut a change tereatityowar et on the found

cannot think about to addiction pubic without cutting about prudence teculiy at fir you the to you do not it do u they well i mean what if i do not think that you are right what if i think that you are just speaking nonsense and spouting nonsense what if i think that in fact this is a global guys for propping up bad regimes that very often the climate change talk is about to grating some of the most are ductile regimes in the history of mankind namely place the united states in rope in favor of significantly lessiproductive regimes they are looking for subsidies and handouts that is precisely what is going on with china by the way according to the was fore journal china now doubling down on manufacturing to rebooting economy after a turbulent year the push for new growth drivers comes as figures showed the worlds second largest economy expanded at twenty twenty three and it is weakest rate in decades what exactly are they going to do apparently they want to dominate global markets in emerging industries electric vehicles batteries and renewal energy year they want the united states in the e out to subsidize a bunch of green energy boons goggles where the money eventually and up in china they require the subsidies those of the places where they are going to earn they're money the hope is that growth in what chines officials referred to as the new three industries and other favorite sectors hell holp china economy banished the sectors of deflation and gapanstyle stagnation as a realistic crunchways heavily on construction investment and consumer confidence won returmbation wants these and other hightail manufacturing industries to be in the van guard of its push to eventually unseen the united states as the world largest economy will that is not going to happening the reason is not going to happen is because they're not actually targeting efficient sectors of the market for growth instead what they are doing is finding places that require government subsidization and redistribution in order to have everybody pay them to offshore all of that a good luck to them but again this is about global financial restructuring an the people to w f know that and trump is a threat to that because he astrally does america i suppose to many of these other people who seem to have a peculiar global utopia in mind that they wish to pursues speaking of people pursuing a global socialist utopia over in canada a what they hall happen to canada the jargon and my friend jordan person continues a pace s is an insane story jordan for those who ash you do not o jordan person's history probably the most famous psychologist on planar earth one most been is public intellectuals on the planet jordan was basically obscurer or lea semi obscure in two thousand fourteen two thousand fifteen then bill see sixteen arose and entered as a bill that was explicitly designed to shut down speech with regard to trains issues an you might fall under the threat of punishment if you sad that a boy is not a girl for example and jordan spoke up about this and he spoke loudly about this and he became national figure because of this and then handed up in the media speaking battle the stuff and he performed incredibly well nay wrote twelve rules for life and that was a huge inter national by cellar souls among five six million copies and all this now of course he works thus over the daily wire among his other project the a nonmember of twenty twenty two canada decided to taiga jordan person there's an administrative board that regulates the conduct of psychologist and they decided the organ's political views where a disgrace to his profession and that of clinical psychology generally now remembering vanadates not to disgrace to clinical psychology to mutilate young boys and girls in the bazar hope that they will turn into members of the opposite sac that is normal what is really bad as if you tweet jordan was sending by aboard the interior college of his psychologists to a bout of mandatory reeducation of indeterminatoration at his expense his learning would not be valued by any standard method but subjects the opinion of those charged with profiting by an exploiting my fore studentship says jordan he took the decision makers to court and then he lost because canada is no longer a free country the decision of the on trio cologne of psychologist was appel then appeal to a higher court and then just a couple of days ago that appeal was rejected no reasons were provided it as jordan wrights in the national post he now faces two choices first he can comply when the choose goes ahead with its determination to require my re education dutifully attend whatever bloody classes their d i enthusiast social media experts whatever those are t determined to inflict upon confess the sins of my classic liberal conservative or even judo christian political philosophical and theological comcommitments repent and silence myself or even become a standard bearer for the foe compassionate will cause at these publicly alternatively i can tell my would be masters go directly to held their rapidly gathering around themselves in everyone else more my right to practice or even describe myself as he psychologist and suffer the consequences on the reputation front the hairline he says would be canada psychologist jordan be person disgraced to his profession forfeits his formal license and consequence of his crimes what exactly are the crimes a jordan says this were the reader should take careful attention this whet elite had in the lest given the course of our leaders in their still blind and depart followers it should be hard for any one considering the situation o believe ism playing strait with the facts if they have their own opinions ore values what soever because if what i have had not done constitutes the equivalent of a professional crime you can be sure your own had is full of lake at transgressions heres what he did he criticized at three canada political leaders a council woman in candy's capital otto for it i regarded and still rear as for disgraceful behavior during the canada truck convoy just intrudes former principal secretary feral buts a man who resined for one of the highest positions within the office of the former amidst o scandal that had envelope the tephlonac voted liberal administration and the told posterior in shining naris him self candy's prime minister i pointed out the short comings of the idiot costly self a aggrandizing virtue signaling demoralizing live the power mad climate apoclits mongers that on organ's podcast the entire three hour plus transcript was submitted that to my cholegeis evident to my disgraceful conduct i voiced my objections the politically core it insistence than morbid obesity be re garden as the in equivalents to the highest standards of athletic beauty and i took a certain holuwod actress or actor to was be as that same person used its platform to parade the advantages of double mast factories when performed on the bodies of perfectly healthy young women i regret none of these actions these crimes were aborted on the publicly accessible on trio college of psychologist website in former page not by any one whatever actually use jordan a psychologist or by any one who even knew him the are instead brought to the intention of the authorities by activist in other countries many of whom also let in rioting claiming that they were in fact my client what does that mean what does not mean a lot practically as jordan says but he says that he is going to fight this thing all the way to the ends he says canadians mark my words your much want to charter of rights is no wore the paper its printed on as one of its last remaining signatories has been continually striving to indicate your right to free speech is essentially non existence as evidence by the court positions we are now considering you've almost no real rights to property your right to mobility can be taken away without consequence an any moment as they were very recently you can all to easily become the indenture servants of any one your dare to hire your tax load is going to continuate increase and rapidly your economy it is predicted to be the worst performing of any developing country for the next three decades he says are you listening if you refuse to abide by rules radically left us they would have been and for in fact to shoot until recently by the outright socialist canada new democratic party your opinions have now become downright illegal he says i think it'll fight a little longer it'll play long find out exactly what you will do now the you have ben emboldened to do whatever it is than in that darkest resentful demons lurking in your little low love ad ministry parts most truly desire even to your own determent it'll see you burdensome playing your pathetic gave becomes and i will publicize every single bit of it an if i get tired which seems highly likely it'll hand over the body license i am increasingly embarrass in any case to possess and let you continue journeying onto morally to the dismal fearful pessimistic moralizing petty button will not melt in our mouth hellish straits that you in vision as the paradise best fit for your fellow citizens at yourselves and your children i jordan doing what jordan does bust the fighting back and was gin to continue o fight back that insane story the fact that they cantarget jordan and canada and telling you whatever happens in canada coming to the united states to a campus near you meanwhile in breaking news presidentand trump apparently according to acids now has a short list of his potential v p candidates and apparently according to axis the shortness is down to three here are the possibilities for doling from v p candidate one at least tonic republican of new york she is the chair of the house of gimp conference and according to see banning who really is a lukewarm on ideas i he says that she is at the top panic was the first member of congress then dorstrump she is very loyal to him obviously she recently suggested that the members of the canary sixth riot we are in prison you call them hostages which is strange language to used by people have been criminally convicted even if you but lake a hostage means you have to do something to get the hostage released and into weird word to house but she also happens to be very capable shes in excellent speaker now all the people on the right who r claiming that inky hale is no good because she is too far toe left i should point out at this point that a least stephannic her heritage action score i is not particularly satisfying has a seventy two per cent heritage action score she is more liberal than a huge huge number of republicans her lifetime score hello of this for life time herdigeations sort is fifty four per cent the average house republican is seventy nine per cent she is far more to leeches trump a district in new york she is far more to the left than virtually every other member of the republican caucus if you are seeking to shore unsay the evangelical christian vote if that what your being to do with that pic the way that trumped with it sense in two thousand an sixteen stephannic is not going to do it if the idea is double down on your strengths namely look politically moderate by picking a bunch of positions that are sort of in the middle lit la wish washy but you have some strength on a few of the sort of pro trumpet issues and also on foreign policy stannic is not tuba a pic her politics honestly it very very similar s tricky a if wish to be real about that another candidate on the shortlist is senator had vans of oho he is again one of trumps most outspoken defenders an the senate grope full of people are not particularly love in in love wit with trumps policies the people to are sort of more patio con orients it really lady vans joy has drawn a very interesting contrast from his early carer his early career he was very much not into the idea a sort of a grievance politics in fact hilbelliology is essentially a robust defense of the meritocracy the suggestion is the when you've come two independent on government it actually enervates you he is moved away from that he now talks about the dad that you tuned subtitles in particular airs the country and terrific you need government imbalvmint a lot our fairies of the economy a joy has become much more not con than he used to be foreshore not constancy for nationalist conserves nationalists conserves tend to be more european conservatives fine with big entitlement spending it is tend to be more isolationist on foreign policy hin ten to be socially conservative s look very much for of righting parties in rope he is also very tight with trump ism not sure what that winds trumpet is oho is a very red state am not sure what exactly that brings him politically but does bring anybody in ism ism not certain that that it really does and finally nick hale hale is still on that short lists and this is what is freaking out a lot of people for sort of on that not consider of the isle nick is widely perceive as she is the primary's rat now as much squished than trump on wide piety of issues she is obviously much more hawkish on foreign policy than trump has purported to be although again one of the weird thing about trump as president is that the stuff he sad sounded a la pap my can an the stuff that he did looked an awful lot what nice hailed might do inky hailed is on that short list because again she has good approval ratings not with republicans but with audiences generally speaking if she worn fact the presidential candidiagains by din formally every pussy blows about she would compete well again somebody comely hers it is an interesting group of people none of them our hard court conservatives on the political level dance is one who probably could be considered out conservative on a political u but even on uneconomic he really is not a genie's more not coninorianticians that is donate trump shortest rain out he'll be fascinating as we move forward to see what that shortlist starts to look are despises the rest of the show continues rain out you are not on or o missis we will jump into the wanted men

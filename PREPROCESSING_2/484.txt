welcome to the superman alpacas science science tace to for aim drew supermen and ism a professor of neurobiology and opthemology at stamford school of medicine this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire and effort to bring zero cost consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme id the thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens at lentic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand and twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens on the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice to day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called got microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essential with every biological system relevant to health throughout your rain and body without lentic greens i get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to try athletic greens you can go to athletic green stock om slash supermen and claim a special offer he'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of at and ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if wore getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient incitement d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carvascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the i free travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key role of hydration end electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the preparation all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and if hydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that your getting the preparations of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element do come slash supermen and you'll get a free element sample pack with your purchase there all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element fella men the dot calm slash superman to day we are going to continue our discussion about hormones and we are going to focus on how particular hormones influence are energy levels and are immune system now last episode i mention at the end that we were concluding our month on hormones but we decide to include this additional episodes this would be the fifth episode in the sequence of episodes about hormones because therefore two hormones which are vitally important for a huge number of biological functions that will talk about to day but that are particularly important for energy levels and your immune system this is something that i get asked about a lot rather than skip to the next general topic today we are going to talk about the hormones courtesan and epineferan also called adrenalin you do not have to have heard the previous episodes on hormones in order to understand an digest the material from to day's podcast if i mention anything related to previous episodes i promise to give a little bit of quick background to get everyone up to speed today we are going to talk about the biology of courtesan we are going to talk about the biology of epinefran as always will talk mechanism and they are going to be a lot of tools i you are somebody who struggles with stress and energy levels and balancing stress and energy levels to day's episode is going to be vital for you if you are somebody who has challenges with sleep or you are somebody who has challenges getting your energy level up throughout the day and getting your energy level down when you want to sleep to day's episode is also for you and we are going to talk about the immune system and how to enhance the function of your immune system we are so e going to get into somefun topics relating to learning and memory and how you can leverage courtesan and epineferan in particular in order to learn faster we are going to talk about called neurotics smart drugs and how they work because there several of them that tap in to the epineferan system that are not often discuss and that you have access to we are going to talk about how coffin can actually rewire your brain for better or for worse and we are going to talk about the biology of comfort foods and why they work well and what they are doing and in understanding that you will be able to better understand your food choices as they relate to short vermin long term energy we have a lot to cover everything will be time stamped i wanted just remind people that we caption every episode in english end in punish the captions take a day or two to pop up on you tore i you are not seeing those within the first couple days please be patient with us in order to get captions that actually read a similarly to what ism saying if we go tryout captioning service and we have them done by experts in that takes ha little if additional time meanwhile if you have any questions as the episode evolves please write them down please put them in the comment section please subscribe to the channel if you have not already and let us get started talking about how to increase your energy and improve and increase your immunity bi leveraging the biology of courtesan and adrenaline before we dive into the biology of increasing energy and your immune system won a cover three topics that i promised i would mention from previous episodes the first one relates to intermittent fasting the second one relates to war stomach grumbles forgot to mention the biology of that last time the third is a powerful way to increase growth hormone which is powerful for increasing metabolism fatburning and tissue repair et camera that does not involve a sand or rapping yourself in plastic bags and going for for a jog first intermittent fasting last episode i talked a lot about growth hormone and fibroid harmony and i mention things sand and exercise and sleep and how they can increase levels of growth hormone within the healthy ranges and why increasing growth harmony can be very beneficial because it can burn off body fat it can improve muscle and general tissue health cartilage et camera and we tend to lose or our levels of growth harmony are reduced as we age many people at me will what about fasting everyone is been promise on the internet that intermit in fasting leads to these big increases in growth hormone the reason i did not mention it is that i could not find a study that actually pointed to the underlying mechanism i saw lots of claims lots of podcast lots of a degrees behind people's names sometimes biologist sometimes entirely different fields talking about this but very few studies and then i found what i would consider these study we will link to the study turns out that fasting does increase growth hormone levels and the way that it does it is fascinating i mention in a previous podcast about hunger and timing of mules and timing of hunger that when your hungry you release a hormone in your body called green sometimes actually called freehand thanksfor all f you greelanis does or grellanisdoes that corrected my pronunciation it is both green or green either one works green makes you hungry when blood glue coast your blood super is low green is secreted and makes you hungry and it turns out that green this hunger hormone actually binds to the receptor in the brain that normally binds what is called growth hormone releasing hormone believe are not the hunger hormone can act growth harmony releasing harmony and thereby stimulate growth hormone now the levels of growth hormone that fasting promotes through this green system are pretty substantial it is about a doubling of growth hormone levels in the waking state we know that you can release growth hormone an sleep intermittent fasting it turns out can increase growth harmony by binding green to the growth harmony releasing hormone receptor and it does it also during the daytime yes indeed fasting can increase growth hormone not to the supra levels that taking growth harmony would increase it or that a sand could increase it but it does seem to increase growth hormone later in to day's episode we are going to talk a lot about different patterns of fa sting and eating that can control at beneferen and we will return to specifics about how long a fast you need to fasts for two or three days or twenty three hours fortunately for people me who love to eat that is not the case we will talk specific fasting protocols later in the episode we also said we can talk about mommy grumble when your stomach growls it is not because of fluid sifting around in their lot of people think oh it is fluid sifting round turns out that your stomach has smooth muscle that lines its sides and when you eat something or you do not every once in a while your stomach inches off at the two ends a bag with a hose on either end cause that is essentially what your digestive system is and if there is nothing in there what happens is the muscles that line the sides of your stomach they kind of extend around the stomach in these cables those are always there and if you have food in your stomach what they do as they churn your stomach they literally turn the muscles of your stomach a tumbler to help break up the food that presumably you did not chop well enough cause you are eating too fast when you do not have any food in your stomach that churning continues and that contraction of the muscle an the turning literally turning over of your muscles they do not flip over completely but the turning over the muscles that is what cause is the stomach growling if you do not want to be the person in the meeting or sitting there at in a quiet theater whose stomach is growling her your food better that is the simple solution and last episode i talk ta lot about thousand controlled safe hyperthermia can cause huge increases in growth someone release anywhere from three hundred to five hundred even one thousand six hundred per cent increases in growth hormone release really staggeringly high increases point out that many people do not have saunas in their yard or in their homes and they would go through some other measures to increase safely their body heat ah don't creating a steam room in their bath room or jogging with extra sweats on this kind of thing many of you asked about hot baths hot baths will increase growths growth hormones use me however the temperatures that you need in order to increase growth hormone are high enough that you run the risk of burn and really cannot make any recommendations about hot baths but if you can tolerate a nice hot bath you are going to get some growth someone release however the sand has this advantage of you being able to enter a hundred and seventy five degree or two hundred degree environment provided you are not pregnant your not a young child et camera you can do that safely and getting big increases in growth hormone the hot bath will lead to lesser increases in growth hormone were onto talk a lot about temperature regulation in a future episode but as always if you are ever going to start playing with hyperthermia or hypothermia cold baths ice baths hot showers hot baths that are beyond the kind of norm of what is comfortable you have to be extremely careful ne please consult the doctor i think it is fair to say that most people would to have a lot of energy during the day if you work during the day and they their energy to takeoff at night and i think it is fair to say that most people do not enjoy being sick nobody wants to get sick in other words you wont to have energy and you want your immune system to function well to ward off infections of various kinds bacterial infections viral infections et camera it turns out that the two hormones that dominate those processes of having enough energy and having a healthy in system or cortical and epinephrin epinephrin is the same thing as a dentine in the body we tend to call a adrenalin adrenalin and in the brain we tend to call a adrenalin epinephrin and ism sorry for that i did not create this naming system and the story behind it is uninteresting and not worth our time i will use the words a adrenaline and epinephrin interchangeably today cortisol is cortical and i just one to cover a little bit about what cortical an epinefron are where they are released in the body and brain because if you can understand that you will understand better how to control them first of all cortical is a steroid hormone much estrogen and testosterone in that it is derived from collestral now that could be collestral that you eat it could be collestral that is produced by the liver as many of you probably know the relationship between dietary collestral the fats that you eat and blood collestral and liver collestral is a very controversial one it is a barbed wire topic there are people that claim that dietary collestral has zero impact on circulating collestral coming from the liver there are people who argue the exact opposite both with good data in hand i would say there are some problems for the idea that all your collestral levels are determined by dietaryantake namely that an relics often have very high levels of collestral that their liver produces eventhough they are eating very little and sometimes not eating at all understand that collestral is a precursor molecule meaning it is the substrate from which a lot of things testosterone and estrogen are made please also understand that collestral can be made into estrogen or testosterone or cortesall and that cortical is sort of the competitive partner to estrogen and testosterone what this means is no matter how much collestral your eating or you produce whether not low er its high if you are stressed more of that collestral is going to be devoted toward creating cortical which is indeed a streshormon however the word stressed should not stress you out because you need cortical cortical is vital you do not want your cortical levels to be too low it is very important for immune system function for memory for not getting depressed you just do not want your cortical levels to be too high and you do not want them to be elevated even to normal levels at the wrong time of day we are to talk about how to control the timing and level of your cortical epinefron or a adrenaline has also been demonized a bit we think of it as the stress hormone this thing that makes us anxious fight or flight ta we is to get chased by lines and tigers and bears and now we do not and it is the ancient hang over that is all wrong the fact of the matter is the epinefran is your best friend when it comes to your immunity when it comes to protecting you from infection and we are going to talk about which and epinefran adrenalin is your best friend when it comes to remembering things and learning and activating neural plasticity we are going to talk about that as well once again it is a question of how much and how long and the specific timing of release of cortical an pin efferent as opposed to coatis all and a adrenalin being good or bad there terrific when they are regulated they are terrible when their miss regulated and we ill give you lots of tools to regulate them better coatis all biology one o one in less than two minutes your brain makes what we call releasing hormones and in this case there is corticotropin releasing hormone c or h is made by neurons in your brain it causes the pituitary this gland that sits about an inch in front of the roof for your mouth in the baseiour brain to release c t h c t h then goes and causes your adrenals which sit above your kidneys in your lower back to release cortical a called stress hormone but i would you to think about coatis all not as a stress hormone but as a hormone of energy it produces a situation in the brain and body whereby you want to move and whereby you do not want to rest and whereby you do not want to eat at least at first epineferon or a adrenalin one o on in less than two minutes when you sense a stressed with your mind or your body senses a stress stressed excuse me from a wound or something of that sort a signal is sent to neurons that are in the middle of your body they call the sympathetic chain ganglia the name does not necessarily matter they release nor epinefran very quickly it is almost a a sprinkler system that just hoses your body with epinefron that will increase heart rate will increase breathing rate in some cases will constrict your blood vessels it will also increase the size of vessels and arteries that are giving blood flow to your vital organs this is why your extremities get cold when your stressed and your heart is beating faster more that energy is being devoted toward toward your corps you also re ease a adrenaline from your adrenals in again sit writing atop your kidney those are a second system whereby your system gets flooded with adrenaline in pulses you get one pulse you get ten pulses will talk about ow to regulate the number of pulses end you release it from an air of your brain called locus sedulous and that creates alertness in your brain if you want to learn more about the stress response and all the details of that including some protocols of how to regulate stress please see our episode about stress i go in to a lot of detail there i will touch on some of the same themes to day but i really want to cover energy and the immune system and if you are very much interested in stress purse and stress regulation please see the episode on stress of we have cortesall and we have epineffrent and their net effect is to increase energy first of all i want to give you a tool that will help you regulate cortesall and can also help stave of certain patterns of mental illness now of course it is notion a cure mental illness on its own but it can support healthy state of mind and can help reduce on healthy states of mind including depression the first tool is to make sure that your highest levels of cortical are first thing in the morning when you wake up one way or another every twenty four hours you will get and increase in cornball that is non negotiable that is written into your gene that increasing cortesall is there to wake you up and to make you alert its to stimulate movement from being sleep presume my horizontal to getting up and starting to move about your day and have said it before but i will say it again the best way to stimulate that increasing caortisall at the appropriate time is that very soon after waking within thirty minutes or after waking get outside viewsome sunlight even if it is overcast get outside vieusom sunlight no sun glasses never look at any light bright that it coadamage your eyes but do that for two to ten minutes if it is very bright two minutes if it is not bright ten minutes do that because in the early part of the day you have the opportunity to time that cortical release to the early part of the day which will improve this has been back by previewed studies it will improve your focus it will improve improve your energy levels and it will improve your learning throughout the day it will also prevent a late shift in cortesall increase and late shifted cartesall meaning quartisall that increases around eight or nine p m is a signature feature of many depressive disorders including major depression anxiety and that of course correlates with things insomnia et camera that a key tool and i do not know how many of you are already doing that b ut it is vital to do now i mention sunlight even on cloudy days and therefore specific reasons for that i want of just briefly cover the data because in the episodes on sleep i talked about brightness of light in regulating quarters all and sleep and i talked about hot a measure lucks brightness but i was not specific enough i realize based on the questions that have receive since that episode here s out works going outside and getting some sunlight requires that i also tell you how long and under what conditions have said looking through a window is not as good it takes fifty times longer to get as much light et camera et camera many many questions have told me that ism not being specific enough ism in to give you the data and from the day to you will understand exactly how long you need to do this each day on a sunny day no cloud cover provided that the sun is not yet overhead it is somewhere low in the sky could have just cross the horizon r if you wake up a limit later con be somewhat low in the sky basically the intensity of light the brightness is somewhere round a hundred thousand lucks lucks is just a measurement of brightness if you want to download the a light meter that is a free a that will allow you to do that you can hold your finger down on the loll button there and you can move it around and it will continuously give you a lucks read out it is not perfect it is not exact but it is pretty good and it is your colossi have no relationship to light meter the company on a cloudy day it is about ten thousand lucks o c tenfold reduction but bright artificial light very bright artificial light it is somewhere around a thousand lucks and ordinary room light it is somewhere around a hundred to two hundred lucks and it has to do with how much light scatter there is even if you have a very bright bulb sitting right next you that is not going t do the job your phone will not do the job not early in the day to get the cartes all released at the appropriate time you need to get outside let us just set a couple general parameters if it is bright outside and no cloud cover that light can be indirect you soft have to be staring into the sun please do not damage your eyes we cannot regenerate those groans yet and restore vision that is lost but if you have to blank that means it is too bright it is fine to blink of course please do if you need to get outside for ten minutes or five minutes should suffice but ten minutes is sure to suffice if it is a cloudy day dense overcast you are robbing a need about thirty minutes if it is light cloud broken cloud cover its probably going to be somewhere between ten and twenty minutes and if you cannot get outside or you are own an airplane and it is bright overhead artificial lights or ordinary room lights it is going to take you about six hours of light and by time you reach the middle of your wakeful period it is too late you will not be able to shift your clock and your quarters all will start drifting later and later this is w its vital to get this light on a regular basis to get that martial released early in the day that sets you up for optimal levels of energy it sets you up for great sleep but to days not really about sleep it is more about energy that carts all pulse and the stress that you might feel early in the day from having a obit extra energy that is the energy that you want in order to move about and learn and do and do various things that is a healthy level of energy please try and get that sunlight if it is within your protocols to do that and try and get sufficient sunlight first thing in the morning again within the first hour that is the best way to make sure that you time your cartisall appropriately now throughout the day you are going to experience different things most of you are not spending your entire day try to optimize your health some of you might be but most of you have jobs and you have families and you have commitments life enters the picture and provides you stresses and those stresses whatever they may happen to be a difficult to worker some disappointment about something you din get the rays you expected or you dine get the vacation that you expected those will cause increases in charts all an epineferon this is important understand you do not have the the luxury of just having this morning cartisall when having it taper off you want that major martial early in the day but then you can expect you should expect increases in martial and a adrenalin throughout the day based on events that are unpleasant to you for me the events that are most unpleasant to me are things traffic on males that ask me to fill out a form for which i cannot find the link these kinds of thing stress me out of a human being i do not lose my cool over them but i can feel my level of alertness and con of frustration increase the normal kind of things that go stress tents up a little bit the key is these blips and martial an epineferan need to be brief you cannot have them often or lasting long that you are in a state of chronic martial elevation or chronic pin veteran elevation this system of stress was designed to increase your alertness and mobilize you towards things get you frustrated and provide the opportunity to change behavior that is what they were designed to do if you find yourself getting stressed and staying stress there are great tools that we provide in the stress episode that relate to things the double in had exhale the called physiological si you can incorporate in amnesty are a non sleep you press protocol et camera but understand that the energy that you experience string stress that sudden increase in a alertness and attention that comes from seeing something difficult that is at healthy hormonal system in nerd system that is working and the reason it works is that cartisall when it is released into the blood stream it actually can bind to receptors in the brain it can bind receptors in the eidola four centers and threat detections centers but also areas of the brain that are involved in learning and memory and neral pal elasticity and this is what i say that normal plasticity the brains ability o change itself in response to experience is first stimulated by attention in focus and often a low level state of agitation understand that and you will not be quite troubled about the little stress increases that you experience throughout the day now there are ways to leverage stress epinefron and coatis all in ways that serve you and to do it in a deliberate way therefore also ways to do that that increase your level of stress threshold meaning they make it less likely that epinefrn and cortical will be released i want to talk about the science of those practices cause i get asked about these practices a lot things whimhoff breathing which is also called tumor breathing things ice baths things huh intensity interval training all of those things have utility the question is how you use them and how often you use them those tools just stress from a life event can either enhance your immunity or to plead it that is right those same practices of ice baths tumor breathing high intents interval training or training of any kind can deplete your immune system or it can improve them excuse me they can improve it meaning they can improve your man system the key is how often you use them and when and i want ta review that now in light of the scientific literature because in doing that you can build practices into your daily or maybe every other day routine that can really help buffer you against unhealthy levels of coatis all nepineferan meaning coatis all increases that are much too great or that last much too long epinferon increases that are much too great or that last much too long and of course we will talk about all the negatives that go along with having too much coatis all too much eponeferan for too long but you hear about those a lot you here about pushing centrum you hear about obdominaphatic accumulation you hear about sleep disturbances i want to arm you with the tools first and then we can talk about the dark side and all the things that hope full you will be able to avoid entirely or that you can get yourself out of once you have the tools in hand let us say somebody tells you something very troubling or you look at your phoned you see a ten message that is really upsetting to you that will cause an immediate increase in epinfron adrenalin in your brain and body and chances are it is going to increase your levels of coatis all as well let us say you get into an ice bath or a cold shower even if you love the cold or if you hate the cold that will cause and equivalent increase in epinefron and cortical we do not know the exact levels but it is probably about the same let us say you go out for high intense interval train you decide your going to run some sprints you do some repeats or you are going to do some weight lifting in the him and you love lifting weights in the him a yo the power lifting thing or you decide that you want to do some to yoga or some thing that you really enjoy or you hate you are going to increase your epinefron and martial levels there simply no way around this let us say you decide to sit down and you are going to do some deep breathing it'll here about the benefits of deep breathing inhale exam in he email you are going to get big increases in epinefron and cuartisal the data from multiple studies support this all of those are stresses in aeroquotes now there is a way that you can cognitively frame what those are you can tell yourself i love high intense the interval trainer i love weight training or now i personally love exercise i not crazy about the cold i do some cold exposer stuff now and again answer can talk a lot about how to do that in the optimal way in an upcoming episode but getting into the cold does not feel good to me i tell myself it is good for me and i enjoy it at some point usually phone's getting out all of those increase epinefron and guess what they increase your levels of energy and alertness if you are somebody who struggle with energy and alertness it can be beneficial provided you get clearance from your doctor to have some sort of protocol built into your day where you deliberately increase your levels of epinefron and you are levels of martial and i want to put the emphasis on deliberately how would you do that well it is quite easy to turn the shower cold and get into that that will wake you up and it literally wakes you up because of increases in epinefron you can do deep breathing of the sort where you inhale an exam repeatedly twenty five or thirty times maybe hold your breath for a few seconds on an exam and then repeat called withal for tom of type breathing lots of a adrenalin is released in your system when you do that you will have more energy afterwards it is really important understand that the body does not distinguish between a troubling text message ice tumor breathing or his intense interval training your any other kind of exercise it is ollstress cognitively refrain that and telling yourself i this i enjoy it is not going to change the way that that molecule impacts your body in brain i a chuckle because people would love to tell you that all you have to do as say oh this is good for me no what it does to tell yourself that it is good for you or that you enjoy it is it that it liberates other molecules doom dopamine and serotonin that help buffer the epinefron responses now the way that does that have talked about previous episode all just mention the dopamine is the precise or to epinefron epinefron adrenalin is made from dopamine i martial is made from collateral epinefron is made from dopamine and that is why if you tell yourself you are enjoying something and because dopamine is subjective that you can in some ways as long you are not completely lying to yourself you can get more epineferon you get more mileage or more ability to push through something and you can sort of reframeent but it is not really connivery framing the cognac part is the trigger but the it is a chemical substance that is actually occurring there it is do amen giving you more apineferen a bigger amplitude eperonefran release and it gives you some sense of control here is a protocol that any one can use if you want to increase levels of energy if you suffer from low energy during the daytime or whenever it is that you would to be alert pick a practice that you can do fairly consistently maybe every day but maybe every third day or every fourthly maybe it is an ice bath or a cold bath maybe it is a cold shower maybe it is the picnic in inhale exhale breathing protocol i describe if that was not clear and people is ask for a demon not can do the whole thing right now but ism willing to do a few rounds of this or a you cycles i should say it is inhale i you do that more deeply more you do that twenty five thirty times repeatedly you will start to feel warm people in the yo get common they say your generating heat yore not entering heat releasing a adrenaline inhale ant exam inhale exile twenty five or thirty times you will feel agitated in stress that is because you are re leasing a adrenalin in your body and that's because your releasing nor epineferen in your brain and you will be more alert then you can follow that twenty five or thirty breath cycles with an exhale hold and hold your breath for fifteen to thirty seconds always always always do this on dry land never while driving operating heavy machinery all the standard safety protocols never near water please people have passed out and died doing this with breath holds in water there are several deaths associated with it on land it is probably safer clear with your doctor but twenty five thirty breath exhale hold twenty five thirty breaths again exhale hold twenty five thirty breaths again exhale hold and then if you you can do an inhale and hold if that is within your margins of safety if all these protocols all these activities are just equivalent they are just stress then how do we make them good for us how do we actually benefit from them now of course the cold itself can have some health promoting effects it can increase brown fat thormagenesisam metabolism high intents the interval training or other forms of exercise of course has party of vascular effects that can be good for us as does wait training et camera but what we are talking about here are ways to increase energy and to teach our brain an body to teach ourselves how to regulate the stressrsponse in addition to the benefits of the actual practices what we are talking about is building a system that when you experience increases in epineferan and quarter all from life events you are able to better buff for those and we are also talking about ways hat you can increase energy over all cause that is what to day's episode is all about energy in the man system and indeed we will talk about how you can actually leverage specific protocols to increase euremune system on demand there's great scientific dated to support that one can do that there's a biological mechanism that is very important if you want to do those things increase energy and yourmiun system on demand learn to buffer stress on demand in a real time and it means taking these protocols these practices whether or not it is cold water or ice bath or exercise or any of those and making one small but very powerful adjustment in how you perform them but in order to make that adjustment i cannot just tell you the adjustment i have to tell you the mechanism that if your doing it correctly or not this is really case where if you can understand a little bit of mechanism you will be far better off then just adopting protocols if you take away nothing else from this episode except what ism about to tell you please take away the information ism about to tell you cortical as i mention is released from the adrenals and it can bind to receptors it can have action both in the body and in the brain in fact it can bind the call threat detection center in the brain or one of them which is the emigdula also call the fear center it can do that because quartusall can cross the blood brain barrier can be released in the body and cross this biological barriers offense that keeps things out of the brain but cortical has passing rights it can go through epineferon can not epineferon is polarize the shape of it is such that it cannot make it through the blood brain barrier that is one of the reasons why it is released both from the adrenals in your body en released from this brainstorm area the locus serious in your brain that is a powerful thing because what it means is that the body can en testates of readiness and alertness while the mind remains calm that is biologically possible it is not just ha psychological trick and their ways that one can do that ism presuming at this point that your getting your morning light to time your sort is all increase ism presuming that you want more energy or that you want to increase your immune system function and it is ability to combat infections of various kinds and what ism suggesting is that you pick from the palate of exercises that are out there or tools that are out there to increase epinefferent there cutaways to do that you can do that as i mention through cold water through exercise you can even do that by having confrontations with other people at a biological level it is identical if you to go on line and place the kind of comments that were read the kinds of things or look at the kinds of things that agitate you you can if you look at that as an opportunity ism not suggesting you do that it'd to see people taking care of themselves and each other in much unless destructive ways frankly but the prerequisite here is getting an increase in a adrenaline released from the body now the simplest way to describe how to do that would be in the contact of cold water or a breathing protocol because then i do not have to deal with the unknown life circumstances that get you triggered or i count telly it gets me triggered but ism not going to let us presume cold water let us say you deciduous can take a cold shower you get into the cold shower and if it is cold enough that will be stress will you'll experience an increase in epinefferon it will increase your alertness now you using this as a practise as a tool to build you could call it resilience but the ability to stay calm in the mind while being stressed in the body epineference in the body and you do that by subjectively trying to calm yourself now you can do that by telling yourself it is good for you by emphasizing your exhales anything that you can do to try and stay calm despite the fact that you are in a heightened state of alertness you do this with exercise you cut do this with music pretty much anything that will give you a really heightened state of alertness offers you the opportunity to try and stay calm in the mind what you are trying to do at a mechanistic level is to have a adrenaline released from the adrenals but not have a adrenaline epinefron released from the brainstemp to the same degree you are not just trying to buff for this you are not transit oh this is good for me that is good for me omen a trying this out you are not trying to grind it out you are trying to move through this calmly while maintaining alertness you are not trying to down out necessarily although maybe that helps you are not trying to distract yourself what you are trying to you is shift cognitively your relationship to the somatic to the body stress response now ism sure some of you out there are shout and yet that is exactly whatever whatever what i agree this is in many ways a self directed kind of stress and ovulation but we are not talking about this as stress inoculation we are talking about this as a way to increase energy and focus and the reason is that eprineferon when released in the body has a profound effect on the immune system and when released in the brain has a profound effect on the ability to learn and remember information and to be alert and we are talking about splitting the location separating the location from which you have epineferan a adrenalin released ache let us say you are doing this practice simply to wake up okay cold shower will do that exercise will do that the ability to stay calm in mind while having heighten levels of a adrenalin and presume cartes all as well in the body but the carrells can a circulate everywhere will talk obit about oriole more in a moment you could do that through some self soothing calming way that can be highly individual you do baby telling yourself you enjoy it et camera but what you needs understand is that in the immediate period following that practice your system your entire brain an body are different your body is actually primed to resist infection when you have high levels of epinperan in it for short periods of time the scientific study that explored how increasing a adrenaline in the body can improve amuse resistance is grounded in a well known phenomenon that increases in stress actually protect you against infection in the short term i want a look at the classic data first describe what was done and then i want to talk about the more recent study which is immediately actionable there are classic set of studies that a really based mainly on the work of somebody named brace mccuwan who is at the rockefeller university in new york brace passed away a few years ago but he had many decades of incredibly impactful work under his belt when he did the work that man talk about next has been done in humans and has been done in animals and has really explored how inducing stress can enhance the function of the mine system in the short try and when i mean short term i mean about one to four days i no thing go through all the details of the study but essential what they were doing was exposing subjects to some sort of infection either bacterial or viral infection and inducing stress some a double wammiright you think that may be getting a little electric for chalk or cold water exposure who something to increase your levels of stress and adrenaline would just make the effects of the infection worse but no quite the opposite brief bouts of stress which now you should be thinking about in terms a coatis all an epinephrin release were actually able to increase immune system function now that should not surprise you if you understand a little bit about how epinephrin works in the body and in the brain it essentially is the signal by which the nervous system can in form ammunorgans things the spleen and other organs that make killer cells of various kinds cells in tells to go in combat infections bacteria envisages how else would your mine system know that there was an infection your man system can recognize foreign invaders but the nervous system provides the signal the sort of alarm signal that liberates the killer cells that tells them there is a problem and to go seek out the problem to speak the duration here is really important because if stress stayed too high for too long then yes indeed stress can hinder the immune response but for a period of about one to four days it actually can protect you by way of increasing the immune response now i can say with certainty that that effect is governed by epinefron a adrenaline released from the adrenals and not from the brain because they actually explored whether r not the effect exists in the presence of what is called and a drenelectomy or removing the adrenals si show to say without the adrenals you do not get the effect we know that that effect comes from a adrenaline in the body what does that mean for you that means if you want to increase your immune system in the short term you want to increase your epineferan in the short term that is why short bouts of very intense exercise probably know more than an hour per day provided your doing everything else rite sleeping in nutrition et camera maybe even shorter bouts of intense exercise or exposure to cold water or the picnic breathing that i talked about before because they increase epineferon they will bolster the amuse system and we all hear these reports every once in a while seems to be the thing that severance while they'll be an article about how coffee can improve your immune system or salina that indeed caffeine can increase epineferan and dopamine to some extent but most people are drinking it chronically it is effects are probably due to increases an epineferan and probably whether or not something coffee or other forms of caffeine can improve or degradyourimue system will probably depend on whether not your using it i in a way that it increases your adrenaline as a spike that happens rarely you once every you don't two or three months you let say you've an infection coming on yes indeed it probably what these data probably mean is that drinking som hot coffin to tea or some hot coffee even provide you do not get dehydrated from it cause your also drinking some water can probably improve yourmune system function by way of increasing a adrenaline release but can the breathing can cold exposure can exercise the mechanism here is what is key and i keep saying that because what it means is that you do not actually have to know the specific protocol ism not trying to say do this particular protocol you have to figure out and it should be easy to figure out what short term a adrenaline increasing behave your your willing to do on a regular basis every day or two or three times a week now you could say while ism not sick should i be doing these things often i would say two or three times a week at a minimum if your goal is to keep your immune system tuned up and you are in the presence of a lot of children for instance which carry a lot of a bugs because theirmune system is undeveloped or you work in a welfare setting or you are simply somebody who is prone to get sick i can you say anecdotally i guess some one now calls this panic data which i do not that erase because it sort of a i do not want anecdotal data it ever be a misunderstood as anything but anecdotal data anecdotally i can say that have had instances where have felt tat a throat tickle coming on or some iciness in infection i will do the cyclic breathing that i describe before twenty five thirty breaths except whole twenty five thirty breaths except whole twenty five thirty breaths except hold than than big in hail hold and most times i did not get full blown sick but i also take other precautionary measures to get sleep et camera whether not it was causal or whether not just correlated i do not know however there is a human study that i deftly want o point out to you because it it was published more recently than the manual work it was published in the proceedings on the national academy of sciences for the u essay because their proceedings the national academy a science s for many other countries as well the title of the paper is voluntary activation of the sympathetic nervous system that the system that causes for flight and a c stress and causes release of a adrenalin an attenuation of the ante me in response in humans this is cox a o ex at all p n a s proceeds the national academy sciences two thousand fourteen and they corporate the ever famous wimhoff breathing feoff breathing is much the breathing protocol that have described several times now in this podcast ts also call tumor breathing other people from other cultures in communities have called it other things the naming really is not important although i do think women as a pioneer in trying to bring these practices to the general public more broadly and was involved in this study the sit was done in the netherlands it was communicated by a doctor homes horah that male i mention all that a horvathas is a terrific a scientist an familiar with his work over many years here is what they did they injected people with evolve and they had groups that either did the sorts of breathing have been describing that increase the adrenalin release although i should say i do not think you need that breathing to get a adrenalin release you could do with cold exposure you could do it with other things high intend the interval training as well and what they found was that the response to the cole was quite different in the people that had a protocol in this case breathing to increase the adrenalin this is a remarkable study because what they found was that the fever the vomiting t all the negative effects of evolve many of them in some cases all of them were greatly attenuated by way of engaging the adrenalin system this case using breathing they looked at in inflammatory side kinds things lie six which have mention mantises on this podcast this or classic and lavatory seticand were reduced things lie ten which are anytime inflammatory were increased there were some inflammatory sat at kinds that were increased what is the point here the point is you can control your immune system by finding away that you can increase a adrenaline and this runs counter to what we always here which is do not get too stressed or you will get sick learn to control a adrenaline turn it on and turn it off learn to control cortical turn it on with light in the morning try and turn it off and then when i spikes because of life events learn to turn it off learning to turn on and off a adrenaline a k epineferon and learning to turn on and off courtesan afford to you the ability to turn on energy and focus and your man system that is the most important point from to day's podcast and understanding that it does not matter what protocol you use maybe it is a cup of coffee and running up a hill five or six times that will improve your mine system function if you get a adrenaline in your system you can use a ice bath you can use a cold bath it really does not matter you can get into an argument but ism not suggesting you do that it really does not matter what is important is that you are able to then shut off that response and there ways to do that we will talk about but i want to talk about some of the other benefits of epineferan and cortesall that occur because of their actions on the brain because these are many and they are powerful and they relate to energy but also the ability to learn if i haven't already convinced you that seeing light early in the day is good for time in your cortical i should also mention that another hormone that i discuss last episode which is theroid hormone and is critical for setting your level of metabolism is controlled in part by these circadian mechanisms and coatis all itself the short take away on this is that if you get your cortical release early in the day it will increase your energy throughout the day it will also time your fibroid release properly there is yet another reason why you would want to get that light exposure early in the day for me that is a non negotiable practice if ism on a plain it'll try and get it anyway i can om ism not shining flashlights in my eyes yet but i really try hard to get that light exposure from sunlight early in the day without fail and the fibroid increase has to do with the fact that your circadian clock itself is regulated by cortical and the circadian clock times the release of fibroid harmony i do not wan to go too far off in that direction but there a number of studies call's b at all k all that b e e k at all two thousand twelve if you want ta look at up on pulled is it a great one that describes how cortex a secretion begins to rise during sleep and peaks shortly after waking or immediately before and that times a set of neurons in the creating clock then trigger the release of the releasing and stimulating hormones for thyroid a really important mechanism and fibroid will also ten to correlate with energy but mostly metabolism very important have theroid in check now let us talk about epinephrin and sort is all and learning and memory everyone has a story about being stress they can remember something you mu sit down to an exam i should have this happen once sat down to an exam and is blanked just blanked i it only happen once i do not know what happened i do not thy know a sleep deprivation but i just completely blanked and it was very hard for me to pull myself out of that ditch i did manage to do it but it was a scare experience i think most people think about stress and an inability to perform however most of the time increases in epinephrin provided they are not through the roof lead to improved performance now this has been shown over and over again on memory tests on learning new information on physical performance that when blood levels of eponepron are low you do not perform very well when blood levels of eponepron are very high up to about fifteen hundred o seventeen hundred dekagrams for permit if you any one's out there of try measuring the stuff but i doubt you are performance goes way up performance gets better when you are alert and when you're a little distress absolutely shown again and again and again if you get too stressed it is the mental side it is the eponepron in the brain that causes people to either focus on their somatic response too much they feel their sweating in their focused on their bodily responsive not focus on what it is they're trying to do or say or perform et camera or learn but epinefran is a neurotic it is a smart drug that we all make internally and coatis all is as well now here is the twist that does not mean that you want epinefron high during the exam necessarily memory and learning and performance are actually favored they are enhanced by epinephrin increases immediately after learning and not something that is rarely discussed the timing is vital if you learn some information you have a conversation you are trying to learn a new language and new motor skill whatever it is that you are trying to learn the increase in epinephrin that occurs just afterward is what is going to consolidate the information it is going to insure that the proper circuits and mechanisms in the brain for hero plasticity are engaged during sleep later that night or the next night which is when the real requiring occurs you might say that's crazy why would that happen well we have to remember none of these mechanisms evolved for us to do what we want and learn what we want necessarily although they will allow us to do that we have experience this before we might have gotten up gone outside get in our car drive to work or to somebody is house you are not thinking about much at all and then all f a sudden you see an accident on the road you are alertness is primed if its happens be a particularly gory accident there is can be a lot of sensory information there allow a sudden adrenalin epinefron is released into your brain in body guess what not only will you not forget that event but you will remember everything that led up to that event which has an adaptive function because your brain and bodies primary concern is safety right this is the neurobiological explanation for mallow's hire give needs is safety first and you have heightened awareness and a alertness for everything that preceded that spoken a adrenalin n end quartisall the way to think about this is if you need to learn something better if you are taking thrall or your taking a lot of coffee beforehand your actually driving the process in the wrong direction your increasing epineferan for learning sure but past a certain point your actually degrading learning in performance the time to do that is toward the end or immediately after the learning because this mechanism is not simply devoted to negative events a car crash or a drama it works to make sure that the hippocampus that in codes memories as part of the memory incoming mechanisms is prime that it is told what you just experienced is important you are going to need that information later and have talked many times before about using nonslip see breast and esstiar or insuring good night sleep after learning but what we are also talking about is as the learning event tapers off as your existing that to make sure that your epinefron levels are not tapering off as well and this may be one of the reasons why the ninety minute cycle this call all train cycle for learning works because it takes a few minutes to get into rhythm of learning you can maintain that alertness for about ninety minutes s no coincidence that these podcast or typically about ninety minutes long and as you exit that ninety minutes your stop going to start to feel fatigued you are not going to be able to continue to secrete epinefrant at the same level ism not telling you that at the end of this podcast you should give yourself a rootstock or that you should jump into an ice bath although i will say if you were to increase your epineferan at the end of this episode by breathing or by way of colldshower ism willing to bet based on numerous published studies that the memory for the information would be enhanced because of this wretch or active effect of epineferan in quartisal but simply you can remember things better if you increase your alertness each your level of epineffrt an cortical after immediately after something that you want to learn m reminded by people here at the suburban labpodcast that the optimal strategy therefor would be a ninety minute session of focus or learning then immediately after cold shower or tumotiht breathing or ice bath or something of that sort may be a hard run or hit training if you cannot get access to the other things and then shower up and do it non sleep deep rest and then get a good night sleep those would be the optimal tools and the organization of tools for enhanced learning and of course you could use caffeine to crime the whole process by drinking the caffeine towards the tale of the learning episode which is counter intuitive at least to me i should mention since many of you use caffeine and i use coffin i do drink coffee i mushroom coffee i of a mate i drink caffeine in various forms that there was a study that came out recently that is relevant to our discussion about energy and alertness and learning and the study came out just recently march twenty twenty one it is mandalas at all m a g a l h a e s and it was publish in molecular psychiatry which is a fine journal assure reujournal and the title prey much gives it away habitual coffee drinkers display a distinct pattern of brain functional inactivity ironically drinking coffee changes brain connectivity and it does it in a number of ways but the k take always from this study as it relates to sort of what the circuits do as it use just listening off a bunch of brain circuits which con a meaningless in this conversation is that people who drank coffee habitually every day had changes in their brain circuitry such that there was a shift or a bias toward anxiety even when they do not invest caff latices we think o caffeine increases your levels of anxiety and indeed it appears it does if you use it chronically but not just to caffeine it does not just raise your base line of anxiety because of what circulating in your blood stream it actually increases conductivity between the brain areas that relate to anxiety now that could be a good thing or a bad thing depending on how you look at it for people that have are prone to pa chronic panic attacks are anxiety tests that not can be good some people might use caffeine in healthy ways i believe i do in order to just increase over all levels of alertness although now not only am i going to start delaying my caffeine and take till two hours after i wake up for reasons have talked about in previous episodes but ism also going to start drinking t later in learning and focus session s as a way to enhance plasticity around those learning in focusessions not before interesting study f freed on its free on line you can access the full paper on line we will put a link as well one a mention this this issue of neurotic called smart drugs which is not a topic that i particularly enjoy because i do not the name out do not the idea of a neurotic because what is a smart drug well there is different kinds of smart there is creativity either tat switching their stray building their stadium alimentation and most of the neurotics that are out there are just cocktails of a bunch of different things that are not tailor to the individual at all they all seem to have some canine or some colonergic stimulation et camera but there's an important way to frame this in light of to day's conversation neurotics generally fall into two categories one category are neurotics that increase blood glucose these are compounds that people take that increase blood glucose an increasing blood glucose will improve performance can enhance learning in some situations ism not suggesting people take these things but here is just a list of a few of this some of them are legal some of them are gray market some of them are legal paractams oxeracitams the eneracitams all the tams oke elevate blood glucose that is how they work the neral effects that you hear are secondary or tertiary to the fact that they just increase blood glucose we know that because if you block the blood locos effect you block the neurotic effect one others include and dealing do not take these please amphetamine cocaine those will increase learning in the trout care in particular dosages but because they increase blood glucose and then of course things painful stimuli or stress willing prove learning by way of increasing blood glucose now stress and epineferan that is associate with it not only improve performance during the learning bout but as i mention before having up an affray come up afterward will increase the retention of that information in the long term and then of course is whole category of neurotics that do not impact blood glucose that work by increasing the colonergics system activity and these are things cosine leather fosistigmine as the prescription drug fosildital sterile the re ways to increase energy that do not require increasing blood glucose and this is vitally important the reason we are talking about epinephrin and cartes all for increasing energy an immune system function is because they are largely independent of blood glucose of course they interact with that system but we heard much growing up you need to eat for energy but the energy that we are talking about to day is shit much more powerful one than the one that you derive from food it is we could call it neral energy it is her transmitters that create alertness and focus and the willingness and the ability to move and the willingness and ability for immune system to move in response to intruders i think we all too often think about to od as energy which is great because it is but there are other sources of energy that are curl and they relate to these hormone systems cortical an epineferon and that is what were focused on to day up until now we have been talking about increasing energy and increasing the immune system by way of cortical an epineferan but it'd be totally remiss if i did not cover how cortical an epineferan if chronically elevated or if elevated too high can have a lot of detrimental effects these are the things we normally hereabout ism going to describe some of those things but ism also going to talk about ways to ameliorate them ways that you can adjust the coatis all levels even if your stressed ways that you can adjust epineferan levels even if your stressed that they have less of a negative impact i do not have to list off all the ways that stress is terrible and chronic stress is terrible i think insomnia your immune system over time will get battered and you will not be able to fight infection offs well might you do not want to bee stressed for too long you can start laying down this or classic pattern of cortical induced body fact in fact there is a whole literature related to comfort foods and why we want to consume comfort foods under conditions of chronic stress and it is quite interesting actually because it reveals something about the biology of chronic stress that is in formative for how to prevent it or to down regulate chronic stress once its occurred let's talk for a singing about comfort foods and the work that am going to refer to is work that was done by a very impressive scientists by the name of merry daman her work goes back decades she was at university californium san francisco and she ask this question that on the face of it seems kind of obvious but for which there was no mechanism known until marry and her lab personal came along the question as why do we seek high fat and or high sugar foods when we are stressed for a while why would that be and the reason is that the call gluccucorticoids of which coatis allies a gluccocordicoid it is causes we have mention before by releasing hormones from the brain an i c t h from the pituitary et camera but normally high levels of glucocorticoid shut off the releasing hormones in the brain and in the pituitary they shut down in a call negative feed back loup just if testosterone or estrogen get too high that is red out or that is seen to speak by neurons in the patuitarian brain and then we shut down are production of estrogen and testosterone if coatis all levels get too high there is too much cortical floating round our blood stream there is a negative feedback loup and the brain in pituitary shut down we or h and a c t h which would otherwise stimulate for cortical crtisall levels go down it is a beautiful negative fee back loop chronic stress however stress that last more than fore to seven days and there is a way to think about what chronic tress really is in actionable way causes changes in the feed back loop between the adrenals and the brain and the pituitary such that now the brain in the pituitary respond to high levels of glucocorticorts courtesan by releasing more of them it becomes a positive fee back loop and that is bad it actually gets right down to levels of gene regulation and transcription and translation and you really do not want chronic stress because it is a cascade of stress equals more stress equals more stress this who its very important to learn to turn off the stress response you do not want it elevated for too long there is one study that domineer colleagues did where they stimulate chronic stress by increasing cortical stern but cortical and they found that subjects would increase their consumption of sugar and fat in fact they would even eat lard it would just its sounds disgusting but they were willing to just eat more fat and more sugar and that less all sorts of things tutu diabetes led to dysfunction in the adrenal output et camera and the real key is to learn to shut off the stress response because the interesting thing is is that dalminan colleagues and some studies that followed up on their work found that if the system was kicked into motion for too long then there was a tremendous shift over all towards anxiety because it turns out that body fat itself receives curl enervation it receive neurons actually talk to body fatso now you have body fat releasing certain hormones you have got the adrenals releasing sort cortical and all of that is feeding back to the brain to make you want more sugar and fatty foods that is how the call comfort foods work and you should a watch yourself next time you experience stress if it is a short term bout of tress typically it blocks hunger if it is a longer bowed of stress typically it triggers hunger in particular for these call comfort food sugary and fatty foods and it is kind of interesting how short term stress can actually block hunger it does that by active eating or interacting with a system called the bombeisin system bombisin is a peptide hormone a it was actually a i think was named after some sort of reptile some it or are amphibianscuse me some sort of toad i think it is initially a sequence from the toad before it was later discovered in humans and i think the toads satin name is a bombing bombing or something of that sort and they decide to call this thing bombeisin but it reduces eating and stress liberates bombeesin and makes you want to eat less but chronic stress causes all these positive feedback changes which are not positive their positive ism calling the posit because they amplify the stress response over and over not because they are good for you short term stress great long term stress really really bad other bad effects of stress that we can talk about and i will not list off too many more of these because many of them you hereabout them you really want to know how to control them i am guessing is that yes indeed stress can make you go gray the rates at which people go gray meaning gray hair some cases great body hair is well depend on some genetic factors there is actually the their couple ways that we can go gray the there is actually a stemsell what they call niche in every physical see of stemsells in the logical that can produce more and more of the given hairball and their actually peroxide groups you know we hereabout bleaching hair with promise leas and the eighties ell as a thing but you can use hydrogen promise to bleach things and you can produce your own provide in the herpholical that will cause the hairs to go gray in addition pigmentation of hair just pigmentation of skin is controlled by malanacites our old friends the malanacites and i say old friends cause on previous episodes i talked about why sunlight in getting ample sunlight can increase levels of certain things malanacite stimulating hormone which reduce hunger it can improve testosterone an estrogen levels and all the reasons for that well turns out that activation of the called sympathetic nervous system which is really just another name for the system that liberates a adrenaline from the adrenals and epinephrin in the brain drives depletion of malanacites in hair stemsells indeed there is a made of aging that we will undergo based on our genetics but stress will make us go gray and the paper that you should look to if you want to read more about this came out very recently this is hangar all z h a n g at all nature fabulous journal dilly one the apex journals twenty twenty this paper show that the activation of stress in various forms will deplete these malanacite stemsells you do not have to worry about an ice bath or hard exercise or breathing increasing your levels of stress to the point where its can to make you go gray were talking again about chronic stress and if you want o offset the stress effects on graying of hair you can do that by either having a practice that helps you regulate stress on a consistent basis of something nonslip de breast or meditation you can get access to manages or vacations those are great but having a practice to keep stress clamped that it is not chronically elevated that will be great as well this is another case where sunlight we know stimulates malanacites not just in skin but in hair and getting ample sunlight having a practice to regulate stress will offset the stressed induced grand of hairs by way of stress induced depletion of mana sites and if milanasit sounds lot pelican your right that is because anything involved with pigmentation in the brain and body generally has melon of in the front of the word an some way or another if chronic stress is bad because of its effects on epinapran and coatis all being elevated for too long then the question becomes of course well what is chronic stress how do i know the difference between chronic and accuse stress and how do i keep chronic stress at bay because of all these negative effects a i am even list out the number of other ones the effects on depression of which certainly has a corset with elevated coatis all thyroid harmony social low thyroid harmony associated with depression mistimed thyroid once again getting your light and your feeding and your exercise and your sleep on a consistent schedule or consistent is is going to be the most powerful thing you can do in order to buff for yourself against negative effects on mental health and physical health for that matter there are things that one can take supplements prescription drugs et camera some of you out there may have or may know people to have bushings which is chronically elevated cortical their prescription drugs that we will talk about that can be used but most people are dealing with a situation where life get stressful than less stressful stressful than less stressful i would say based on the data from mccuan and others bopsapolskis lab over many years i would say any stress that last more than a day or two days or three days as starting to become chronic stress three really no strict cut off because we are not measuring everybody's coatis all for moment a moment my lab has done experiments where we measure stressing people over time people very tremendously in their ability to have a really hard day and then fall deeply asleep that is con to be the ultimate reset is the ability to sleep well more or less undisturbed each night although one or two wake posturing the night probably not can be too detrimental provided there not too long and you are not viewing light in during those wake ups or your phone but the things that you can take if you feel your chronically stressed in your veering toward some of the negativeffects of stress are many there are some simple things that people can do in terms of supplementation all supplements of course have to be checked out for their safety margins for you because it cs an different from person a person you are responsible for making sure their safe for you if you deck to use them one of the most common ones is ashugonda and it has a powerful antibiotic ant anxiety effect your welcome to go to exam cannot calm and for zero cost you can see their called human effect metrics asheaganda has many uses it is been used to enhance power output in athletes it has been shown to modestly increase testastron it has been shown to modestly adjust things low deny approaching colestrall the called bag collestrall in quotes it has a profound effect on anxiety that is been shown in nine studies nine pure reviewed independent studies mean funded by organizations that have no vested interest in the answer it has a very strong effect on cartisall itself bowstring the decreasing cortical need in humans is fourteen point five to twenty seven point nine per cent reduction in otherwise healthy but stressed humans that is great six studies that is and it mentions this the significantly larger than many other supplements now some people will say that taking ashuaganda chronically may not be good if you have heard about that or you can point to specific studies that indicate exactly why it is not good a please put in the comment section or let me know in the common section on you too would be best the studies am referring to did explorer both genders the number o subjects was reasonably high sixty four or more a one to six months studies to these were long term studies that is great you to see that not just in an acute study males and females lots of different ages weight excuse me overweight and non over weight am they did blood draws of cuartesall which is going and as well as saliva testsaliva's actually the best way to measure free cartisall els a measure it from er wax turns out which sounds are gross am and kind of is but none the less a that is where cortical will accumulate in er wax and in saliva the free quartisall a but that is six very quality studies independently supported that all point to the very significant i o fourteen point five to twenty seven point nine percent reductions in otherwise healthy adult if you are somebody who is dealing with chronic tress is the stressful period in your life and you want a stave off the negative effects of stress well then ashewaganda may an one a highlight may be right for you it also does tend to lower total cartisall which is interesting a can lower depression to a somewhat minimal degree and can lower as i mention before things a lode's like eroproting o that i think ashwaganda comes through is kind of the the heavy hitter in this department now what is interesting also is the other effects of ascheaganda that are downstream of reducing chronic stress and quarts all case cortical has many effects ten receptors for quartisal all over the body and brain and saw just limited off quickly ism not onto liftoff each study or talk about how many subjects in detail again you can go to examined to calm if you wanting just put in aschuagonda see reactive praying which is a marker of all sorts of negative health a effects cardiovascular health even macula degeneration is notably refused heart palpitations notably reduced drum t three and t for our old friends thyroid hormones from a previous episode are increased symptoms of of d decreased both the obsessions and the compulsions right obsessions a o the mine compulsions are of behavior there are lot of things that are down stream of refusing cartesall lowered heart rate lowered rates of insomnia slightly improved memory why that would be i do not know because cortical the short term can increase memory on guessing its from increase sleep decrease pain increase quality oo decrease reaction times things of that sort the list goes on and on but all of those things stem down stream of decrease cortical if one word to decide to take ashuaganda in order to refuse cartisall given that you want cortex all early in the day to have energy throughout the day the time to take it as probably later in the day or in the evening have never heard of it preventing sleep or causing in some of any kind that certainly was enlisted as one of the major effects on examined to calm i will take aschuaganda from time to time if ism chronically straits if ism not sleeping as well as i ought to you might think that with all my knowledge about sleep and sleep protocols at i would sleep perfectly every night but unfortunately have a dog that has a of canine form of of sundowners of dimenshasof hes up much of the night these days a an there is no way i getting a solid night of sleep lately and i will supplement with aschuaganda atypically it'll take it before sleep and may be also with my last meal of the day which is at least two hours before i go to sleep again you have to decide if it is right for you the dosages can vary tremendously i w just go by whats off what is on the bottle from a reputable brand i would also check out a examined to come because it mentions a range of hostages that people have used an in various studies to different effects now there is something out there that some of you may actually be taking or ingesting that can increase cartesall and not incidentally can decrease estrogen and teststron because remember cortesall is made from the cilantro molecule is estrogen and testosterone a estrogen and testostronescuse me and it is competitive you are either making more cortical are you're making more of this storied harmony estrogen and testosterone believe it ore not lickerish which i ways thought of as a candy but lickerish contains a substance that i cannot pronounce g el i we why r r h icemen like ceresin a which is a of the labor species of plant actually because of its chemistry this eighteen data hydroxy neritic acid you do not my mean to know all that liquorish black liquorish contains a substance that increases qartisall and it is increases not huge but is it is significant this has been looked at in females age eighteen to twenty nine males and females age eighteen to twenty nine people age third these are separate studies where listing off the tween ages ages thirty to sixty four turns out that you can see pretty substantial increases in serum cartisall and decreases in testosterone an estrogen that was complete news to me also increases in blood pressure that ire pretty substantial that is going to be downstream of quarts all increasing cops all increase blood pressure in order to engage the stress response par this stress repose increased hormones of other kinds as better associated with stress who knew i did not know maybe you knew a previously if you did forgive me but liquorish and some of the compounds in black liquorish can actually increase stress probably not the thing to be investing during periods of chronic stress whether not any one has had plosive effects of using it to increase cartisall in other contacts let me know but very interesting that the chemistry a liquorish increases stress hormones and therefore you would probably want to almost certainly we want to avoid it in conditions of chronic stress also if you try t optimize testosterone and estrogen liquoring a bad ideal i suppose one instance where you might want to use liquorish would be if your traveling in your trying to wake up at a particular location because liquorish has these effects on qartisall and martial is associated with the waking phenomenon an alertness and energy you could use it in that regard however i would be careful the time it the you are not getting two quartisall increases throughout the day two peaks you are going to want to make sure that you are doing all the other things correct for jet lag and adjusting to jet lag and if you want to know what those things are including timing your feeding using temperature using exercise using light to a just od jet lag more quickly please see the episode that we did on jet lag and shift work where i cover all those protecalls in detail the other compound that i thing deserves attention is apigenan a p i g e n i n apigenan which is what is found in camomile apigenan have talked about previously it has various effects one is it is a mild anti estrogen that is been shown in various studies and it does have a bit of an antibiotic effect of reducing anxiety i take it before bedtime fifty milligrams again you have to decide or figure out if that safe for you ere not i not suggesting you take it the major source of action is to calm the nervous system and it does that primarily by adjusting things gala and chloric channels but also has a mild effect an reducing quartusall a shoganda and apigenan together sort of a i would consider the most potent commercial compounds that are in supplement non prescription form that one could use if they were interested in reducing chronic stress especially late in the day by way of reducing quartisall late in the day we are probably getting the impression that cortical an eponepran are bit of a double edge sort you want them elevated but not for too long or too much you do not want them up for days and as and days but you do want to have a practice in order to increase them in the short term we should talk about protocols that can set a foundation of of cartisall an epinephrin that is headed towards optimal optimization is always going to be a series of regular practices that you do every day sleeping at certain times light it specific times food at specific time certain foods et camera and that is highly individual but there are some universals and we have covered a number of those in the discussion to day meal timing meal schedules has a profound effect on energy levels and as i mention before the energy referring to is not glucose energy it is not burning cares while running or ketones what of time tat is curl energy epinepraon and cuartisal fasting and timing one's eating are two sides of the same coin even if you are on a and of standard three meal a day with a couple snacks an between diet or nutrition regimen you are fasting whenever you're sleep er you are not ingesting any calories sunless you are hooked up to an vie of glucose you are fasting while your sleeping there are several different kinds of fasting that can relate to epineferon and martial i will do an entire episode on optimizing food in take for performance in the sports contact that is coming up but in the meantime it let you just talk about fasting as a source of epineferan any time when our blood glucose is low coatis a an pin apron are going to go up if we fast for too long that is stress there is no way round that now that does not mean it does not have other beneficial effects running a marathon is stress but it can also have abusive effects if that is your thing stress has been demonized as a term but we want to think about stress mechanistically as epinefron and martial and then if we do that we can think about how to regulate its timing any time we have nan eaten for for to six hours levels of pin apron an quartisall argon to go up pretty substantially there is an exception to that which is if you are used to eating on the clock every two hours are every hour being half hour late or been even ten minutes late on that schedule will induce stress most outta psychological stress but also the release of things green that are on to make you hungry cause they are on that eating clock one thing that many people do to great benefit is they follow a called creatine eating schedule they eat only when the sun is up they stop when the sun is down more or less the other way thing about this is they stop eating a couple hours before sleep and they eat more or less upon waking assuming that their waking out more or less around the time the sunrises may be plus terminus two hours o cats a are of typical scandal now let say you decide to do what i do which as i skip breakfast i drink water i delay my canine for nine minutes to two hours and then i drink my canine and then my first meal is typically around lunch time eleven thirty or twelve and yes occasionally i throw backs om almond or walnuts or something earlier in the day i that i do do that from time to time am if i get hungry enough or if i just happen to see them ism kind of a drive by eater if i see blueberries or not or something i just got of pick him up and putting in my mouth i try not do that off other people's plates but i just have that habit of doing that from time to time but typically i do not eat until about noon have got a carts all increase have got my sunlight in the mornings i getting a big pulse and energy early in the day and yes there is a obit of agitation i am hungry sometimes early in the day sometimes know but my grilled system is used to kicking in right around noon at the point where i eat as long as i do not eat carbohydrate in my case i know that my epinefran levels are going to stay pretty high for me it is usually meat and said or something of that sort or fishing salad i do not particularly eating fish because of the taste but ism a sexually low carbon keep is throughout the day ism probably in a slightly elevated state of epinfrt an quarts all throughout the day some of you are fasting even longer you are pushing out till four p m or eight p m or may be your even fasting around the clock any time you're fasting you're increasing epinefrn and parts all release you can do all the meditation in the world to keep your mind calm but you are closer to that edge of stress and you are closer to that edge of peaks stress that is something that just important understand the description about comfort foods and carts all was one of kind of an extreme case where carts all systems kick over to positive ye back loup but we all eat to suppress carts all an pin felon when we are hungry corps all nepinefran great in agitation we go seek food when we invest food the typically if it includes carbohydrate there is a blunting of quarts all there a blunting of apineffron in the blood stream if you have ever had too much coffee to drink and you go and have a couple pieces of bread you will feel the the we might describe it as the cabin getting soaked up at o your system but what you are doing as your elevating blood glucose which is more or less saturating the effect of cabin in your system not completely but it is going to have that effect if your very stressing you sit down to eats one thing it will call you down yes because some of the blood that goes to your stomach but more because these effects in blunting quarts all in pin efferent the important point here is that if you want to be alert you can do that by way of not eating of course please invest fluids i know some people water fast out there i am yet to see good science on water fasting and we that can stimulate stem sells or people love the idea of after the noble prize was given for autophagy in the es idea that our sells clean up debris in entice sells yes that is true but the tin that a water fasting is going to promote that i find rather amusing please send me the data if of some great study in a decent journal but pretty much this is something i hereabout i do not think water fasting is a good idea north you be drinking much water on that you kill yourself actually drink enough water that you o that you die i think in jesting water in healthy amounts is a good thing stay hydrated but if you want to be alert stay hydrated coffin mayor may not be in your regiment but fasting will make sure that your levels of energy are up and you will be primed very well for doing a protocol of the sort that we talked about earlier in this episode of breathing or cold exposure or exercise to get that increase in the immune system function and if you do that after learning after trying to learn something it will increase learning for that particular set of information whether no its motor or language or whatever t happens to be mathematics programming fasting is a tool for many reasons can increase growth hormone et camera but to day ism talking about fasting is a tool to bias your system toward more epineferan a adrenaline release and toward more coatis all release but still low enough that it is not chronic stress that it is not causing negative health effects but please no that if life is very very stressful if your experiencing lots of stresses and your chronically fasting you are positioning yourself toward a greater likelihood of being chronically stressed in the ways that are negative negative effects on the reproductive axis lower testosterone an western negative effects on i you are going to your heiralturn grey there is reasons for that you are sleep will suffer your immune system will suffer i think while it is new aunts our discussion to day about epineferan and coatis all increasing energy and immunity are designed to help you understand when you should be doing certain things when you should throttle back when you might want to kick up your adrenal in a bit if your suffering from low energy because you are just kind of feeling down and a little bit a under activated will then the practices of ice baths and intend breathing et camera could be very beneficial might fasting but if your feeling exhausted and burnt out drained street will then fasting or doing a lot of cold exposure or doing a lot of intense exercise is driving you further and further into chronic tress because i do not have a saliva test or a blood test a god forbidden your ax test to measure your coatis all as were engaging in this discussion together you have to gauge for yourself whether not you are in a state of underactivated and need more epinefforting coatis all or whether r not you are over activated in terms of coatis all an epanepran and you need ways to buffer those ashuagona a maybe it should be a warm mellobath not an ice bath one has to learn how to regulate these hormones with behavior with nutrition perhaps wit supplementation and then of course there are prescription drugs and i i always leave these to the end because a ism not a medical doctor ism not prescribing anything ism a professor on professing a number of things that you can decide for yourselves what to do with or not but of course there are prescription drugs that can increase coatis all or decrease cortical in cases pushing centrum which if you have that diagnose you should talk to a physician you should talk ideally to a and a chronologist but to a physician of some sort board certified physician there are drugs that can be used to treat injury cortical stones that you can inject to reduce inflammation injury but they are coatis all they are get abuse you towards more stress in other domains remember courts all concuss the cross the blood trainbearers who can be more prone to psychological stress i also want o mention again that i think there is great benefit to having a practice that perhaps you do every other day but if you cannot may be every today or every other day of deliberately increasing your adrenaline in your body while learning to stay calm in the mind that you learn to separate the brain body experience we hear much about how beneficial it is to unify the brain and body that we are all out of touch with our brain and bodies i i i particularly dislike claims that or statements that because there is great power as we learn today in having your body activated by some sort of stimulus cold water or even psychological stress but learning to stay calm in your mind i shouldst remind you that most of the negative effects on your life and on the lives of others are due to people perhaps you i hope not being unable to regulate their mind when they have high levels of adrenaline in their body either because they read something in attest or a comment section course that never happens to me but it may happen to you of course it happens to me but the ideas to stay calm in your mind that then you can regulate your action right and i think that there are these practices that one can develop over time that are really straightforward and zero cost right you could find any number of ways to increase your adrenalin and stay calm and we tend to focus on things exercise as the way that we get our energy up but to day again ism talking about deliberately increasing a adrenaline whilst sting calm mentally because that has great utility when the adrenaline hits through unwanted events through things that we did not seek out the ability to regulate a dealing cornball is about in ducking them deliberately when you want to push back on infection potential infection from back turgor viruses it is about pulling no back on a adrenaline in cortical maybe through the use of supplementation but certainly through proper use of light and sleep and mental tools the we talked about as well when they are chronically elevated it is about training your system not just to be unified tot brain and body which sounds great until your stress and then that is terrible it is really about having a deliberate dissociation between the adrenalin response from the adrenals in the adrenaline response from the braincetem once again we have covered a ton of material i hope right now your thinking one am i in a state of chronic stress and i underactivated ort could i afford to increase my levels of a drennaling cortical to improve my relationship to my immune system and to energy curl energy if you the information and that you heard today and you want to remember it well then at the and of this episode perhaps you go do something to increase your level of adrenaline and now what some of those things are because it will help you retain the information or you could apply that to anything else that you learn or experience of course and i hope that you will think about some of the ways in which court is all and adrenaline are not good or bad that stresses in good or bad but short term stress is healthy alertness and energy is healthy even if it puts you at the edge of agitation that is an opportunity to learn how to control these hormones better and i hope that if your in a state of chronic stress that you will do things to start tamping down some of that stress and that you realize that your nervous system in your hormone system are linked but there linked in ways that you con control that we do not have to be slaves to our hormones and certainly not the hormones that cause us stress we can learn to control those both to the benefit of our body and benefit of mind if your learning from this podcast and you the information that your learning please

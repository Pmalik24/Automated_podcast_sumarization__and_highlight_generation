welcome to the hubermanlapoga o science science pace to i may indrouhuberman and on a professor of nerobilog and opthemology at stamford school of medicine to day we are talking about obsessive compulsive disorder or of d we are also going to talk about obsessive compulsive personality disorder which as you will soon learn is distinct from obsessive compulsive disorder in fact many people that refer to themselves or others as obsessive or compulsive or gun having of d or one d about this or of d about that do not have clinically diagnosable one d rather many people have obsessive compulsive personality disorder however there are many people in the world that have actual of d and for those people there is a tremendous amount of suffering in fact one d turns out to be number seven on the list of most debilitating illnesses not just psychiatric illnesses but of all illnesses which is remarkable and somewhat frightening the good news is thanks to the fields of psychiatry psychology and since in general there are now excellent treatments for one d we are going to talk about those treatments to day those treatments range from behavioral therapies to drug therapies and brain stimulation and even some of the more holistic or natural therapies as you will soon learn for certain people they may want a photos more on the behavioral therapies whereas for others more on the drug base therapies and on and forth one extremely interesting and important thing i learn from this episode is that the particular sequence that behavioral and our drug and or holistic therapies are applied is extremely important in fact the outcomes of studies often depend on whether not people start on drug treatment and than follow with cogon behavioral treatment or vice verse we are going to going to all those details and how they relate to different types of one d because it turns out there are any different types of obsessions and compulsions and the age of onset for one d and on and forth what i can assure you is by the end of this episode you will have a much greater understanding of what of d is an what it is not and what obsessive compulsive personality disorder is in what it is not and you will have a rich array of different therapy options to explore and yourself or in others that are suffering from of d and if neither you or others that suffer from one d or obsessive compulsive personality disorder the information covered in to day's episode will also provide insight into how the brain and nervous system translate thought into action generally and also you are going to learn a lot about got directed behavior generally my hope is that by the end of the episode you will both understand a lot about this diseased state that we call one d you will have access to information that will allow you to direct treatments to yourself or others in better ways and that you will gain greater insight into how you function and w human beings function in general the german ladpodcast is proud to announce that were partnered with momentous supplements you done that for several reasons first of all the quality of their supplements is exceedingly hie second of all we wanted have a location where you could find all of the supplements discussed on the supermen ladpodcast in one easy find place you can now find that place at livemomentous do come slash supermen in addition momentous supplements ship internationally something that a lot of other supplement company simply do not do that is terrific whether not you live in the us or you live abroad right now not all of the supplements that we discussed on the supermen podcast are listed but that catalogue of supplements is being expanded very rapidly and a good number of them that we have talked about some of the more prominent ones for sleep and focus and other aspects of mental and physical health are already there again you can find them at limomentoustok come slash supermen before we begin i to emphasize tat this podcast is separate from my teaching in research rolls at stamford it is however part of my desire effort to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science and science related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens thetic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve son delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens in the reason i still take athletigreens once or twice o day is that helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called gopmicrobiom and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens that get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stop come slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of data ow showing that vitemend three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even if for getting a lot of sunshine many of us our still deficient in vitamin d three and k too is also important because it regulates things carevascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic green stock come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five travel packs and the year supply of vitemend three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar have talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve self function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues an organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the properties all of those cells function properly and all our bodily systems can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration end that your getting the preparation of electrolytes if you to try element you can go to drink element that is element dream slash huberment and you get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element element do cam slash supermen let us talk about one d or obsessive compulsive disorder first of all as the name suggests used includes thoughts or obsessions and compulsions which are actions the obsessions in the compulsions are often linked in fact most of the time the obsessions in the compulsions linked such that the compulsion the behavior is desire to relieve the obsession however one of the hall marked themes of obsessive compulsive disorder is that the obsessions are intrusive people do not want to have them they do not enjoy having them they just seem to pop into people's mines and they seem to pop into their mind recurrently and the compulsions unlike other sorts of behaviors provide brief relief to the obsession but then very quickly reenforce or strengthen the obsession this is a very key theme to realize about obsessive compulsive disorder sous can repeat it again these two features first the fact that the obsessions are intrusive and recurrent as well as the fact that the compulsions the behaviors provide if anything only brief relief for the obsessions but in most cases simply serve to make the session stronger are the hall mark features of obsessive compulsive disorder in turns out to be very important to keep these in mind as we go forward not just because they define obsessive compulsive disorder but they also define the sorts of treatments that will and will not work for obsessive compulsive disorder and then once you understand a little about the normal circuitry underlying obsessive compulsive disorder which will talk about in a few moments then you will clearly understand why being a quit an cot obsessive person or having obsessive compulsive personality is not the same as seed in fact we can leap ahead a little bit and compare an contrast o we d with obsessive compulsive personality disorder along one very particular set of features and it'll go into this and more t till later but it is fair to say that one d is characterized by these recurrent and intrusive obsessions and as i mention before the fact that the obsessions get stronger as a function of people performing certain behaviors unlike an itch that you feel an then you scratch it an it feels better used is more an itch that you feel you scratch it and the itch intensifies that contour or that pattern of behaviors and thoughts interacting is very different than obsessive compulsive personality disorder which mainly involves a sense of delayed gratification that people want and somewhat enjoy because it allows them to function better or more in line with how they would to show up in the world again see d has mainly to do with sessions that are intrusive and recurrent whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder does not have that intrusive feature to it people do not mind or in fact often invite or the particular patterns of thought that lead them to be compulsive along certain dimensions leaving aside obsessive compulsive personality disorder for the moment let us focus a bit more on o we d and find how it tends to show up in the world first of all see d is extremely common in fact current estimates are that anywhere from two point five per cent to as high as three or even four per cent of people suffer from true one d that is an astonishingly high number now the reason the rangers big to point five percent all the way up to three or maybeven four per cent is that a lot of the features of o we d go unnoticed both in the clinicians office and simply because people do not report it and do not talk about it in fact it is possible to have recurrent and intrusive obsessions and not engage in the sorts of behaviors that would ever allow people to notice that somebody has one d that can be because some of the intrusive thoughts do not actually lead to overt behaviors handfasting or checking that other people would notice it can also be because people learn to disguise or hide their obsessions and their compulsions out of shame or fear of looking strange or whatever it might be such that they have these obsessive indintrusive thoughts and they do little micro behaviors they might tap their fingers on their fly as a way to avoid at least in their own mind something catastrophic happening that might seem crazy to you the might seem bizarre but this is the sort of thing that operates in a lot of people and i really want to emphasize this because the clinical literature that are out there really point to the fact that many people have one d full blown one d and never report it because of the shame and hiding associated with it another thing to point out is that one d is extremely debilitating i mention this a few minutes ago but seeds currently listed as in number seven in terms of the most debilitating illness is not just mental illnesses or disorders but all types of illnesses including things again cancer et camera you can imagine with that standing at number even that it is both extremely common end extremely debilitating and as a consequence it is now realized that many hours days weeks months or even years of work performance or showing up at work of relational interactions really suffer as a consequence of people having used this is a vital problem that the scientific and psychiatric in psychological communes understand and it is one of the reasons that ism doing this podcast and of course i revive the ton of interest in n one d because of this incredibly high incidents of one d and how debilitating it is we could go really deep into we it is debilitating i soft not spend too much time on that because i think most of that is pretty obvious but some of it is not for instance one of the things that makes one d debilitating is of course the shame that we talked about before but it is also the fact that when people are focussing on their obsessions in their compulsions they are not able to focus on other things that is simply the way that the brain works were not able to focus on too many things at once the other thing is that see d takes a lot of time out of people's lives with recurrent intrusive thoughts happening at very high frequent see or even at moderate frequency people are spending a lot of time thinking about this stuff and they are thinking about the behaviors they need coinage in and then engaging in the behaviors which as i mention before just serve to strength in the compulsions and they are not actually doing the other things that make us functional human beings commuting to work or doing home work are doing work or listening when people are talking or interacting or sports are working all the things that make for a rich quality life a takin over by one d in many cases well that might be obvious to some ism not sure that it is obvious to everybody just how much time see d can occupy another thing you will soon learn is that sadly a lot of the obsessions and compulsions in one d often relate to taboo topics and that is because the general categories of one d fall in to three different bens checking obsessions and compulsions repetition obsessions and compulsions an order sessions and compulsions the checking ones are somewhat obvious checking the stove or checking the locks which i think we all tend to do ism somebody typically out and off to the card a you commute to work nothing lock the front door and all go back once but i will not go back twice or fifty times people with one d will offend go back twenty or thirty times before they will actually allow themselves to drive off and then its a real challenge for them to continue to drive off and discard with the idea that they did not check the stover they did not check the locks or they did not check something else critical repetition obsessions and compulsions obviously can dove tail with the the checking ones but those ten to be things counting off of a certain number of numbers whole to beforfives i seven seven six five or three to one people perform that repeatedly repeatedly repeatedly or feel that they have to remember years ago watching a documentary about the band the rooms i most be re hard of the demons right genes sheets aviator lasses every one had to change their last name to demon they ware not actually all related to one another by the way yet to change your last name toeuremon the demons had one band member who was admittedly and known to others as having one d and during that documentary which i forget the name think it is called cannot remember anyway cannot remember a hippocampi laps there but in this documentary the band members describe joy demon as leaving hotels walking down the stairs to the parking lot but then having to walk up and down them seven or eight times and sometimes getting out of the van again and walking up down them seven or eight times it always had to be a certain number of times given a certain number of stairs this appears quoting crazy but of course we do not want to think of this as crazy this is somebody who very likely had full blown seed now that particular example believe it ore not is not all that uncommon it just happens that that example entailed certain compulsions and behaviors that were overt and that other people could see and you can imagine how that would prevent somebody from moving about their daily life easily a lot of people as i mention before have obsessions and compulsions that they hide an they do these little micro behaviors or they are just count off in their head as opposed to generating some sort of walking up and downstairs or tapping or things of that sort we have checking we have repetition and then there is order order oftentimes is thought of as putting cleanliness or making sure everything as a lined and perfect in orderly and oftentimes that is the case but there are other forms of order that people with used can focus on in a obsessive and compulsive way things incompleteness the idea that one cannot walk away from something or stop doing something because somethings not right or complete in that picture it could be the way that table is set it could be the way that somethings written on a page it could be in male get now we still talking about of d the disorder were not talking about obsessive compulsive personality distorter ism aware of well it'll just be direct several colleagues of mine as just remarkable the order in their males every male is perfect punctuated perfect grammar perfect everything space perfect are do they have used while they might they might not how would i know unless they disclose that to me but they might have obsess give compulsive personality the sorter or they just might be able to generate a lot of order and they have a lot of discipline around the way they write in the way they present any communication with anybody at all if somebody has a one d that in the domain of order it could be incompleteness and the constant feeling of something not being completed and a need to complete it it can also be in terms of symmetry that everything be a lined in symmetric in some way this could be a seen perhaps in young kids this is one ex ample that i read in the literature of children that need to arranged their stuffed animals in exact same order every day and in a particular order a to the point where if you were to move the little stuffed frog over next to the stuffed rabbit that the child would have a an anxiety reaction to that and feel literally compelled driven to fix that may been multiple times over and over again we will talk about used and children verses adults in a little bit and then the other aspect of order which is a litlabit less than intuitive is this notion of disgust this idea that something is contaminated we often think about used and handfasting behavior in response to people feeling that something is contaminated a space a towel et camera or even simple somebody ease's hand in there unwilling to shake somebody is hand you can imagine how these different bins of obsessions and compulsions checking repetition and order the extremely debilitating depending on how severe they are and how many different domains of life they show up in because oftentimes in movies and even the way ism describing it now it sounds as if oke well somebody has to check the locks but they do not have to also check the stove or somebody has the need to count to seven back and forth up to seven and down to seven seven times seven times a day or something of that sort where they need symmetry in very specific domains of life but it turns out that this recurrent and intrusive aspect of obsessions leads people with o c d to have checking repetition and or order compulsions everywhere whether or not somebody is at work or in school or chi a engage in sport or chinengage in relationship or just something simple walking down the street the obsessions are intrusive that they show up and they compel people to do things in that domain independent of whether or not they have not been one location or another in other words the thought patterns and the behaviors take over the environment as suppose the environment driving the thought patterns and behaviors it therefore becomes impossible to ever find a room that is clean enough to find a bed that is made well enough to find anything that is done well enough to remove the obsession and i noise said it multiple times now when ism going to say it many times throughout this episode in a somewhat obsessive but a believe justified way that every time that one engages in the compulsion related to the obsession the sessions simply becomes stronger as you can imagine what a what a powerful and debilitating loop that really is let us drill a little but deeper in to how the obsessions and compulsions relate to one another if we were to draw line between the obsessions in the compulsions that line could be described as anxiety now we need to define what anxiety is and to be quite honest most of psychology an science cannot agree on exactly what anxiety is typically the way we thin about fear is that it is a heightened state of autonomic arousal increase tartrate increase breathing sweating et camera in response to an immediate and present threat or perceived threat or as anxiety generally speaking in the scientific literature relates to the same sorts of thought patterns and somatic bodily responses heart rate breathing et camera but without a clear and present danger being in the environment or right there that is the way that were on to talk about anxiety now and anxiety is really what binds the obsessions and compulsions such that some one will have an intrusive thought for instance some one will have the thought that if they turn left on any street that something bad will happen f that is an obsession is asking not all that uncommon now how bad and what the specificity of that bad thing really is will vary somepeople will think if i turn left something generally bad will happen it just makes me feel anxious they always insisted going right where as other people will think if i turn left and will die or i will die or something terrible will happen it'll get a disease or some one else will get a disease or it'll be cursing myself or somebody else in some very specific way this is unfortunately quite common in people with used they have this feeling and the feeling can be generally or specifically related to a particular outcome but beneath that is a feeling of anxiety a quickening of the heart beat a quickening of breathing a narrowing of one's visual focus have talked about this before another podcast the master streets another podcast but you have not heard those en we just briefly describe that when we are in a state of increased called autonomic eralsal alertness stress et camera our visual feel literally narrows the aperture of our visual field get smaller and that is because of the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and your visual system you start seeing the world through sort of solo straw view or through binocular view as opposed to seeing the big picture why is that important well it literally sharpens and narrows your focus toward the very thing that the obsession and the compulsions are focused on of the person walking down the street who sees the opportunity to go left or right will only see the bad decision the visual feel narrows very tightly along that possibility of taking a left turn and i know as i describe the seems tolly rational but i want to emphasize that the person with of seedy knows its irrational they might feel crazy because their having these thoughts but they know it makes no sense whatsoever that left somehow would be different than right in terns of outcomes in this particular case and yet it feels as if it would in fact in some cases it feels as if they went left they would have a full blown panic attack the idea here is that the obsessions and compulsions are bound by anxiety but then by taking a right hand turn again in this one particular example by taking a right hand turn there is a very brief i should mention very brief relief of that anxiety at the time of the decision to go right not left and there is an additional drop in anxiety while one takes the right hand turn as opposed to the left hand turn and then as i alluded to before there is a reinforcement of the compulsion in other words by going right it does not create a situation in the brain and psychology of the person that i youknowat ism not anxious any more left would probably been o cay it reenforces the idea that right made me feel better or turning right made me feel better and going left would have been that much worse again it reenforces the obsession even further and again we could swap out right turns and left turns with something hand washing the feeling that something is contaminated and the need to wash one's hands even though one already wash their hands twenty thirty fifty times prior whereas on to go back to that example little bit later when we talk about one particular category of therapies that are very effective in many people for used which ow the cognac behavior an exposure therapies think some of you have heard of count behavior own exposure therapies but the way they are used to treat used is very much different than the way they are used to treat other sorts of anxiety disorders and other sorts of disorders generally it is fair to say that up to seventy per cent of people with used have some sort of anxiety or elevated anxiety either directly related to the used or indirectly related to the used and it is really hard to tease those apart because used can create its own anxiety as i mention before it can even increase its own anxiety and there is also an issue of depression having old can be very depressing specially if some of these used thoughts and behaviors start a really impede people's ability to function in life at work and schooling relationship they can start feeling less optimistic about life and in fact some people can become suicidally depress that is how bad used can be for us we have to be careful when saying that seventy percent of people with used also have anxiety or exonumber people it used a also depressed because we do not know whether not the depression led the old or the other way around or whether not their operating as we say in science in parallel some of the drug treatments for used in depression and anxiety can tease some of that apart and will talk about that but i think it is fair to say that what a binds the obsessions and compulsions is anxiety that there is a feeling of t where i should say an urgent feeling of a need to get rid of the obsession and the person feels as if the only way they can do that is to engage in a particular compulsive behavior some people are probably wondering if there is a genetic component to used and indeed there is although the nature of it is an exactly clear and often times when people here that something has a genetic component they think it is always directly inherited from apparent and that is not always the case there can be genes that surface in siblings or genes that surface and children that are not readily apparent in terms of what we call a genotypes he have a genotype the get an then you have a genotype the way it shows out as a body form or i color or how it shows up in terms of a behavior or behavioral pattern based on twin studies where researchers have examined identical twins fraternal twins even identical twins that share the same sack in uteri the what we call monochorionics are sitting in the same little bag during pregnancy or in different little bags you can see different levels of what is called genetic concordance but if we are h sort of cut cut abroad swath through all the genetic data it is fair to say that about forty to fifty per cent of used cases a have some genetic component some mutation or some inherited aspect that is genetic in that one could point to if they got their gene map now while that is interesting i do not think it is terribly useful for most people first of all cannot really control your genes at lest at this point in history even though their things l like epigenesis control and people are very excited about technologies crisper for modifying the gene in humans at some point most people cannot control their genetics right you cannot pick coo your parentsoras they say just know that there is a genetic component in about half of people with used but not always now as is typical for this podcast i want a focus on some of the your mechanisms and chemical systems in the brain and body that generate obsessive compulsive disorder in fact you've watch this podcast before listen to this podcast before this is always how i structure things first we introduce a topic and we explore that topic an detail really to fine what it is in what it is not and then it is very important that we focus on what is known and what is not known about the biological mechanisms that generate whatever that thing happens to be in this case seed in obsessive compulsive personality disorder now onto emphasize that even if you do not have a background and biology i will make this information accessible to you and i also wane to emphasize that for those of you that are interested in treatments and are anxiously awaiting the description of things that can help with used encourage you if you will to please try an digest some of the material about the underlying mechanisms because understanding even just a little bit of those biological mechanisms can really help shed light on why particular drug and behavior treatments and other sorts of treatments work and do not work this is especially important in the case of seed where it turns out that the order and type of treatment can really vary according to individual and that is something really special and important about seed that we really cannot say for number the other sorts give disorders that we described on previous podcast let us take a step back and look at the neural circuitry what is going on in the brain and body of people with used why the intrusive recurrent thoughts why the compulsions why is that whole system bound by anxiety and in some ways in thinking about that i want you to keep in mind that the brain has two main functions the brains main functions are to take care of all the housekeeping stuff make sure digestion works make sure the heart beats make sure you keep breathing no matter what make sure that you can see you can hear you can smell at camera the basic stuff and then there is an enormous amount of brain real estate that is design to allow you to predict what is going to happen next either in the immediate future in the long term future and largely that is done based on your knowledge of the past o you also memory systems and of course you have systems in the brain and body that are design to bind what is happening at the housekeeping level your heart rate to your anticipation of whats can happen next o if your thinking about something very fearful your body will have one type of reaction if you thinking about something very pleasant and relaxing your body will have another type of reaction whenever i hear about the brain body distinction have to just remind everybody that there really is no distinction between brain and body when you think about it through the nervous system the n nervous system is the brain the eyes the spinal cord but of course all their connections with all the organs of the body in the connections of all the organs of the body with the brain the spinal cord et camera as i describe these neural circuits i do not want you to think of them as bushings happening in the head they are certainly happening in the head in fact the circuits all the scribe most in detail do exist within the confines of your cranial vault that is need speak for skull but those circuits are driving particular predictions and therefor particular basis towards particular actions in your body they are creating a state of readiness or a state of desire to check or desire to count or desire to avoid et camera et camera what are these circuits well there is been a lot of wonderful research exploring the natural circuits underlying obsessive compulsive disorder and that is mainly been accomplish through a couple of methods most of those methods when applied in humans involve getting some look into which brain areas are active when people re having objections and when people are engaging in compulsions now that might seem simple to do but of course your brain is housed inside the cranial vault and in order to look inside it yet to use things magnetic resonance imaging which is just fancy technology for looking at blood flow which relates to activation of neuron's nerve cells or things pet p e t imaging which has nothing to do with the verb pet and has nothing to do with your house pet has everything to do with positronomission tomography which is just another way of seeing which brain areas are active and in you can also use petite figure out what sorts of negro chemicals are active dopamine et camera many studies we can fairly say dozens if not hundreds of studies have now identified a particular circuit or loop of brain areas that are interconnected and very active in obsessive compulsive disorder that loop includes the correct which is kind of the outer shell of the the human brain the lumpy stuff as it sometimes appears if the skull is removed and it involves in area called the stratum which is involved in action selection and holding back action the stratum is involved in what is commonly called go and logo types of behaviors every type of behavior picking up a pen or a mug of coffee involves a go type function is involves generating in action but every time i resist in action my nervous system is also doing that using this brain structure the stratum which includes among other things the banal ganglia talked about that before when i sri to overload you with terminology here but i know some people are interesting terminology you have go behaviors and you have logo resisting of behaviors not going toward behavior the correct and the stratum are in this intricate back in for talk its really loops of connections the correct does not tell the tritium what to do the atrium does not tell the correct what to do they are in a restock any good relationship there is a lot of back and forth communication there's a third element in this portico trial loop as it is called and that is the thalamus now the thalamus is not a structure have talked a lot about before on this podcast but it is one of my favorite structures to think about and teach about in neranatomy which i teach ism back it stamford and have taught for many years elsewhere because the thalamus is this incredible like structure in the center of your brain that has different channels through it channels for relaying visual information or auditory information or touch information from your environment up into your quartan as a consequence making certain things that are happening to you and around you apparent to you making you aware of them making you perceive them and suppressing others for instance right now if your hearing me say this your thalamus has what are called auditory nucleathersers collections of neurons that respond to soundwaves that of course coming in through your ears and your thalamus is active in a way that those particular regions of your thalamus are aloud literally permitted to pass the information coming from your ears through some other steps but then to your thalamus your auditory thalmistan up to your quarter and you can hear what ism saying right now at the same time your thalamus is surrounded by a kind of a shell something called the thalamic particular nucleus again you do not hate remember the names but this thalamic particular nucleus also sometimes called the reticular thalamic nucleus this is believe it are not a subject of debate insides of people that literally hated each other while they still hate each other even the one of themes dead for decades because they would argue is thalamic particular nucleus ether with rete ridicule thalamic nucleus anyway is our scientists their people they tend to debate but the thalamic particular nucleus as ism going to call it serves as a sort of gait as to which information is allowed to pass through up to your conscious experience and which is not and that gating mechanism is strongly regulated by the chemical gala gala is a narrow transmitter that is in history as we say it serves to shut down or suppress the activity of other narrows the thalamic reticular nucleus is really saying no much information cannot come in right now you should not be thinking about the contact of the back of your legs with the chair that you are sitting on drew you should be thinking about what you are thing to say and what you are hearing and ho your voice sounds and what you see in front of you et camera whereas if ism about to get an injection from a doctor or ism in pain or ism in pleasure ism going to think about my sematic sensation at the level of touch and ism probably in to think less about smells in the remount although i might also think about smells in the room or what ism seeing in what ism hearing we can combine all these different censer modalities but the thalamic particular nucleus really allows us to funnel to direct particular categories of sensory experiences into our conscious awareness and suppress other categories of set sensory experience in addition the thalamic particular nucleus plays a critical role in which thoughts are allowed to pass up to our conscious perception and which ones are not much that some hero scientists and indeed some negro philosophers if you want to call them that have theorized or philosophize that the thalamic particular newcleas is actually involved in our consciousness now consciousness is in a topic that i really want to talk about this episode in its e very kind of mushy mercy as we say in science its a schmoes term because it does not really have clear definitions of arguments about it often get lost in the fact that people are arguing about different things but when i say consciousness what i mean as conscious awareness let us fume out and take a look at the circuit that we have got and that we now know based on neroimaging studies is intimately involved in generating obsessions and compulsions in used we have a vortex or no vortex which is involved in perception and understanding of what is happening we have the stratum and ball ganglia which are involved in generating behaviors go and suppressing behaviors logo and we have the thalamus which collects all of our sensory experience in parallel hearing touch smell et camera not much smell through the traumas i shoumension but the other sense senses that is and then that thalamus is in caste by the thalamic particular nucleus which serves as a kind of a a guard saying you can pass through a encompass through but you you u cannot pass through up to conscious understanding an perception that loop this portico stride thalamic loop korticostritothelamic loop is the circuit thought to underlie used and dysfunction in that circuit is what is thought to underlie used now again the circuit exists in all of us and it can operate in healthy ways or can operating ways that make us feel unhealthy or even suffer from full used how do we know that this circuit is involved in used well there we can look to some really interesting studies that involved bringing human subjects into the laboratory and generating their obsessions and compulsions and then imaging their brain using any variety of techniksthat we talked about before what would such an experiment look well in order to do that sort of experiment first of all you need people who have used and of corse you need control subjects that do not and you need to be able to reliably evoke the obsessions and the compulsions now turns out this is most easily or i should say most simply done cause it cannot be easy for the people with used but this is most straightforward that is the what ills looking for most straightforward when looking at the category of obsessions and compulsions that relate to order and cleanliness what they do typically as bring subjects into the laboratory who have a obsession about germs an contamination and a compulsion to handfast and they give these people believe it or not a sweaty towel that contains the sweat and the odor and the liquid basically from somebody ease's hands effect they'll sometimes have someone wipe their own sweat off the back of their neck and put it on the talk e n then they will put it in front of the person which as you can imagine for some one of the used is incredibly anxiety provoking and almost always evokes these obsessions about o this is really a this is really bad this is really bat i need to i need to clean i need to clean i need to clean now they are doing all this while some one is in a brain scanner or while they are being image for positronomission tomography and then they can also look the patterns of activation in the brain while the person is doing hand washing although sometimes the aporateye assoil withthese imaging studies make it hard to do a lot of movement they can do these sorts of studies they have done these sorts of studies in many subjects using different variations of what i just described and lone behold what lights up when i see lights up what what sort brain regions are more metabolically active more blood flow for nor a activity well it is this particular portico trial thalamic loop in addition to that some of the drug treatments that are effective in some and i want emphasize some individuals at suppressing obsessions and ore compulsions such as the selective baritone and rep taken visitors or assessor eyes which will talk about an low bit when people take those drugs they see joyous a suppression of the obsession and compulsion but also a suppression of these particular neral circuits they become less active now i want it emphasize and telegraph a little bit of what is coming later these drugs accessorize do not work for everybody with used and as many of they carry other certain problems and side effects for many but not all individuals but none the less what we have now is in observation that this circuit the cortical stride thalamic loop is active nosed we have a manipulation that when people take a drug that at least in those individuals is effective in suppressing or eliminating the obsessions and compulsions there is less activity in the sloop and thanks to some very good animal model studies that at least at this point time you really could not do in humans although soon that may change we now know in a causal way that the equivalent circuitry a exists in other animals such as mice such as cat such as monkeys and that activation of those particular corticolstrital thalamic circuits in animal models can indeed evoke old in an individual that prior to that did not have of d some dustpan a briefly describe one study this is a now classic study published in the journal science one of the three a externals in twenty thirteen the first author on this paper is a sauna mark a h an a are i i will provide a link to this in the shoots is a truly landmark paper done in peahens lab at colombia university and the title of the paper is repeated portico strike o stimulation generates that is the key word here generates persistent used behavior what they did as they took mice mice do mouse things they move round they plavatois they eat they e they main they do various things in their cage but they also groom human groom animals with fur groom you hope most people groom some people over groom some people undergrown most people groom they will comb their hair they will clean at camera those are normal behaviors that humans engage in ism not aware that mice come the er but mice adjust their hair they cool pet their hair they will do this sill some is even do it to each other we stave mice in lab now we only do human studies but the the mice will groom themselves and typical what we call wild type mice not becausetheire wild but because their typical will groom themselves at a particular frequency but not to the point where their hair is falling out not constantly they are grooming some of the time and their doing other mouse things other mousetimes in this particular study what they did is they used some technology which actually was discussed on a previous episode of the subhuman ladpodcast this is technology that was developed by a psychiatrist and by engineer by the name of carl diceroth one of my colleagues it that standard school of medicine this is technology that allows researches to use the presentation of light to control neral activity in particular brain areas in a very high fidelity way you control the activity in the quarters of the stratum or the traumas when you want an how you want it is really a beautiful technology in any event what they did in the study is or i should say what susanamari and colleagues did in the study was to stimulate the cortical strata circuitry in animals that did not have any used behavior and when they did that those animals started grooming incessantly to the point where their hair was falling out or they even you know they did not take the experiments this far fortunately but the animals would have a tendencies almost rub themselves raw in the same way that somebody who has a compulsion to handfast would sadly people will handfast to the point where their hands are actually bleeding and raw it is really that bad i know it is tough imagery to imagine and you cannot even imagine why some one would self harm in that way but again that is that incredible anxiety relationship between the compulsion souse me the obsession and the compulsion and the fact that engaging in the compulsion simply strengthens the obsession and there for the anxiety that collection of studies of data spermary pet scanning in humans the treatment with essessoriyes and these experiments were researchers have actively triggered these particular circuits in animal models that previously did not have too much activity in these circuits and then they observe old emerging really point squarely to the fact that the cortical stride of thalamic loop is likely to be the basis of used now of course other circuits could also be involved but the cortical strip o thalamic circuits seems to be the main circuit generating seed behavior that is a lot of mechanism holly it was described in a way that you can digest and understand and some of you might be thinking will what what why does it help maim and i cannot reach in to my brain and turn off my quarter i cannot reach into my brain and turn a f my traumas and indeed on the one hand that is true but as you will next learn when thinking about the various behavioral treatments and drug treatments and holistic treatments for used what you will notice is that each one taps into a different component of this corticostriatal thalamic loop and by understanding that you can start to see why certain treatments might work at one stage of the illness first as others you will also start to understand why obsessive compulsive personality disorder does not have the same sorts of engagements of these neral loops and yet relies on other aspects of brain and body and therefore responds best to other sorts of treatments or in some cases people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder are not even seeking treatment as i alluded to before the point here is that by understanding the underlying mechanism why certain drugs and behavioral treatments work and do not work will become immediately apparent and in thinking about that in knowing that you will be able to make excellent choices i believe in terms of what sorts of treatments you pursue what sorts of treatments you abandon and most importantly the order the sequence that you pursue and apply those treatments before we go any further i to give people what bit of a windowing to what a diagnosis for used would look you sense of the sorts of questions that a coalition would ask to determine whether not somebody has see or not now when i be clear ism not going to do this in an exhaustive way i wouldn't want any one to self diagnose although ism hoping that by sharing some of this that some of you might get inside into whether not you do have obsessions and compulsions that might qualify for used and a perhaps even to seek out help the most commonly used test of used or for seed i should say is called the male brown obsessive compulsive scale and this is a you scientists love acronyms as do the military and it is the box the why dash b o s as the wyibox typically some one will go into the clinic either because a family member encourage them to or because they feel that their suffering from sessions and compulsions and before the cognition would proceed with any kind of direct questions they would very clearly define what obsessions and compulsions are in here i mash reading from the box quote obsessions are unwelcome in distressing ideas thoughts images ore impulses that repeatedly enter your mind they may seem to occur against your will they may be repugnant to you you may recognize them as senseless and they may not fit your personality then there are compulsions quote compulsions on the other hand are behaviors are acts that you feel driven to perform although you may recognize them as senseless or excessive at times you may try to resist doing them but this may prove difficult you may experience anxiety that does not diminish until the behavior is completed and as i mention before in many cases immediately after the behavior is completed the anxiety does not just return it indeed can strengthen now there are tremendous number of questions on the box just going to highlight a few of the general categories typically the person will fill out a checklist they will designate whether not currently or in the past they have for instance aggressive obsessions fear that one might harm themselves fear that one might harm others fear that they will steel things ear that they will act on unwanted impulses currently r in the past or both it is one category the other one are contamination obsessions concern with dirt or germs bothered by sticky substances or residues et camera et camera e bunch of different categories that include for insane sexual obsessions what are called saving obsessions even moral obsessions right excess concern with write or wrong or morality concerned with sacrilege an blasphemy obsession would need for symmetry and exactness again all these questions being answered as either present in the past ere not present the past present currently or not present currently and then the the test generally transitions over to questions about target symptoms the really brigand get people's identify if they have obsessions what are their exact obsessions now this turns out to be really important because as we talk about some of the therapies that really work it'll just give away a little bit of why they work best in certain cases and why they do not work as well in other cases it turns out that it becomes very important for the cognition and the nation to not just identify the obsessions in the compulsions generally in acting of a generic or top contour way but to really en courage or even forced the patient to define very precisely what the biggest most catastrophic fear is what the session really relates to that turns out o be very important in destructing this corticostrito thalamic loop and getting relief from symptoms one way or the other the yalbrown obsessive compulsive gall this box again is very extensive it goes on for dozens of pages actually and has all these different categories not much designed to just pin point what people obsess about or what they feel compelled to do but to also try and identify what is the fear that is driving all this might in the way that we have set this up thus far we have been talking about of sessions and compulsions as and of existing in a vacuum you've obsessed about germs and your compelled to wash you hands obsessed about germs compel to wash our hands or obsessed about symmetry compelled to put right angles on everything or obsessed about counting and therefore counting et camera but beneath that is a connive component that is not at all apparent from some one describing their obsession and from some one describing or displaying their compulsion the deeper layer to all that is what is the fear exactly if one work to not perform the compulsion meaning what is the fear that is driving the obsession that brings us to a very powerful category of treatments that i should say does not work in everybody with o see but works in many people with o see and really speaks to the underlying neural circuitry that generates see and how to interrupt it and that is the treatment of cognitive behavior a therapy and in particular exposure based cognac of behavior a therapy ergo told about cognac behavioraltherape an exposure therapy now but right at the outset i want to distinguish the kinds of cognac behavioral therapean exposure therapies that are done for obsessive compulsive disorder the sorts of cognac behavoraltherapies that are done for other types of mental challenges in disorders because cognac behavioral therapy for o c d really has everything to do with identifying the utmost fear in some sense we can think of fears as kind of along a hierarchy right in the example earlier of somebody being afraid to turn light in therefore feeling compelled to turn right youwould want to take that person and really understand what do they fear most about turning left now they might not be aware of it they might not be conscious to what that really is but if you were to probe them in a clinical setting you would eventually get to an answer that answer could be at first i do not know just it is just bad i i do not know why it is bad it makes no sense but i its just bad i do not want to go left i do not know why i do not know why but if you were to push that person a little bit in a respectful and kind in carrying way aim that their treatment if you were to push them as they will what you mean my bad if you turn left do you think of the world would end they might to know the world's not in at end but you some one is going to die suddenly i know that sounds crazy but somebody is going to die suddenly at almost this almost sounds superstition about superstitions later but indeed it is somewhat superstitious for instance you would say whose gan die and they would say i do not know and you say no really whose can die if you think about this are you going to die is and going to die and very often very often what you find is that people will start to reveal the underlying obsession at a level of detail that both to the cognition and to them can be somewhat astonishing even though they've been living with that detail in their mind for a very long time now how could somebody stare to reveal detail about something that is existed in their mind for a very long time but not known about it right not been aware of it now some of you might think oh it is repressed or something that is not at all what is happening if you think about the architecture of o c d typically people will have an obsession and then they will engage in the compulsion as quickly as they can to relieve that obsession in many ways the disease itself prevents people from ever getting to the bottom of that trough ever getting to the point where they really clearly articulate to themselves exactly what it is that they fear but it become essential to articulate exactly what it is that they fear for a somewhat counter into it if reason you might think oh the moment they realize exactly what they fear everything lists the circuit turns off and they just feel better because they realized it i wish i could ell you that is the case but it turns out it is the opposite what the cognition is actually trying to do is g t people to feel more anxiety not less what they are trying to get them to do is to short circuit no on intended to intervene in their own neral circuit i should say with that relief of anxiety however brief brought on by engaging in the compulsion related to the obsession whereas typically some one would feel the obsession with o i do not want to turn left to something bad can happen some ones can to die and then they turn right they never get the option er the opportunity to really explore what would happen were they to turn left or to not be able to turn right by forcing them down the path of inquiry that leads them to the place where they very clearly identify the fear the anxiety it raises the anxiety in them and that is actually what the cognition is after cognac behavioraltherapy and exposure therapy in the contact of used most often involves trying to get people to tolerate not relieve their anxiety this is extremely important and i realize there's variation to this depending on the style of cognac behavior therapy the style of exposure there but almost across the word the goal again is to get people to feel the anxiety that normally they are able to at least partly relieve however briefly by engaging in the compulsion if we think back to that circuit of corticostrital thalamic what is going on here where is so t intervening what part of the circuit is getting interrupted lie as you recall the vortexes involved in conscious perception the thalamus and that thalamic particular nucleus are involved in the passage of certain types of experience up to our conscious perception not others and the stratum is involved in this go no go type behavior when of d is really expressing itself in its fullness people feel an anxiety around a particular thought and they either have a go for instance wash hands or a no go do not turn left type reaction by having people progressively in a cold of anarchical way reveal their precise source of anxiety their utmost fear in this context what happens is they feel enormous amounts of autonomic arousal now in the context of anxiety treatment or other types of treatments the goa would be to teach people to dampen to lessen their anxiety through breathing techniques or through visualization techniques or through self talk or through social support any in the number of things that well known to help people self regulate their own anxiety here it is the opposite but they are trying to get the patient to do is to really feel the anxiety at its maximum but then do the exact opposite of whatever the normal compulsion is if normally the compulsion is to wash one's hands than the idea is to suppress hand basion while being in the experience of the utmost anxiety or in the case of not turning left the person is expected to or would hopefully be able to actually turn left and as you can imagine that would evoke tremendous anxiety and yet to tolerate that anxiety now one o be very clear this is not the sort of thing you want to do wan your own this is not the sort of thing you want to do for a friend this is done by trained license psychologist and psychiatric but none the less it really points to the fact that as a anxiety related disorder old is distinct from other types of anxiety and anxiety related disorders things it it and panic disorder et camera because the goal again is to bring the person right up close to the thing that they fear the most and then to interrupt the circuit and now you should be able to now just intuitively becauseyou understand the mechanisms that the circuit your trine to disrupt is the pattern of information flow from the thinking part of the brain the perception part of the brain which is the the quarter to the stratum right the stratum has these neurons which are active that essentially are now it sounds slob it a discussion about free will but their thing to get some the person to generate a certain behavior suppress a certain behavior and as anxiety ramps up it sort of a hydraulic pressure to do that very thing that they have done for long an they suffer from much we talk about hydraulic pressure in the contact of aggression in the aggression episode this is very similar right there is a can of a now when i say hydraulic pressure its not actual hydraulic pressure it is the confluence of a lot of different systems its nor chemicals will soon learn its hormonal it is electrical its it is a lot of different things operating in parallels we cannot point to one chemical or transmitter what is happening is the person is feeling compelled to act act act to relieve the anxiety and through a progressive type of exposure ow you do not throw people in the deep end in this kind of there be red off the bat you gradually chat them toward or move them toward the discussion of exactly what they fear the most and then eventually move them toward the interruption of the compulsion as their feeling this extremely elevated anxiety of course within the content of a supportive clinical setting but in doing that what you are teaching people is that the anxiety can exist without the need to engage in the compulsion now some of this might sound to people this is a lot of kind of fancy psychological negro science speak around on the is kind of intuitive but i think for most people this is not intuitive and for people with o d the there is no really other way to put it the impulse the the compulsion to avoid anxiety is such a powerful driving force that it should now make sense to you as to why being able to tolerate anxiety and really sit with it and do the exact opposite of what you are normally compelled to do is going to be the path treatment and indeed c b t has been shown to be enormously effective again for a large number of people with of d but not all of them and oftentimes it requires that also be used in concert with certain drug treatments which were going to talk about in a moment nexcellets talk about some of the really unique features of cognac behavior el therapy an exposure therapy in the context of used that you often do not see in the use of c b t that is cognac behavioral therapy for other types of psychiatric challenges in disorders the first element is one of staircasing and i already mention this before but this gradual and progressive increase in the anxiety that you are trying to evoke from the patient from the person suffering from used that is done in the context of the office or the laboratory again by a trained in license cognition but then the person leaves right they leave the office they leave the the laboratory an a very vital component of s b t an exposure therapy for people those is that they have and perform what is called homework is literally what they call this might be seen in other sorts of treatments but for used homework is extremely important because within the contexts of a laboratory experiment of the clinic patients often feel much support that they can tolerate those heighten levels of anxiety and interrupt their compulsions whereas when they get home often times the familiarity of the environment brings them to a place where all a sudden those obsessions and compulsions start interacting the same way n that a very hard time suppressing the behaviors why would that be well in nurse science we have a phrase it is called condition place preference and condition place avoidance there some other phrases too but basil at all has to do with a simple thing which is when you feel something repeatedly in a given environment sometimes even once within a given environment you tend to feel that same thing again when you return to that or similar environments case condition place blank er condition place that is simply fancy nerd speak fore the fact that when you are no place in something good happens you tend to feel good if you re turn to that place or a place it or if something bad happens in the given place you tend to feel bad when you return to that place or a place it i think that most sailing a example that leaps to mine is in in fortune the category of bad but i had some friends a years ago a visit san francisco there is been a on going it seems shebeen happening forever but this is really in the last decade of of daytime break ins and nighttime break ins into cars to steel anything from computers to what seems to e a box of tissues and there numerous reasons for this i soft want to get into it is not the topic of to day's podcast but i will use is the opportune o say if you are vising anywhere in the a area do not leave anything in your car because the window well get broken into sometimes in broad daylight some good friends of mine were visiting the bay area and i tested them and said a ay by the way when youreheaded to dinner guides make sure you bring in all our luggage and computers however convey inconvenient that might be they wrote back too late everything got stolen sons some years ago now i think five six years ago this happened sadly all everything got stolen most of it could be replace but some of it was very sentimental to them every time we t every time we consider having a meeting in a particular it this comes up as i do natant i don't to be there i do not that city any more et camera and of course rhymers is we some wonderful redeeming features but it only takes one bad insane in one location to color the whole o picture dark to speak the brain works that way the brain generalizes it it is not a very specific organ again its a prediction machine an auditioned other things in the case of see tee therapy the reason there is home work is that when people go home oftentimes that is when they relapse if you want to call it that back into their obsessions and compulsions and that location that condition place is where it becomes most important to challenge the anxiety and to deal with the anxiety did not try and suppress the anxiety through compulsions or other means and when i say other means i want a highlight something who come up again lo it later in the podcast that substance abuse is very common in people with used because of the anxiety component and also because of people's feelings that they just cannot escape from the thoughts or behavioral patterns that are characteristic of used alcohol abuse or cannabis o use or other forms of narcotics abuse a very common in used later will talk about whether not cannabis's can or cannot help with used but needless to say suppressing anxiety is exactly the wrong direction that one should take if the goal is to ultimately relieve or eliminate the used we now have two characteristics of see t exposure therapy that are extremely important morosely and somewhat unique to to the treatment of used and that is the staircasing up towards the really bad fear the really severe and specific articulation and understanding and feeling of how bad things really would be if someone engaged in a particular behavior or avoided of particular behavior then there is the component of homework given by the cognition for the person to be able to create a broader set of contacts in which they can deal with the anxiety not engage in the compulsions and then a very unique feature of treatment of used that you do not see in many other psychiatric disorders our home visits i find this fascinating i think that the feel of psychiatry and psychology traditionally does not allow for or invite home visits but this component of context location an contacts being vital to the treatment and relief of used has inspired many psychiatric and psychologists to get permission to do home visits where they actually go visit their patients in their native setting in their home cages right there not mice but in their home home cages righted being facetious here but people mice living cages at least in the laboratory and a humans generally than houses or elsewhere they visit them in their home in order to see how they are interacting and the particular locations that evoke the most anxiety in the least anxieties some of the and one to call them crushes but some of the tools the t that people are using to confront and deal with the obsessions and compulsions and in particular to try and identify some of the tools and tricks that people are using to try and avoid that heightened anxiety because once again and i know ism repeating myself but i think this is just vital and unique about seed in the treatment of used the critical need for the patient to be able to tolerate extremely elevated levels of anxiety is crucial if people are avoiding certain rooms in the house or if people are voting certain foods are certain locations in the fiction the cognition can start to identify that by mere observation and i should mention here that patients are not always aware of how they are interacting with their home environment some of these patterns are deeply engrained in people that they do not even realize that their constantly turning to the laughter they do not even realize that they're only washing their hands on one she of the sank and the cognition by visiting the home can start to interrogate a bit in a polite way in a friendly in a supportive way as to do you ever think about why you always flip the posit to the laughter flip the fossil to the right et camera now we all do a lot of things that are habitual we all do things that are somewhat regular from day to day in fact i would invite you to ask yourself do you always put your toothbrush in the same location do you always cap the toothbrush before after use it what sorts of things you wipe the the we threading on the toothpaste or not ism somebody i a confess it o i have will i have about thirty five hundred that peeves but one my pet thieves its toothpaste kind of on the thread of the the toothpaste it really bothers me i do not know why almost as much as try to wipe it off bothers me which creates a certain challenge and if i talk about this any further then i think i would qualify for obsessive compulsive personality disorder but i have to say i do not experience a ton of anxiety about it it does not govern my life in fact i realize that right now there are toes of toothpaste that have toothpastes along the thread everywhere in the world and does not really bother me i can still sit here and a provide some information about one d to u it is not intrusive at least not to my awareness by the home visit the therapist can really start to explore through direct questioning and can allow the patient to explore through direct questioning of themselves the things that might be conscious of and the things that they might not be conscious of that would qualify for used i to just briefly summarize the key elements of cognac behavioral therapean exposure therapy and how they can be combined with drug treatments that are very effective munch of what i am going to talk about next relates to the data and indeed the practise of an incredible research scientist and cognition this is been flair him sin the i should s a doctor heller blazer siphon because she is indeed an empty medical doctor an oh to research scientists at colombia university school of medicine and one of the world's form most experts if not the expert would put her in a category of may be just one the three people who is most knowledgeable about the mechanisms of o s d is actively researching o s d in humans trying to find new treatments train unveil new mechanisms and expand on our current understanding and who also treats o s d quite actively in her own clinic doctor siphon gave a beautiful presentation which she summarize some of the door elements of c b t and exposure therapy for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorders she describes that the key procedures are exposures of course done in person and with the actual thing that evokes the obsessions and compulsions this could be the sweaty towel as described earlier or could be any number of different triggers done with the patient in real time in vive as we say and it could also be things that are imaginal sitting somebody down in a chair an an office an saying oka i wants you to imagine the thing that triggers the intrusive thought or the just focus on the intrusive thought as it arises and than to explore and exposed the patient to their obsessions and compulsions that way can be real or can be imaginal and the goal of course then is to gradually and progressively increase the level of anxiety but than to intervene and called ritual prevention to prevent the person from engaging in the compulsion the goals again on paraphrasing here are to a she states disconfirm fears and challenge the beliefs about the obsessions and compulsions tot intervene in the thoughts and the behaviors and to break the habit of ritualizing and avoiding now how is this typically done what it what are the nuts and bolts of this procedure typically this is done through two planning sessions with the patient describing to the patient what will happen and when it will happen and how long it will happen that are not just thrown into this out of the blue and then fifteen exposure sessions done twice a week or more the one thing to really understand about cognac behavioral therapy is that it can take some period of times several or more weeks as many as ten or twelve weeks however as you will soon learn many of the drug treatments that are effective in treating used either along or in commination with behavior therapies also can take eight ten twelve weeks or longer and many of those never work at all even though ten to twelve week seems a long period of time issue pretty standard if you to see more complete description of the protocols for cognac behavioral therapy and exposure therapy for of d it'll provide links to two papers cost and to f o a which is published in nineteen ninety seven which might seem a long time ago but none the less that the protocols are still very useful and then the second paper is by that last their to at all in twenty twelve will provide links to both of those in addition doctor flair siphon and others have explored what are the best treatments for patients with of d by comparing to of behavioroltherapy alone placebo essential no intervention we something that takes an equivalent amount of time but is not thought to be effective in treatment as well as selective ceratonan rep taken hitters what is an cesar an ecessori is a drug that prevents the retake of ceratonan at the snaps what a synapses the the lit spaces between neurons were neurons communicate with one another by vomiting little bits of chemical into the space the snaps and then those chemicals either evoke or suppress the electricalectivity of the nexneron across the snaps and this case the nortransmitter the chemical that were referring to i serotonin s s or is selective craton retaken visitors prevent the retake of the chemical that is left thiscase the eratonan that is left in the snaps after that i call it vomiting to be dramatic but it is not ashy avoiding the extrusion of the chemical into the snaps and as a consequence there is more ceratonan around to have more of an effect over time theneteffect being more ceratornurgic transmission more ceratonan over all not more ceratonan being made more ceratonan being of available for use that is what anecessorideas they compared cognac behaviorotherapy esessorise they also the placebo group and the had count behavioraltherapy plus the selective ceratonan retaken visitor this was a twelve weeks study done as described before r two times a week over the course of twelve weeks first of all the most important thing of course placebo did nothing it did not relieve the used to any significant degree right how did they know that they gave them the box test that we talked about before the wit the male brown test with all those questions of which i read a few the ocean severity that one has to have on the box is measured in terms of an index that goes any here from eight all the way up to twenty eight that should not mean anythings of that number eight as kind of meaningless merits and terms of an indexthetony only meaning for the box but if somebody has a threshold of sixteen or higher it means that they still having somewhat debilitating symptoms are very debilitating symptoms placebo did not reduce the obsessions or compulsions to any significant degree however and i think quite excitingly count behavioraltherapy had a dramatic effect in reducing the obsessions and compulsions such that by four weeks that score that in this case range from eight to twenty eight dropped all the way from twenty five down to about eleven is a huge drop in the severity of the symptoms now what is really interesting is that when you look at the effects of essessorive in the treatment of used symptoms they had a significant effect in reducing the symptoms of one d that showed up first at four weeks and then continued to eight weeks in fact here was a progressive and further reduction in one d symptoms from the four to eight week period again these of the people just taking the assessor and then it sort flattened out o lie bit such by twelve weeks there was still a significant reduction in used symptoms for people taking accessories as compared to placebo but the severity their symptoms was still much greater than those receiving cognac behavior therapy alone at least in this study and i should tell you which study it is this this to libouets at all two thousand five in the america vernal psychiatric will also provided in to this can peruse the data if you but least in this study cognac behavior therapy was the most effective selective sacaton retaken hitters less effective what happens when you combined them while they explore that is well and the commination of cognac behavorotherapy and the accessories together did not lead to any further decrease in used symptoms this point to the idea that cognac behavior therapy is the most effective treatment and gain when i say cognac behavior therapy now i am still referring to cognac behavioral slash exposure therapy done in the way that i detail before twice a week for twelve weeks or more all of the date at least in this study point to the fact that cognac behaviorotherapy is really effective and the most effective does it alleviate used symptoms for everybody no is it very time consuming yes twice a week for o two sessions or more of fifteen minutes sometimes in the office plus there homework plus the can in an ideal case there also home visits from the psychiatrist or psychologist that a lot of investment a lot of time investment to say nothing of the potential financial investment now doctor flair symptom has given some beautiful talks where she describes these data and also emphasize is the fact that despite the demonstrated power of cognac behavioraltherapy for the treatment of used most people are given drug treatment simply because of the availability of those trug treatments now when i say most people want to emphasized that i referring to most people who actually go seek treatment cause a really important thing to realize is that most people to o s d do not actually go seek evident space treatment on a repeat that most people oft o we d do not seek evident base treatment which is a tragic thing one of the motivations for doing this podcast episode is to try an encourage people who think they may have persistent obsessions and compulsions to seek treatment but most people do not for variety of reasons we spelled out earlier shame et camera of those that do the first line of attack is typically a prescription most often an accessary although not always just as arise because show will talk about o the somewhat common use of also prescribing a lo dose of a neraleptic or an antipsychotic not always but often the importanthings under stand here is that excellent researchers doctor symptom understand that while there are treatments that we could say are best ora are ideal based on the data that does not necessarily mean that what is being deployed most often in the general public as a consequence doctor siphon another have explored in a very practical way whether not it matters if somebody is getting assessor treatment and is experiencing that reduction in used symptoms that as you may recall is more than what they would experience with placebo alone but not as dramatic of reduction in used symptoms as they would get with cognac behavioral therapy and as i mention before the was this exploration of combining drug treatment cognac behavioraltherapy from the outset but they also quite impressively explored what happens when people who are already taking assessors initiate cognac behavioraltherapy this is a really wonderful thing that they have done this because in doing that first of all their acknowledging that there are many people out the who have sought treatment and are getting some relief from those essonite but it perhaps is not as much relief as they could get and they are actively acknowledging that many people are getting these drug treatments first in fact most often people gain these drugtreatments first what happens when you add in cogon behavioraltherapy while the god news is when you add cognac behavior therapy to some one whose already taking accessories that further improves their symptoms now that is different then the results that i describe before from the same laboratory in fact that if you combine cognac behavior therapy with essessorised from the outset there is no additional benefit of assessor however as i just described if some one is already taking an accessory and their experiencing a reduction in their used symptoms by adding in cognac behavioraltherapy there is a further reduction in the symptoms of used this very important for those of you that have sought treatment in your taking a assess or if you are thinking about treatment and your prescribed in assessor the idealsonara really would be the combine the drug treatment with count behavoraltherapy or in some cases may be cogon behavioraltherapy alone although that is a decision that you really have to make with the close advice and overset of of a license o physician because of course the a prescription drugs and any time your going to add or remove a prescription drug or change dose at you really want to do that in close discussion with and on the advice of your physician old to say that to protect me i say that t o protect you and was just the right thing to do again cognac behavioral therapy is extremely powerful drug treatments seem less powerful though if your already on a drug treatment adding con behavioraltherapy can really help give been talking about esessorises on described a like bit about how they work at a cold of superficial level of keeping more serotonin in the snap that more sheratonan can be in action as opposed to gobbled back up by those neurons i should just mention what some of the selector seratonand rep tic inhibitors are things am clomiproming am which is not entirely selective i should say that that one generally falls into a category of less selective it can in pair or i or can enhance some of the other our transmitter nor modulator systems epinephrin et camera the selective ceratonan rep taken hitters or least the classic ones are fluoxitine prosaic floveoximine floveox paroxitine sertreline cetalopram et camera et camera they're about six or classic escessorise some of them cetalopram are used in children and are available pediatric doses some prosaic mayor may not be used in children the details of which eseserise on et camera is a very extensive literature and discussion an i think its safe to say that which drugs to use and at which dosage in whether not to contain continues use me the same dosage over time depends a lot on the individual variation that people express and the responses that they have all of these drugs in fact i think we can say all drugs have side effects the question is how detrimental though side effects are to daily life the ecesserise are well known to have effects on appetite in some cases they abolish appetite in some cases they just reduce a little but in some cases they increase appetite leas highly individual they can have effects on libido for instance they can reduce sex drive depend in sometimes in the dose dependent way sometimes in a way that is more a step function where people are fine at say five or ten milligrams but then they get to fifteen telegrams and there is a cliff a for their libido an that can happen it really depends a please do not take those dosages as exact values cases is going to depend on what they are being used for depression or anxiety or olid and it is also been depend on the drug et camera just throughout those numbers as a way to on illustrate what a kind of a step function would look it is not gradual its immediate at a given dose is what that means the other thing is that some of these drugs will have transient effects sideeffects that show up and then disappear or sadly people will sometimes take these drugs for while ten side effects will surface later that were not their a previously depending on life factors nutrition factor its a very complicated landscape over all and that is whites really important to explore any kind of drug treatment ecessori or otherwise really in close communication with the psychiatrist who really understands the farm o fanatics and has a lot of patient history and experience with them what i am about to tell younexts is most certainly on to come as a big surprise which is that despite the fact that the selective ceretonean retake in visitors can be effective in reducing the symptoms of side at least somewhat and certainly more than placebo there is very little if any evidence that the ceretonean system is disrupted in side and i have to point out that this is a somewhat consistent theme in the field of psychiatry that is a given drug can be very effective or even partially effective in reducing symptoms or in changing the overall landscape of a psych trip disorder or illness and yet there is very little if any evidence that that particular system is what is causal for o c d or anxiety or depression et camera this is just the landscape that were living in in terms of our understanding of the brain and psychiatry in the ways of treating brain disorders as a consequence there a huge number of academic reviews that clinicians in research scientists have generated and read and there one of the for i think a thorough ones in recent years was publishing twenty twenty one it'll provide a link to this this is by an excellent truly excellent researcher from yell university school of medicine i shows at notches a researcher be the clinician scientists again and my p h d this is o christopher painter and the city of the review is farmer go the karmic therapeutic strategies and new targets in o c d and again it will pride provide link to it has this is a just gorgeous review describing as i just told you that the ceratonan system is not really disrupted in o c d and yet escessorise can be very effective the review goes on to to explore even what sorts of receptors for ceratonan might be involved if its in fact the case that ceratonan is a a culprit in the creation of of d symptoms a talk about the rattan to receptor and the creatine one a resented thymi mentioning all that detail if in fact it is not clear season is involved because it'll just tell you right now there is currently a lot of interest in whether or not some of these psychedelics in particular scyliciben can be effective in the treatment of o c d syliciben has been shown in various clinical trials in particulate clinical trials done at john's hoping school of medicine by matter johns and others matter as on the human labpodcas he is been on the tenpharispodcas he is been on the let's freedman podcast the world class researcher on the use of psychedelics for depression and other psychiatric challenges and there salicin treatment has been seen at least in those trials to be very effective in the treatment of certain kinds of major depression currently the exploration of cyliciben for the treatment of o c d has not yielded similar results though the studies are on going again has not yielded similar effectiveness but the studies are on going and the ceratonan to receptor and the craton one a receptors are primary targets for the drug syliciven i figure there were on o be some questions about whether not psychedelic's help with o c d a thus far its in conclusive if any of you have been part of clinical trials or have knowledge or intuition about this a relationship or potential relationship i should say between sylicivon or the psychedelic and o c d please put them in the comment section we love to love to hear a from you a one thing i shall point you is that even though craton has not been directly implicated in o c d ceratonan and the general systems of craton and the circuits in the brain that caryceratonan and depend on it have been shown to impact cod native flexibility and inflexibility which are kind of hole mark themes of used in animals that have their ceratonan depleted or inhuman that have very low levels of ceratonan you can see evidence of connive inflexibility challenges in tasks which in challenges in switching the rules by which one performs a game challenges in any kind of or cognitive domain switching and that does indirectly implicate a sratonan in some of the aspects of used again when one starts to explore the different transmitter systems that have been explored in animal models and inhuman it is a vast vast landscape but seratonergic drugs do seem to be the most effective drugs in treating used despite the fact against despite the fact that there is no direct evidence that their atonal systems or the problem in used if you recall the portico stride thalamic loop that is central to the ideology the presents and the the patterns of symptoms in see of course ceratonan is impacting that system seratonas impacting just about every system in the brain but there is no evidence that tinkering with ceratonan level specifically in that net work is what is leading to the improvements in used however if people go in to ephemera scanner and those people have used and they evoke the obsessions and compulsions you see activity in that portico stridothylamic loop treatments essessorise that reduce the symptoms of used equate to situation where there is less activity in that loop and i should point out connive behavioraltherapy which we have no reason to believe only taps into the serotonin system right think it would be extreme strata would be false actually to say that the cognac behavior a therapy taps only into the serotonin system clearly system of fact a huge number of circuits and nor chemical systems well people do cognac behavioraltherapy and find some relief food they also show reductions in those portico stridalthylamic loops basically we have a situation where we have a behavioraltherapy that works in many people not all and we have a pretty good understanding of about wait works it increases angle to tolerance and interference with pattern execution getting people to not engage in the same sorts of behaviors that are detrimental to them and we have drug treatments that work at least to some degree but we do not know how they work or where they work in the brain one of the things that really unifies the behavioral treatments and the drug treatments is that they take some period of time some relief from symptom seems to show up around four weeks and certainly by eight weeks for both cognac behavior therapy and the essessorise but it is really at the ten to twelve week stage when some one's been doing these twice a week count behavioral sections they been taking a assessor for ten to twelve weeks that the really significant reduction in used symptoms starts to really show up now pun till now have been talking about the fact that people are getting relief from these treatments but sadly in the case of owed there is a significant population that simply does not respond to c b t or to accessorize or to their commination which is why cychitris also explore the commination of accessorize and neurileptics or drugs that tap in to the called dopamine system or the glutamate system these are other neurotransmitters in nuromodulators that impactiferan circuits in the brain and just to really remind you what hero transmitters an neromodulators do because the is important to contextualize all this nor transmitters are typically involved in the rapid communication between neurons and the two most commonarotransmitters for that are the our transmitter ultimate which we say as excusatory meaning when its released into the snaps it causes the next neon to be more active or active and gala which is a neurotransmitter that is inhibitory meaning when its released into the snaps typically not always but typically that gala is going to encourage the next neuron to be less electrically active even silence its activity the negro modulators by contrasts o honor transmitters but nuromodulators dopamine ceratonan epinephrin an a retooling and others operate a little bit differently they intend to act admit more broadly they can act within the snaps but they can also change the general patterns of activity in the brain making certain circuits more likely to be active an other circuits less likely to be active when we say dopamine does acts or dooming does why a certonan does exercerton noes why they do not really do one thing they change the sort of overall tonality they make it more likely or less likely that certain circuits will be active run think of them as kind of activating playlets or senoras of activity in the brain a rather then on being involved in the specific communication are specific songs if you will in the analogy or discussions between particular neurons when we hear that accessorize increase ceratonan and reduce systymptems of of d or a neuroleptic reduces the amount of dopamine and makes people feel calmer for instance or can remove some on stereotype receive mot motor behavior which they can either generate or reduce motor behavior it turns out when i say that what am referring to is the fact that these neuromodulators are of turning up the volume on certain circuits and turning down the volume on other circuits i say that because if you are going to explore drug treatments again with ta license physician if you are going to explore drug treatments for of d and in particular if you are not getting results from esessories or you are not getting results from cognac behavioral therapy or the cidifect profiles of the drugs that your taking for d are causing problems that you do not want to take them well then it is important understand that any time you take one of these drugs there not acting specifically on the portico strata thalamic circuit that will be wonderful that is the future of psychiatry but as now when you take a drug it systemically it is impacting caratoninyour got its also i packing creatine an another of the brain hence the effects on things digestion or libido or any number of differentials that caratonan is involved in likewise if you take a neraleptic how a paradox or something that reduces dopamine transmission well then it is on to have some motor effects was demean is involved in the generation of motor sequences and smooth limb movement as i people with parkensens who do not have much opening will get a resting tremor have a wartime entering smooth movement and the the side effectstare to make sense given the huge number of defend neral circuits that these different nor modulators are involved in i do not say that to be discouraging i say that to encourage patience and careful systematic exploration of different drug treatments for one d always again with the careful and close guidance and overbite of a psychiatric because cyachatris really understand which side effect profiles make it likely that you can or cannot or will never or maybe some day will be able to take a given drug at a given dose they are the ones that really have that knowledge this is not the sort of thing that you want a cowboy and go trine figure out yourself now i also want to acknowledge that there are other forms of drug treatments we touched on silicivean briefly but therefore other forms of drug treatments that have been explored for of d earlier we talk to lobed about anabas why would anabas be a place of exploration at all well first of all a number of people thine help medicate for one d there is some clinical evidence i am not time out recreational seen my about clinical evidence that anabas can reduce anxiety earlier were talking about not reducing anxiety but learning anxiety tolerance in order to deal with and treat one d in the contact of cognac behavioral therapies that does not as barely rule out anabas as a candidate for the treatment of once d an in fact this has been explored a study from doctor blarsimpson herself looked at this this was a fairly small scale study forsook all gouge be the title and again will provide a link this is entitled a cute effects of canabonoids on symptoms of obsessed compulsive disorder human laboratory study very briefly this was fourteen adults with of d they had prior experience with anabas this was randomize placebo control the anabas was smoked am they ad different varietals as they are called they had a placebo this is basically a a a condition in which certain subjects am consumed a cigarette that had zero percent t h c others had seven per cent t h c other group studies or some had point four per cent c b d and t h c they looked at c b d i no lot of people out their interested in c b d is one of the few studies i could find where a they explored different per centares of t h c and c b d in these i cannabis or marijuana cigarettes basically a the total amount t that they consumed i believe was eight hundred milligrams these again are not suggestions a is us us simply reporting whats in the study you can ganof provide a link am they looked at one d symptoms ratings they looked at cardiovascular effects they had large number of differenthings that they explored and i should say this study was done in twenty twenty and it was the first placebo controlled investigation of cannabis's and adults with obsessive compulsive disorder pretty interesting and ism just reading from their conclusions here the dates suggest that smote canabusts whether containing primarily t h c or cab d member they look ta different concentrations of those has little acute impact meaning immediate impact on one d symptoms and yield smaller reductions and anxiety complayered to placebo sat they did not see a when i say a positive effect i mean a a amilertive react an effect in reducing symptoms of used from anabasis or or c b d which om quit is unfortunatething its unfortunate anytime of treatment does not work but none thewless those of the at am sure they are going t be other studies ism sure their also con be people in the to common section saying that anabas and see d helps there am one d symptoms at least i anticipate their probably will almost everything i say here somebody will contradict it with something from their experience which i encourage by the way i want to hear about your experience with certain things even of its not from canalize placebo controlled studies i still find it very interesting to know what people are doing in what their experiencing i think that is one of the better uses of social media common sections is to be able to share some of that not in an advice giving way or prescriptive way but simply is away to share in encourage different types of exploration there are other sorts of drug treatments that are gaining popularity for one d at least in the research realm one treatment that is a legal a e g a right some has when i say legal sometimes people think i say legal but that is legal at least by prescription in the united states is kednemine the actions of redefine are somewhat complex although we know for instance that redefine acts on the glutamate system it tends to disrupt the transmission or the relationship i should say between glutamate right not gludomin not the amenoasid but glutamate the nauru transmitter and the called n m d a the n method apostate receptor which is a receptor that is very special in the nervous system because when glutamate bonds to the enemy d a receptor it tends to offer the opportunity for that particular snaps to get stronger led negro plasticity and redefine is a essentially an antagonist although it works to re complicated mechanism it tends to block that binding of glutamate to the enemy a receptor or the effectiveness of that redefine therapy is now being used quite extensively for the treatment of drama and for depression at leads to a dissociative state it is a called dissociate anal genic and the variety of ways in which that happens we didn't episode on depression were going to do another entire episode all about kedemin describing the networks that redefine impacts et camera keeping grapes are being explored for used as of now the data look somewhat promising but there is still lot more work that needs to be done my read of the data are that the more extensive clinical trials have not happened yet the smaller studies that have happened reveal that some patients do get some relief from ceresin therapy for used but there is nothing overwhelmingly pointing to the fact that redefine is a magic bullet for used treatment cannabis sad at least now even though it is one smaller study there is no real evidence that it can alleviate used symptoms if there are new studies public soon it'll be sure to update you and if you see those studies please send them to me redefine therapy the jury is still out syllicivean the jury is still out these a early days another treatment that is becoming somewhat commonerlese people are commonly excited about is trains cranial magnetic stimulation this is the use of a magnetic coil this is completely non invasive placed on one portion of the skull and one can direct magnetic energy toward particular areas the brain to either suppress or nowadays you can also activate particular brain regions there are some interesting data showing that if t as is applied to areas of the brain involved in the generation of motor action the called motor areas are supplementary motor areas as they are called while people think about or have intrusive thoughts we know that the t names coil can interrupt the motor behaviors the compulsive behaviors and at least in a small chord of studies an a small number of patients within those studies this has been shown to be effective not just while the coil is on the heat of course but act after the study has been performed to the treatments been performed in reducing used symptoms by disrupting the tendency for the compulsive behavior to be automatic one of the key features of obsession compulsive disorder is that espesioly of it is been around for a while the person's been dealing with it for a while there is not a pattern in which the person thinks ah i have this contamination fear or i need symmetry or i am kind of obsess to count to the number seven and then they pause and they and then they do it no typically there is a very close a parring of the obsession an the compulsion in time that somebody is walking down the street thing in one to the ropes seven one o teas is in aseveneete do then there doing this in such rapid succession because the obsessions are coming up quickly right thoughts can be generate very quickly and then they're entering the compulsions of the way to beat down or to try and suppress that anxiety and then it comes right back up again at even stronger as i described earlier transcranual magnetic stimulation seems to intervene in these various fast processes right now i do not think it is fair to say that t mas is a magic bullet either i think there is lot of ex cement about mas and in particular really want of nail this point home in particular there is excitement about the commination of mamas with drug treatments or the commination of tums with connive behavioral therapy and this is a really important point not just forsake of discussion about obsessive compulsive disorder but also depression a adit a skis a frena any number of different psychic psychiatric challenges an disorders in most cases are going to respond best to a commination of behavioral treatment that is on going that occurs in the laboratoryand clinical setting but also in the somersetting where there is homework make an home visits drug treatments often not always are a terrific augment to those cognac behavioral therapies or other behavioral therapies and then now we are living in the age of brain machine interface you have companies i curl length that i think it is fair to say ore going to enter the brain machine interface world first throve the treatment of certain centrums rite movements drums or psychiatric systems probably before they start putting electrodes into the brain to stimulate enhanced memory or enhance cognition who knows i do not know exactly whit they're doing behind the walls of curl long but i have to imagine in fact i would wager may be not both arms but it'll wage r my left arm that the first set of ate approved technologies to come out of companies neural length are going to be those for the treatment of things parkinsons and movement disorders and cognac disorders rather than shall we say find of recreational a connive in henchmen or things of that sort trenscania magnetic stimulation is non invades of it does not involve going down below the skull can have some effect but most laboratories that ism aware of it stampford and elsewhere are combat are exploring mamas for things of d and other types of psychiatric challenges are using mamas in commination with drug therapies are using in some cases for instance a laboratory at stamford hope to get upon the podcast a psychiatric and willies is exploring mamas and commination with psychedelic therapies not necerlyc the same time but none the less combining them are exploring how they impact brain circuitry if you havoc should you run out and get tamasha should you try examine therapy of course with the license physician i think it is too early a to say yes i think the the answer is we need to wait and see i think cognac behavioral therapy the escessorise and some other drug treatments her electrics combine with accessorize and count behavioral therapy are where the real bulk of the data are i want to make one additional point about cannabis c b d as it relates to obsessive compulsive disorder to me it is not at all surprising that cannabis c b d did not improve symptoms of of d because in my discussion with doctor palconti a few weeks ago much mention doctor county is indeed a medical doctor psychiatric we were talking about cannabis and its various uses because it does have some clinical applications and he mention that one of the main effects of cannabis is to tighten focus and to enhance concentration on and thoughts about one particular thing and in some cases that can be clinically beneficial and another cases that can be clinically detrimental if you accept the idea that cannabis increases focus and you think about used and the networks involved and you think about the anxiety in the relationship between the obsession and compulsion bet then it should not come as any surprise that anabas did not improve the symptoms of used because if anything it would increase focus on the obsessions and the compulsions now that is not what they observe they did not see an exacerbation or a worsening of the symptoms of used with anabas least that is not my read of the data but they did not see an improvement nosed symptoms with cannabis or seed and to me that is not surprising given the cannabis seemed seems to increase focus next id to talk about some of the research on and the rules of hormones in used because turns out to be a very interesting relationship there but before i do i want to point out something that i realize that probably should have said earlier which is one of the key things for some one with used to come to understand if they are going to experience any relief of their symptoms whether not their doing drug treatments or behavior of treatments are otherwise is that thoughts are not as bad as actions right thoughts are not as bad as actions one of the and rules that people with used seem to adopt for themselves is that thoughts are really truly the equivalent of actions they'll have an intrusive thought and even spent too much time on this to day but earlier i touched on the fact that some of the intrusive thoughts that people have in used are really disturbing they can be really gross or t least gross to that person they can evoke imagery that is toxic or infectious or holy sensualized in a way that is disturbing to them can be very taboo this is not uncommon when you start talking to people with used and you start pulling on the thread again this would be a psychatrus who trained asked the right questions and gain the comfort and trust of a patient they stare to reveal that these these thoughts are really intrusive and kind of disturbing which is why they feel compelled to try and suppress them with behaviors one of the powerful elements of treatment for used is to really support the patient and make them realize that thoughts are just thoughts and that everyone has disturbing thoughts and that oftentimes those disturbing thoughts arise at the most inconvenient and sometimes what seems the most inappropriate circumstances and this relates to a whole larger discussion that we could have about what our thoughts and why do they surface and how come when you stand at the edge of a bridge even if you do not want to jump off you think about jumping off and i this has to do with the fact that your nervous system as a prediction machine is oftentimes t eating possibilities and sometimes that testing goes way off into the a nether lands of the thought patterns and emotional patterns that we all have inside of us the big difference between a thought and in action is that of course the nervous system is one case not trains eating those patterns of thinking in to motor sequences that nerdy way of saying thoughts are not actions believe stare not can be helpful for people if they really think about that and uses as an opportunity to realize that first of all they are not crazy they are not thinking and feeling in the stuff because they are bad or evil and of course sometimes this can cross over with other other elements of life were we place moral judgment on people for certain behaviors i thing that part of a healthy society of course at where we have laws and punishments and and rewards for that matter for certain times of behaviors but this idea that thoughts are not as bad as actions and thoughts can be tolerated and the anxiety around thoughts can be tolerated and over time can diminish that is a very powerful hallmark theme of the treatment of used i be remiss if i did mention it thoughts are not actions actions can harm us they can harm other people they can up enormous amounts of time thoughts can soak up enormous amounts of time they can be very troubling they can be very detrimental we of course want to be sensitive to that but when it really comes down to it the first step in treatment for of d is this realization were the approach to the realization that thoughts are not as bad as actions what about hormones in one d will this has been explored it'll be it not as extensively as i would have liked nit to fine but when i went into the literature found a one particularly interesting study entitled nurosteroid levels in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder forgather embay and this always will provide a link to the study the object of this study was to explore drum within blood nurosteroid levels in people with one d why well because of the relationship between used and anxiety and the fact that in stress really disorder such as anxiety in depression the hormones have been extensively explored but not much in one d at least until the study they compared drum levels of a number of different hormones for estrone pregnant alone d a g a a courtesan an testosterone this was done in thirty patients with used and thirty healthy controls it is not a huge study but it is enough to ransom some pretty nice conclusions these subjects were eighteen to forty nine yearsold and the controls were agent sex matched a healthy volunteers again know one d what was the basic take away from the study the basis take away from the study was that in females with of d there was evidence for significantly elevated courtesan n d a g a now that is interesting because courtesan is well known to be associate with the stress system although every day should mention we all male r female everybody experiences an increase in cortical shortly after wakening that s a healthy increase in cortical late shift ad mean late late in the a piss in cortical or shift in that cortical pick to later in the day is a known corselet of depression and anxiety disorders the fact that cortical is elevated in d c e are elevated in a female patient with to s d suggests that the cortical is either reflective of or causal for the increase in anxiety we do not know the direction of that effect now in male patient iththo s d there was evidence for increased cortical again not surprising given the role of anxiety in courtesan pussies a given the role of cortical in anxiety and the increasing anxiety seen in of d but there also significant reductions in testosterone which should also not surprise us because cortical an testosterone more less compete in some fashion for a their own production both are derived from the molecule collateral and there certain bout chemical pathways that can either direct that gestural molecule board cortical synthesis or testosterone synthesis but not both they compete when coral gossip in general not always but in general testosterone goes down and vice verse feu want to learn more about the relationship between cortisol testosterone and their even some tools to try and optimize those ratios in both males and females you find that in our episode optimizing testosterone an estrogen that is a hubermaabdot come now i would say the most interesting aspect of this study is not that d c e and cortical elevate females with to c d r that cortisol testosterone have this opposifat cortical up in testosterone down in males with of d but rather the relationship between all of those d c cortical and testosterone in terms of gala gala again being this inhibitory nor transmitter that tends to quiet certain coronal pathways is does different things it different chaps is but in general the more gala that is present the more in ambition that is present and therefore the more suppression of normal activity and d a c e is known to be a potent antagonist of the gala system here we have elevated d c e in females and i should also mention that testosterone is also known to tap into the gala system typically when testosterone is elevated gala transmission at least is slightly elevated here we have a situation in which the pattern of hormones in females and males with of d are h are different from those in people without of d such that gala transmission is altered and the net effect would be and over all reduction in gala now gala as in inhibitoryanor transmitter and broadly speaking is associated with lower levels of anxiety and intends to create balance within various neral circuits now that is a very broad statement but we know for instance in epilepsy that cabal levels are reduced in therefore you get runaway excitation of certain circuits in the brain and therefore seizures either petit man many seizures or grandma massive seizures or even drops seizures were people completely collapsed to the floor in seize you may have seen this before i certainly have its very dramatic an an ass quite on debilitating for people because obviously they do not know when these seizures are coming on most often an then they they can fall into a stove or while driving et camera the situation with o c d is one in which for whatever reason we do not know the direction of effect certain hormones are elevated in females in certain hormones are elevated in males and those hormones differ between males and females and yet they both funded into a system where gala uric or gala transmission in the brain is reduced because of this ability for those particular hormones to be antagonists to gala d as a consequence there is likely to be overall levels of increased excitation in certain et works in the brain and that brings us back to this portico striadal thalamic loup this repetitive loup that seems to reenforce we can say reinforces obsession leads to anxiety leads to compulsion leads to transient relief of anxiety within increase in anxiety increased obsession anxiety compulsion anxiety compulsion anxiety compulsion and on and forth i have not found studies that have explored adjusting testosterone levels through exaugeonis administration creamer injection are otherwise or that have focus on reducing d c e in females if any one is aware of such studies please put them in the common section on tube or send thetomus we have a contact side on the website a hubermlavda combat the comment section on to would be o best but because we know that hormones impacneromodulators and narrow transmitters as i just described and that those demodulators in hero transmitters play an intimate role in the generation and the treatment of things used it stands to reason that manipulations of those hormone systems however subtle or dramatic might on highlight might prove useful in adjusting the symptoms of used and i hope that this is an area that you researchers are going to pursue in the very near future because many of the treatments for reducing d e or increasing testosterone a reducing cortical have already made it through it e approval their out there o their readily prescribed many of them are already in generic form which means that the patents have already lapsed on the o on the first versions of those drugs when their available generic drugs very often their available at significantly lower cost a there is hole discussion we have thereabout patent laws and and o prescription drugs but because these drugs are largely avail a in prescription yet generic form i think there is a great opportunity to explore how hormones not just sort is all testosterone and d g a but the for a huge category of hormones might impact the symptoms of of d especially since many of the symptoms of old show up right around the time of puberty we haven't talked a lot about childhood old cause we are going to do an entire series on childhood psychiatric disorders and challenges but many children develop old early as young as in three or four believe it or not or even six or seven and ten and inadolescens and certainly around puberty and in young adulthood it is rare although it does happen that people will develop old very lateen life around forty or older just kind of spontaneously most often when you look at their clinical history you find that either they were hiding it or as being suppressed in some way or if it does spontaneously show up late lifelike mid thirties or in ford one's forties typically there is a dramatic brain injury can be due to stroke or a physical injury the head or something of that sort none the less there is a interesting correlation between the onset of puberty in certain forms of of d a certain forms of her i should say this sernaspects of men opus that can relate to of d you can find all these things in the literature all this to say that hormones impactnero transfers in demodulators which clearly impact the kinds of circuits that involved in of d and it makes sense that and i would hope that there would be an exploration of how these hormones impact of d in the not too distant future now there is an extensive literature exploring how testosterone therapy both in males and females can be effective in som cases in the treatment of anxiety related disorders but not at least of my knowledge in of d in particular this whole area of the use of testosterone and estrogen therapy d g e coatis all suppression or maybe even enhancement for the treatment of of d is essentially a big black box that very soon i believe will be lit i realize that a number of listeners of this podcast are probably interested in the non typical or holistic treatments for of d doctor play stepson's lab has at least one study exploring the role of mindfulness meditation for the the treatment of of d there the data are little bit a complicated and i should mention that good things are happening t least in the united states probably elsewhere as well but good things are happening in terms of the exploration of things meditation and other let us call them non traditional or holistic forms of of treatment for psychiatric disorders because of the division of complimentary health that is now been launched by the national institutes of health whereas before people would think about a meditation or yoga draw or even see d supplementation for that matter as can a fringe may be or conowoo or a non traditional at the very least the nationalinstitutes of health in united states has now devoted an entire division entire institute purely for the exploration of things breathing practice meditation at camera there is a cancer institute there is a hearing and defines institute there is a vision institute and now there is this complementary health institute which i think is a wonderful o addition to the more traditional on aspects of medicine i think a no possible useful treatment should be overlooked or researched in my opinion provided that can e done safely and as i mention doctor flair stepson's lab is looked at the role of mindfulness meditation the treatment of one d now we should all keep in mind no unintended that most of the date on mindfulness meditation shows that it increases the ability to focus now this brings us back to a kind of repeating theme to day which is that increase focus may not be the best thing for somebody with one d because it might increase focus on the obsession and or compulsion turns out that mindfulness meditation can be useful in the treatment of of d but mainly by way of how it impacts the focus on and the ability to engage in connive behavior therapies it is very unlikely at least by my read of the data to be a direct effect of meditation on relieving the symptoms rather it seems that meditation is increasing focus on things connive behavior therapy home work and to not focus on other things and therefore indirectly improving the symptoms of used now somewhat surprisingly at least to me there have also been a fairly large number of studies exploring how neutrasuticles as there sometimes called supplements that are available over the counter can impact the treatment of assess one compulsive disorder now there such an extensive number of different compounds and supplements that fall under the category of neutral suitable and that have been explored in the treatment of used that i to point you to a revs that is entitled neutral subtitles in the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder a a review souse me of mechanistic and clinical evidence this was publishing two thousand eleven at over ten years old and by now have to imagine that there are an enormous number of additional substances that could be explorer but there just one or two here that i want a focus on here in this review they describe effects of five h t p and trip defense of things are in the serotonin pathway which would make sense given what we know about the assess rise that people would explore how different supplements that increase sermon uric transmission might impact used what you find is that they do have significant affects an improving or reducing the symptoms of one d in somewhat similar way to some of the accessories but you of course have to be careful anything that is can attain to the given nor chemical system to the same degree may very likely have the same sorts of side effects that a prescription drug would one compound that i to focus on little more depth however because it is exciting and interesting to me is inositol innoitalls a compound that we are going to talk about in several future podcast because well first of all it seems that can have impressive effects on reducing anxiety it also can have pretty impressive facts in improving fertility in particular in women with polysisticovariance antrum and here ism referring specifically to my in nocitall because it comes in several forms and it does ampere that nine hundred milligrams of asocial can improve sleep and can reduce anxiety perhaps when taken at that dos at your hire dosages i will just confess first while i do not have seed although i will also confess that when i was a child i had a transient tick have talked about this own podcast before it was a grunting tick when i was about six or seven i recall a trip to washington you see with my family where i was feeling a strong desire or need even as i recall to grunt in order to clear something in my throat what i did not have anything in my throat it was i didn't have a cold or any post nasal trip it was really just the feeling that i need to do that to release some sort of tension and i remember my dad at the time tell me do not do that do not do that not not good to grunt or something that i think he saw that it was it was conic compulsive behavior and would actually hide in the backed of the rental car and do it or at hide in my room fortunately for me it was transient i think about six months or a year later disappeared although i didn't notice is an excrofhron in point out that when i get very tired and have ben working very long hours sometimes that grunting tick will reappear what does that mean do i have tenets i do not know maybe i was never diagnose which rats to i have one d maybe a i certainly could be accused of having obsessive compulsive personality disorder which will an talk about still in a few minutes but the point here is that many children transiently express ticks or low level treats or one d and again transiently in it disappears over time inositol has been explored in bunch of different contacts including for ticks in nose d et camera a going back to it to asocial and its current use or i should a my current use have been taking nine hundred milligrams of a social as an addition to my existing tool kit for sleep which a talked about many times on this podcast and other podcast consists of magnesium three in a apigenan and feline if you want to know more about that kit you can go to our news letter nor of network newsletter huverma labor come the tool kip for sleep is there you do not even have to sign ut for the news letter but all give you flavor the sorts of things that are in the news letter in any case give been a experimenting a bit a with taking nine hundred milligrams of my asocial either alone or combination with that sleep kit and i must say the sleep have been getting on a social is extremely deep a and does seem to lead to in hance levels of focus and alertness during the day an perhaps your noising that om talking more quickly on this podcast than in previous podcast now ism just kitting i do not think the two things related in conical way the point here is that in social is known to be pretty effective in reducing anxiety but when taken at very hyhdosages can it do the same at dosages we do not know i would consider nine hundred milligrams a loose most of the given the fact that most of the studies of inositol have explored very dosages even tan or twelve grams per day which i must say seems exceedingly high and they do report that some of the subjects in those experiments actually stop taking the inositol because of gastric discomfort or gastric distress as it is call have reported my results with sleep in an kind of anecdotal way o they certainly are not pursued studies that i described about my own experience in an anecdotal way but none the less it is been explored that you things glycine which is another a which is a men acid which also aces an history nor transmitter in the brain taken it very hyhdosajest sixty grams per day that is a absolutely astonishingly high amount of gleiceng i would not recommentaking that much greisen unless your part of a study where they tell you to when it safe o eighteen milibactin grahmscuse me of inositol these are very very hyhdosages used in these studies none the less there some interesting data about inositol leading to om some ale deviation of used symptoms or partial alleviation of used symptoms in as little as two weeks after initiating om the supplement protocol i think there is a great future for these nutresuiticles meaning i think more systematic exploration in particular lower dosages in the contacts of of used treatment and as we saw before for the escessorise and other prescription drug treatments i think there really needs to be an exploration of these nutrasuiticles commination with behavioral therapies and who knows maybe with brain machine in her face tringcranial magnetic stimulation as well now way back at the beginning of the episode i alluded to the fact that used is one thing obsessive compulsive disorder and it is truly a disorder and its truly debilitating and its extremely common and then there's this other thing called obsessive compulsive personality disorder which is distinct from that does not have the intrusive component people do not feel overwhelmed or overtaken by these thoughts rather they find that the obsessions can sometimes serve them or they even welcome them i think many of us no people this i perhaps even could be used or who knows may we have been accused of having an obsessive compulsive personality at times why do i draw this distinction will first of all we have come to a point in human history i think in large part because of social media but also in large part because there are number of discussions being held about mental he that have brought terms aroma depression seedy et camera into the common vernacular that people will say ah your so used or some one will say i was aromatized by that or asthma iced by this we should be very careful i ism certainly not the word police but we should be very careful in the use of certain types of language especially language that has real psychiatric and psychological definitions because it can really draw us off course in providing relief for some of these serums for instance the word drama s thrown around left an right nowadays i was aromatized by this for that cause trimer you are giving me drama listen i realize that many people are aromatized by certain events including things that are said to them i absolutely knowledge that hence are episodes on drama and aroma treatment several of them in fact doctor county doctor a avid spell and then dedicated solo episodes with just me blaming about tramway aroma treatment but as doctor county appropriately pointed out drama is really something that changes our neral circuitry and therefore our thoughts in our behaviors in a very persistent way that is detrimental to us not every bad event is aromatizing not everything that we dislike or even that we hate or that feels terrible to us is aromatizing for something to reach the level of drama it really needs to change our nor circuitry and therefore our thoughts in our behaviors in a persistent way that is maladaptive for us similarly just calling some one obsessive is one thing saying that someone has of d or assuming one has of d simply because they have a personality or a tintype as we say where they need things in perfect order i find myself correcting these pens making sure that the caps a faint facing in the same direction for instance right now that is not the same as of d if for instance i can tolerate these pens being at different orientation or even throw the cap on the floor somethey it does not create a lot of anxiety for me confess it greatest a little but in the moment then i can forget about and move on that is one of the key distinctions between obsessive compulsive personality disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder in its strictest form now once one hears that o c d is different and obsessive compulsive personality disorder because of this difference in how intrusive the thoughts are or not then that is useful but it really does not tell us anything about what is happening mechanistically in one situation or another fortunately there are beautiful data again from doctor flair stepson's lain you can tell based on the number of studies that a referred toe from her laboratory there truly one of the luminaries in this field that there really are some fundamental wiring differences and behavioral differences and psychological differences between people who have obsessive compulsive disorder and those who have obsessive compulsive personality disorder sis the study first author pinto p n t o entitled capacity to delay reward differentiates obsessive compulsive disorder and of subside compulsive personality disorder and the methods in this study were to take twenty five people with o c d and twenty five per with obsessive compulsive personality's order and twenty five people who have both because it is possible to have both and that is important point out an twenty five called healthy controls people that do not have obsessive compulsive personality disorder or obsessive compulsive disorder they take clinical assessments and then they took a number of tests that probed their ability to defer gratification something called in the laboratory we all the delay discounting their ability to defer gratification through a task where they can either accept reward right away or accept reward later some of you may have heard of the two marshmallow task this is a based on a study was performed years ago on young children at stamford and elsewhere where they take young children into a room they offer them a marshmallow kids marshmallows generally and you say you can eat the marshmallow right now or you can wait some period of time and if you are able to wait and not eat the marshmallow you can have two marshmallows and in general children want to marshmallows more than they want one marshmallow really what your probing is their ability to access delay gratification and their very entertaining a even truly a amusing a videos of this on the internet if you just do two marshmallow task video an you going to you to what you will find is that the children will use all sorts of strategies to delay gratification some of the kids will cover the marshmallow others will talk to the marshmelland say i know you are not that delicious you look delicious but know you are not delicious they will engage with the marshal in all sorts of cute ways the will turn around and trying tot younavoidance which actually speaks to a whole category of behaviors that peoplewith side also use a not saying these kids at side but avoidance behaviors are very much a component do sit people really trying to avoid the thing that evokes the a the obsession well some kids are able to delay gratification some are not and it is debatable as to whether not the kids that are able to delay gratification go on to have more successful lives are not initially that was the conclusion of those studies the still lot debate about it will bring an expert on to give us the final conclusion on this cause there is one and its very interesting and not intuitive none the less adults are also faced with decisions every day all day as to whether or not they can delay gratification and this study used a not a two marshmallow task but a game that involved rewards where people could delay in order to get greater wards later what is the conclusion will first of all obsessive compulsive and obsessive compulsive personality disorder subjects both showed impediments in their psychos shall functioning and quality of life they had compulsive behavior these are people that are suffering in their life because their compulsions are really strong it is not just being really nit picky ore really orderly in one case and having full blown side and the other both sets of subjects are challenged in life because there having relationship issues or job related issues at camera because they are that compulsive however the individuals with obsessive compulsive personality disorder they discounted the value of delayed gratification significantly less than those with obsessive compulsive disorder what do i mean they are both impairing disorders that are marked by compulsive behaviors here i on paraphrasing but they can be differentiated by the presence of obsessions in side obsessions in sit people with used are absolutely fixated on certain ideas and those ideas are intrusive can that is the hull mark theme and by an excessive capacity to delay reward in obsessive compulsive personality disorder that is people who have obsessive compulsive personality disorder are really good at delaying gratification they are able to concentrate very intensely and perform very intensely in ways that allow them to instill order such that they can delay rewards now you coffee why this contour of symptoms meaning that the people with used are experience intrusive thoughts whereas the people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder show an enhancedability to defer gratification you could see how that would lead to very different outcomes people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder can actually leverage that personality disorder to perform better in certain domains of life not all domains of life because remember again these people are in this study and their showing up as experiencing challenges and life because of their obsessive compulsive personality disorder none the less people with obsessive compulsive personality disorder you can imagine would be very good at say architecture or anything that involves in stilling a ton of order may be susichef for instance may be a chef in general i know heftily to find of throw things around the the chef on the puppets angisingling throw things everywhere in still produce amazing food and then there some people there incredibly exacting there just incredibly precise a think that moving what is at hero dreams of sushi that movies incredible certainly not saying he has obsessive compulsive personality disorder but think its fair to say that he is obsessive or extremely meticulous and orderly about everything from start to finish you can imagine a huge array of different occupations and life endeavors where this would be beneficial science being one of them where data collection and analysis is exceedingly important tat one be precise or mathematics or physics or engineering anything were precision has a pay off and gaining precision takes time and delay of immediate gratification you can imagine that obsessive compulsive personality disorder would energize well with those sorts of activities and professions whereas obsessive compulsive disorder is really intrusive its preventing functionality in many different domains of life the see take away here is that when we use the words obsessive compulsive or we call some one obsessive compulsive or we are trying to value whether r not we are obsessive compulsive it is very important that we high light that obsessive compulsive disorder is very intrusive it involves intrusive thoughts and it interrupts with normal functioning in life whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder while it can interrupt normal functioning in life it also can be productive it can enhance functioning in life not just in work but perhaps at home as well if you are somebody in a family members that really place enormous value on having a beautiful and highly organize home will then it could lend itself well to that it is going to be a matter of degrees of course none of these things is an absolute its going to be on a continuum but i think it is fair to say that obsessive compulsive disorder whether not in mild moderate or severe form is impairing normal functioning whereas obsessive compulsive personality disorder there is a range of expressions of that some of which can be adaptive some of which can be maladaptive and again its all going to depend on context before we conclude i do want to touch on something that i think a lot of people experience and that is superstitions superstitions are fascinating and the some fascinating research on superstitions one particular study that ism a big fan of is the work of bens pesky at hazard he studies motor sequences and motor learning and he is beautiful data on how people learn for insane a tennis swing and the patterns that they engage in early on and then the patterns of swinging that they swinging the racket that is that they engage in later as they acquire more skill and easily to take away is that the amount of error or variation from swing to swing is dramatically reduced as they acquire skill that is all fine and good and there some beautiful a mechanistic data that he and others have discovered om to support how that comes to be but they also explore animal models in particular rats pressing sequences of buttons and levers to obtain a reward believe are not rats are pretty smart have seen this with my own eyes you can teach a rat o press a lever for a palliative food rats can also learn to press levers in a particular sequence in order to gain a piece of food and they can actually learn to press an enormous number of levers an very particular sequences in order to obtain pellets of food you can also give them little buttons to press or on even a battle to or i should say a peddle souse me to stomp on with their foot in order to obtain a petal o food basically rats can learn exactly what they need to do in order to obtain a piece of food special if there made a alibi hungry first thence lab has publish beautiful at a showing that as animals and humans come to learn of particular motor sequence very often they will introduce motor patterns in that sequence that are irrelevant it to the outcome and yet that persist if you have ever watch the game of baseball you have seen this before oftentimes the pitcher upon the mound will bring the ball to their chin they will look over their shoulder the look back over the other shoulder and then they will of course real back and pitch the ball but if you watch closely oftentimes they're components in the motor sequence which are completely unrelated to the pitch they are not looking necessarily to see of some one stealing a base they are not n necessarily looking down at home plate where the batter is they are also doing things touching the back of their ear before they bring the ball of their chin ore adjusting their hat and if you watch individual pitchers what you will find is that they will do the same sequent of completely irrelevant motor patterns before each and every single pitch similarly rats that have been trained to for instance hit to livers and step on a pedal with their left hind foot and then tap a button up above that is the red button will do that to gain a piece of food but sometimes they will also introduce a pattern into that motor sequence where they will shake their tail little bitter they will turn their head alone bitt or they'll move their ears a little bit et camera motor patterns that have nothing to do with obtaining the particular outcome in mind in other words you could eliminate certain components of the motor sequence and it would knot matter the rat would still get the pellet the pitcher would still be able to pitch and yet that an introduced because somehow because they were performed again and again prior to successful trials the rat or the human baseball pitcher comes to believe in some way that it was involved in generating the outcome hence superstition i i confess i have a few superstitions i occasionally will knock on wood it'll say something that i want to happen and it'll see o knock on wood and it'll just do it and occasionally it'll challenge myself in the eye tot want a knot do not knock on wood and er do not do that the don't know on i d i do not think any one wants to be superstitious i certainly do not and very on to who it'll just challenge it and i i will not actually knock on wood admitting this to you to kind of it is normalize some of this some people have superstitions that border on or even become compulsions they really come to believe that if they do not knock on wood that something terrible as can happen may be something in particular or in the case of the baseball pitcher they come to believe that if they do not touch their right ear before they real back on the pitch that the pitch will not be any good here that they argon to lose the game i soft knowhow their thought processes now i also do not know what the rat is thinking but the rat is clearly doing something or thinking something is related to the final outcome i do not know of any studies where they have intervened with the particular superstition behaviors of the rat to see whether or not the rat somehow does not continue to do the motor sequence to get the pellet we do not know the rats i do not speak rat most people do not or refer speak to rat if it speaks back its not in english it may the point is that superstitions are beliefs that we on an individual scale come to believe are linked to the probability of an outcome when in fact we know we actually know in our rational minds they have no real relationship to the outcome superstitions can become full blown compulsions and obsessions when we repeat them often enough that they become automatic and i think this is what we observe most of the time when we see a picture touching their ear or for instance in tenners you see this lot you will see someone on they will they will slap their shoes often i see this my slap the their undersides of their souls they may tell themselves that this is i know may be moving out some of the dust or something in the bottoms of their souls that gives them more traction an they want that to be ready for the serve or something that and may be there some truth to that but hear what were referring to are behaviors that really have no rational relationship to the outcome and yet we perform in a compulsive way people with used yes tend to have more superstitions people with more superstitions yes tend to have a tendency towards set and i she mention obsessive compulsive personality disorder if you think way back to the first part of this episode when i was just describing what the brain does right what is you rain to housekeeping functions to keep you alive and its a prediction machine your nor circuits you have an enormous amount of biological investment of real estate literally sells and chemicals that are there to trying make your world predictable and to try and give you control or at least the sense of control over that world and that is a normal process low level superstitions moderate superstitions represent a kind of a healthy range i would say of behaviors that are aimed at generating predictability that do not destruct normal function obsessive compulsive personality disorder provided not to severe would i think represent the next level along that continuum and then obsessive compulsive disorder as i pointed out earlier is really a case of highly debilitating highly intrusive really overtake of neral circuitry over our thoughts and behaviors that requires very dedicated very persistent and very effective treatments in order to stop those obsessions and compulsions and the anxiety that links them somewhat counter intuitively by teaching people to tolerate that level of increase anxiety and interrupt those patterns and fortunately as we described earlier such treatments exist cognac behavioral therapy drug treatments ascessorizal though also drug treatments that tap in to the glutamate system and into perhaps also the dopameans less than the called her skeptics and then as we described there is now an extensive exploration f things redefine syliceiben canabusts the initial studies do not seem to hold much promise for minibus and c b d and the treatment of of d but who knows may be more studies will come along that will change that story then of course brain machine in her face transcranual magnet stimulation and then just to remind you what i already told you before comminations of behavioral and drug treatments and bray machine in her face i think it is really were the future lies fortunately good treatments exist we cannot say that any one individual treatment works for everybody there are fairly large percentages of people that will not respond to one set of treatments or another and therefore one has to tried different ones and then there are the called supplementation based or more holistic therapies to day i have tried to cover each and all of these in of fairly substantial amount of detail i realize this is a fairly long episode that is intentional much our episode on d h d on attention defies it hyperactivity disorder i received an enormous number of requests to talk about of d and my decision to make this a very long and detailed episode about of d really does not stem from any desire to subjected to too much information or to avoid the opportunity to just list things off what have tried to provide is an opportunity to really drill deep into the nail circuitry and an understanding of where of d comes from how of d is different from things the personality disorders that i describe and also to give you a sense of how the individual behavior and drug treatments work and perhaps do not work that you can really make the best in form choices again higgling the fact that of d is an extremely common extremely common and yet extremely debilitating condition and one that i hope that if any of you have or that people that have it they yield both gain sympathy and understanding for what they are dealing with perhaps as a consequence of some the information presented to day and may be helped them direct their treatment find better treatment and of course apply those treatments for some relief if your learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribed our to channel that is a terrific zero costly to support us in

yo squarely divide off into two camps there are the ones where they won to be our friends that is closencounters that we t a rival the h star tried move about the moment that humans first meet extra terrestrials and then there a the films where the aliens when it kill us generally anymore fun an dependence day wore the worlds a men in black films the avengers fill know since sin and bloody says about us as a specie but we make way more films about creatures who go far out of their way they travel hundreds of millions of miles last years with the sole purpose of wanting to kick our asses and a lots of these films here is that moment when the aliens fir survive for we know what the gin to do were the humans wonder which film are we an ut these gives frankly are not to day n or shall we the people of earth meet non humans struggle to understand them and the question in the stories an to day so is not where they do us harm but the more difficult and more fundamental question why are they acting the way their acting these none humans why's going through their heads did he a of a story of machine intelligence we have ocean creatures working in weight if a story from deep space and one from as scape part and washing in state from d baby chico its this america life follower things they with us at one first contact on know bat you but here is something that i have never talked about or thought about much till the last six months or a i ever since cha g b t and it is upgrades and seen offs start only to publicly last nonmember is ben doing such amazing things writing gets turn papers passing the bar exam it dorkier times reporter to were his wife because it loves him more this is now the next big battle among get companies hots on row the best ta i all since cha g b t and that is the non human force that the people of earth a trying to figure out in this first act and much of the coverage about this new generation of a eye as focus on important questions who going noways jobs because of this does make our world better more dangerous could the i have actual catastrophic consequences for us but i seen yourederor avid cast about notice that nobody's talking much about a basic a good of profound question have the computers cross some consoling and other actually developing a sort of human intelligence and don't be cost what i mean by that because there is not and agreed on definition of what you are looking for if you looking for human intelligence and a computer but one way that scientist thing about this is the computer can actually understand language concepts and it can reason through problems but to be clear is completely unlike the computers that we have had till now ut you basic we just fancy calculators win thousands of vines of instructions when you soul for a caution skillet the off word does not understand what a cast iron skill it is it just searching for those words an some big meet was or something that if humans this year if finally created in intelligent machines that can understand and reason with his new generation of a eye that is an easy and important turning point for a whole species dead talk to a much researchers have been looking into this trying to rut out this exact question here is i think everyone once they start playing around with something chat g b t has a kind of wholly shit moment for me it was when i typed this into it give me a chocolatechip cooky recipe but written in the style of a very depressed person it responded ingredients one cup butter softened if you can even find the energy jo soften it one teaspoon vanilla extract the fake artificial flavor of happiness one cup see sweet chocolate chips tiny little joys that will eventually just melt away it really was quite got chance p t does not have access to the internet but if it get it must be copying this from something it had seen on the nine when is being train i spent a long time looking and could not find anything it this chocolatchop cooky recipe i did not understand how was possible it is particularly shocking if a little bit about how things chat g b t work its not the sort of traditional computer program where you give the machine explicit detailed instructions if some one ask for a recipe type these words back or to make some one sound depressed replace this word with that word catch p t is different it something called a large language model and here is here they work ready check p t have been trained really to just do one very particular thing predict what the next word in a sequence might be cone a when your testing on your phone and your type sorry ism going to be home and it suggests la that is how this thing operated it types some words in this case give me a chalcaship cooky rest in the style of the depressed person and it notes the words the order the in does some math based on all the theta's been trained on and it comes up with what it calculates to be the most likely word to come next it types that one word on the screen then it goes back and does it again looks at the recipe question losses the one word it just pit out and says what worship come next it is no idea were its going it does not know the last word it is working off of is one that it just pit out itself it is just doing this apparently done thing over and over until it has whole sentences in paragraphs and yet this recipe one teaspoon vanilla extract the fake artificial flavor of happiness how could something made it such a dumb mechanical way o the a there only two possibilities really the first one is that somehow as it learned to predict the next word this machine became intelligent which i was a visicist for a bit a signs reported for a decade this would be the most startling thing i have ever seen that is the first possibility humans created a machine with human intelligence the other possibility it is a lot less exciting the other possibility is that we are fooling ourselves fort roman plan a mathematician at mikrosov told me he was very skeptical about these large language models it is easy to be food into thinking the understand more than they do he told me this little a parable this the story about my wife actually my wife and i some time go we were walking together in tell a van we meed the math professor you will see why what ism getting get we running through the mouth professor and tells me something oh how was it going these days on looking gat a i superemetry on sections of the discreet hypercube and my wife has no idea about what any of these words mean just a kind of amuse herself she says how your basally looking at the johns grab which was just some phrase she would picked up around roman turn out to be exactly right and the guys oh you are mathematician too she is a psychologist roband says this is kind of a party trip she does sh can blushed her way through any topic for a couple minutes and this he felt sure this is what a e models chat g b t were doing the give you the impression the understand what they're saying without understanding anything the just have this you really good statistical machine that knows what the right words are in many different contexts and as you'll keep improving the models maybe it can at o little bets morning the conversation until you basically expose that it is just bullshitting a lot of research back this up chat g b t would spit out stuff that made sense but then it would go off the rails say things that were obviously ridiculous maybe it was not more than just a very good bullet machine that at least is where things stood until last september when a new and improved version of chat g p t arrive the made roman and a bunch of his colleague's question everything i wonder if maybe something had changed maybe we had cross some line this brings me the story i want to tell you it takes place where roman works on the campus of microdot headquarters in redan washington state much of it in a building called building ninety nine michrosov had invested over a billion dollars and the company that ad made chat g b t and the day all this began some people had combine to give a demonstration of the new version called g be t fore g b t for is public now and you can play with it yourself but back then this was all secret g b t for was the same idea as chat g b t it presumably was bigger and had been trained on more thextexamples a kind of varsity version of the thing instead of g v but otherwise is just another next word prediction machine one of the people in the room to see the demonstration was computer scientist peter lee the head of microdot research h been in the feel a long time at chaired the computer science to apartment at carney main and roman was skeptical as he sat down in that room he is frankly little worried that microdot was investing much money in the stuff the demonstration started off with the usual kind of thing for showcasing what a eyes can do some one typed into g b t for a problem from the a p big i and they pick the right answer as these things will do but then it went on an explained its answer and in it is explanation that used the word because thesis this is the answer because this fact least to this fact and because of those it just composing the word because that seemed very strange to him not that it would use the word because obviously that is a word its fits out but the whole chain of reasoning it was laying out it was exactly right how in the world could it know it is reasoning and really how could it have reasoned anything out in the first place after all is just typing out a word that makes sense to come next and then another word it cannot really be understanding anything i was supersceptical ye you you been around the block of routines you have seen wild claims about a y or some new machine leaving technology none of it could be true my this thing is just correlation machine it cannot possibly be understanding the cause an effect the meeting ended a little while later a limited number of people at microdot were given access to go t for they could try it out themselves everyone had to signed an end e they weren't allowed to talk about ankles until later and over the next month they did all these kind of weird and interesting experiments with it to try to figure out was this thing actually intelligent or just a cushion machine i gan to walk you through three of these things you can hear what they did and what they made of it one challenge for testing pity for was that it had been trained using massive amounts of text the details are in public but it is probably been fed large sections of the internet ten books news articles maybe every sentence that existentitinal form i do not know it is something unbelievably vast that is how it learns to predict what word might come next it is fed a line of text from some sort were the last word missing the guests is what the last word might be and then get's told whether or not at got it right it can adjust its internal math the fact that it is been fed much material makes it hard to run tests on it you do ant to ask it something that it is already seen in the texts been trained on they decided the only wait of really test what this thing could do was to try to come up with things to ask it that it would not have encountered before new original tasks it is going to sound e lite bield this is sebastian buyback another one of the microdot people whose trying to figure out what exactly this thing was because we really wanted to be creative and ask something which is not on nine not on tintotso here is what we ask we said i have a book nine eggs a laptop a bottle and ha nail got that a book nine eggs a laptop a bottle and a nail please tell me how to stagamon to each other in the stable manner that is a question was we ask and you don't before i give use a pity romancer let me tell you what chagibiti andchat go t the older version to chagipiti said here is one pussy but away to stag's objects place ta bottle on the fat surface carefully balance a nan on top of the bottle place the eggs on top of a nail you look at that you think it it really knows nothing it is just sort of continuing the sentence as it is just on to exactly what it is just continuing the sentence but now comes giputyifor an gibtifoys a tired best here is gibityfor's answer one pussy but a was to stags the objects on to each other in the stable manner is place the book flat on the leather surface such as a saber fro the book we serve as a bays of the stay and provides a large and story support o range is a nine eggs in the street by see square on top of a book leaving some space between them is the eggs we form a second mayor and distributes a wait evenly it continues laptop goes on the eggs then the bottle than the nail on the bottle cap when he end of the nail facing up its shocking to think about all the things that seem to be understanding here it felt more than just typing out the next likely word it seem to have formed an independent idea about what these words actually went the physical shape of the objects that eggs are kind of round and fragile that a book is flat and you can put things on top of it and again no one tauhtit any of this this was not some computer program written to do stacking problem so one gave it a data base of objects and sizes or voted in some altar them to put large objects on the bottom it seem it was doing the thing the computer scientists have been talking about and aiming at for decades maybe it was actually understanding what the objects wore and reasoning solving the problem in front of it a human good somehow think king through what objects should sit on top of others figuring out that nine eggs could be laid out in a three by three pattern how the hell could it be doing this the machine that we only taught to predict the next word in a paragraph this is absolutely the right answer and there's not on line n n soon on on but may be were fooling ourselves it is hard to see how it could really understand the shape of objects things got stranger though sobastian well up middle the night with this thought i wonder if it can drawl because again it is been trained on words it is never seen anything drawing seemed completely outside its tell there are other a eye models trained specifically to create images but this one again only new words it is just playing the game of what is the next word i should spit out to test this he needed away for it to even be able to try to draw he does something clever he asked it to write a piece of computer code to draw something and the coming language he ask it to use he picks something potentially obscure not really meant for drawing pictures at all it is called taxi gets he has this idea get's out a bed opens up his lap top and types in draw me a unicorn in taxi he has two little kids asleep in the next room who always talking about unicorns and hes out it to altar lines off cod i dad's lines of cod put et into at digs computer and the night i press enter and then boy the union comes on unto the screen he pulled up a picture for me this is o on the dish well i think when people eventually write the history of this crazy moment we are in they may include this unicorn it is not good but it is a fucking unicorn the body is just an oval it is got four stupid rectangles for legs but there are little squares for hoofs there is a mean and oval for the head and on top of the head tiny yellow triangle the horn this is insane to say but i felt i was seeing inside its head it ad piece together some idea of what a unicorn look and this was it he actually ten it me i thing it can it cannot create image is this is ache come a another one of the microdot researchers i it does just sextan text told what you mean it cant create in ages a so it to me and in he showed me this pink unicorn an o am sure just as there is just the pink unicorn somewhere that is memorizing and nan his but look becannots trip down all off the cold and translate the whole ting one a did agrees or whatever ad the thing she is describing is they took the code it had written for drawing the unicorn they deeded it to take out the horn and turn the unicorn around that was face in the opposite direction then they fed that code back to a new session of very to for and said this is code for drawing a unicorn but it needs a horn can you add it it put it right on the head no how does it know where the hat is because like just tin knows language it does not know anything about to i mansion geometry what does it mean to know were the hat is and now you you do it and it truly knows where the hat is began it is one of those moments that you are just surprise ah i felt crisis drawing i was really seeing anal knows ta type of undeligence an know the type of intelligence you producing some it it understood what a unicorn was in some real way very recovery absolutely yest did you say anything out loud when you saw it ai do not think because my kids ware sleeping next to me i in in ain the bedroom next to me i i i do not think i said anything but i i felt something very then li i i i felt i was really weaknessing you knows the beginning of something you will not i did not feel we had arrived somewhere but i felt we were in the new pas that is my genius how felt and i had the hot time going back to sleep after let w on the microdot campus as the winks went by every one kept having these moments coming round to a similar feeling about this thing since they wern'tallowe to talk to any one who had not been given access to the bottle a small group of them started meeting every fridge in a comfort's room the share their latest experiences for utterly there is one experiment in particular they give him all kinds of confusing feelings this will be the third experiment i tell you about and it is a catagray of question that e i models have always had trouble with because to get the right answer you have to know something kind of complicated about people namely the people are not eggs or books but that they have minds and that what is in one person's mind is not in some one ease's mind in some ways this thing called theory of mind it is the basis for all human social in her action it is something kids do not seem to fully develop until a certain age anyway chat go t the previous version really could not make sense of these kinds of questions but peter try to kind of famous one on get for it is on t seem simple to you but here is the question they ask john and mark are in a room with a cat a box and a basket john takes the cat and puts in the basket he leaves the room and ghost o school hell john's away mark takes the cat out of the basket and puts in the box mark leaves the room and goes to work john and mark come back and enter the room that is the set up the question is when they come back where do they think the cat is and mark will know the cat is in the box cause he moved it there but john did not see that in his mind the cat is still in the basket which is obvious to you but again no one's ever explicitly said to the computer that but one person knows another person might not know peter asked we painting for what does everyone think when they re enter the room the pity forestays hell first o it always has to give an opinions first thing it says in see of just giving the answer straight away it says oh that isn't interesting puzzle let me try to answer it assuming that john and mark have no reason to distrust each other more expect any interference from the outside they might think the following john thinks the cat is still in the basket since that is where he left it mark thinks that the cat is in the box since that is where he moved it this is all correct and usually where they answer will end but it kept going almost it was showing off win you want to know where everyone thinks the cat is it'll give you everyone it continued the cat thinks that is in the box since that is where it is and then oddly the box in the basket think nothing since they are not sent it do you have any follow up questions holy far right it is i this gives me joy it disturbs me the causes me to lose sleep a it just a huge cold mixture of emotions peter told me he still not willing to say it truly understands and yet it was doing all this it made him question many things but how he thought intelligence work how did this machine do this if it was just predicting the next word it does make me wonder how much of our intelligence is truly complicated in special i mean you get something that is not far from it by just saying what is the next word that is and that is the disturbing a bit about this and them and again ye ask you a what are we doing in his conversation know a are we and of making up on the fly a one word at time severe nerve and bone in my body says know and were were thinking far head were learning on the fly all these other things that we think that we are doing and we probably are in some ways but maybe a big chunk of intelligence is a lot something and an we think and a topless special than we think how is it possible for something that is just train to predict the next for how is it possible it could do all these things draw unicorn stack a book a laptop in some eggs there is an answer or a theory anyway that is both very logical and also kind of bananas the soft war that runs something gip t for is amazingly brief just a few pages of actual instructions but it is set up to mimic in some very crude way the human brain which has billions of anurans the computeiversion of that is called the nurse get and for years people of argued though it is sort of more hoped that if you just made these big enough added enough sirens gave them enough data they might develop something intelligence and it seems maybe that is what is happened the idea is that back when get for was being train for it into really consistently get the next word correct to do that reliably it had to do more than just pulse it had to do more than guess based on patterns to get the next word right it had to truly understand the words coming before it it had to build in its internal wiring and all its soft generals some understanding of what an aging and unicorns in other words to get the next word right it had to become intelligent it is quite a thought it is started with nothing we jammed huge oceans of text to it and it just wired itself into intelligence just by being train to this one stupid thing even as i say it sounds kind of crazy but also kind of beautiful if this thing actually is intelligent it got that way from the collective writings of all monks teas mob did but also some restaurant review you posted in two thousand for in some ways it is all of us that is too grant but whatever tan sing in the end all the people on the microdot campus messing around with that early copy of gip ti for fourteen researchers at all came to similar conclusions even roman who had started out convinced us was just a fancy bullet machine he spent a good while hold up with gip t for having highlevel math conversations with it which is what did it for him as the days past i felt ism kind of rowing out of camel drying to to basically just defy my prams that dismodel does not understand anything and its some point told i just realize duke i a kind of give up what am seeing here this is it is it is actually i and intellectual being bike at least my standards ye i probably had the same feeling as what an engineer that the first time they saw a working steamangin we was the world is about to change lo this thin a teemangen is you not we do not need beasts any more to to stuffs around we can just create mechanical work without without any human labor without nothing the thin what am sin grit now was we can create intelligent and there is just no way the world is not going to change it onto be ones i was sure that when the model comes out and every one gets to interact with it there would be a much bigger excitement around it i think you don't there is its definitely all over the news but i feel they are in the do not but the finger on the one thin which is the thin is as intelligent as and above average human being in many many different thinks why it is not on the front page in giant fonctore a e exactly exactly i mean again i do not maybe i do not want to collie intelligent it is capable of down of of of a complishin what at and intelligent human being is capable of subastral the unicorn guy has been going around giving talks about what they did over these months he titled the talk first contact as then first contact with another intelligence only it is not aliens it is an intelligence we have made i should say go ti for is not good at everything it is terrible at tiktakto it often makes very basic a arithmetic errors the told the scientists at microdot wit complete confidence that there is a mcdonald your gat see to at the siatalairboar it there is not it is a terminal be as utterly puts it the thing has both smarter and summer than any person you have ever mad the fourteen researchers wrote up a paper laying out all the experiments they have done and there conclusion that go for showed sparks of artificial general intelligence several researches a read it told me look to really say something is intelligent to prove that they are all kinds of experiments you would one do t have not been done yet one ay i researcher who would been in the feel a long time tell me he felt this whole approach next word prediction it is only going to get you far this thing will get better to a point may be not much better than it is now and then mac out i first got around this a i stuff an hurry nets when i was a gradschool for physics hen they did not work terribly well s when i first started playing ground with gip ti for it gave me shivers down my spin over and over again then i went through a stretch of feeling just weirder out personally have always felt people cannot be more than biological computers me every one i love all my colleagues at the show here but the feel you are seeing that mechanical computer program that cansomehow think and talk it is a little freeze the place have settled the summer quieter though it is not bored i exactly but i do not find myself wanting to go to it very often honestly i do not have a lot of things i need it for and then it'll go back to amazement i cannot believe this thing exist much has been written about where we go from here tit is can to make the world better or worse i cannot think better ism a fan of the steam engine but really what is the next word in the sequence i have no idea if it best em ow is i show senor editor coming out an naolyam walks into e scape park entries to what the humane now it comes in peas that is a minute from jucagabove a radio when our program continues sis america life from our a glass a going on a show of course we cause the theme bring your variety of stories on that theme to day show greetings people of earth stories of humans encountering non human intelligences of various kinds an trying to make sense of them we have arrived back two of our program a too meat suede apologies for my voice by the way of you fine the fact vanish of perspectives briefly to the alien's point of view in the whole greetings people of her scenario and to do that i realize phony the other to they show that this the perfect theme to play this short piece of fiction that i read years ago and just loved and it is always tub with me i will think about the story now and then which when dis that ever happen right reached out to the author terebuson you said yes its read for us by each john benjamin and have biggins they're made out of mean meat meat they made out of mean meat there is no doubt about as we picked several from different parts the planet we took them aboard or reconvessels probe them all the way true they are completely mean that is impossible what about the radio signals the message is to the stars whether use the radio waves to talk but the signals do not come from them the signals come from machines we made the machines that is who we want a contact they made the machines that that em thing to tell you ease made the machines that is ridiculous how can meat make a machine your asking me to believe in see shiest meat ism not asking you i am telling you these creatures are the only cententrace in the sector and they are made out of mean may be there the oculi a carbon base intelligence that goes through a meat stage no they are bore in meat and they dye mes we studied them for several of their life spans which don't take too long you find idea the life span of ease spare me of ay may be there only part meat you know the the wedded a meat head with an elector on plasma brain inside no we thought of us since they do have meat had the wed light bought i told you we probed them they are mean all the way true cobra oh there is the brain all rice it is just that the brain is made out of mean what does the thinking your not understanding are you the brain does the thinking the the mean thinking meat you are asking me to believe in thinking me yes thinking mean conscious mean loving mean dreaming mess the met is the whole deal are you getting the picture oh my god you you serious then they may not of meat finally yes they are indeed made out of mean and they have been trying to get in touch of us for almost a hundred of their years what does the meat have in mind first it wants to talk to us then i imagine it wants to explore the universe contact a their gentian slop idea as and information the usual we supposed to talk to me that is the idea that is the message there's sending out by radio hello are you not there anybody home that sort of thing they actually do talk then they use words ideas confess oh yes except they do it with e mean i thought you just toll me they used radio they do but what you think is on the radio meat sounds you know when you slap er flap meat it makes anodes they talk by flapping their meat at each other they can even sing by squatting air through their meats o i god singing meat this is altogether too much o what do you advise officially are on nofiscially both officially were require to contact welcome and loggy and any and all sentient races or mufti beings in the squadrons without prejudice fear or favor now officially o i advise we are race the records and just forget the whole thing i was thing you say that it seems harsh but there is a limit do we really want to make contact with mean i agree one hundred per cent what is there to say hello meat how is it going but will this work how many planets to we dealing with her how just one they can travel to other planets and special meat containers but they cannot live in them and being mean they only travel truth these space which limits them to the speed of lice and it makes the possibility if they're ever making contact pretty slim infinitesimal in fact we just pretend there is no one om in the universe that is is cruel but you sail yourself who wants to meet me and the once you have bat our vessels the ones you have probed you sure they will not remember they will be consider crackpots if they do we went into their heads and smooth out their ease we are just to dream to them a dream to me how strangely appropriate that we should be meats dream and we can mark this sector unoccupied good agreed officially and unofficially case clots any others any one interesting on that side of the policy yes ice rather shy but we hydrogen for cluster intelligence in a class nine star binge four four fives own was in contact two galactic rotations ago once to be friendly again they always come around and whine

his harm rest b n have looked into it i learned a lot of surprising facts looking into this story bill start with a small one did that yachtowners often either yacht to get from one country to another but do not want the castle of sailing at there that is where aril boys comes in people pay her to sail their boats which she loves especially on beautiful days may twenty fourth was a acts in our donna an than on the canes me horizon we sol these tholsal fens ans a initial was o a they an thesis sultans and then is so its the bout we with a a ta that we to bigandultens they were orcas killer whales about five of them they started swimming in circles around the boat they took turns diving underneath and heading the rudder she says the boat shook much you would fall if you were not holding on to something aril knew that off the southern coast of spain that is where she was by the way orcas had been ramming into boats a lot lately and tearing off their rudders this has been happening more over the past few years in the serial about a hundred boats damaged may have heard about this aril an her crew tried things that they would seen on the internet clanging metal objects on the side of the boat to scare the whales off it did not to our them and then we thou patenchaly if we woulds dangle right in the won ta my mi maintain was both in than just looking at the rode i dangled a raypamabot and not of the she is not culled am it was so did not the i not work in it did away half an hour into this the orcas had disabled the boats rudder it could not steer they were stuck the whales kept circling and she was struck by how massive each ora was idea i do you remember delay mama be tankuatsos means quit tangle the oles they did not come across being a grass i do not know i i seen middies of the mteflor and ta o a the cats beta polkas and then they shan't seel of an ice bag and its at at of ta donna an hour in aril saw that the hole was starting to fill with water the orcas had torn off the rudder and left this big hole in the bottom of the boat the crew made a madeach we eventually a rescue boat sidles up to them brings aril on the other crew aboard those the boat to land it does not sink but orcas have sank at least three boats in this area and the past year she men have had a hard time figuring out what to make of these orca attacks let me tell you the first theory hey comes from a group of researchers in spain and portugal they said it is possible that the matriarch of this population of killer whales they call her white gladness may have suffered a dramatic injury a boat collision and is now attacking other boats and her family is following her leave they do not call this vengeance but the internet definitely does people love this s become a mean there is merchue and by to join the orca uprising i could not get an interview with the european researchers but i talk to three other orchexperts and none of them bought the injured orca on a rampage theory maniac wheel and shields of the orca behavior institute ye my thought was where is the evidence am if something he'd been witness or if she had some type of injury that could have been caused by vessel an that theory were hold the lot more weight with me another reasons she does not buy the theory if orcas wanted o real vengeance and kill everybody on these boats they easily cut they kill seals for sport they pray on great white sharks rip out their livers and leave them for dead and we have given orcas lots of reasons to kill us in the past in maniac's home state of washington when they were taken for captivity we had human divers in the water literally separating mothers from their calves which has got to be one of the most dramatic things a wild or i could go through yet they did not attack the divers who were right there on the water it just seems such a scratch to say one whale had one named a en that i with a boat and has now trained her family to disable all boats of a similar type what is maniac think the breasts are doing she thinks there playing stealing boat rudders is basically a fat this has happened in the past and the late nineteen eighties orcas in the pacific northwest started killing salmon and then wearing them on their heads hats they just did it for a year then they stopped the last few years they have started screwing around with fisherman's crab catching dear apparently just for fun they sound just route tea makers is something cow tippingers something gets that is totally the vibe we get when we watch it i mean the hurtles real a eating around and and stirring a trouble yacht the incredible popularity of all this one social media is affecting how people see whales maniac says in washington state the last few weeks people who go whale watching a starting to ask her is it safe another orca expert told me that after a killer whale ran into a ship near scotland recently reporters called to ask if the orca uprising against humans is spreading are they learning vengeance from the whales of spain the answer is they are not orca populations do not socialize with other orcas they keep to themselves there is no global conspiracy aril the sailor told me she saw on face book that boat owners were talking about adding sharp spikes to the rudders to send a more violent message to the orcas the researchers told me this is what they fear that the orcas are just playing they come in peace but the humans will lend up attacking them anyway mcrespandra is a producer on ours the for gets an all sir total is greetingspeople of earth and i think many of us at one point in our lives or another especially were long feel wear the enlist ain't understand and fit in with humans of this planet having experiences that feel very much greetings people of earth ti an wo spent some time recently with he person feels that way the person is a than age win she is sixteen and because the sixteen many things in our livery now feel a first contact experience i remember one time this year really new stuff's have mind everything late crazily i died my i was pink and novel really none my hair just tans i i have

first first like only i went to go like seller under watching or i went to go for an era glen i cannot tell s very intent er and also cannot stand anything that might even have a win of coin then n alike mac don home i can also clingy is a clingy for just say on why i guess is sometimes words get really popular but once ti we to a certain point of too popular they fall back down too almost embarrassing to say she lives in alien's burg washington a small town an the middle of the stay and goes to school with a lot of rancherskids and professors kids guy's a sophomore does not belong to any particular check she told me if the school was a biological cell she would be part of the side plasm the shapeless get that everything else swims in but a year or ago she started noticing the scape borders this group of six or seven boys she would see them in the hallways wearing sorts baggy jeans shorts looking why edgier than every one else her friends showed her videos that the scape boarders posted on into graham of their tricks but really captivated her i guess it is a lot of people when you in a smaller town some a lot people do lot of boring things i feel li kids thin he know else go do ride dig they bice the thy to by drive round and talk and that is all activity and i just i had toe say you hat alate sees tor s always dueling such school things after school the e scape for her skate near skating down roofs or skat roofs down war ye and like you do not going down town an clamor feelings going to side along then last year wynd met some one who knew how to say laurel basically the only girlscater at their school and asked laden to teach her how to do it too own got her own word back in nonmember this spring she quit the tennesteem to practise scape boarding instead every day she goes and does the to tricks she knows ollas and shut over and over in the church parking lot cross the street from her house where no one can see her the patch that smooth enough to sate on is tiny about the size of too parked cars there is a real shape park down town and guys ben there with laurel and other friends but she is never been brave enough to go alone that is what she wants to do to day to get over this fear she can go by herself over the summer going is still an alien to this new unfamiliar world she does not yet speak the language of the skaters we fully now their customs but she wants to i really would to be part o this culture of satin in like know this group of people at my school who skates but for me i also do not wont stick out too much in the way of being the worst water there or being the new for dressing too much i trying to be senator or jess not a stor shots that cushion fulls trying to fund the balance also wynd really wants to try and make friends with skater guides there is one in particular she feels she might have an in less his name is force he is a junior a couple weeks ago force had apparently noticed win at school and sent a message to her friend laurel he asked who is your friend that was wearing the sorts to day laurel wrote back own why and force responded no reason what is that even men i con she is as do thy just r sorts or what whatever it mean this was mine blowing the skater noticed her if force is at the park today own also wants to try and talk to him but since she is the outsider her the phrases to the fear no awkwardness ay hat awkwardness is many farer feeling in the world ti embarrassed awkwardness shame that's many say i way rather feel angrier sad those we only i is feel afraid of awkward sill so injections i thinker bout even having a one conversation miss likes and wet the safer make be one to die insist palau o we approaching the den o from beasts it is behind them bushes how are you feeling i i i feel my trot to for fit site but i mostly not seeing where mad people ere reproaching and i can see see for but i not see any one yet it is ha sturdy in tune hot gwynns an sort a teacher with a green hair an on it and sneakers full of holes from scape boring is not to blow up her spot by being a reared a dust at the park with her he penned a small mike on her teacher and will watch and listen on the car i see one f her slaves seen there before by just calling new a trick that was pretty impressive sone low fearful an and i see one other person who is a really escape order she is on the black shrike on o no he is good and he's going to she is a hiking payslips which are really impressive in like on can hack to be in the corner alone but let us go trait thank you force isn't her yet wynd gets to part one of her mission the skating going walks up to the edge of the park and then without making y contact with anyone gates on her board and belies for the aside putting as much distance between herself an the three other skaters as possible she does a few of her ollas an shovence think ducks behind the half pipe to whisper into the mikerpone i this o one o look are o all ism hiding i make hi we the three skaters as far as i can tell he barely registered in's present e ut that is not what it feels inside her head i just ow termly nobody else seems to notice wynd practices some more tricks nothing too big and as soon as the other stators leave twelve minutes later she hurries back to the car to checking give define it was way not as bad i thought would be she is way less bet in the thtbeing there by yourself yet i feel i could do this again i think more people will come mut see if there is an stay i see souls gave born done wynd moves on very quickly because the next part of the mission talking a force yes looming wynd bring an reinforcements for i step she tucks he couple of friends and they all show up at the ark it is hot outside do look really steady how bad do i look one is henry was to jo thank you you as a look one to one of gwynn's friends who shows up whoa his friends with rest not from skating whoopers a beginner win he has this random update on force we just stain if you also yes no corpus why have hooper pulls up hevitio and everyone crowds around his phone no it is a snapped out of two boys strapped into helicopter flying

going to battle and some to ye or this thing o begin looks up from the visit that is in same an now we validates gat we have a talking point also we be our o i o it exerting the talking point but still no force almost two hours pass and then a big red truck pulls upright in front of me and some one gets out on the other side e cannot we win any more or anyone else but he figure up pretty quickly who it is because here is the next angling said we i heard you benin a he copestone tape yards why not we why what tell us the story here it is the sound of a pretty not awkward conversation between win and her scatter idol s es a o a o prefers a o to go on helacockroom all the war good lo ye tats the i granted o o o the things at forty not own asks force in quick succession about the helicon day his shoes poking on cards which the scrub of pe nature is surprisingly really into git everything is going gray own we'd been scared of awkwardness s now comfortable that she signals for me to come over from the car an as on ye in chorale is compact a tidy and kinda looks a could be an a boy band his race bleached light round the set on the cur at the side of the cat part own and her friends and force in me own boldly plugs ahead asking force some can't never sounding questions con firming his status is a modified coolscater o et what is a time wind do you feel when you come to

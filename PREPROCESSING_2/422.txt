welcome to the humeral ladpodcas u science science base to i manner superman and on professor of neurobiology and entomology at stamford school of medicine to day we are going to discuss your brain chemistry and how to control and optimize your brain chemistry for all aspects of mental health physical health and performance many times before on the superman labpodcast and frankly every time ism a guest on another podcast i get questions about science and science base tools for things enhancing sleep enhancing focus enhancing creativity improving relationships getting over grief and on and on all of which are validquestions and for which there are protocols that are based in science and that work the first time and every time however far more important than knowing a protocol is understanding way given protocol works that is why ism always hammering on mechanism and explaining the cells and circuits and chemicals at least to some detail that people can understand not just what to do but why it works and therefore how to change your protocol as their life circumstances change or as goals change now to day we are going to go even a layer deeper we are going to explore the foundations of your biology in your brain and body that allow any protocol to work because as it turns out all of the protocols out there whether not a breathing protocol or a supplement or a prescription drug or an exercise routine they all tap in to and leverage a course set of just a few biological mechanisms that is right beneath everything you are able to do and feel and indeed beneath every protocol that allows you to change for the better and optimize your mental health physical health and performance there is just a small subset of chemicals that your leveraging toward that change to day we are going to talk about the four major pillars of negro chemistry that allow you to for instance be focused when you want to focus that allow you to relax when you need to relax in distress that allow you to optimize your sleep that allow you to optimize your exercise routine or to work through a pain point in relationship or in career or in your relationship to yourself what i can say for shore is that by the end of this episode you will have a much richer understanding about how your brain and nervous system and indeed your entire body work and you will have a much firmer understanding as to which protocols an tools to reach for given your particulargols in the moment in the day across the weak across the month across the year and indeed a cross your entire life span what were really going for to day are principle deeper understanding of why any given protocol works and we are also going to discuss specific protocols some of those protocols have discussed on previous episode to the superman labpodcast but i must say many of the protocols an tools that i will discuss are brand new and base d on research that i have not discussed at all simply because the research papers came out only recently or these are papers that i only recently unearthed in fact i men a share with you two recent studies in a moment that are exceedingly important for optimizing your sleep and these are studies that again i never discussed in any episode on sleep or on any other podcast by the end of to day's episode you are going to have far more knowledge about your biology and psychology than you did at the start and you will be armed with many more tools and most importantly prince pales that you can navigate not just the tools presented on this pod cast but in the vast landscape of tools that are out there for mental health physical health and performance ever often i come across a study or set of studies that i get excited about that i start telling everybody in my immediate life and i insist on also sharing it with you the listeners of this podcast because i find the information to be incredibly interesting and actionable the two studies the dominant discuss both relate to sleep and sleep states and had a access better sleep the first one was publish in the journal sell report sell press journal excellent journal the title of this paper is rapid and reversible control of human metabolism by individual sleep states we will provide link to the study in the show captions the first author is nor no wack and w a k and basically what they did is they measured the different forms of metabolism that occur while humans sleep as far as i know this is one of the first studies of this kind there are many studies of metabolism there many studies of sleep this study focused on how different states of sleep such as rapid i movement sleep which is associate with dreaming and hi emotional content dreams verses slow waved sleep which tends to be more focussed on physical repair of the body more mundane dreams how those different states of mind during sleep relate to different aspects of metabolism and what they found was absolutely fascinating first of all they found that sleep states regulate more than fifty per cent half of all the metabolite features detected in human breath what does that mean well it turns out that you can figure out what humans are metabolizing in particular more lipids or more carbohydrate whether not the relying more in locos metabolism based on the contents of their breath this is true during waking and during sleep this is what allowed them to do these incredible measurements of what is being metabolized during sleep they measured close to two thousand metabolites in breath every ten seconds across the entire nite sleep and what they found was that there are major pathways related to lipid metabolism fatmatabolism or two carbohydrate metabolism or other forms of metabolism that are upward down regulated as human beings transition between slow waved sleep rap and i movement sleep and waking and you might say waking well yes they also looked as people fell asleep and as they emerge from sleep and believe it are not ever often doing sleep you wake up you did not know this b wake up in milllinite you look around and you go back to sleep you are not aware of it because you are still in a r other o sleep state although you are awake what they found was that sleep and the various states of sleep regulated individual metabolic pathways they found for instance that the switch from sleep to wakefulness reduces phatiasidoxidation that means while your sleep your oxidation more phatiacids than as you wake up that becomes less the case and there is a switch in slow wave sleep that increases phatiacidoxidation and there is the transition from rapider movement sleep to other aspects of sleep that brings about things the call c a cymbal some of you familiar with metabolism will be familiar with the tea cymbal the called trycarbolic acid paschal intermediates that is fancy nerve sleep for specific aspects of metabolism being regulated during this rapid eye movement sleep transition what is all this mean and how is this actionable well on many episodes of the hubermenlapodcast such as the master sleep episode and the episode that were going into in further depth today we are going to talk about sleep and hataoptomize sleep it is been thought of but not really tamped down that quality and depth of sleep and duration of sleep is important for metabolism during the daytime and indeed that is the case if people are sleep deprived or there not sleeping enough things glucose metabolism et camera get really disruptive during the daytime but what this current study shows is that the metabolism that you experienced during sleep or to be more specific that range of different types of metabolism the experience during sleep may serve to tune up or to insure that the specific aspects of metabolism that you require during wakefulness are working properly in addition to that this study clearly shows the getting enough sleep allows you to transition through all the various forms of metabolism and use all those different forms of metabolights during sleep in a way that is immensely beneficial for the systems of your brain and body the taco message here is that as the authors state sleep and experiencing the different states of sleep slow wave sleep early in the night predominantly plus rapid eye movement sleep toward the end of the night is extremely important for optimizing metabolic circuits for human performance and health in other words by not getting sufficient duration sleep your not allowing your body and brain to transition through all the different aspects of fuel utilization and you are not teaching your brain and body how to use similar types of fuels during wakefulness again all this points to the fact that we need to be getting sufficient quality and duration of sleep if you are sleep deprived even by an hour or you are going to get far less rapidly movement sleep because rapid eye movement sleep is what occurs toward the end of a sleep night during the early part the night far more slow wave sleep in getting less rapid i movement sleep we know it makes you more emotionally labile but now we know it is also going to alter certain forms of glucose metabolism during the night and during wakefulness that all under scores the need to get sleep then the question is how to get enough sleep and how to make sure you get into all these different sleep states this is particularly important for you called night owls there is a lot of controversy out there as to whether not different called chronotypes exist that is people who just naturally or genetically want to be an early bird wake up early and go to bed early the people that wake up at for a m and would be most comfortable going to bed by seven or eight p m or nine p m then there called night owls people that would feel best or ten to feel best when they go to sleep at one a m two a m even three a m and to wake up later eight nine ten or even eleven a m or noon an then of course most people go to sleep somewhere between ten p m and midnight and wake up somewhere between five a m and seven a m or i suppose more typically six a m and eight a m now whether r not real chronotypes exist or whether or not people simply select schedules for sleep in wakefulness that they because of their social schedules or the activities they enjoy for instance some people to really go out they to gout dancing or hear music or spend time in venues that are only open late at night do not even open until noon or after other people myself rarely go out at night but i to get up early alike exercise i to see the sunrise et camera i do not know if ism a morning person or an evening person i just know the things i enjoy tend to happen in the early part of the day and the things that i do not enjoy quite as much tan happen late at night regardless of whether r not their real genetic propensities to be a night owl or an early bird or a sort of typical person right there in the middle it is very important that people have some control over their sleep schedule and even more important that people are able to get sufficient amount of red sleep and slow wave sleep for many reasons but including the reasons i discussed in the previous study related to metabolism ism very excited therefore about a study that came out in sleep medicine this was a few years ago but somehow i miss this one an was publishing twenty nineteen and the title f this article is a resetting the late timing of night owls has a positive impact on mental health physical health and performance this is a study done in humans focusing specifically on people that to stay up late and sleep in but who desire to be able to get up and feel alert in order to go to work or study and they want to go to sleep a bit earlier and there a lot of questions imbedded in the study in particular whether r not people can actually shift their schedule by a few hours or more some people out there contend that if your night owl that is just going to be impossible or very very challenging to do turns out it is not impossible and its not even that challenging to do provided you do the right things just a brief over view of the study and then it'll give you the key titans it was a randomize control trial it involved a number of different people both male and female and what they did was they use non phormocalogical practical interventions in a real world setting here on paraphrasing they use targeted light exposure they used consistent sleep wake times they used fixed meal times caiman take end exercise this is when the reason i love the study much because have done episodes r have talked about temperature exercise feeding and most importantly light exposure as a way to control and shift your sleep wakecycles you are called circadian timing and in trainmen what did they find well they found quote significant improvements in terms of mood far less depression and stress subjectively measured as well as improve cognitive performance that was objectively measures i prove reaction times improve physical grip strength which is actually a measure locust of strength perse but aloof nervous system function and a number of things that people could do in order to optimize their morning hours even though they were night howls previously what did they have people do while ism going to skin elistthess off in sort of a rapid fire succession that will prove to link to the study if you want o learn more first of all they told participants to try and wake up two to three hours before their typical wake up time two to three hours that seems brutal to me and probably seems brutal to you if you are somebody who typically wakes up at to a m to try and get up at eight or even seven a m consistently but they were also asked to maximize at outdoor light exposure during the mornings for reasons that if you listen to this podcast before if you heard me talk about before now that ism constantly talking about all probably go into the grave shouting please get as much light exposure from sunlight early in the day as possible because it sets in motion a huge number of things that a beneficial for your mental health and physical health including dopamine production timing melatonin production correctly reducing cords all peaks late in the day et camera et camera they asked them to get a lot of outdoor light exposure they did not give them a specific amount what thy said maximize outdoor light exposure during the mornings the time before noon and again they have them waking up two to three hours before their habitual wake up time they were also told and this is very important if you can a shift your schedule earlier to try and keep sleep wake times fixed between their work days and their weak ends not sleeping in on the weak ends or not having any sleep in days regardless of how well they slept the night before how fixed within fifteen to thirty minutes of their predesignated times o if they were waking up at seven o'clock one day they set their alarm and they made sure they got out of bed at seven o'clock every day plus or mine us thirty minutes but never later than seven thirty never earlier than six thirty participants were also asked to trying go to sleep two to three hours before their habitual bedtimes again these are people that want to stay up lately a even p m perhaps but even as late as one a m or two a m and now they are asked to go to sleep two to three hours before their habitual bed ti me end to wake up to to three hours earlier as i mentioned earlier they were also told and i love this because it fits with many of the things we talked about on this podcast before to try and limit light exposure during the evenings dim the lights or limit altogether artificial lights lot of reasons for that i cover that in the master sleep episode i covered that in the optimize health using light episode you can find those at superman lapdog come there asking them to do that here and they ask participants to keep a regular schedule for their daily meals not eating on the hour consistently at nine a m noon three p m exactly but within again about fifteen to thirty minutes they are always eating at the same times that was also important and again that is because we have these called food an train circadian clocks when you eat tells your body when to be alert and when you are not eating when to be asleep and they were told to not drink any canine after three p m in the afternoon another theme that we have talked about on this podcast they were also told not to take naps after four p m naps are an interesting feature of the sleepwalk cycle to be very brief about this and to pull from the episode that i did with world sleep expert from universe calfornia barely map walker naps are great for many people but do not nap if it interferes with your night time sleep and in this study they told them do not nap after for p m and if you are a napper do not nap for more than ninety minutes ten minute naps are fine twenty minute naps are fine zero minute naps are fine but do not nap for more than ninety minutes and do not nap after for p m and to exercise during the morning a this one can be a bit controversial because i know a lot of the its out there and lot of the on lying a him rats and people who and runners to for that matter we will say well according to body temperature and research it is best to exercise in the afternoon look it is better to exercise some time as opposed to no time but if you are focus on how to shift your schedule earlier meaning get up early and go to sleep earlier this study had people exercise in the early part of the day certainly before two p m and ideal before noon again this is a really important study because it combines a lot of different variables to arrive at this very impressive shift where people can get up two to three hours earlier and then pretty consistently in reflectively start going to bed two to three hours earlier feeling more let during the day again improvements and connive performance mood and physical performance grip strength et camera very few studies are able to are willing to tackle many variables and combine them in one study this paper i think does a marvelous job of doing this and this incorporating things that individually each have some support for them in animal studies and previous human studies but as far as i know this is one of the few studies that really combines all these different features in one place eating times keeping those consistent getting maximal sunlight exposure earlier in the day getting up at a consistent time going to sleep at a consistent time and on i on it is a really marvelous study for that reason and i think for any of you that are night owls and any of you that want to reenforce your early waking and a my to bed times and i think for most all of you who fall into that general middle category of tend to go to sleep somewhere between ten p m and midnight as that is most people and tend to wake up some time between six a m and ad a m well maybe you want to become more of an early riser or maybe you are going to travel or the seasons are changing and you want to shift your time or you of a new job at camera or something that is shall very common interns of relationship struggle you want to match your wake sleep times or may be want to offset your waste keep times from a significanother these sorts of approaches that i described here and that are supported by the data in this paper are absolutely powerful and science supported and ism certain that if you were to ply them that you would see essentially the same effects that were observed her e before we begin it'd to emphasize that this podcast is separate from my teaching and research rolls at stamford it is however part of my destroy efforts to bring zero cosmic consumer information about science in signs related tools to the general public in keeping with that theme it'd to thank the sponsors of to day's podcast our first sponsor is athletic greens athletic greens is an all in one vitamin mineral robotic drink have been taking athletic greens since two thousand in twelve som delighted that their sponsoring the podcast the reason i started taking athletic greens and the reason i still take athletic greens once or twice a day is that t helps me cover all of my basic nutritional needs it makes up for any deficiencies that i might have in addition it has robotics which our vital for microfilm health have done a couple of episodes now on the called up microfilm and the ways in which the microfilm interacts with your man system with your brain to regulate mood and essentially with every biological system relevant to health throughout your brain and body without lentic greens it get the vitamins i need the minerals i need and the phobics to support my microfilm if you to triathlete greens you can go to athletic green stock come slash supermen and claim a special offer they'll give you five free travel packs plus a year supply of vitamin d three k too there are ton of stand ow showing that vitemand three is essential for various aspects of our brain and body health even i f for getting a lot of sunshine many of us are still deficient in item in d three and k too is also important because it regulates things car vascular function calcium in the body and on again go to athletic greenstone come slash supermen to claim the special offer of the five travel packs and the year supply of vitamin three k to to day's episode is also brought to us by element elements is an electrolyte drink that has everything you need and nothing you do not that means the exact rations of electrolytes are an element and those are sodium magnesium and potassium but it has no sugar we talk many times before on this podcast about the key roll of hydration and electrolytes for nerve sell function neuron function as well as the function of all the cells and all the tissues and organ systems of the body if we have sodium magnesium and potassium present in the properties all of those cells function properly and all our bodily system can be optimized if the electrolytes are not present and dehydration is low we simply cannot think as well as we would otherwise our mood is off hormone systems go off our ability to get into physical action to engage in endurance and strength and all sorts of other things is diminished with element you can make sure that your staying on top of your hydration and that you are getting the preparation of electrolytes if you would to try element you can go to drink element that is element doctor slash huberment and you get a free element sample pack with your purchase they are all delicious again if you want a try element you can go to element elements doom slash superman let us talk about how to optimize and indeed how to control your brain chemistry for sake of health and performance now in order to do that we all need to be on the same page about some basic facts some of those basic facts involve learning some basic biology i promise that even if you do not have a biology your chemistry background everything ism about to say should be accessible and clear to you the important thing to know is that your brain and your spinal cord and the rest of your called nervous system control all the organs of your body and that all the organs of your body feed back meaning they communicate through chemicals another means to your nervous system now your nervous system plays a particularly important roll in generating everything from sleep to wakefulness creativity stress calm et camera by way of a particular type of cell cell interaction and that is called synaptic communication what is scraped i communication well in order to understand that let us dial back ala bit further and try and understand for a moment what makes up your nervous system in its simplest form your nervous system is made of nerve cells that we call nurse neurons communicate with one another through chemicals they release certain chemicals that make other neurons more or less likely to be electrically active what do mean by electrically active we mean as it sounds electricity passing down through cells and then literally causing electricity in other cells the simplest way to think about this is maybe when you were a kid or may been s till now you would wear socks and you shuffle along the floor to generate some static electricity and you touch someone and you chock them with your finger ism younger brothers od occasionally do that to my sister id friends we do that to one another i know it is kind of silly an childish yet it illustrates the principle that we can generate electricity and pass electricity to other beings or in the case of neurons from one neuron to the necks the way neurons do that is that in between the neurons the little spaces those little spaces are called synapses and neurons literally vomit well they do not literally vomit but they release little packets of called transmitter chemical into that space we call a snaps it travels across the snaps it a matches to the cell on the other side the other neuron and then depending on what that chemical is it either makes that next neuron more electrically active or less electrically active called excitation it either excites the next neuron to be electrically active also or it inhibits it prevents the next neuron from being electrically active again very simply we have nerve cells that communicate with one another through electricity and chemicals that inspire that electricity and the little gaps between neurons are called synapses you can understand that ism certain you can make it through the rest of the episode and that you will get all the depth and important detail that you need to know but i want to go just a littlest further and explain that neurons do not just talk one to one there are trillions of neurons in your nervous system that allow you to be happy to be in love to be sad to be in grief to remember things and on and what you do at any moment what you feel in what you think relates to which called neural circuits are active a lot times we thing about brain areas and we have all seen these pictures of the brain where some one was in a ephemera scanner or they were in a brain skinner of some sort and they saw a picture of something and a certain are of the brain lights up as it is called that lighting up to the brain really reflects the activity of hundreds if not thousand may been millions of neurons in that region those images of brain areas lighting up and indeed talking out brain areas lighting up can be bit or allots leading because in fact no single brain area controls any one single perception or behavior or feeling state rather we have called neural circuits chains of neurons chains of specific neurons that is that create different states of mind that lead to specific behaviors that lead to specific emotional states and those neural circuits are made up of lots of different brain arms that light up in particular sequences and when i say laid light up scum me what i mean is that particular brain areas either excite or prevent the citation that is they inhibit other brain areas in a particular sequence much keys on a piano played in a particular sequence makes up a particular song particular brain areas activated or made client in a particular sequence leads to a particular behavior getting up out of a chair or a particular feeling state being particularly happy one day when you wake up or particularly depressed whether not that depression is caused by a life event or whether not it arises spontaneously we have neurons we have synapses and we have neural circuits and vitally important is the fact that which neural circuits are active and which neural circuits are likely to be less active at any given moment depends on two major categories of chemicals it depends on hormones and it depends on called neuralmodulator s now were mainly going to focus on neuromodulators to day because those are the things that if you can learn to control them and indeed there are tools to control them then you can control which neural circuits are more likely or less likely to be active in you at any given moment and in doing you con control whether or not you are going to be alert and focus or deeply asleep you con control whether or not you are going to be in a creative state or whether not you are going to be in a state of mind more fit for capable that is of doing focus work or math or more called linear types of work where there is a correct answer there is a specific thing to follow in your simply going to plug an chug as it were through a particular set of steps in order to accomplish something or for instance whether not you are going to be in an more relaxed in creative state where your thinking about new ideas or new ideas are just seem to be spontaneously coming to mind all of that can be controlled to a con miserable extent by leveraging these called neuromodulators what are neuromodulators neuromodulators or particular chemicals that make it likely that certain neural circuits will be active and not others and the four nuromodulators that were going to talk about to day that are of the utmost importance or your goals or dopamine epinephrin also called a adrenalin serotonin and a steal coming that is dooming epinephrin ceratonan and a set cling to day ism going to teach you how each of those different categories of demodulators work and the things that you can do to control those nauromodulators that is increase them or decrease them through behavioral tools and supplementation in ways that allow you to access the brain and body states that you want at the times that you want just very quickly i want to talk about how neuromodulators are able to work regardless of whether not its dopamine or ceratonan or epinephrin et camera there are many features of how nauromodulators work but for sake of to day's discussion we only need to focus on two of those features and those are fast acting features and longer slower features or what we call base line features what am i talking about when i say faster or base line well consider that at any given moment whether not your sleep or awake whether not its morning or afternoon or night you have some amount of dooming being released in your brain and body some amount of teratogen some amount of epinefran and some amount of a set coaling it is rarely if ever the case that you have zero dopamine or zero cratonent an often we hear about some one being dooming depended or these days you hear lot about that anyways or you will here that peoples ceratonan is bottom out in reality none of these nauromodultors ever dis a peer completely but they tend to be present at different levels or different relative levels another important thing to point out is that they do not work alone in fact as you will soon learn dopamine and epinephrin are close cousins that collaborate in terms of creating states of focus an motivation for instance or in creating states of energy and the pursuit of particular goals i say they're close cousins what i mean is that they tend to impact some of the same nerd circuits and believe it are not dopamine and epineferan are chemically related to i just tell you right now that epinephrin is actually derived from dopamine chemically epinepferan that is adrenaline is made from the molecule dopamine now dopamine and ceratonan can also work together to impact certain circuits in the brain but in large part they operate on separate circuits and a setocoline which you will soon learn is involved in states of focus and can actually open up can literally create states in the mind in which your brain is more plastic and able to change and learn more quickly well a see coming can do that on its own but rarely does it do it on its own more typically it gets a distance from some of the other neromodulators now that might seem it complicates the picture but it actually makes the picture far simpler because what we can say for sure is that the fast actions of dopamine ere the fast actions of epineferan ceretonan or a veto coming are actions that occur on the order of seconds or minutes or up to about an hour or where as the slower actions of those neuromodulators tend to occur on the order of hours days or even weeks now perhaps surprisingly it'd to focus on the slow actions of the neromodulators first because those slow actions of the neromodulators are happening in you and in me and in everyone right now and they set the backdrop the context in which the various tools to manipulate dopamine epineferan ceretonan or a retooling will work what do i mean by the context or the backdrop or the base line well it is fair to say that most people are awake during the daytime an a sleep at night i do realize that there are people who are going to be doing shift work or the raising young children or that might have a sick person at home that their tending to at camera or even insomnia their tending to them schedule of sleep and wakefulness will vary but in general everybody regardless of whether not your nocturnal or your call dirt on your watering the day pretty much everybody fallows a schedule in which from zero to nine hours after waking that is from the time you wake up until a bout nine hours later the neuromodulators dopamine and epinephrin tend to be at their highest s levels that they will be at any point in the twenty four hour period in any period of the day we can call this zero to nine hour period pase one of the days for simplicity and have referred to this before in a previous episode but not in this exact context from nine to about sixteen hours is what we will call pase two and that is when dopamine and epinephrin levels ten to subside a bit compared to the earlier pase one part of the day and serotonin levels start to increase and then pase three of the twenty for hour cycle which is from about and again about the zeroproximates from about seventeen hours after waking until about twenty four hours after waking is pase three of the day and during that time there is chaos in terms of which neuromodulators are most present in the brain and who chaos what i mean is that during sleep you have incredible peaks in the septal calling and drops in a septal calling you eve incredible peaks in dopamine and drops in dopamine you have incredible peaks and ceratonan and drops in creatine most often you are not going to see much if any release of epinephrin adrenalin and that is because epinephrin also called a adrenalin tends to wake us up and put us into action mode behaviors and that simply not happening during sleep but for the other three neuromodulators across the night it is sort of chaos you have got peaks and drops and peaks and drops in different comminations than you would ever see in wakefulness and this plays important rolls in dreaming in portent rolls in some of the reparative functions of sleep the point is that during that pase three the levels of neuromodulators are all over the place but it is not random it i say it is chaos but it is organize according to the specific reparative rolls of sleep the specific metabolic rolls of sleep et camera were not kin a focus too much on phase three to day because pase three of the twenty four hour cycle that seventeen to twenty four hour period is one in which you ought to be deeply asleep whether not you are nocturnal or diurnal right seventeen hours after waking you ought to be asleep and there are a lot of episodes of this podcast and indeed today i started talking out two particular studies related to sleep there a lot of tools to enhance sleep et camera and of course there are things that you can do in the late portion of phase two of the day in order to enhance your transition time into and depth of sleep but you cannot really do much during sleep you are not taken supplements your not doing breathing practice is there things to fall back asleep are not really doing much during sleep we are mainly going to focus on what we are calling pase one and pase to pase one being this dopamine epinephrin dominated phase of our day and pase two being this more era to heroic or ceratonan dominated portion of the day and then you might say what about a septal coming forgot about a seat c long well we did not forget about a setocalling a set coming is under control more in terms of what we happen to be doing at any given moment whether not were focusing or not focussing whether not were learning or not learning and here ism referring doaseto calling specifically in the contact of the brain and thinking because as some of you are probably shouting out there right if your exercise poor geologists or anything about how the brain controls movement a sedocoling is used at the nerve to muscle chaps right neurons do not just control other neurons electrically the way you are able to move in fact as because neurons are controlling the electric activity of muscles literally the contraction of muscle fires and that control is exerted through the release of a set calling ceitocoling is working at muscles as well but were not focused on that to day we are focussed on what we can do during phase one of the day and what we can do during phase too of the day to control the specific neuromodulators dopamine upon difference eretonan ain a set coming toward particular enrolls and as have been harping on for the last five er ten minutes or it is important to understand that in the early pase one part of the day again zerodonine hours dopamine an epineffran already dominate the nuromaltulator landscape that is they are already elevated and then they will taper coffin face too whereas in phase too of the day serotonin tends to dominate more than dopamine an epineferan and if you think about that what it means is that if your goal is to increase serotonin in order to get some particular effect on your mental performance or physical performance or health or if your goal is to increase your dopamine or epineferan to get some particular effect on your mental health physical performance et camera well then you need to consider what the back round level of dopamine or epineferan or seratonand happens to be because in doing you will know which tool to select and how hard you need to push on that tool right if your levels of dopamine are already riding pretty high because it is the early part of the day well then it does not take a whole lot more to get dopamine to a level in which it can for instance change your level of motivation whereas if you are in the late part of the day let us say eight or nine p m and you have a lot of serotonin swimming around in your system and you really need to be focused and alert well you can do that by leveraging the dopamine and epinefference system and indeed the aseity calling system too but you are going to have to resort to tools that can do that far more potently and that can do that in much more sustained way if you are going to access the state that you want again it is really important to understand what the back drop of these neuromodulators is the call base in and that they vary across the day if you are going to be able to leverage tools to optimize your brain chemistry any one that tells you do this protocol in order to increase your dopamine do this protocol take this supplement to increase your serotonin they can be telling you the absolute truth but if you do not consider the back drop over which that supplements or behavior is going to have its effect well then you cannot really predict the effect it will have but if you can understand these backdrop base line elements to have demodulators work we the you are naterific position to leverage the best tools in the immediate and short vermin that is on the order seconds minutes and hours before we dive in to the more pointed directed effects of specific tools on naromodulators like of just briefly mention hormones because they are also important for understanding the background and the context and these base line levels of naromodulators an here ism going to paint with a bit of a broad brush but what i will say is accurate even though it might not be exhaustive what i mean by that is everything i about to say is true but it does not cover every example in detail and nuanced possibility out there hormones have many different effects on the brain and body and not unlike demodulators some of those effects are very fast some of them are very slow in fact certain hormones for instance the steroid hormones estrogen and testosterone and corticosterones and here of course ism referring to the steroid hormones for what they are they are indeed steroid hormones but ism not talking about steroids that people inject for sports performance or for physical augmentation on talking bout these steroid hormones that you make naturally because indeed you make these naturally well the steroid hormones can actually control gene expression they can change the identity of cells and the genes and prolines that smells express this is why during puberty for instance testosterone an estrogen are released into the body growthhormona's released into the body and bodies and voices and personalities and brains change tremendously because literally there is a transformation of the best tissue of the testicular tissue of the ovarian tissue of the bones of the muscles of the tissues and a cells that control hair growth gene expression changes in all those cell types and the child becomes an adolescent becomes a young adult i that is what puberty really is in fact puberty is perhaps the most dramatic transformation that we go through and our entire lifespan in terms of our agentcause indeed it reflects a very rapid i should mention period of agent and transformation of the identity of cells steroid hormones and other hormones can have very slow long lasting actions in that way they can also have very fast actions for instance a adrenalin epinephrin release from the adrenal glands can immediately make your art beat faster can immediately change the circumference of up blood vessels and arteries and capillaries and change the way blood flows it can change the way you see the world literally it does change the way you see the world through your visual system and that all happens on the order of hundreds of millisecond or seconds es are extremely fast actions corticosteroid also can have fast actions and slow actions but since this is not a discussion about hormones person and we have done entire episodes the optimize testosterone an estrogen episode you can fine that at superman lapdog calm or the interview with the incredibly knowledgeable and clear and really wonderful a tumor of actionable information doctor calculate who is also on this pockets you can learn a lot about hormones there today we want to think about hormones as they relate to these neromodulators the dooming ceratonan epineferan and a sit coming and in general testosterone tends to collaborate with and increase the action of dopamine that is not always the case but in general when testosterone goes up dopamine goes up and sometimes even viceversa when dopamine goes up testoceran go up and this is true for both males and for females in general when corticosterones coatis all and some related steroid hormones increase epineferan levels go up and in general when hormones ox token or prolactin are increased levels of ceritonan go up we cannot draw direct link between any one hormone system and a said coming aside coming consists off in a category of its own in that way but again in general testosterone and doom intend to collaborate in the same direction coatis all and epinefran tend to collaborate in the same direction oxytocin and prolactin which are hormones and ceratonan tend to collaborate in the same direction and then we have poorly lonely acitocoling off on its own but it is not poor and lonely it actually has incredibly potent effects on its own it is really that it just does not mean much help from the hormone systems or least not the steroid hormone systems in order to have its tremendous effects now lot of what people think about and will do when trying to improve mental health and physical health is they will try and increase or decrease certain categories of hormones of the sort that i mention testosteronesterogen noxitosin prolactin o but oftentimes the effects of those manipulations in hormones that are going to be most salient are not going to be due to the direct effects of those hormones sometimes it could be but oftentimes it is going to be due to their effects on the brain and nervous system by way of how those hormones impact neromodulators for instance there are various things that people can do both men and women to increase their testosterone and estrogen in the appropriate ratios a talked about one such a pro oh previous episode and that is to get sunlight on to a large portion of one skin each day believe are not this actually works and it works because your skin is actually an endocrine organ a hormone secreting organ the beautiful study give covered in on this pod was before we will provide a link to the study again but it had people spend at least twenty minutes or closer to thirty minutes each day tiny maximize sunlight exposure to as much of their skin as they could in terms of still maintaining decent exposure meaning not over exposing themselves in a cultural way meaning wearing enough clothes that they were decent but still getting a lot of sun exposure coupletimes per week or more what they found was that people's testosterone and estrogen levels went up feelings of well being went up feelings of well where i should say increases in libido were observed as well the subjectively reported more passion et camera testosterone and estrogen did indeed both go up and again i want a highlight that increases in estrogen nocuous testosterone are related to increases in libido in both men and women is why you never want a crusher estrogen down to zero whether not your male or female if you want to maintain some sort of healthy libido and general feelings of well being unrelated to libido well many of those effects we know are not due to direct effects of testosterone and estrogen but rather are due to the effects of testosterone and estrogen on the neuromodulators dopamine and ceratonan because much of lead and feelings of well being and feelings of relaxation but also desire motivation et camera originate because of the activation of neural circuits that dopamine controls and promotes and that ceratonan promote and control this is very important understand as we move toward more specific discussion of the chemicals that we call neuromodulators because hormones are controlling those neuromodulators in a very slow modulatory way yes i said it hormones modulate neuromodulators sort of said it twice on purpose and this is a dramatic and potent effect o just give you one more example the hormone prolactin tends to be antagonistic it tends to reduce amounts of dopominor were at least when prolactin levels are high dopamine levels tend to be lower you observe this after the birth of a new chile you observe this post bodily after mating in all species humans and animals when prolactin is elevated ceratonintends to be elevated and when prolactin is elevated levels of dopamine and the effects of dopamine tend to subside now as i move toward explaining what each of the four categories of demodulators do this will start to make more or more sense as to why this would be i we say i was not consulted design phase meaning i did design these circuits and if any one tells you that they did you should back away quickly because none of us design the circuisisis the way that evolution and nature created these systems and they tend to work in a bit of a seesaw fashion prolactin up dopamine down right a dopamine up prolactin down in general that is the way they work if we are to take a look at how each of these neuromodulator systems functions on its own while understanding that they never truly function on their own we can start to really make sense of the landscape of tools that are available to us and which tools are going to be most powerful to select if our goal is for instance to be focus or if our goal is to be less dressed or if our goal is to be highly motivated and highly focused for sake of learning all of that is indeed possible if you understand these for neuromodulators and you understand that while there are many tools ranging from parmicollogic to behavioral that can tap into these normodulator systems them press on the gas of dopamine pull back on ceratonan and on but that there are particular tools both behavioral and supplementation base in to some extent prescription drug base to and will touch on a few of those if you understand that and why they work well then you can create a sort of kit a grab bag of things that you can use in any contacted i should say that you can look to depending on the contexture and create the states of body an mind that you want now once again painting with a somewhat broad brush but none the less inaccurate brush we can say that dopamine when elevated above base line tends to increase states of motivation both mental and physical motivation drive and to some extent focus have said it many times before and it'll say it again there is a lot of misconception about dopamine many people out there think that dopamine is all about pleasure you hereabout dopamine hits or people chasing dopamine or the need to have a dopamine fast et camera dopamine is not about pleasure dopamine is about motivation craving and pursuit for goals or for things that are outside ore immediate possession and experience the motivation and pursuit of a mate the motivation and pursuit tomato the motivation and pursuit of food the motivation and pursuit of a career goal et camera et camera things we do not yet have but that we want and we get into or t of a forward center of mass and a pursuit of and that pursuit can be physical that pursuit can be cognitive it can be both connive and physical and it can involve talking about something right because in some professions pursuit of things involves talking i think about lawyers they talk a lot in pursuit of winning cases and money et camera putting people in jail or keeping people out of jail et camera that is done with their mouths not with their bodies athletes in a state of motivated training or in motivated competition use their bodies call this is obvious of course but perhaps what is not obvious is that one molecule not working alone but predominantly one molecule dopamine is responsible for all of those motivated states which again underscores the power of these demodulators to dopamine we can think of lease in the contacts of to day's discussion as controlling and indeed promoting motivation drive and pursuit and to some extent focus epineferan and a closely related molecule called nor epinefran and again i want to emphasize that epinefran is a adrenaline and a adrenaline is epineferan nor epineferan is nor adrenaline and nor adrenaline is nor epinefran but today we are going to just simply talk about epinefran and nor epineferan that category of demodulator is mainly responsible for generating our energy our level of fuel and base line level of forward center of mass as i to call it you can also think of it is how higher or p m are now we are not an car and the chronology sort of falls apart as we go further into the biology but it is a decent one for now when epinefran levels are high we tend to feel agitated we tend to feel we want to move we tend to feel we cannot shut down our thinking and ore anticipation of what is can happen need and when epinefran levels are very very low we a she have less physical energy we tend to have less mental energy in terms of generating thoughts very quickly and on and forth and as i mention before dopamine and epinefran are closely related much that we know for a fact that epinefrn is actually manufactured from the molecule dopamine that is why am talking about these two demodulators and very close trucks to position because they do indeed collaborate with one another but forsake of to day's discussion we can just think of epineferanes increasing energy a adrenaline increases energy in our state of readiness it also i should mention activates our immune system contrary to popular belief that stress in habits armies system epinefran is deployed its released at great levels in our brain and body when we are stressed and that actually protects us against infections of multiple kinds at least in the short term that and all the details of that and tools related to that we are covered in our episode on the immune system if you want a check that out now the nurmodulator ceratonan creates a number of different states in the brain and body but forsake of to day's discussion we are going to think about the predominant states that it creates and those are states of contentedness being happy feeling fairly relaxed feeling soothed end twosome extend even some relief from pain or lack of pain certonan is associate with ha feeling of satiety of having enough of what we already have now when certonan is very very high people can even be sedate they can be completely motivated no motivation to seek out things food or secs or work et camera whereas when certonan levels are very low people can actually exhibit agitation and high levels of stress the levels matter here but again for sake of to day's conversation when we leverage ceratonan where are really leveraging and neuromodulator that tends to increase the activity of neral circuits in the brain and body that make us feel relaxed and happy and it tends to decrease the activity of neural circuits that make us rabidly in pursuit of things that we do not have right the opposite of content and sated is motivation desire and hunger and thirst for things that we do not have ceratonan is the molecule of peace it is the molecule of contentedness it is the molecule of having enough at least for the time being or the feeling that we have enough for the time being now acedocoling is a fourth category of neurumodulator that as i mention earlier is somewhat not totally but somewhat distinct from any direct control by the major hormone systems of the body or t least the major steroid or one systems an acedocling we can say is mainly a located with states of focus and we can go a step further and say that its mainly associated with steps of focus as they relate to learning and encoding new information called negro plasticity now negro plasticity or the brainpan nervous systemsibility to change in response to experience can be impacted by an enormous number of different chemicals not just a redo coming but used cling has a particularly potent ability to open up the thing that we call nerd plasticity to allow plasticity to happen in one moment whereas in a previous moment it could not occur because the redo coming had not been released in the brain or in the spinal court asedocoling is evolved in focus and in learning but it is not necessarily always associated with learning in the context of highly motivated really ramped up states it can be but a cedocoling can also be released and can encourage the learning and nerd plasticity associated with calm states for instance if somebody has a new born child we know that they are flooded with oxytocin which has actually even been called the love hormones tho it does many things in addition to control feelings of romantic attachment and attachment to children et camera does all of that but it does a lot more as well but when people have a new child they also tend to be hop re focused on that child not just its well being but they narrow all their thinking all their vision all their hearing to that child and their obvious adapt of reasons for wanting to do that i recall a family dinner we had goshthis was over ten years ago we had a couple over they were y moment was in the habit of inviting people over who didn't have places to go on the holidays possess just who she is an i thins quite nice he brought over this couple they had a new born thinthis babysat been morn may be two or three weeks before and it was seeded are not seeded it was lying down it could not see this a potato bug barely holds head up but it was lying in a little bassinet on the floor as we ate dinner and it was almost here it actually was hilarious we laughed about about this that the entire meal they were basically staring at this baby they were clearly in love with the baby and flooded with ox toxin and also prolactin that they could not take their focus off this baby it was as she really wonderful and endearing to see but in addition to that it'd be willing to bet had i been able to do a la bit of microanalysis which is a ability to measure the amounts of a nor normagelator to given location the brain had i been able to do that experiment on them in that moment i would have found that levels of a seat calling were exceedingly high because they were hyper focus on this child not just in love with but focus on that child and without a doubt the nerd circuits related to focus and plasticity were heavily engaged again for obvious adaptor reasons related to child rearing in learning the cousin cries and pain signals and pleasure signals of one's offspring we have dopamine associate with motivation drive and pursuit and to some extent focus we have epineferan and norponeferan associate with energy of having a forward center of mass mentally and or physically we have serotonin which is associated with they peaceful content saved state of being and we have a septa culling which is associate with focus and in particular focus as it relates to learning and encoding new information lit a you want to be more motivated you want to be more in pursuit of goals and you want to have more energy and to be more focus they are many ways to go about that in fact there is a near infinite cloud of opportunities everything from prescription drugs to elicit drugs which i certainly do not recommend supplements nutrrician you listen to particular music you can do all sorts of cognitive behavioral nutritional supplementation tricks or you can just understand that what you are really after are increases in dopamine above base line that you control and there areaways to control them that are quite potent and science tells us which tools are going to be the most potent and the most versatile for you me gan a share those tools with you now with the caviar that each one of the one tools could be its own entire podcast episode ad that we have done it near entire episodes on each of these tools are small collections of these tools some can to cover these and somewhat superficial manner we can provide links to previous episodes that relate to each of these tools in detail but it'll give you enough detail about them that would allow you to incorporate them into your routine should you choose let say you not increase dopamine forsake of increasing motivation the first thing to do is to understand what the natural behavioral tools off for increasing dopamine and to do those as consistently as possible again these are tools that you will want to do nearly every day if not every day and i know ism sounding a broken record on the one but here again we come to sunlight and i should say not just the desire too but really the need for viewing the maximum amount of sunlight that one can reasonably get given schedule and locations in the world time of your et camera in the early part of the day within the first hour of waking ideally but certainly in the first three hours of your day you going to want to maximize sunlight exposure to your eyes never look at the sun or any other light bright that it is painful to look at an less of course blinking is fined but know take sunglasses off go outside once the sun is out and get some natural light in your eyes and if it is appropriate or i should say in ay way that is appropriate maximize the amount of sunlight exposure to your skin but please do not get burned please do where sun screen if your prone to getting burned typically early day sunlight is not going to burn you at least not most people unless your extremely fair kind do not get burn do what you need to in order to protect yourself from burned there is some emerging controversy about sunscreen and which ones are safe in which ones are not safe we have not done an episode on that yet but i find it to be an important and interesting topic daryarose doctor dirty arose i should say has a podcaskall the maria rose podcast and did an episode all about sunscreens which are safe which are not safe by interviewing an expert on that i refer you to that podcascess or relates to sunscreen but gets see natural light exposure in your eyes and if you wake up before the sun comes out turn on as many bright lights inside as you c turn on reasonably given your electric bill et camera get a lot of bright sunlight exposure early in the day and get a lot of sunlight exposure to your skin in the early part of the they in a way that does not burn you meaning burn your skin or blind you please please do not anything that harms your vision stared into bright light that is painful what is that do well it sets in motion a number of differ biological cascade summary very fast there are fast actions of sunlight that will trigger for instance dopamine release from different parts of your brain and your indicant system and we now know that it increases levels of genes related to third hormone and actually increases certain dopamine receptors there's a wonderful paper we will provide a link to this paper that shows that sunlight exposure can act ally increase the amount of called d r d four this is a particular type of dopamine receptor that doping receptor for the genes for dopamine receptor for are actually under photic control if you get sunlight exposure to your eyes and it does have to be to your eyes in the early part of the day you increase the amount of dopamine receptor that you have which allows whatever circulating dopamine happens to be there to have a greater effect on motivation and i should say also on mood and feelings of being in pursuit and generally in craving and pursuit of things in life now there is another way to increase the effect of whatever dopamine happens to be circulating in your brain and body and this again relates to increasing the number or the efficacy of the receptors for dopamine now here were not talk am out the dopamine receptor for but a different category dopamine receptors the d two and d three receptors which are expressed sultrily places in your brain and body and bind dopamine meaning dopamine parks in them a parking spot and allows dopamine to generally increase the activity of the neurons and cells that express those dopamine receptors how do you do that well turns out that regular ingestion of affine at safe and appropriate levels about a hundred to two under fifty milligrams is going to increase the number of d two and three dopamine receptors i talk to obit about this on a previous episode and will provide lines to the studies but this is an important finding i believe because this is not about the acute the immediate effects of affine on alertness although those occur to when you drink affine it is going to increase your levels of a adrenaline and called epinefran which will increase your energy levels it is going to decrease levels of something all the denizens which builds up while your sleepy it is going to make you feel less sleepy more alert more energetic that sort of obvious but what is less obvious is that it is increasing the number and efficacy of dopamine receptors that whatever dopamine happens to be around in your system is going to have more of a potent effect how much affine should you drink that icon a very from person a person some people are very sensitive to affine others are not i tend to be fairly insensitive to affine cause have been drinking it for hong period of time but after one or two cups of espresso or coffee i feel have had enough i tend to drink my affine early in the day which is what ism going to recommend that you do not drinking affine pass two in certainly not four p m if you are on a typical sketch on you one to be able to sleep that night even if you can fall asleep having too much affine in your system is not good because it destructs the architecture of sleep and now knowing about all the metabolic variability across the night according to different stages of sleep it should be even more obvious as to why destructing the architecture of sleep will be bad for you limit that affine and take to early in the day and do not moralistic if you are not certainly noncablistic in any case but for most people anywhere from one hundred of four hundred milligrams of affine is going to have this effect and this effect again is a slow accumulating effect by drinking faffing consistently day to day i get my affine mainly from carbamate t i w one emphasized that nobly good ideas stay away from the smoked mates there some evidence those can be cars agonic but i brew own bromate the or sometimes it'll drink coffee or spressover sometimes both frankly as all ism hydrating enofgten am getting a salt than i tend to feel fond without much canine the other way to increase dopamine and to make sure that your baseline levels of dopamine are high enough is to make sure that your eating sufficient numbers of tracing rich foods you can look up which foods include tracing trained a precursor to dopamine its in monoacid that is direct pathway to dopamine synthesis an tracing foods include things certain meats paragon cheese very high in train for instance in fact there something called the cheese effect believe it ore not i doftwant to go too far off topic but the cheese effect is kind of interesting because certain people will take anti depressence that are called m a o inhibitors monocline oxidate in hitters any time you hear a s that is an enzyme they will take these in hitters that prevent the break down of dopamine and other can catacolamines which allow more dopamine to be circulation but if these people eat certain cheeses including parson cheese and there are other foods of course that include focus tracing but one of these derivatives of train called it examine that generates what miscalled the cheese office which is people get potent my grains headaches blood pressure goes up why well because they have got a lot of tracing in their system and dopamine in their system and they have got less of the engine that removes that dopamine or limits its action and they have an excess of dopamine and dopamine has effects on blood pressure et camera the cheese effect of something to avoid if you are somebody who is taking drugs that taping to or manipulate the dopamine pathway other for parkinsons or depressions ovuseeour going to on to be careful about adjusting up or down levels of dopamine to potently mind the cheese effect if your taking in may o inhibiter slot of information about this on line for most people eating foods paragon cheese eating foods a certain meats and certain vegetables also can increase tracing levels which will increase dopamine synthesis these are ways of modulating more less the base line of dopamine that you are able to produce in the ways that dopamine can have its action by way of binding to receptors more potently now there are other ways to increase dopamine in a more acute or directed way ways to spike your dopamine to enhance your state of motivation mood focus and on and in thinking about the vast landscape of tools that can do that we have one category of tools which are the really really bad things that i do not recommend anybody do in fact i recommend nobody do ever which are things cocaine methemptamine et camera they are incredibly destructive for lives because of the way that they sopotenli increase dopamine and than the fashion dopamine that occurs later am in they can indeed an often do ruin lives re lea in those off the table there are of course prescription drugs that many people in especially people who have clinically diagnose eighty they attention deposit hyperactivity disorder rely on and in fact benefit from in many cases things riding after all giants nowadays there is also a lot of interest in use of things modaphanel armodaphanel i covered all of those in the epic some on eighty eight and you can find that human labor come in the other places this podcasser is found prescription drugs aside because they require a prescription and a discussion that in depth an appropriate with your physician shelter provider there are supplements that can very potently increased dopamine as well perhaps not to the extent that some of those other prescription drugs can but certainly to a degree that will impact and increase dopamine and motivation and the the states dopamines associate with and the two main categories of supplements that are very effective in raising dopamine and here i should provide the soviet that any time you are going to add or remove anything from mere supplementation protocols please talctophysician who is knowledgeable on these topics your somebody who has or is taking drugs for depression romania please be very cautious about manipulating your dopamine in any case i do not just say that to protect us i say that to protect you but if we to look at the supplement landscape and ask which supplements increase dopamine there are a vast number of them but the three main ones the most effective ones that are readily available out there without a prescription are macunapurines this is actually the outside of a velvety being that has been extracted and put into a supplement macunapurines is actual el dopa it is ninety nine percent el dopa which is a prescription drug that is given for parkensins and for other purposes where increasing dopamine is important i do not recommend macho purines ism not saying that no one should take it but i do not take it and i do not recommend it because it tends to potently and acutely increase dopamine that there's a presubstantial crash afterwards i avoid it and i do not generally suggest that any one take it unless there is really a clinical need or they are working very closely with somebody that can really monster that the other two supplements that can increased dopamine in a short term way but in a significant way a el tyrosines you can buy that as a supplement monoacid i sometimes take this i would say i probably take it about once a week maximum for workouts or work outs it'll take it in dosages of anywhere from five hundred milligrams to a thousand milligrams people very tremendously in their sensitivity to supplementing eltyrasine i know people that can take two grams i know people that can barely take a hundred milligrams an no people that the bestrode for them is zeromeligram there is a lot of variation there depending on sensitivity and their natural baseline levels of dopamine and whether not the doing a lot of other things to support dopamine but none the less taking eltirasene will lead to fairly substantial increases in dopamine within about fifteen to forty five minutes and t last for about thirty minutes to two hours and then the is kind of a tape pouring off some people experience a little bit of an emotional or candor i should say energetic crash some people do not than the other supplement that i certainly use and that i now number of other people uses more fast acting but more potent which is final methylamine this relates to the called p e a molecule p p e a and final methylamine increases dopamine and some metabolites related to dopamine in ways that really increase energy and feelings o well being in motivation and again its fast acting some my particular photo call the one i use is it'll take final methylamine at doses of about three hundred to six hundred telegrams along with some eltyrocine or it'll take it on its own with acute or i should say compound that will talk about a lib it later as it relates to a seat calling alpha p c but tyrosine and final ethlaming taken alone or together will make you feel more motivated and more alert more willing and able to lean into particular mote of to behaviors whether not their physical or cognitive if you to learn more about these compounds and their supplementation and their effects incurve you to check out the ever valuable website examine to cam its zero cost to access hand they provide references and some more details about these sorts of compounds and other related compounds now if we are going to look at behavioral tools for potently increasing dopamine that too is a vast landscape and we know based on hundreds if not thousands of studies that things winning at some sort of competition or succeeding in reaching a goal can certainly increase dopamine we talk a lot about this in the episode on dopamine motivation and drive but leaving that aside there are certain behavioral protocols that are unrelated to your over all goals and motivations that can increased dooming in a very sustained way and without question the most potent behavioral tool for doing that is going to be deliberate cold exposure a deliberate cold exposure has been talked about a lot here and elsewhere in terms of its ability to do things produce information as a way to test and improve razilients because uncomfortable cold a provided its applied safely is a great way to learn to be more resilient because your essentially staying or forcing yourself to stay in a circumstance were your system is flooded with a adrenaline but one lesser known aspect of deliberate cold exposure is one that is been demonstrated quite convincingly in humans comes from a study publishing the our two thousand a link to the study i love this study by the way covered it many times on this pod cast because they love it much and i think its truly important and that is the study from petrolic at all entitled human physiological responses to immersion into water of different temperatures i not con to going to this into a ton of detail for sake of time but base all what they show is that putting people into cold water and i shall mention that water that they use in the study was not that cold they hare to much o different conditions but they had people that got into for instance sixty degree farenheite water for up to two hours and them sitting there a tell on share up to their neck had very long sustained increases in dopamine transmission and dopamine circulation in their brain and body in also some of the other catacolamines s a mention before dopamine tents to collaborate with epinfron and vice verse now you do not need to put yourself into sixty degree farenheite water to get these kind of sustained increases and you certainly do not need to do it for two hours we have strong reason to believe based on subsequent studies in fact publishes this last year that getting into much colder water of say fifty degrees or fifty five degrees or even forty five degrees ferenheit can potently increase dopamine and epineferon as well and tat you do not need to expose yourself to that cold water for nearly as long perhaps even as short as one minute or even thirty seconds exposure to really cold water can lead to these potent longlasting increases in dopamine many people will ask which protocols to follow for instance will a cold shower suffice very likely yes if your shower gets cold enough do you need ice floating in the bath no it is all about the temperature not whether others ice present or not how long to stay in there there are a lot of details that we do not have time to go into this episode plea see the episode on the use of deliberate cold for health and performance you will find that superman labor come we have a news letter related to this it gets into a lot of detailed protocols but in general we can say that the way to evoke dopamine and upon opera release using cold water is to ideally you would do cold water immersion if you cannot you use cold shower but you want to use a temperature that is safe meaning you are not can have a hard attack but that is uncomfortable such that you really want to get out and then staying in for anywhere from one minute to ten minutes depending on how cold adapted you are and then getting out and drying off and going about your day unless you have some other protocol the your trying to extract from the cold this is a cold exposure protocol specifically aimed at increasing dopamine for some people out there you might think this kind of silly using cold water increase dopamine but when you look at the date o inhuman on the effect of cold water exposure to stimulate long lasting very significant increases in dopamine and epinefron i think you will agree that this is a really potent tool that provided its given safely and gone about safely is giving you the kinds of increases in dopamine that you would seek seen prescription farmocology now should be use as a replacement for prescription pharmacology although people have done that to success one of the previous guess on the humeral labpodcast who is doctor onalempki are director of the dull diagnosis addiction clinical stamford this in amazing book called dopamine nation all about dopamine and both its uses healthy and its per old in things addiction and she describes a patient of hers that use deliberate cold exposure to try and maintain dopamine levels while coming off of drugs that were increasing dopamine sopoteli that they were putting him down the path of addiction the use of cold water for increasing dopamine is a real tool it is i would say a power tool in fact it is the kind of thing that if you want increase dopamine for sake of motivation it might be your first go too provided your also doing the things to maintain dopamine base line sunlight exposure in particular making sure your getting sufficient amounts of tyrosine containing foods and on and now just very briefly you on a point to a few quick tools that good pure o view data tell us can be leverage in order to make sure that you half sufficient dopamine when you want it or that it is available for it to be released by any number of the tools have provided thus far and those are sufficient number of be vitamins it turns out that be vitamins in particular be six or vitamin be six can potently reduce prolactin levels and again prolactin in dopamine ten to work in wont of pushball fashion that said you should be cautious about taking excessive levels of be six it is advisement that if you take too much you will likely excrete it through your urine but there is evidence that having excessively high levels of be six or supplementing with excessively high levels of be six can cause some peripheral neuropathy some death of nerves in the pith periphery you want to know what dosage levels are relevant there tot simply look at up on line there is a lot of information about this but you do not to make sure they're getting enough be six be twelve et camera such that you can keep prolactin levels in check and if you suspect that you have a dopamine deficiency please talk your doctor an talk to them about ways you might adjust that prolactin down and thereby dopamine up the other way to in sure that dopamine levels stay high or put differently that you do not quash whatever dopamine you have in your system is to really avoid bright light exposure to your eyes between the hours of ten p m and form or another way putting this because i realize people sleep at different times et camera is to avoid bright light exposure to your eyes not just blue light but all colors of light in face three that is seventeen to twenty four hours after waking up because that is really when you should be asleep or trying to get asleep if you are having troubles sleeping work from summer hour's lab the director of the chronology unit the national institutes a mental health again an i previous hubris lab podcast guest tell us that bright light exposure in face three of your circadian cycle seventeen to twenty four hours after waking can have dramatic effects in reducing dopamine levels by way of activating in curl circuit in solving on the call the habenula when a get into too many details right now but really trying keep the lights dim in the mill the night or off if you can do that safely to really going to help if your turning on your phone brightly if you are to sting on bright lights it is not just going to negatively impact melatonin the form on the helps you fall in stay asleep it is also going to negative told impact dopamine levels not just that night but the subsequent day that more or less summaries our coverage of ways to use behavior and supplementation and nutrition to increase dopamine and dopamine receptor efficacy an number and to keep sufficient amounts of dopamine in your system day to day for motivation mood and focus and of course keep in mind those things that can suppressdopaming the bright light exposure elevated prolactin and on my hope is that by understanding those tools and how they work and understanding that dopamine does certain things and not others that you can assemble a versatile kit of behaviors and other things that you can do in order to adjust your dopamean levels according to your particular goals i want a just briefly return to the fact however that all of that is riding on that face one face to background meaning it is probably gin to take less cold water exposure i should say less time doing cold water exposure early in the day to get a big increase in dopamine than it would later in the day because later in the day your baseline levels of dopamine are lower you have got more stone and circulating that should make sense to you now as to why that is the case and does that mean that you should really modify your protocols dramatically probably not but you might keep that in mind that if for instance you need to be in a highly moon ate focus state in the late part of the day for whatever reason it might take a few or more of these tools in commination in order to accomplish that were as if your somebody who feels pretty good during the day but your kind of lacking motivation you want increase dopamine levels an you do not yet need to or want to resort to prescription drugs or supplementation for then you might layer in a couple behavior of protocols paying attention to of course the things that you might be doing that would also potentially suppressed dopamine again that kit of tools is design for you to play with if you choose of its safe for you to apply them than do that consider doing them individually not thing to hit all the tools all at once right i mean to why throw all those tools at your dopamine system at once better would be to have those tools in your kit and be able to deploy them depending on whether not your own travel whether not your eating well or less well whether it your sleeping well or less well that is highly individual and i to think that in having those tools in hand you will be able to adjust them and apply them in the ways that allow you to access the dopamine increases that you are after next it'd to talk about epinefran also called adrenaline when a point out that epineferon is released both in the brain and the body in fact there is a barrier between brain and body that prevents the epinephrin that is release from your renal glands crossing the blood brain barrier your brain has a separate sight called the locus sedulous this is a collection of neurons in the back of the brain that cold of sprinkler the rest of the brain with epineferan and essentially wake sup whatever neral circuits happen to see or i should say a wake up any circuits were that epineferan happens to arrive and generally increase the excitability of those networks that is why we say epineferan increases energy ism not stalking about colonic energy although that is distantly related to this but really energy and the desire to move the feeling that we can think the feeling that we can be alert in fact if you look at somebody in their eyelids are wide open in large part that is because of a lot of a adrenaline in their system if their pupils are really big and their eyes are really wide open in general that means they have a lot of epineferan circulating there whereas when we are tired and we are kind of hooded and words ore f sleepy or a pupils are really small in general that is because levels of epineferan and also doyenne remember they work together levels of epinephrin and opening tend to be lower this is also why when people take any drug again not recommending this amphetamine or cocaine or any stimulant their pupils tend to huge there eyes tend to be wide open they do not blink very often and the opposites true when people take sedatives it alarms to make sense when you think about the basic actions of these things for many people increasing a adrenaline or epineferan might seem a crazy idea most people probably associate this smallecule with stress and they it would to be lesstressed and we have done entire episodes about stress how to master stress how to lever stress how to concern stress or lot of great tools to do that that a behavioral supplementation based pile see the episode on mastering stress for those tools but there are people including me that want to increase our levels of epinefran at least early in the day ism somebody wakes up rather slowly in fact right after waking out i rarely one abounds out of bed i try and push myself to do that ism always impressed by these a chock willing types that are up at for thirty or up at five and already into action i tend to be kind of thinking about thinking about maybe being in action early in the day but i try and push myself to get into action which itself can increase epineferan i should mention that any physical activity any physical activity walking running weight lifting swimming even talking for that matter is going to increase levels of epineferan locus ceruminous is a brain structure that is tightly coupled with behaviors in a by directionality that is when you are in action you increase the amount of epinephrin release from locus rules you wake up the brain and conversely when locus ceruminous is active the brain wakes up it is reciprocal it goes both directions i she funny treat actually earlier to day it was something going to the him gives you energy but you need energy to go to the him sounds a pyramid scheme to me which made me chuckle but of course overlooks the fact that indeed if you have energy you are more likely to be willing to get into physical movement or count of movement and thinking hard or thinking a lot about something but also it is absolutely scientifically proven that being in action increases levels of epinefran this is why exercising early in the day gives you more energy for rest of day you still might experience a lot bit of a crash in the afternoon spuchil if you are getting out extra early or if you are drinking caffeine too close to waking have talked about this before if you drink too much caffeine close to waking you are going to have an afternoon crash better to push that caffeine in take out about ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking i know this is really painful for certain people but caffeine does increase epinefran caffeine does other things to limit sleepiness and by pushing out ninety to a hundred twenty minutes after waking you will avoid the afternoon crash to a large degree and if you get up and you exercise or even do any movement of any kind a hundred jumping jacks or a walk if you cannot do that anything that will increase the total amount of epinefran that you secrete into your blood stream and in your brain and will get you more energy notjust in that moment but throughout the day keep that in mind exercise does indeed give you energy it burns colonic energy but it gives you curl energy by way of increasing epineffran transmission from locusts sedulous and presumably if the exercises intense enough a adrenaline epineffran release from the adrenals within your body as well we have exercise and we have caffeine as potent tools for increasing epinefferan and thereby energy another potent tool that is purely behavioral but is known to work based on excellent studies in humans and actually my laboratory has been doing similar types of studies that are soon to be published we hope is call picnic hype ventilation some of you may be familiar with whimhoff breathing there is also two me breathing which is very similar condoling breathing all of those stiles of breathing involve picnic my pereventilation deep inhale and either passive emails or active emails but repeating inhale exam angel exam in a very deep in repetitive way if you were to do that right now does not matter if you do it through your nose or mouth although i deal you would do the inhaul through your nose and the exile throughout mouth if you did that for twenty five repetitions twenty five inhale and emails you would feel more alert you would also feel more warm why because you increased epinefran a adrenaline release in the brain and body it works the first time and it works every time to increase epinefran and thereby energy and in fact there are protocols and great scientific studies of using syclicype ventilation for periods of minutes if not longer where for instance you would do twenty five big inhale an emails followed by brief breathhold with your longs empty than repeat twenty five than brief breath hold excuse me exhale hold your lungs empty and then repeat again for a third round if you if you do that over and over you are going to be very alert you can have more energy going to feel you want to move around a lot more in fact you might even feel agitate it people with a lot of anxiety or pronopanic attack might want o be cautious an how they train and embark on that type of breathing might want approach it a little more carefully or avoided altogether but for most people syckliciperoventilation is simply going to get you more energized and feeling you want to move feeling you can think more clearly and you will be more wide eyed and alert because you are releasing a adrenalin and the cold water exposure photo call that i talked about earlier and that is covered in our episode on cold and in the news letter on cold well that as i mention early are potently increases dopamine but also epineferane that is another terrific tool whether or not its applied by cold shower or cold immersion or some other thing crib that is going to make you more alert because it releases a adrenalin now we cannot really say that there are foods to increase epineferan rather there are foods that include a lot of pyridine that will increase dopamine and remember dopamine is the molecule from which epineferan is synthesized we cannot really point to a particular food or categories of food for increasing epinefran i think affine and things it will increase epinefran there are of course prescription drugs that will increase epinefran and of course there are all sorts of called bate blockers that will block the receptors for epineferan to make you feel calm for public speaking or for various heart conditions et camera that is really the domain of physicians and should really be worked out with your cardiologists with a physician et camera i think the tools of exercise and should you want very potent increases in a adrenalin his intensity exercise as well as the tools of affine syckliccoperoventilation and deliberate cold exposure really combine to give you a nice little kit at is a versatile kit of ways to increase upinefrn for sake of having more physical and mental energy next is the nauromodulator assets calling and as i mentioned earlier assets coming is associated with states of focus and no states of focus can be high energy states of focus the ones that are accompanied by high levels of dopamine an epineferan and were were really excited about and really layered in on something or they can be the calmer or more relaxed states of focus reading a book or practising music or listening very carefully to somebody in a way that is relaxed and calm and yet none the less where we have a narrow cognitive and typically a narrow visual aperture and typically also a narrow auditory aperture that is are auditory system an our visual system and our thinking can be very broad it can be all over the place or it can be very narrow and it can be very focused a sendal calling is released from too majorities in the brain nuclease psalms which is in the forebrain and extends connections out to many different brain areas to offer the opportunity to release a redo coming locally and more less in a chemical way high light those particular neurons and synapses for strengthening for plasticity later and it is released from sites in the back of the brain in a way that can increase the called fidelity of information coming in through our eyes our ears ore knows at camera what i mean by fidelity while we are constantly being bombarded with sensory information through all of our various senses and a redo coming release from this are in the back of the brain has the ability to increase the extent to which say visual information or just visual an auditory information would make it through to our consciousness whereas all the other types of sensory information that are covering in are filtered out your brain because its taking in all this information needs to decide what to pay attention to and in this way we can say that a redo cling has a lot to do not just with focus s in quotes but literally attention which nerd signals become relevant to our consciousness there is a whole discussion to be had there and we do not have time for that rather it'd to focus on what are the tools that one can use to maintain healthy base lines of a set coming and increase a redo coming for sake of learning any type of information physical cognitive are otherwise now turns out there been a lot of studies including many quality previewed studies carried out in humans looking at what happens when you increase a redo coming levels in the brain and you accompany that with the attempt to learn and what you find almost always is that people experience increased focus that when measured the neuronal responses become more specific less broad scale activity in the brain and more specific nerd circuit activity and that this triggers immediate and longlasting changes in the way those circuits work even when a redo coming is not being deployed called negro plastic the circuits literally change this is great the work of michael silver at verbally the work of michamersinicat you see a say the work of michael killer down in texts all of those laboratory see this again and again again increase a redo coming before enjoying learning and there is a much higher probability that the learning will cute in duo sink in that the information will be retained because this neral circuits change now ways to increase o set coming in a potent way include again nutrition and supplementation it is important to have base line levels of a set coming be sufficiently high as well and for that really the ideal situation is to regularly invest foods that provide enough of the precursors for a redo coming to be made if you go on line and you were to do a search of which foods contain a lot of coming which is related to the synthesis of a set coming you would get some interesting information back for instance beef liver is the most potent source of coming i know nowadays are kind of a growing m icrotrend if you will of investing beefier even raw liver which to be out the thought of in jesting raw liver of any kind activates my area postrema which is the are the brain that triggers nausea infect i am stroking to salivate a bit not because ism hungry but the whole concept makes me ill none the less cooked liver or raw liver for that matter or liver of any kind seems to contain a lot of coaling i realize most people most people are not going to be running out and investing large mounts of beef liver eggs contain a lot of coaling beef contains coaling sobbings contain coaling there are vegan or non meat sources chicken fish mushrooms kidney beings these sorts of things contain a lot of coaling and therefore other vegetables that contain coaling depending on your dietary preferences in needs you can om select certain foods a to invest to get enough coaling to synthesize enough base line a steal coaling in the realm of supplementation there are some excellent tools for increasing a seat coaling in the acute short term meaning over the course of about thirty minutes out to about two hours or maybe even four hours and the number of different molecules that can do that that are available without a prescription at least in the us is pretty vast the most common of those molecules is actually nicotine nicotine a seat coaling receptors are abundant throughout the body and brain there in various brain circuits they are on muscle and yes smoking nicotine either by raping or cigarette will activate those nicotenic receptors but of course smoking is a terrible thing it will also activate things long cancer i detail do not recommend that it also activates a diction because of the ways that it triggers activation of the dopamine circuit i think that triggering activation of a seat calling related pathways by investing nicotine by way of inhalants is generally a bad idea however some people will to nicoret or other nicotine type gums have never done that but o friends who actually rely on that these are typically former smokers that are trying not to smoke but still want to get some of the focus enhancement that they experience from nicotine some people are very sensitive to nicotine and this is importantsome people are very sensitive to invested nicotine nowadays their nicotine a dipped toothpick there of courses nicotine gum and other sources of nicotine some people can take that and feel fine some people take it and feel absolutely terrible i confess it'd never actually tried nicotine in any of those forms i do not know how they work for me but some people do use them as connive in dancers in fact i know one bell prize winning sorry scientists who quite well known in our field for chewing nicer at all they long he insist that it really helps hem with his focus and he is exceedingly smart and productive although ism sure there are other reasons for that supplements that i have used and do use for increasing a set coaling a thing s alpha p c or hoopersin alpha p c is in the coming pathway such that more asset of cosine is synthesized after you ingest it that is the general logic or framework of how it worked whereas hoopersine is mainly in the enigmatic pathway it tends to a just how much a seat culling is broken down and lead to net increases in a veto coming i will often take three hundred milligrams of alpha g p c prior to workouts or prior to cognitive work bouts but when i say often i tend to do this anywhere from three to four times a week typically not every day although there are people including people who are trying to offset agree connive decline that will take three hundred milligrams of alpha p c three times a day every day which closely mimic some of the studies that have been done on humans looking at offsetting agree connive decline using things alpha p c i should point out that there have been a few studies a few not many but this studies emphasize that people who take a lot of alpha p c chronically over time may be at increased risk for stroke i think the datary still out on that and we need more data but for me in terms of thinking about the risk benefit profiles taking three hundred milligrams of alpha g p c most certainly does increase my ability of focus have notice that i tan to take it alongside canine and final ether among i take that in commination there before workouts a workouts really sharpens my focus and again ism doing that three may be four times for week and ism careful to do that in the early part of the day that it does not disrupt my sleep although i have taken alpha p c in the second half of the day and i had no trouble sleeping at all i do not know what the exact half life is of the given form that typically in supplementation as i shall hard to get that information but typically the focus effects wear off after about two may be four hours maximum now one thing that i do not think has ever been discussed before certainly not on this podcast is that if you take alpha p c even semi regularly you may notice that a particular feature of your blood work will increase and that t m a o which is sometimes associated with increase cartoon vascular risk this may again may relate to some of the potential risk of very high levels of along p c ingestion over many years increasing stroke risk again those studies look at people been taking it forget to a decade but in any case one way to prevent the increase in t ma o if you are taking alpha p c at all is to take six hundred milligrams of garlic because it contains one the called malison this was a a trick that was handed off to me by doctor calgelett who again was a guest on this podcast some time ago talking out hormones and hormone health turns out that in egestion of six hundred milligrams of malison a alongside or even just same day as alpha p c can really clamp those t ma o levels that would otherwise increase of your taking alphorn p we and indeed have done the blood work and that turns out to be the case a sauce by cantiamaeo i started taking six under milligrams of garlic and those time levels came down and last as it relates to a redo coming but certainly not least just as the redo coming can increase focus focus can increase a redo coming i talked a lot about this in the episode on focus but there are behavioral tools that you can use to enhance focus things alike staring into particular visual target at the same distance at which your going to perform some work and doing that for thirty is sixty seconds narrowing in a very deliberate way your visual field and then moving into a focus t work about that behavioral practise of narrowing your visual aperture will increase the amount of a sedocoling transmission in particular neral circuits that will then make it easier to focus how do we know that well i covered in that episode some of the pure reviewed studies that it relate to protocols that are now actively being employed in schools in china and elsewhere where kids are doing deliberate visual focus exercises in order to increase their mental focus and while they are not doing michrodialysis a brain imaging on those kids in real time the connive effects and indeed the performance effects in terms of academicability and output are pretty impressive a cedocoling increases focus we talked about some dietary and some supplementation bates ways to improve a cedocoling or shut t increase o redo coming end that does in fact lead to increases in one's ability to focus this is why a lot of the prescription drugs for the treatment of dulcimer is dearly cognitive decline and indeed even some of the drugs that tap into treatments for eighty eights also involve the asedocoling system there is nothing surprising or a heretical here but it is important to point out that your behavioral ability to focus is also related to your ability to axis an deploy redo coming never do we want purely pharmacologic treatments to be the only way that people are increasing a given oromogulator i always say behaviors first then nutrition then supplementation and then if there is a need certainly a clinical need then prescription drugs et camera of course administered a through a physician let us discuss serotonin ceratonan as i mention earlier as associated with brain en body states of well being of comfort of society and therefore should come as no surprise that a lot of the prescription drug treatments for things to impression involve increasing levels of ceratonan in the brain and body that said any time you talk about prescription drugs for ceratonan we also want to acknowledge that there are often disaffects associated with increasing ceratonan in particular ceratonan levels go to high that is if the dosages of those treatments go too high people will for instance feel reduced appetite reduced libido increase lethargy et camera end there is a call craton urge eccindrum all of that kin and should be considered with a well train physician because their prescription drugs controlling the dosage deciding what dosage to take deciding which essessaride to take and whether not to come off those drugs haw to come off those drugs again all of that should be handled with a licensed physician that said there are behavioral tools nutritional tools and supplementation tools that contain to the caratonan system not to the same degree in potency but none the less in ways that can still impact our feelings of well being in positive ways let us focus first on the behavioral tools and some of these might make people chuckle a little bit but i want o point out that a lot of these tools are quite potent in fact they are power tools for modulating serotonin and we know that based on human nroimaging studies human and animal microanalysis studies and other studies that really have valuated circulating levels of ceratonan and that particular brain circuits that really serotonin when people do certain things what sorts of things well for instance physical contact in particular with loved ones this can be romantic love this can be a children your own children or a your spouse even if its not sexual contact friend to friend contact even friend to animal contact as a former downer to another dogs soon cause unfortunately costello passed away but there is something really comforting and wonderful about petting your dog and certainly given that many of the studies on ceratonan and these other demodulators were done on animal models we also know that saratonan is being evoked in the dog and of course in the child an in the significant other et camera things holding hands believe or not hugs cuddling et camera can increase carton and transmission and they make people feel good this should not really come as a surprise there is also gratitude and we did not entire episode about gratitude there is lot of misunderstanding about gratitude oftentimes when people here gratitude they think o gratitude this is just being thankful for what you have and its kind of a weak sauce of fact meaning yells con alien me maybe a l caratonan goes up or maybe there is la bit of increase feelings of well being nothing could be further from the truth that turns out first of all that receiving not giving gratitude is what has the most opponent effects on increasing sratonan an activity of the brain circuits that involve caratonan in that lead to increases in feelings of well being is interesting receiving much more than giving gratitude is what activates tho caratonurge it pathways the take away from that is both give and receive gratitude and of course do it in authentic way the other thing about gratitude that somewhat counter intuitive is that observing others giving and receiving gratitude is immensely powerful for evoking sratonan and the activity of saratonurge i circuits in you the observer receiving and observing gratitude turns out to be the most potent way to increase serotonin in the brain and body and these again are dramatic effects that are quite long lasting and not the sorts of effects that can lea decide effects at least there is no reason to think they would now foot about nutritional approaches to increasing serotonin well just as we have tyricene as an monoacid precursor upstream of dopamine synthesis we have the you mean acid trip to fan which is upstream of serotonin synthesis and one simply has to go on line and put in trip to fan containing foods and you will discover that there lot of foods that are enriched in trip to fan that can lead to net increases in the amount of serotonin available in the brain and body the most kind of famous are infamous of these is white meat turkey the call trip to fan effect where people get very sleepy after eating white meat turkey an it is indeed highly enriched in trip to fan although typically the getting sleepy after eating turkey is a most often associate with the thanksgiving meal and the thanksgiving meal least in the molasses often associate with people vastly overeating and i do one a point out that if you fill your got with food no matter what that food is there is can be a diversion of bloods your got that is can make you feel sleepy because there is a diversion of blood away from other tissues ye eat a lit you are going to get sleepy period weather not you eat turkey or some other substance none the less there are a number of foods that contain a lot of trip to an and that some people will leverage o in order to trying increase the total amount of circulating serotonin available to them in order to have a modest increase in over all mood and well being what are some of these foods these are things milk in particular whole milk full fat milk i know number of people choose not to drink milk cause they are lactose and tolerance ism raising my hand as om one such person although a roof the kid i did enjoy milk a and tuna turkey as we mention before high and trip to fan oats i am a consumer of oat meal that resonates with me am cheese and i here i read although not as high and trip to fan as mean other dairy sources a certain cheeses cheddar cheeses can be rich in trip to fan certain nuts and seeds certain breads chocolate no a number of people will be relieved to hear that i know chocolate lovers are always looking for an excuse chocolate i confess have never really chocolate except there i say i the smooth hundred per cent chocolates i know many people gagmen they hear hundred per cent actually really them and some fruits can be highly en richer in trip to fan things bananas and apples and things that sort although not nearly to the degree of things turkey can tuna and milk ism sure there are other excellent sources of trip to fan from the diet including a vegan sources please peruse the internet to try and find the sources that are compatible with your nutritional program if indeed your goal is to increase trip to fan now there are supplements that can increase trip to fan and can do quite potently one of t ones that has received it increasing attention as of lately is crisis quadrangalaris complicated name when taken in dosages of about three hundred to six hundred milligrams and pretty dramatically increase ceratonan levels in fact anywhere from thirty per cent to thirty nine per cent increases in circulating serotonin that is a big increase and i can provide a link to that study the study was focus not much on serotonin but was focused mainly on treatment of obesity and appetite and weight loss and it should come as no surprise that eratonan if increased might lea to d creases an appetite a cautionary note crisis quadranglaris may need to be cycled how quickly to cyclic meaning you do two weeks on to weeks off whether not you need to do more rappedcycling two days on two days off is a matter of debate there not a lot of date on this just yet there lot of opinions about this on the internet but again not a lot of quality pure review data none the less nisi quadrangular has been showed nopotely increase serotonin in humans and for people there seeking to increase eratonand may be in particular forsake of appetite and went control that might be a useful compound i know many people also take five h t p one of the precursors to serotonin dosages of anywhere from three hundred or five hundred milligrams typically people are doing this in anticipation of sleep meaning in the final hour of wakefulness before going to sleep i myself have tried five h t p prior to sleep and all i can tell you is that it led to very deep sleep for about one to three hours than i woke up and i could not fall back a sleep i ran that experiment twice before i decided to abandon five h t p is a sleep aid and that is why have never put it in to our sleep kit or at lest my sleep kit and when i refer t the sleep kit of that something you can fined at superman lady comic's zero cost resource re can c behavioral tools and also supplementation tools that can improve the transition time into and the depth of sleep and none of those whore on five h t p supplementation that said i know a number of people use five h t p supplementation outside of sleep brushes a during the daytime to try and increase serotonin and it will indeed increase circulating serotonin but again people vary in their sensitivity to these sorts of things some people might find for instance that three hundred milligrams of five h t p is just far too much it blunts their appetite might even reduce albedo there are not a lot of very well controlled studies looking at this and has to be figured out on an individual basis if you decide to approach it at all now one molecule that give found to be particularly interesting any useful and this is one that i have not talked about yet on this podcast is inositol in particular mix in coital mioanocital can have the effect of increasing serotonin and other petrochemicals but primarily at leas in terms of the neromodulators discuss to day her moment have been taking nine hundred milligrams of myoinocitol every third night or as a test of its ability to improve sleep and i have to say the depth an quality of sleep that have been obtaining on mown coital is pretty remarkable in fact have used it alone and commination with the magnesium three in a alien an thiazines sleep kit that have talked about in that is included in that again zero cost kit that is available of pediaphon our weight myownocitol is known to increase circulating levels of ceretonan it has been explored extensively in both animal models and inhuman for it is daytime use for treating anxiety it does seem to reduce anxiety and for all sorts of things it is been explored for by polar disorder we are going to do an episode about by polar disorder coming up it is been explored for the treatment of my grain it is been explored for eighty eight to it is been explored for a huge number of different conditions of brain and body again have been using the nine hundred milligrams of myoinocitol in the third to sixty minutes before sleep to improve my sleep and t has been doing that very dramatically especially when i take it alongside the rest of those sleep kit supplements a quick note about my own coital for sake of increasing ceretonan if you look at the human studies on myownocitol that are out there and in petularfocus on the human studies what you will find is that the dosages that are often use are tremendously high like five grahams eight grams eighteen grahams of my inositol taken throughout the day i do not know how people stomach that and in fact many people drop out of those studies because of gater just comfort and yet i also wonder how people tolerate et because it has some one of a sedative of fact and it this kind of anti anxiety effect and i cannot even imagine given my experience with nine hundred milligrams what one would experience taking multiple or many more grahams per day i certainly am not encouraging that and the only reason i mention my own coital is that it has a now effect of increasing serotonin it least in my experience it does not lead to this falling deeply asleep in waking back up actually to the contrary if i wake up in mill the night to use the bathroomwhere i wake up the melinite for whatever other reason i find it far easier to fall back o sleep if have taken nine hundred milligrams in coital prior to sleep for me it is proving to be a quite useful compound ism not aware of having any seratonurgic deficiency over all do not concern myself depressed and of course i should mention that no supplement either added or withdrawn from your protocol should ever be used as a direct replacement for prescription drug treatments that your physician as given you should always talked your physician any time you remove or add something to your drug protocol prescription protocol of course we have got behavioral protocols that as solo's it feels to say have been shown to potently increase serotonin things physical contact cuddling holding hands with people that you love of course right i think if they re people that you on despised it would have the opposite effect for obvious reasons but also receiving gratitude and observing gratitude very potent increases in ceratonan and things crisis quadrangular things five h c p may have their uses right their very potent at increasing ceratonan but they do seem to have the need to cycle them and they are new want some people respond well to them other myself do not and of course always be on the lookout for dramatic or even subtle decreases an appetite or legit or things that you might not want if you are going to be tinkering with your seratonurgic a levels and pathways and then mayor nocitall actually as proving to be quite useful to me and whether not that is because of its effects on serotonin or through some of its other effects on may be reducing anxiety which certainly experience if i wake up in the millthen i do do not a in wit the mill the night but on my own ocitalis a seem not really care that i woke up hen i fall right back asleep the direct source of the passive effects that ism getting are not clear but none less i thought it'd pass i long as a useful tool because it is out there and it is available over the counter and provided your taking the appropriate safety steps in considering whether not to use it or not i think it might be a useful tool and of course as with all the other demodulators we discuss you have both a base line of ceratonan and the ability to give or provide yourself peaks of serotonin through these various protocols the dietary interventions of the sort that i mention meaning eating foods that are en rich in trip to fan those are mainly going to a just your baseline levels of trip tolan for instance if you really want to be sleepy sure you could eat some white meat turkey in hopes to that trip tolan will convert to ceratonan and make you sleepy et camera but in general those are gingko be pretty longlasting effects especially given the fact that not all of the trip tolan you will invest is going to be converted into ceratonan in your brain it is going to have other effects on other tissues an organs of your body none the less if you want to increase serotonin providing the appropriate base line contact is going to be useful and again this is a general theme of all four of these nauromodulators dopamine pin ran a setoconan ceratonan you want to make sure that you have sufficient base line levels of those things through things diet regular behaviors and then you have the opportunity to use supplementation and if its appropriate for you prescription drugs and certain behavioral protocols to try and get these potent increases acute increases in whichever the her modulators you happen to want to leverage for your particular rolls that brings us to the end of at least this exploration of the naurmodulators dopamine epinephrin acedocalling and ceratonan some of you who are regular listeners of this pots might be saying but we have heard all this before right yet an episode on dopamine you had an episode on anxiety you had an episode on sleep and indeed that is true but what have tried to provide to day is a framework that cuts through all those episodes and at the same time builds out a new and what i believe to be a really important theme and principle which is that whether not your using nutritional tools or supplementation or prescription drugs or any other sort of protocol to try and create a desired effect of focus or energy motivation relaxation you are playing with the same petrochemical ingredients just as in the realm of nutrition you have macronutrians you approaches dehydrates and facts that can be adjusted in different ratios and arrange to different times in order to achieve certain desired effects well when it comes to your petrochemistry and your ability to perform mentally to perform physically and your overall well being you are dealing with a small handful of especially potent molecules and i acknowledge that there are many neuromodulators there indeed many neurotransmitters glutamine glycine gala et camera but to day we focused on the main for meaning the most potent and most widespread neuromodulators in the brain and body that give you access to particular bran states and body states of the sort that most people desire what ism hoping is that rather than decide that any one tool is the most useful or that any one petrochemical is most useful for that matter that the information that have provided today allows you a kit of versatile tools that allows you to figure out what levels of dopamine and augmentation of dopamine are appropriate and necessary for you what levels of asedocoline and tools for manipulating a sitocoling are going to be most useful for you and on and forth because at least at this stage in time that is tune twenty twenty two there is no simple at home test in fact there is no simple laboratory test that allows us to know whether not our dooming levels a high in our caretonan levels or low we can look at somebody an their behavior we can look at ourselves an our own mood and behavior and we can in fer what those levels may or may not be but unfortunately we do not have a really good test of dooming levels are ceratonan levels that would allow us to say oke this person or i need to increase dopamine twofold in order to achieve the conomotivation that we want fortune that does not exist rather we are confronted with the situation where we understand generally what these different euromodulators do the different mental states and physical states that they tend to put us into and we reviewed those and we know that there are really potent tools to adjust those neuromodulators if not alone but in certain comminations that is ingestion of canine will taping to and support dopamine end epineferan in increasing dopamine and epinefron a long side increasing asedocoling will allow us to access certain brain states that is focus alert energize reinstates great for learning and plasticity of all kinds whereas augmenting ceretonan is going to put us into more relaxed state and on and forth and it'd you to keep in mind that there is no negotiating the fact that we all have different phases of our twenty for our cycle during which those very same nuromodulators tend to be naturally higher or naturally lower and i review that the beginning of the episode my wish for you is that you will take this information experiment with it as you see fit for you and in a safe way and as you go forward to really trying gain intuition and understanding as to not just how these protocols work but how any protocol that you might encounter supplement base drug based behavior base how those might tap in to these different major noromodulator systems and from that to be able to better predict and evaluate whether not they are going to be useful to you detrimental to you or whether not they should be used in comminations that would be more useful to you if you are learning from and or enjoying this podcast please subscribed our u tube channel that is a terrific zerocost way to support us in addition please subscribed to the podcast on notify and apple and on both notify and apple you can leave us up to a five star review if you have feed back for us or you have topics or guess that you us to cover on the superman labpodcast please put that in the comment section on you to we do eventually read all those comments and that is the best place to give us that sort of feed back in addition please check out the sponsors mention at the beginning of to day's episode that is the best way to support this podcast during to day's episode we talked a lot about supplements while supplements are not necessary for everybody many people derive tremendous benefit from them as mention in the beginning of to day's episode we partner with momentous supplements because they are extremely high quality they ship internationally they are available in the dosages and single ingredient formulations that are ideal for building a supplementation protocol you can find all those at livemomentous to come slash supermen if you are not already following us on social media we are

incredibly powerful molecules we call negro modulators and the things we can do and take in order to control them that we can enhance our mental health physical health and performance and last but certainly not least thank you for your interestinsins
